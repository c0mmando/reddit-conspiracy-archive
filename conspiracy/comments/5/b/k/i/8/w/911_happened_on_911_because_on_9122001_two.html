Location: Jacksonville, FL  Let me tell you, there&#39;s a great deal of obfuscation going on. The answer to almost every question posed of this type is, &quot;follow the money&quot; and that&#39;s precisely what I&#39;ve done.</p>

<p>My position is that almost all 911 truth organizations have been compromised and I maintain that position based on my research into this event and that the truths I&#39;ve discovered are not discussed by ANY of the 911 truth movements. I can describe perfectly in rather short order why 911 took place when it did, what the 3 primary reasons behind the event were and specifically who was responsible. I can also provide the data necessary to see both why and how the actual reality behind the event is and was covered up and more importantly, why it will remain so.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why did the events of 911 happen on 911? Was this a &quot;date specific&quot; event?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, the event was specific to 9/11/2001.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>911 happened on 911 because on 9/12/2001 two hundred and forty billion dollars in fraudulent securities became due and payable by the US treasury and paying those securities would have exposed the necessary links in 100s of massive, global international money laundering schemes and 100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison based on 100s of current and ongoing investigations at that time. Evidence of money laundering, arms sales, drug sales, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and many more crimes were destroyed forever.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. The FBI, the CIA, the SEC, Customs, the Secret Service, IRS, the Office Of Naval Intelligence, banking regulators and global intelligence organizations as well as a number of other government agencies were tracking the money laundering activities related to gold market manipulation and global international money laundering. The &quot;Eldorado Task Force&quot; was a group of 55 intergovernmental agencies devoted to investigating international money laundering. These investigations all began after 1989 and were tracking years of fraudulent but very sophisticated money laundering schemes. ALL investigations were immediately halted on 9/12/2001 because not only was ALL of the evidence destroyed but 100s of the government and non-government investigators were also killed.</p></li>
<li><p>Did anything unusual happen on 9/12/2001?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. For the first time in US history the Federal Reserve cleared 240 billion dollars in securities ANONYMOUSLY thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission invoked its emergency powers under SEC Act Section 12(k) and eased regulatory restrictions for the clearance of international securities on 9/11/2001. Think about that. The Federal Reserve allowed an anonymous individual or individuals to be paid 240 billion dollars in US denominated funds without revealing their names, location or legal status. As a result of the events of 911 George Bush, the SEC and the Federal Reserve approved the dispensing of &quot;Securities Clearance&quot; laws, for less then 15 days, a presidential approved breach of National Security, for the first time in history.</p></li>
<li><p>Why did George Bush and the Federal Reserve do this?</p></li>
<li><p>In 1989 a scheme was devised to end the Cold War and destroy the Soviet Union. The plan included crashing the currency and thus the economy, buying up the Soviet infrastructure at pennies on the dollar and leaving the Soviet Union a shell of its former self. The plan worked. In order to promote a sophisticated plan to crash the economy of the Soviet Union a massive amount of money was needed and the Federal Reserve, the SEC and with the blessings of George Bush, approved the counterfeiting of 240 billion dollars in bearer bonds, commonly referred to as Brady Bonds. This scheme was covered fully under &quot;National Security.&quot; There were 4 parts to this &quot;National Security&quot; scheme:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a. Theft of the Soviet Treasury</p>

<p>b. Currency Destabilization of the Ruble</p>

<p>c. Funding the KGB Generals 1991 coup against Gorbachev</p>

<p>d. Takeover of key Soviet energy and defense industries by Western powers</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What exactly did they do once the bonds were floated?</p></li>
<li><p>Using various global intelligence assets, foreign banks and large international corporations with off-shore accounts, like Enron, but many others, they destroyed the Russian Ruble causing its value to plunge. They then bought oil, gas, steel and commodities exporters, major technological institutions and water, electric and agricultural firms within the Soviet Union. By buying up the infrastrusture (energy and defense) and then selling off the assets the economic viability of the Soviet Union was destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>What were the 3 primary reasons for 911?</p></li>
<li><p>The first and foremost reason for the events of 911 was to conceal the identities of the 100s of intelligence assets, international bankers, elected officials and international players involved in the demise of the Soviet Union and to prevent the exposure of a &quot;National Security&quot; event, the destruction of the Soviet Union. The 2nd reason behind the events of 911 was to end for all time the ongoing investigations by numerous government and non-government organizations into these money laundering and gold market manipulations. The 3rd reason behind 911 was to provide the cover to allow for vilification of Islam and for blame to be placed on Islamic Fundamentalists allowing for public opinion to support extended wars to acquire global petroleum and mining resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Were the several planes targeting specific locations?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. Each plane on 911 had specific targets all of which were hit with great precision. There were 3 major securities brokers in the Twin Towers, Cantor Fitzgerald (largest in US), Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 11 hit the North Tower right below the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald destroying all records of securities transactions. Cantor Fitzgerald was the primary target. Flight 175 hit the South Tower below the offices of Eurobrokers and while this all took place massive explosions were reported in the North Tower under FBI offices on the 23rd floor and under Garbon Intercapital on the 25th floor again destroying any and all securities records. Flight 77 hit the Pentagon targeting the Office Of Naval Intelligence where investigators were working on illegal international financial schemes based out of the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 77 not only destroyed all records related to these investigations but it also killed 39 of the 40 Naval Intelligence Investigators. The flight that crashed in Pennsylvania missed its target, building 7. All certificates for US bonds and other securities were completly destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>Since this was a murder are there clues if we examine the fatalities?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. Forty-One percent of the fatalities in the Twin Towers came from the two corporations that managed US government securities, Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers. Thirty-One percent of the fatalities at the Pentagon were from the Naval Command Center that housed the office of Naval Intelligence where 39 of 40 investigators were killed.</p></li>
<li><p>How is this cover-up maintained?</p></li>
<li><p>The event was a &quot;National Security&quot; event. Anyone connected whether media or elected officials are given the excuse that &quot;National Security&quot; is and was at stake and that&#39;s all that needs to be said. 911 hides the purposeful destruction of the Soviet Economy, massive crimes attached to that, and the need for a massive crime to cover up these massive crimes.</p></li>
<li><p>Who was involved?</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m going to list the major players in no specific order. Please remember, the events of 911 were designed to cover up illegal global international financial activity by many people, both elected and non-elected, whose privileged lives were about to go up in smoke, whose pampered lifestyles would have, if not for 911, been reduced to a life in prison. In essence, 911 was a National Security event designed to cover other National Security events, or, depending upon your perspective, a massive crime to cover even more massive crimes.</p></li>

<p>Elements of MI6</p>

<p>The Russian/Israeli Mafia</p>

<p>These people referred to themselves as the &quot;Vulcans.&quot; The covert operations conducted by the Vulcans involved - at a minimum - securities fraud, money laundering and violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In a number of cases murder and false imprisonment (see Leo Wanta) seemed to be the mainstay of efforts to prevent any remorseful participants from going public with their stories. While accomplishing the objective - bringing about the demise of the Soviet Union - the scheme also seems to have lined the pockets of the individuals that executed the policies at US taxpayer expense.</p>
