<p>Rule 11.</p>

<p>You are free to make claims, just don&#39;t present them as fact in your post title. That&#39;s misleading and dishonest behavior which we do not allow here. Dishonesty is literally the anathema of the purpose of this subreddit.</p>

<p>Let me ask, would you actually give this sub the time of day if everyone was allowed to make up lies in their titles?</p>

<p>Lol, you would have fit right in with the Ministry of Propaganda. Reddit, where the rules are only followed when a mod doesn&#39;t like what they read. </p>

<p>Next time try omitting the SCREAMING PROFANITY and unverified claims from your post title. Lying is bad, m&#39;kay? &lt;-- got an agenda, much? Does Reddit have a rule about corrupt mods, or moderators insulting posters that said something they politically don&#39;t agree with. I mean, I can see it being removed...but</p>

<p>Using caps, and stating something is a lie when you have no idea...either way, pathetic that you are allowed to be a mod, or post on Reddit at all. But then, Reddit is pathetic. Will make sure to contact Reddit though about your behavior. </p>

<p>Not that I agree with the actions, hell I hardly will step outside to take out the trash while my kids are asleep inside.</p>

<p>I remember reading this story when it first happened and now a lot of the details are fuzzy, but I want to say the mom checked and everything was OK, and not long after, maybe the father checked and found a window open and the girl missing, very small time window between.  I am sure if I wasn&#39;t lazy I could find on the original, thorough articles on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, just a fyi. The people who were identified by the witness sketches are Washington elites that are all over the Podesta emails...so in other words, these sketches were only 2 of the sketches, 2 they couldn&#39;t find...but look at the sketches they DID identify...it is associates of Podesta...then you see the pictures, they are stunningly similar to the real people...so we have good reason to believe they were in the hotel, and the pictures are spot on...why would anyone with an open mind think that it is crazy or a stretch? 
We also know Podesta was in Portugal at the time.</p>

<p>Also, John Podesta’s first email from the Wikileaks data dump is dated May 4, 2007...so all the emails before that day (did I mention this girl was abducted on May 3, 2007) 
Hey, this is all news to me. I didn&#39;t even know who McCann was until today. Crazy how it all makes so much sense. I hope we learn about the truth with this and this pizza nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my own parents.</p>

<p>that&#39;s why I&#39;ve always had less suspicions about this than most people seem to.</p>

<p>my brother and I were a little older...I was maybe 7 with him being 5 or so...and we were in a high rise hotel on an upper floor (yes I know the dangers inherent in that) so it&#39;s not quite the same thing but still...it happens. lol - my mother totally denies this btw.</p>

<p>the other angle that I&#39;ve always taken on this is were I to be at the end of my garden and my son asleep in my house in his bedroom then he&#39;s not that much closer to me than madeleine was from her parents that particular night...so if he was snatched by an intruder then would I be negligent?</p>

<p>the person responsible for her death / disappearance is the one who took / killed her. no-one else.</p>

<p>by way of refuting your potential opinion of my parents as &#39;shitty ass&#39; we are a very close family...they have always been there when needed...they neither pushed us nor prevented us from following our goals...and both my brother and I are relatively high-achieving vocationally successful adults with our own families...</p>

<p>but no...I wouldn&#39;t ever leave my 9 yr old lad on his own like that. I don&#39;t even like sending him to school or his maternal grandparents because of my healthy fear of predators.</p>

<p>what!?!?</p>

<p>if my kid appeared to have been abducted that&#39;s the first fear that would cross my mind.</p>

<p>wtf is your point!? that due to his saying that that&#39;s indicative of some sort of guilt!?</p>

<p>this sort of total fuckwittery is why I find it hard to be objective on this case and truly consider both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really sure what any of this has to do with Maddie. I&#39;m not even saying the girl in the picture isn&#39;t groomed or abused. I just said it looks nothing like Maddie and may not be abuse or grooming. Would I tape a kiss hands down, even with easily broken paper tape, no. But it has nothing to do with the original post.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t really anything that constitutes proof in the post and that was my point. There is more possible evidence pointing to Maddie&#39;s parents then there is pointing elsewhere in this post. </p>

Seems like an awful long way for two American pedophiles to travel to &#39;hopefully&#39; find the little girl left unattended at night in a hotel. Seems a bit of a stretch but the resemblance is interesting although they have very common and unremarkable faces. </p>

<p>Unless this was preplanned with the parents (who incidentally, register high on my hinky meter) I just can&#39;t see them chasing this little girl in hopes that she&#39;d be left alone. Most parents do NOT tuck their child in--in a hotel room----then go out to a restaurant to drink &amp; eat with their friends. But what do I know?

    <div class="md"><p>The Big Lie.</p>

<p>The size of the lie is a definite factor in causing it to be believed, for the vast masses of a nation are in the depths of their hearts more easily deceived than they are consciously and intentionally bad. The primitive simplicity of their minds renders them a more easy prey to a big lie than a small one, for they themselves often tell little lies, but would be ashamed to tell big lies.
-- Adolf Hitler&#39;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; (1925)</p>

<p>Goebbels offered, &quot;If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, just a fyi. The people who were identified by the witness sketches are Washington elites that are all over the Podesta emails...so in other words, these sketches were only 2 of the sketches, 2 they couldn&#39;t find...but look at the sketches they DID identify...it is associates of Podesta...then you see the pictures, they are stunningly similar to the real people...so we have good reason to believe they were in the hotel, and the pictures are spot on...why would anyone with an open mind think that it is crazy or a stretch? 
We also know Podesta was in Portugal at the time.</p>

<p>Also, John Podesta’s first email from the Wikileaks data dump is dated May 4, 2007...so all the emails before that day (did I mention this girl was abducted on May 3, 2007) 
Hey, this is all news to me. I didn&#39;t even know who McCann was until today. Crazy how it all makes so much sense. I hope we learn about the truth with this and this pizza nonsense.</p>
