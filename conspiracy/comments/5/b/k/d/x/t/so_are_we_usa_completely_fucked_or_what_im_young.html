       This is my first election (19 years old). Is every election at least kind of like this or have past elections made you think that "yup this is it, we are fucked". Just curious because I'm pretty sure we are fucked. I know this is a "historic election" but can someone tell me an election that felt like this one but everything turned out "okay"?

       Well not force fed. I tested out of high school (I am kind of dumb if you can't tell by now so not a "genious" just because I tested out) because I couldn't take it anymore. By my senior year I was thoroughly convinced that a great power had almost absolute power over everything in our society (was apart of a few Anon protest around Indy). Since then I have realized that they are not that smart, it's all about money. So no, I was not force fed but when I was still in school I looked around and saw everyone had drunk the Kool-aid and I got out ASAP.

       Ok, cool, you're a free thinker. Force fed may be the wrong word to describe your situation but the premise is still the same. The information you were
       <em>
        given
       </em>
       for 19 years is bullshit. We don't live in a republic or democracy, we don't control shit and it's all a lie. The "american dream" is a lie, your vote counting is a lie, equality is a lie, etc. We're fucked. The sooner you accept this and make peace with it the better you can live your life (whatever that is).

       Here, let me ask you a simple question.

      <p>
       Do you think the global elite (or the power you mentioned earlier) are going to allow the leadership of the most advanced and richest nation on the face of the planet to be decided by average joes filling in bubbles next to names?
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple yes or no will suffice.

       You got me, NO!  I've been back and forth in my mind about how much control the "power" has. Whether it is complete or shrinking due to tech and comm. But you have to realize that as much as we think this 1984, we at least have a little more control. I'm not gonna wake up and get arrested for talking about this. That is where the "power" fucked up. The Internet has completely changed the game and I think we are a head of them regardless of CTR. We can call them out and make it to the front. In a complete 1984, I think we would be put in jail for even discussing it. In the long run I think the people are ahead the "power".

       If they want to pull the plug on the net they can. A week or two ago when we had a nationwide net outage should show you that. When they feel they need to clamp down and make it against the law to speak freely, it will be when we are in deeper shit than we are now. So the people aren't ahead of anything. You're optimistic but think about this. They, for the most part, are unified in their goals. We, for the most part, are divided by skin color, religion, sexual preference, socioeconomic status and everything else you can think of. So no, we aren't ahead of the power.

       So when you say cultural engineering what exactly are you referring to? Some can take that to mean multiculturalism while others can take it to mean engineering how we think, what our instrinsic and extrinsic values are, etc.

       At 19, Obama was first getting elected into office and I was enjoying my freshman year in college. I remember thinking that my parents were stupid for not seeing that Obama was just the bees knees, but I can promise you that if you are here and reading anything on this sub, you are more awoken than I was by just a lot. I didn't know anything about anything at all; I just partied and went to class and kind of didn't care. It wasn't cool to care, and I remember a few of my friends saying that they didn't follow news or politics because it helped them be more peaceful, but they said it in a trendy, second-hand way. There were political people on campus, but no one really feared or was overloaded by terrible revelations. Hell, I didn't get my first credible wiff of elite pedo bullshit until I saw that Franklin doc on youtube, or seeing

       a year or two ago. Still can't find the whole original anywhere, but it was about 15 mins, and the one I linked is only 2:48.  Anyways, I think you are completely justified in thinking that we're all fucked, especially considering what it means to be alive right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man, when I started college, minimum wage had
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       went up like $6.00 and change (IIRC), and me and my two roommates worked 30 hours a week a piece at a local grocery store, bringing home about $5 or $600 a month. Our rent was $450 total, for a
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       nice privately owned townhouse with about 1000 sq ft. It now only rents "single bedrooms" for $700 a month. That is almost 5 times as expensive, per person, today, yet by the time we had moved out a year and a half later, rent was the same, but minimum wage had gone up to where it is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our first grocery trip, we loaded the basket with stuff like ramen, mac and cheese, meats, chips, drinks, tuna, basically only the stuff we'd taught ourselves to cook by that point, and it came out to $50. If I wanted a similar haul today, I could expect to pay well over over $150, easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that something has been happening to us, and I'm not sure if it began when I came into the real world either. I bet it goes back and back and back, maybe to Vietnam, when the U.S. got into it's first geopolitical war backed by propaganda.

       I think it really went downhill after FDR. Slowly, drip by drip, the rich got tax break after tax break. Now the middle class pays as much or even more than millionaires and some billionaires  (by percent). My cousin makes around 1200 a week before taxes and her bring home is just about 700 to 800. So just by looking at taxes you can really tell when we started to go downhill. Also, allot of people my age are really politically involved. I started doing research about the government and conspiracies at about 14 or 15 (it all started when I watched the zietgiest). If we can make it another 30 years or so I think my generation can put this country back where it needs to be. I don't know if we will make it that long though.

       Well you didn't specify in what way we were "fucked," but I will give you my opinion. So if HRC is elected, consider the core principles that the United States was founded on are done forever. Money in politics is here to stay. It is very unlikely that any Republican will ever be elected president after her. In fact, Republicans will slowly be pushed out of Washington due to their religious beliefs slowing down "progress." The Supreme Court seats will be given to globalists and the second amendment will be axed by 2024. The first amendment will be suppressed significantly. The middle class will disappear completely.

       No this election is an anomaly. I disagree that "this is it, we are fucked" is true or the general sentiment. "If blank wins I'm gonna blank" might be more accurate. What the blanks are who knows. Everything has turned out "okay" in every election. I don't think "okay" is okay though. What you consider okay for many here and abroad equals hot pieces of metal tearing through their flesh, starvation, marginalization, etc, etc, etc, pain, pain, pain. This shit is not natural.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: the likelihood that we're going to see some nasty shit immediately following the election or during next POTUS term is super high though

       <p>
        It is said here that amongst the trees there are also evolutionary processes; the different kinds of trees have touch perception. It is said that better than the trees are the fish because fish have developed the sense of taste. Better than the fish are the bees, who have developed the sense of smell, and better than them are the serpents because serpents have developed the sense of hearing. In the darkness of night a snake can find its eatables simply by hearing the frog's very pleasant cry. The snake can understand, "There is the frog," and he captures the frog simply because of its sound vibration. This example is sometimes given for persons who vibrate sounds simply for death. One may have a very nice tongue that can vibrate sound like the frogs, but that kind of vibration is simply calling death. The best use of the tongue and of sound vibration is to chant

       I think all pretense has been dropped.  In the past even a hint of the email scandal would have sunk a candidate.  Also any one of Trumps misspeaking would have sunk him. Look at Johnson. He was totally shut down for asking "what's Aleppo".  It's all rigged and they're barely hiding it. But don't worry.  It doesn't seem to matter who's in office.  The machine grinds on.  Obama was going to do so much and he's done nothing but drone people.  We're not really fucked until the banking system crashes.  And there's no way to really tell when that happens before hand. We'll just wake up one day and all our money will be worthless. But I don't think who's president will actually matter.

       This election is as important as 2008, and 2012.  What failed in 2012 is to be remedied by this one. The Senate and House votes are more important than the Presidential vote. The Republican Congress plan is if they can't  gain the Presidency via the electoral college is to simply remove  the Democratic candidate and Kaine is more questionable than Hillary. 
Donald Trump is not a real candidate and would have to be removed if elected.  He really is too unstable for even a job as front man.

       He seems mole-ish for a variety of reasons based on my personal views and to give you an example of how far out those views are, I firmly believe Trump is entirely controlled by the Kochs for financial reasons.

       Ok i see Alot of defeated and deflated here wallowing in self pitty and acceptance to all you don't give in so easy . Yes its probley rigged yes they are probley are all pedos but you still gotta have a go.  They can't really %100 rig a election but they can swing things 20 / 30 % and it costs lots of money so at least your making them spend some of there dollars yes its chump  change to them but how else you gonna hit em? Giving up and not voting is a win for them your out of the game all together hell they will probley fill out  a vote in your name.  The powers that be have slashed your education to make you appethitc and ignorant this is were  they want you make you care more about a football game than who is in charge of your country. Yes you are fucked but go down fighting.  How do i fight? You educate your self in things politically related so you can form your OWN opinion you vote for the least evil and connected candidate/ party.  You won't win but at least you make their job a little harder buy not voting and or remaining ignorant you make it easier for them to rig things. As for OP to me this reminds me a little of Nixon the guy was balls crazy we all thought nukular winter is coming he did end up getting removed from office for crimes no lock up but did get a gtfo order more or less and we lived.  Do vote imo at least scratch the nose of the lion will he rips you to shreds don't just lay down and go limp.

       You got me, NO!  I've been back and forth in my mind about how much control the "power" has. Whether it is complete or shrinking due to tech and comm. But you have to realize that as much as we think this 1984, we at least have a little more control. I'm not gonna wake up and get arrested for talking about this. That is where the "power" fucked up. The Internet has completely changed the game and I think we are a head of them regardless of CTR. We can call them out and make it to the front. In a complete 1984, I think we would be put in jail for even discussing it. In the long run I think the people are ahead the "power".
