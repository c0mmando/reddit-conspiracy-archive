<p>I&#39;m sensing general anxiety, unrest, and high aggression pretty much everywhere I go. I see some violence happening already, and I can&#39;t imagine either side going down without a fight. </p>

<p>This election has shown me that people are happily fighting, ending friendships, and hurting other people over which side of a <a href="http://www.dulcefina.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/h/o/ho1140_1.jpg">gold chocolate coin</a> is better. It&#39;s all the same inside, and honestly, the chocolate is pretty fucking terrible.</p>

<p>I am going to be in a major city tomorrow and Tuesday for work, and honestly, in hopes of a good story to tell. I&#39;m not scared for my life, but I do want to be able to safely live-stream and record what I see for history&#39;s and the public&#39;s sake. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust Twitter, Google, or Facebook. Is there any open-source software that will let me live-stream from an android phone to a secure server that only I control? And possibly release that stream somewhere automatically?</p>

<p>edit: should we put together a starterpack for citizen journalists in major cities? So far, I&#39;m thinking:</p>

<p>older cameras, with cell phone as a backup (thank you <a href="/u/ridestraight">/u/ridestraight</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.copblock.org/apps/">http://www.copblock.org/apps/</a>  live-streaming app, at least one (thank you <a href="/u/putin_loves_cats">/u/putin_loves_cats</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.peacemagazine.org/index.php?id=2083">http://www.peacemagazine.org/index.php?id=2083</a> methods of peaceful protest that you can suggest to protesters who might be trying to incite violence</p>

<p>water, from a re-usable container (don&#39;t you dare buy Nestle water, just carry enough for you to get home and share a little on your way)</p>

<p>bitcoin, unstable US economy = higher BTC price, I&#39;ve bought a little every time shit has gone crazy this election and made a good ROI</p>

<p>feel free to add</p>

<p>*<em>Initiations -- Sydney, April 2, 1972: *</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prabhupāda: So being afraid, he wanted to be saved by his youngest son. Naturally we, anyone we love... But because the youngest son had the name Nārāyaṇa, the original Nārāyaṇa took notice of him, and he was saved, and he was immediately taken to the kingdom of God because he chanted the name of Nārāyaṇa. So those who are always chanting the holy name of God, they are in safety position. Safety position means next life, he is going back to home, back to Godhead. So this is an example that such a sinful man, if simply by chanting once at the time of his death—that was also desiring his youngest son—he could get so much benefit, those who are chanting always the holy name of God, they should be always in safe condition. Māyā, or the material contamination, cannot touch him. But one thing, those who are being initiated, they are being freed from the resultant action of past sinful life. But they should be careful not to commit again sinful activities. Then they are safe. That&#39;s all. </p>
