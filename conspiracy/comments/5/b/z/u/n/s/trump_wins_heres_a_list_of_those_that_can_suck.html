       Right wing neo Nazi is an oxymoron, 
You exclusively get to Nazism through liberalism. You're probably thinking about Marxism and that's still on the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       You either have evidence Trump and Soros are in cahoots, or you don't. It seems to people when you say things without evidence, that you're making things up for higher ground in a debate.

       nah the new neo nazi movement is within the alt right like some of these conspiracies havent been astroturfed and even if you blame the left the left in America isnt far off from the right. Its that the right have so much power they have created these astroturfed movements. PPL here will be quick to point out Soros funds BLM yet these same ppl think the NRA are not some dangerous propaganda machine.'Its now the alt right have infiltrated the conspiracy movement

       So a few people who identify as being on the right, because they're extremists,.means the right is filled with neo nazis? That's some special thinking. 
And notice I said "extremists" in BLM are calling for Nazi ideas to be implemented, look up Cynthia G on YouTube, then look up Larry Elder. Cynthia G is an extremist, Larry Elder has his head on straight.

       Nah a lot of corporate conservative think tanks have hijacked the conspiracy movement its all essentially right wing even when it is the "left" which isn't really a left because no left really exists in the  Democratic system and neo nazi ideology doesnt mean ppl are wearing kkk robes etc but it is done on this more "intellectual" level w the limited information presented like overly policing language so it makes it seem ppl using certain words seem edgy and being anti pc when anti pc is just as much backed by corporate think tank conservative thinking

       You're not conceding on the crazy idea that the right are a bunch of alt'right neo Nazis, and you won't admit that the left is filled with Nazi-esque double-speakers, that means you're cemented into your paradigm where every white conservative is a racist.

       It doesn't mean that every conservative is racist neo nazi but it also doesn't mean some of their talking points come from right wing nazi philosophy on a deeper level and the pc culture today has extremism to it but thats by design but doesn't mean the symbolism of getting rid of the confederate flag  from government buildings or changing the Indians name on a team doesn't represent some right in the world because theres always been a deep seeded racism ingrained into the system where it has been normalized and once it changes a bunch of right wing fucks like yourself claim ppl get triggered are the ones who get triggered the most

       The racist conservatives that run shit are racist not because of words but the power structure. Its funny that you ppl complain about BLM when they dont have as much power as the elites you know the same ones who create private prisons so they can justify modern slavery and arrest minorities for drugs that the elites bring in.  But when black ppl protest that inconveniences you? See you keep looking on the surface cuz white elites control the narratives which made it look like white ppl are being oppressed. Nah this sub is worried about guns and ride for the NRA. Keep thinking Trump is gonna protect you .. most ppl trolling the net like you are paid to do so. Its funny this sub claims to be awake but never mention how the OFFICIAL FBI report in 2006 stated that white supremacists had infiltrated the police forces but have no qualms ridiculing minorities who continue to get fucked with more than most of the white privileged cunts on this sub looking for fake internet points. Keep thinking you are some on some supreme intellectual shit of counter culture when thats astroturfed to make you guys think you are fighting the system when you are being played even more

       I'm against anyone inciting race wars, when it's not about race, that includes KKK, Westboro, Manson Family, extreme Islamists and extreme BLM protesters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power structure was at one time based around the idea that minorities and women didn't have equal rights as men. But those minorities included people like the Irish, the Polish, the Jewish, and the Blacks, the racism wasn't race specific.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back then, whites were predominantly Christian extremists, who fought to keep segregation in the states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, whites are a diverse group, that includes a countless amount of variation. While I denounce all racism, another white man loves racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logic and reason has to pour into the extremist mind, before it does something insane, something irreversible. This is life, where death means the end and nothing is ever undone.
      </p>
      <p>
       People take life for granted no matter what race, and that affects morality. The varying degrees of taking life for granted within individuals, creates a spectrum of different people, all with different moral reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extreme right or left are both guilty, they don't deserve a mouthpiece if all they want to do is incite war, which is completely unnecessary. We can easily establish peace and increase the welfare of all, without racial division or conflicts in preference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pc movement needs to die out, BLM movement issues need to be address appropriately and humanely, and at all costs, a race war needs to be averted.

       You're the crafting a narrative, I'm the one actually bringing up historic and objective facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The structure is not designed against black people, they have just as much ability to achieve as I do, there is no systematic oppression happening. The system is not designed to prevent blacks from achieving.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are still recovering from systematic oppression, cities are still recovering from it, and the psychology of the collective is recovering from it.

       To craft the narrative that the white man is the devil, is undoing all of the work done for peace and inciting a race war.

       That's the problem though, racial oppression is not systematic, there are mechanisms in the system to fight against oppression and it's called affirmative action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Minorities have systemic privileges white men will never, and there are no systems in place to prevent a black man from achieving the life he wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what America is about, if you want to succeed you can. If you're willing to work, you can have what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are a nation in development, we have yet recovered from Jim Crow segregation, and our legislation has a ways to go before it can ensure everyone's freedom. The training wheels haven't come off and I'm not sure they ever will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racism is a dumb problem everyone wants to see vanish, white and black alike have to fight together to get rid of racism, instead of being divided. We need sympathy from both sides for us to progress, but that sympathy is demonized by white supremacists and Black lives matter radicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The demonization of the white man only furthers the divide and moves away from real progress.

       Show me one instance of systemic oppression towards blacks, and I'll go make it my life's purpose to eradicate it. 
What I do see, is systematic oppression of illegal immigrants, because we rely on their cheap labor, and the only reason their labor is cheap is because they're illegal. Our country relies on a certain amount of illegal immigrants to make our food.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not against blacks, that's against anyone who is an illegal immigrant which include all races.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have slavery in modern day, and black Americans are complaining about a few racists... while they eat food made by indentured slaves, while they enjoy all of the benefits of society because there's no system in place to oppress them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no apartheid, no segregation, no laws banning blacks from education, jobs, or from housing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone in this country without the silver spoon are equally disadvantaged, privileges in modern society is about class and not race.

       Yeah there are laws from black ppl getting those things by giving longer sentences more for non violent crimes like drugs that WHITE run organizations like the CIA FBI DEA bring drugs in while black or brown ppl do more time so they cant get jobs etc when they are out.They abolished slavery but made it possible under prison labour cuz they are privately owned.If you were so woke you would point out the war on drugs has essentially been a war of race but keep telling yourself that there is no systemic racism ..keep justifying it with your fake intellectual shit

       I call out white supremacists as much I call out BLM extremists, any racist is worth denouncing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you won't believe me, but I actually got kicked in the mouth by white supremacists because I was denouncing all of them to their face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both KKK and BLM extremism rely on making people xenophobic and anti-social, they're furthering the divide, not closing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need whites denouncing the KKK more, Muslims denouncing extreme Islam, and we need blacks denouncing BLM extremism more.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we see isn't a denouncing of racism, we're seeing the promotion of racism, and it's on the very far right and the very far left. I agree that some on each side are racist AF, but not all of the left or the right are extremists.

       BLM is a movement created by George Soros, in order to create legislation for less cops in black areas, which only fuels black issues, like gangs and black on black crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Areas do not get better unless money comes in, money doesn't come in unless the area is safe, and the area isn't safe if there are not enough cops, and if there is a "no snitching" policy in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our system isn't designed to oppress blacks, it has always been the actions of individuals that has constantly lowered the standard of living within black communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ones in control want everyone weak, subservient and dependent, they want masses that are easily controlled with trigger words, they want predictable behavior so they can use it for their purposes. Inciting "all the white cops are killing blacks" cuts right down to the fight or flight response in people's minds, problem-solution tactics where the solution is the goal of what was intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black community have been forever manipulated by the democratic party, used like puppets for the goals of the democratic party.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only real solution is to have more cops, to have more police training, to weed out megalomaniac cops, and to establish a healthy relationship between the people of troubled neighborhoods with cops. We simultaneously have to destroy degenerative legislation, and undermine the efforts of George Soros.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is much more of an economic inequality issue, where inequality is manufactured by the global elite. White areas with enough disparity, start devolving into gang and hard drug areas. Deer Park Washington is the perfect example of a white are, where meth use is at record high for the state, because they have a lack of money, resources, cops, and they have the area of deer park undeveloped, with broken Windows and shoes on the power lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same exact issues happened to British white people in 1960s, where whole areas were left undeveloped, with less cops, and less money in the area, kids being sent to orphanages sky rocketed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those struggling areas become hot beds for drugs, which then become target areas for the CIA and FBI to peddle their drugs on the streets at marked up prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA and FBI control which organized gangs rise and fall from power, they control the opium trade, and they target areas of high crime to do their dealings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of the sex trafficking is done by CIA outlets, adding to the black budget necessary for their evil doings. It's worldwide and affects all races.

       I agree that there have been anecdotal evidence to paint the narrative that oppression is systemic, but systemic oppression means everyone is involved with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that there are subversive efforts to demoralize this nation, and much of that involves subversive oppression of groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same way crack was introduced to blacks in inner cities, meth was introduced to poor white towns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multi-layered plan to demoralize the nation involves the use of rigging the system, of implementing drugs for social engineering, and creating a culture where there are no objective moral values.
      </p>
      <p>
       If BLM isn't a terrorist organization, it needs to stop acting as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media will 10/10 Times report some white racist burning down a church, but they will omit whole stories about black on black crime or the terrorist acts of BLM. BLM shoots themselves in the foot every time they resort to riots and violence, because it just furthers the divide.
      </p>
      <p>
       That which furthers the divide must not stand, it must not take root in our consciousness, we all have to see evil and call it evil; we have to see good and call it good.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Soros and his hatred fueling money need out of politics, racists needs to learn to gain perspective and learn to love, and we all need our heads out of our asses before we have a race war.

       How do you think a fucking revolution began? violence.Im not condoning it but for some there gets a point of frustration that has built up and second how do you know these things aren't started from agents provocateurs.Im not saying everyone now isn't affected. Until white ppl started feeling "oppressed"  then it became a bigger deal for them about the authoritative society we were headed into
      </p>
      <p>
       And BLM is activist group to combat the white supremacists who work within the police force. That doesn't get mentioned though cuz most of you are supportive of the systemic oppression that keep denying doesn't exist

       BLM is fueled with paranoia, young pride, and irrational responses to anecdotal hatred, it's a terrorist organization that has demands lest they commit violence, they're cry babies who throw fits when things don't go their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Destroying whole cities because a black criminal was shot in the heat of a fight, that's not rational, that's not productive, Smashing up stores is terrorism.

      <p>
       That's the problem, you've justified terrorism. And if you'd ask me, George Soros gets off on the idea that black men die for no reason, making BLM a terrorist organization was always the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pointless deaths, pointless racism, justified racism towards whites, and tragedy is coming from BLM, Martin Luther King would be ashamed that all of his work is being undone.

       And the media reports on BLM within limits and barely scratches the surface of the deeper suppression that goes on where even black public figurers cant fully expose what is happening or they will be made to be seen as the enemy

       And when you say we need more policing I can agree a bit but they are not trained to do the right thing and even with black or brown cops they are still working within a white supremacist system and its by design

       Agreed. Tonight/today's outcome has really brightened my spirits. Now we just need to keep the pressure up and enjoy the Clintons fall.

       nah the new neo nazi movement is within the alt right like some of these conspiracies havent been astroturfed and even if you blame the left the left in America isnt far off from the right. Its that the right have so much power they have created these astroturfed movements. PPL here will be quick to point out Soros funds BLM yet these same ppl think the NRA are not some dangerous propaganda machine.'Its now the alt right have infiltrated the conspiracy movement
