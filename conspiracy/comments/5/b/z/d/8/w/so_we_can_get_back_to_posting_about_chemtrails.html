       Serious question, if 9/11 was an inside job, then why weren't the elections rigged to make hiliary win? Surely she was in on the plot, so the fix should have been in for her.
      </p>

       I question now whether 9/11 or sandy hook were done by the deep state.

       Because it's not as plain and simple as 'they all know what really happened'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say for example your brother got arrested for fraud but got off with it, the whole time telling you and family he didn't do it. Everyone outside your family think you all know the truth but in reality you have no idea, the evidence was there and he was acting suspicious for a few months, your mom will have another theory, your dad might have been in on it but is keeping quiet.
      </p>

       I know it's a bad analogy but hopefully you get my point.

       Your point is supporting my point though. It's saying that we were wrong about 9/11. If anyone knew the truth about 9/11, it would be Cheney first, closely followed by the Clintons. 9/11 had to have been setup by the Clintons. I can't comprehend how an "inside job" could have operated without the Clintons involvement.

       Broward County was one of the last counties to report their final count in Florida. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz essentially runs that county, and has influence in the surrounding area. My personal belief is that they WERE going to steal it there, pushing the state blue, but the FBI was aware something was up and so they weren't able to execute the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hill still won the county but lost others nearby. It seems like a logical place that they would have based their swing manuever.

       Nice point, but shouldn't these people have had a more foolproof plan? Maybe they just didn't expect people to fall in love with Trump, so perhaps it got away from them.

       Bush and Cheney refused to testify on the record, because they didn't want the truth getting out to the public. Plus, Cheney clearly prevented one of the planes from getting shot down.

       As for the Clintons, the preparation leading up to 9/11 would have taken months to years, putting it into the Clinton presidency.

       9/11 is the definition of a inside job. Regarding Sandy Hook I have some unanswered questions that no one has been able to answer yet, until then I am skeptical it was a COMPLETE hoax.

       Clinton is one of the people on the inside, the reason it wasn't rigged is because 1. It would have been waaaay to obvious, I mean after all the scandals we are supposed to believe she actually could win? And I see people typing shit like "If Trump wins expect riots" It's the other way around if Hillary would have won everyone would know how bad the system really is. Also remember the rigged voting when it was Bernie vs Hillary? that popped up and lingered for weeks after the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also 2, it doesn't really matter who is POTUS until the person elected goes against their views. That's when it becomes a problem for the "Insiders" and it just so happens Trump is a huge fan of Netanyahu so that means they still got their fix in the middle east vs Israel conflict. Regarding Federal Reserve/TPP/NSA(whistle blowers)/FBI&amp;CIA etc, we still have to see how he handles those issues and if it aligns with their wishes.

       It was pretty derelict and looked more like a storage facility than an elementary school.  It was obviously in disrepair &amp; unused.

       Thanks, very interesting.. I can only compare it to my own time in school and that has to be the worst organized school ever. What's up with the water stains in the ceiling that seems to be spread out everywhere.

       I guess the police went through everything and that's why a lot of the cabinets/drawers are open but the mess is real.

       School shootings are an interesting topic that should get more attention. Ive been looking into columbine, a lot of strangenesses connected to that one....the rabbit hole goes pretty deep. People died, but there were other shooters. Ambulances were not allowed near the school, victims were left unattended, the hospital workers all had to sign confidentiality agreements.... something stinks about the whole thing.

       I have read quite a lot about columbine too, the actual event is what bothers me but the build up to it seems pretty realistic if you ever read Klebold's diary. I mean the guy was deeply depressed and suffered from extreme anxiety rendering him suicidal for almost 3 YEARS before the event. That state of mind can really fuck with you and if you get it into your head that you are suffering because of bullies/class mates that don't understand you etc. Taking a bunch of them out before committing suicide is not hard to fathom.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen the videos broadcasting from outside the school during the shooting and there are some strange occurrences indeed. I haven't read about the "additional shooters" theory, got any link?

       I can see this as a possibility, but some of the things that Trump supports are against the globalist agenda. Like if he destroys the TPP and Obamacare, that will set back the globalists by decades.

       There is no singular "deep state", is how I see it. There must be various groups vying for power. See: Someone from NSA probably behind the DNC/Podesta leaks.

       nice point, but how many deep states are there? Two, three, ten or a hundred? If we break things apart into competing groups, well thats what we were taught in school as to how the government is supposed to work. It's can't be a giant conspiracy if the system was explained to us in 6th grade civics.

       It's like a pack of wolves. One top dog leads the pack while other dogs in his orbit plot to take him down. They work together as a pack so long as it serves everyone's interest. Meanwhile there is an internal power struggle to unseat the top dog in order to shift the pack in another direction. When you think you have solved the conspiracy by finding a lone wolf, you are deceived. Another will take his place and the pack carries on.

       Different factions rigging seperate events. It is also possible the voting machines were set to boost Hillary by a certain percentage and Trump got more than that. If the machines are rigged too steeply exit polls and paper ballot states might show an anomaly.

       My view on this....and I doubt you or most here will like it:
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is one of them. He is as pro-establishment as they get, but was playing an anti-establishment card to get elected. I doubt he'll even care enough to govern. Mike Pence, his VP, is probably going to be calling most of the shots, so it may be a situation similar to Bush/Cheney . 
And Mike Pence has pretty much the worst far right policies you can imagine. Just looking at him, to me, the guy looks even more evil than Hillary
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I could be wrong, but this is my perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do feel a lot of people have been (perhaps inadvertently) awoken by this election. People have, through Trump, begun realizing the true extent of the corruption and sickness of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just hope people wake up even deeper than just seeing Clinton as the root of all evil (and understanding that she is just a head in the many-headed hydra) as well as see that only compassion, respect, understanding and cooperation, unity between all beings on this planet, will actually get us the Earth and the society we so dearly desire.

       I actually agree with you. However some of the things that Trump is suggesting will set back the globalists. If the one world government people are the ones that rig the system and run the world, then Trump is not their choice. He's going to end obamacare and the TPP, both of which we important to one world government.

       I wonder if he is actually going to do this. I guess time will tell. It's just that he has said so many contradicting things one can't help but think that everything he said up to now was just part of the plan to get him into office.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I still feel like the elite would somehow prevent him from taking office if he was truly the man to enact real change for the better...

       well, its up to us to keep the momentum of motivation going to fix shit and do it now... I am starting to like that Trump was a liberal plant who usurped the Demorals' line succession while also pissing off a ton of old scho republicans. We don't need any of em! It was us and it was a message. We are hiring a decent manager and working his fucking shit back from the ashes you reduced it to! WATCH US.

       A New Ager who hasn't read the Law of One, is like an atheist who hasn't read The Origin of Species.  When studying for your Fox Mulder merit badge, reading the LoO and William Cooper's account of the history of MJ-12 are more or less the first steps.  Every self-respecting UFO freak should also know about Betty and Barney Hill, as well; since that was pretty much the first ever close encounter of the fourth kind.

       My father used to say that if a thing is worth doing, it's worth doing it properly; and being a schizophrenic, basement-dwelling conspiracy theorist is no exception.  If you want to become a truly professional crank, you have to be conscientious.  It takes dedication.  I've spent more than twenty years honing my paranoia to a fine edge.

       No. We're just getting started!  We need to follow through on everything that's already hot, including watching everyone like a hawk, especially in the next few months: Trump and Pence and Obama and the Clintons etc.  This is the most ridiculous thing that's ever happened in the U.S. and this transitional period is going to be nuts.   The political conspiracies are only going to ramp up.

       I agree with this sentiment wholeheartedly. I am a Liberal from MA (sharpen those pitchforks ladies and gentlemen) however I believe, along with many in this subreddit, that the election and its awful media coverage has been abominable.  I also believe that the corruption runs deep in the US and worldwide governments, however just because the liberal media was so anti-Trump and untruthful doesn't mean this subreddit has to devolve to partisan fingerpointing and flame wars. I hope that we can return to a place of open minded discussion, because I believe that this sub and America as a whole has the responsibility to think critically and independently without drawing party lines in the sand. And that is one of the reasons that I dig this subreddit. Keep it weird people!

       I saw some really hard core chem trails today. Extra special. Lots of lines with rainbows. Strangely arcing and streaky clouds all over. Lots of crisscross action. Defiantly out of the ordinary for my area, not usually this active, is this way. Something was in the air today. Typical, I got no pics.

       Honestly....there is still work to be done.

       I didn't spend hundreds of hours digging through wikileaks emails just to keep the Clinton Mafia out of office. I want them to go to prison. I want them to be held publicly accountable for their crimes. I'd love to hear about UFOs and Chemtrails but I'm going to keep dedicating my efforts to digging up the truth.

       The vapour trails created by high flying aircraft which alter the pressure of the air causing water vapour to condense out of the air to form clouds which trail behind the aircraft. These water vapour clouds are thought by some people to be chemicals being sprayed on the population.

       To some point they have to produce chemical trails,  if you could only see here in West Cork the amount of windmills they put up every few months to power and give us electricity, to some point we have exhausted our own natural resources so they produce more with chemicals,  more wind more rain more clouds.

       I have been waiting for what feels like years for this day, when we go back to being tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy nuts and nobody gives a fuck about Grandma Clinton's email server in the basement or Trump's fuckboi days with Jefferey Epstein

       The moon landing was faked, simply because we had to fight the Nazi's on the moon (see operation, " we gotta get them moon Nazi's") &amp; it was cheaper to film the landing in burbank w/ Kubrick than it was to clean the debris from the moon war, thus keeping the sheeple asleep. Man, I miss the good ole days of this sub. I haven't been called a dumbass for months for thinking the world is round.

       Broward County was one of the last counties to report their final count in Florida. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz essentially runs that county, and has influence in the surrounding area. My personal belief is that they WERE going to steal it there, pushing the state blue, but the FBI was aware something was up and so they weren't able to execute the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hill still won the county but lost others nearby. It seems like a logical place that they would have based their swing manuever.
