    <div class="md"><p>I hope you&#39;re right, but I doubt it. Sanders quietly left the democratic party. Even if he hadn&#39;t, he was definitely not the most powerful democrat. The entire democratic party was out to get him, they aren&#39;t going to support him now.</p>

<p>Most powerful, no. But sanders could very well be the most popular. Having the support if ordinary people won&#39;t help him much, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People seem to be dismissing you right now, but that&#39;s exactly the vibe that I&#39;m getting right now from the results from the election. The states that she ended up losing that costed her the election were the places that sanders did well. </p>

<p>I&#39;m betting that a large portion of those voters are ones that were pro Obama because he specifically promised change, and voted to elect him. It ended up being 8 years of mostly the same shit with a poorly negotiated/executed ACA, and ended up supporting Bernie closing in on 2016. When he lost the nom, more of those voters than expected either voted for Trump or did didn&#39;t vote at all from voter apathy. </p>

<p>Now they&#39;re pissed, and not just those voters in the rust belt, but a lot of northeastern states that liked Bernie. look at NH, it&#39;s literally neck and neck as I type this, uncalled. No clue who is going to win there.</p>

<p>The DNC is fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most powerful Democrats are Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid.  Bernie is still a nobody within the party.  They see him as a threat because they want to continue to be corrupt.  Only the electorate likes him.  The party does not.  The Democratic Party likes money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are the gullible one that has been taught that socialist was bad because of 1960&#39;s fear mongering. Look,  I&#39;m no fan of Trump. Not a fan of government at all really,  this progressive movement is doing so well that a president can say he&#39;ll make America Greta again and people agree the country isnt Great now</p>
