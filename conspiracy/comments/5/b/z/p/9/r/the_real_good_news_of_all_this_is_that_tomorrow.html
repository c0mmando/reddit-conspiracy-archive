       I hope you're right, but I doubt it. Sanders quietly left the democratic party. Even if he hadn't, he was definitely not the most powerful democrat. The entire democratic party was out to get him, they aren't going to support him now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most powerful, no. But sanders could very well be the most popular. Having the support if ordinary people won't help him much, though.

       People seem to be dismissing you right now, but that's exactly the vibe that I'm getting right now from the results from the election. The states that she ended up losing that costed her the election were the places that sanders did well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm betting that a large portion of those voters are ones that were pro Obama because he specifically promised change, and voted to elect him. It ended up being 8 years of mostly the same shit with a poorly negotiated/executed ACA, and ended up supporting Bernie closing in on 2016. When he lost the nom, more of those voters than expected either voted for Trump or did didn't vote at all from voter apathy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they're pissed, and not just those voters in the rust belt, but a lot of northeastern states that liked Bernie. look at NH, it's literally neck and neck as I type this, uncalled. No clue who is going to win there.

       The most powerful Democrats are Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid.  Bernie is still a nobody within the party.  They see him as a threat because they want to continue to be corrupt.  Only the electorate likes him.  The party does not.  The Democratic Party likes money.

       Bernie Sanders is a socialist. I mean a large part of people on conspiracy is being wise and being able to discern. This isn't even conspiracy at all,  take this to politics or something where the former Hillary fans can enjoy it.

       You are the gullible one that has been taught that socialist was bad because of 1960's fear mongering. Look,  I'm no fan of Trump. Not a fan of government at all really,  this progressive movement is doing so well that a president can say he'll make America Greta again and people agree the country isnt Great now
