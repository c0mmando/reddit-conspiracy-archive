       Hillbots.  They also like to say, "why are you holding something her husband did against her from 30 yrs ago".  Like there's a statute of limitations on ethics.   They ignore the fact that they are married, and that she was friends with the crony running the program also.  And that if bill made money giving kids aids, she did too.

       I'm not sure.  "He released a statement" but not sure if it's really him.  I want to see video.  I'll tell you what would be incredible: if Trump had helped him get away and was keeping him safe until Obama/Clinton are taken down.  This is a fantasy tho.

       That would be a great story. I think there is some possibility the Patriarch Kirill got him out but the part that still doesn't make sense is I am 100% positive that a significant effort was carried out to censor any questioning about if he was taken from the Embassy that day. I don't know who else could do that except the usual abc suspects.
