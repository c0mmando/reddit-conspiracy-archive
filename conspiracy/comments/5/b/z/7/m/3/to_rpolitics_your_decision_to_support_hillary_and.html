       Yeah, seriously.  I'm not so fickle that I change my opinions based on what other people say/think.  I actually vote based on policy.

       I wouldn't mind that trend catching on, instead of people just bitching about the media being shit.  If they wanted to hear the real issues or policies, the news channels might actually cover them.

       A lot of people who voted for Hillary looked past that though, many of them voted for her simply because she was a woman. No further research was done on their behalf.

       I'm sure that you tried to tell them otherwise and they went against what you tried to explain to them. I've watched videos where Latinos tried to explain themselves as to why they were voting for Trump, which led to people, who were anti-Trump, shouting in their faces saying that they weren't true Hispanics.

       I'm female, and so are most of my friends (we were from an all-girls' school), and they're all blindly singing Hillary's praises just cos she's female. T_T They bashed me when I showed them evidence that Hillary was corrupted, and said that I 'made it all up'. And they think Wikileaks is just a website made to defame Hillary...

       Me too for sure, but the bias i saw on r/politics really pushed me to the "echo chamber" they called r/The_Donald and forced me to check it out, Didnt see the hate they kept telling me about. The Bias was poison on MSM, they shouldn't have let it show. Outed themselves to their detriment.

       Wow me too, social media and conventional media was so slanted it made me withdraw any support I had for her (not really thrilled anyways with her but I'm a lifelong dem). This election was important for showing people how the media lies and uses propaganda to push an agenda. It made conspiracy theories more mainstream as well.

       Agreed, I'm from Singapore and some people here were following the elections pretty closely too, though they were blinded by the biased pro-Shrillary/anti-Trump reporting by our government-owned TV station + newspapers, as well as the one-sided 'news' on FB that demonised-Trump and made Hillary seem faultless.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now all my social media feeds are filled with very angry youths (mostly females) who keep trashing Trump like it's gonna magically change the outcome (I'm also a young female, but I would've voted Trump over Hillary). They're the demographic who either don't know about Hillary's dishonesty or choose to ignore it, and who wholeheartedly lap up biased propaganda without questioning the truth.

       Which is true for all sides. Didn't vote Hillary, but let's not ignore history. Generally speaking, all politicians are ass hats and the people who put blind faith in any one are only setting themselves up for despair. Progress happens not by votes, but by coalition movements...don't forget that the fight continues, and probably will continue for as long as power and greed permeate human society.

       I want to ask though, are cases she was tasked to win as relevant as what Trump says and does in the hear and now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Facing these candidates myself Trump is almost comically bad. Ultimately when it comes to policy every candidate will compromise, that's how ruling works. I'm mostly concerned with the electorate and how its affected. It's just far too similar, to me as a European, to any right-wing election where fear is in the driver's seat.

He was executed on 8-7-16 for helping the United States keep tabs on Iran's nuclear programs, he was executed as a direct result of Hillary's negligent actions, and as a result we now have no contact inside Iran regarding their nuclear activity.

       Just reading the first few "unbiased" sources and there's no actual content. One even says how the New York Times even went ahead with an unredacted email. So much for biased media.
      </p>
      <p>
       And those tweets about emails and warnings about Benghazi? They're not even emails. Just a screen cap of a pastebin saying Hillary did or didn't do this but what the heck makes that different from some Reddit post you or I type up here? It's serif so it's true?
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump, the republican candidate asking for email donations outside the US, supposedly never got any donation from any weapons company or gun lobby groups? Kay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is all the anti Hillary news sites are these click bait sources with no real structure or evidence, and read like cheap tabloid rather than an investigative report? One of these is comparing what Trump said live on tape about assaulting women to quotes in anti Hillary books that are meant to be taken verbatim? Ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary is for fracking? So is Trump. Though "states and municipalities should choose" which would raise eyebrows in the energy community but placate voters. It's an post sale comment and a deception, not an electoral promise or part of a manifesto.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not that invested here. I'm not interested in GOP vs DNC. I'm a foreigner, I've seen my fair share of political scandals up close and people dressing up as Donald Ducks to ask about why he's ducked tax returns is about as vanilla as you can get. (It's a valid question, btw, given the vast amount of off shore shell companies he has set up at Mossack Fonseca. Not necessarily a bad thing, but definitely not straight and narrow)
      </p>
      <p>
       This really isn't about the political machine. If anything, Trump is everything wrong with the political machine, and it is so fitting that he won via electoral college and not popular vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Hillary politic-Jesus? No, but neither is Trump. They're both political animals playing the game, one just has an idea about tact and what's possible in the Whitehouse. I mean, Trump couldn't keep the story on him ridiculing a disabled reporter straight. So he isn't even a "tell it like it is" guy, he's just a rude person that isn't clever enough to lie well.

Sarah Silverman, Al Franken, Bill Maher, Rachel Maddow, That Cuomo dude, Anderson Cooper, Colbert/Stewart, Thom Hartmann, all of them.  It was a sickening display of propping up a crooked candidate.

       Another good way to fuck with her would be to get two front row tickets and just not react whatsoever to a single joke. No laughs, no boos, just complete silent stare. That's the only true way to take down a comedian.

       I've been to a lot of comedy shows and that is exactly it. A stand-up guy once was saying some jokes and kind of bombing but he did say something that made me chuckle so I laughed. I can sometimes have an obnoxious laugh and he decided to go after me thinking I was being sarcastic. I just said, "hey man trying to help you out" and then went 100% mute. My buddy decided to do to the same thing. It can be EXTREMELY detrimental to a stand-up set

       Hes owned by NBC now. I kind of think (polyanna me) Stewart wanted to stay above it. When Podesta hosted the off-the-record dinner for all the pundits and publishers Stewart was off the list but interestingly the email was sent on the 8th of May, 2015, (maybe 10?) two days later was the dinner and Jon Stewart announced retirement on the 20th. After retirement he did an (interview with David Axelrod)[

       Merkel better hope that she doesn't ever have to meet with Trump and Putin alone at the same time. Oh, what a diplomatic nightmare that would be for her...

       I realized the extreme media bias and outright lying back during the first Ron Paul campaign in 2008 and then I got an extra strong dose of it when I was living in Ukraine before, during and after the coup and war there.  Then just in case I didn't have it all figured out they went ahead with the over-the-top pro-Hillary election coverage.

       The narrative wasn't going their way so they tried harder.

       As I said before. Pence beats Kaine. President Trump is the peak of US ambition. Any child who works hard works to be President Trump. That achievement means something and this time it's been rewarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton whether you like her or not, even if not, is a Monarch. She'd listed presidential candidate as her full time occaption and First Lady in her governmental experience. She didn't list speaker or director of anything. After listing her unemployment and marriage to a politician, Hillary listed Former Secretary of State and Lawyer, but from the official voter's material it was clear that Hillary Clinton is a Throne Monarch.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Trump listed a plethora of business ambitions and activities and they're making America great again.

       Pence is a complete idiot. He doesn't believe in evolution. He is a bible thumping Christian Taliban. But, I firmly believe Trump picked him because of all of that. It's clear that Trump doesn't give a shit about Pence. He doesn't listen to him, that's for sure. that's a good thing. Trump is the kind of guy that doesn't plan on dying in the next 4 years, so he picked whoever he thought would give him cred with the evangelical idiots of the country.

       Not only that but Pence is pretty much Joe Biden to Obama. He's a good speaker, he'll back his president, he's definitely a tough opponent in a debate. Trump did a really good job picking him for those reasons. Plus the DNC never saw it coming.

       Yeah pretty much. Pence is certainly not dick cheney. Trump is not going to want anyone stealing the show. Trump will send Pence out when he needs someone to be serious in the same way that Obama sent out Biden when he needed someone to get emotional, but that will be about it.

       I voted for the guy because I identified with hI'm in that he gets attacked by everyone because of comments made to who he thought was a buddy in a private conversation and meanwhile the person making him out to be some nasty villain has and is doing way worse shit but nobody talks about it and instead they praise and rally around the greater evil, it's called being haters and I'm enjoying them feeling the sting of failure.

       That makes no sense. You decided the next President of the USA and are going to try to pretend you have no responsibility in it? Get a grip and stop being so spineless. You are responsible for this and will be for the next 4 years. No amount of pretending and scapegoating is going to change that.

She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer, she conspired to violate the constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the Committee, and the rules of confidentiality."

       *And then there is Shahram Amiri. Who was an Iranian Scientist providing us with intel on Iranian nuclear activities as a spy, Hillary shared emails from him with staffers, and those emails got back to Iran. He was executed on 8-7-16 for helping the United States keep tabs on Iran's nuclear programs, he was executed as a direct result of Hillary's negligent actions, and as a result we now have no contact inside Iran regarding their nuclear activity.

       At no point did I ask why Hillary is the lesser of the two evils, nor did I even mention her. Re read my question, why are you proud that a racist POS who hates everyone who isnt wealthy is the new president? Im afraid for everyone that isnt of his "prefered" race

       Keep going with the racist talk and all that. Let's see how that works out for liberals in the future. All of this was caused by not holding the DNC accountable and demanding a better candidate. This is their fault. Bernie would be President right now if everyone didn't try to prop up an extremely flawed candidate.

       I completely agree with you, I think you might be getting a little to defensive and jumping to conclusions about my political views. I would have loved to see Bernie in office. Hillary is a bitch. But Trump? Convince me on how I can be proud that my president essentially hates me for the color of my skin and my whole culture and family.

       Yeah, seriously.  I'm not so fickle that I change my opinions based on what other people say/think.  I actually vote based on policy.

       I wouldn't mind that trend catching on, instead of people just bitching about the media being shit.  If they wanted to hear the real issues or policies, the news channels might actually cover them.

       Me too for sure, but the bias i saw on r/politics really pushed me to the "echo chamber" they called r/The_Donald and forced me to check it out, Didnt see the hate they kept telling me about. The Bias was poison on MSM, they shouldn't have let it show. Outed themselves to their detriment.
