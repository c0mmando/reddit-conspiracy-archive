    <div class="md"><p>I never thought about it this way. I voted third party and was trying to make sense of how Trump was elected. I can&#39;t believe people would vote for Trump bc of obvious reasons, but when people voted for Hillary, all I could think of was her connections to all the pedophilia she is connected to and also is probably very informed about. </p>

<p>If people voted for Trump because they didn&#39;t want to vote for Hillary due to Anthony Weiner and all the recent wikileaks email pertaining to pedophilia, then it makes me feel just a little better about this country and the voters as a whole. </p>

<p>Most americans still don´t know about the pedo-ring, at least how much of it that we do.</p>

<p>I actually believe Trump won the middle class vote fair and square. People lie, they say they are gonna vote Hillary and then votes Trump. Because they don´t wanna be identified as a &quot;deplorable&quot;, &quot;white-trash&quot;, &quot;racist&quot; etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah very true. I didn&#39;t mean specifically pertaining to the pedo-ring.</p>

<p>Even though the media clearly was set out on destroying Trump, it was still known that Hillary was being investigating for &quot;something,&quot; aka criminal charges. Those voters may not have dug into it like this subreddit does haha, but makes voting for a non-politician that much easier, in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they never really got into the core issues with Hillary. </p>

<ol>
<li>Saying she had a private server and the classified info was not well protected is one thing.</li>
<li>WHY she had a server in the first place - to avoid inspection, like Colin did is a much harder statement about what she was hiding.</li>
</ol>

<p>And Hillary has been investigated so much over the years, and has had so many scandals that this &quot;email&quot;-scandal was just a piece of cake for her. As long as the media didn´t dig just a little bit deeper.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that&#39;s probably the most likely scenario.  I&#39;m in the same boat of not caring who&#39;s president but just wanting the crimes against children to stop, but it&#39;s probably similar to the drug trafficking.. there&#39;s just too much money being made from it.  The only thing that could work would be if the pubic became aware of what was happening and demanded change.

    <div class="md"><p>Good.  But then don&#39;t post an OP that says &quot;I&#39;m gonna be some upset if pedos don&#39;t go to prison and soon.&quot;</p>

<p>because, again, you&#39;re <em>gonna</em> be upset.</p>

<p>Cuz pedos are <em>not</em> going to be going to prison and soon.  They&#39;re not going to prison <em>at all</em>, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This country&#39;s a sham, and it&#39;s owned and controlled by the rich elites.  And they&#39;re the ones who happen to be the most vile pedos out there...so <em>those</em> pedophiles won&#39;t be going to anyone&#39;s prison - much as I personally feel they deserve worse.</p>

<p>We don’t “need” keyboard warriors.  We need responsible individuals willing to talk about and write about and post about things that can be done to change the system.  That’s far different from a keyboard warrior.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If you need someone to be “nice” to you before you realize just how fucked things are and get up and act, then you’ve already lost.</p>

<p>You shouldn’t have to depend upon having to get your little dongle fluffed before you actually get up and DO SOMETHING.  You shouldn’t need to be held by the hand and cooed softly to before you get up and ACT.  If you need somebody to be “nice” to you before you can move, then you don’t have what it takes to get shit done.</p>

<p>Fuck that.</p>

<p>You think TPTB are “nice”?  GTFO w/that shit.  You think a commanding officer is “nice” to his or her troops in the middle of a fucking war?  You think that&#39;s what needs to happen in order to get shit done?  You think the troops aren’t going to move in and fight unless they’re told to fire “real nicely” by their COs?</p>

<p>Come the fuck on, man.  I don’t need to be “soft” to you to still be on the side of righteousness and liberty and fight alongside my brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>You’re the one who needs to shove it w/your attitude and realize that some serious fucking toughness is needed to get shit done in these times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  I don&#39;t disagree with that.  Believe it or not, I don&#39;t like being a mean hard ass, but I <em>really</em> don&#39;t like the regular sense of entitlement that so many people online express.</p>

<p>These are hard.  Fucking.  Times we currently live in.</p>

<p>And we&#39;re <em>losing</em> as a citizenry.  Big time.</p>

<p>A big part of the reason why we&#39;re losing is because we&#39;re fucking <em>soft</em>.  We don&#39;t have to be assholes, but we do need to toughen the fuck up.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t/didn&#39;t mean verbal abuse to you, but realize that verbal abuse can take many forms, and many times PC warriors come on here and try to use condescension and attempts at sounding &quot;intelligent&quot; as a way to brow beat people they don&#39;t agree with...and you <em>were</em> the one who came on here initiating verbal hostilities to me.</p>

<p>I tend to be quite a bit more of a straight shooter and just say &quot;fuck you&quot; if I mean fuck you.</p>

<p>At the same time, and like I said initially, I prefer for everyone to get along and work together toward a common goal of improvement and evolution for everyone.</p>

<p>Barak Obama was a MILLION times more “different” and “fresh” than Trump when he first stepped on the stage years ago.  What you just said right here applies 100 times more to Obama than it would <em>ever</em> apply to Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they never really got into the core issues with Hillary. </p>

<ol>
<li>Saying she had a private server and the classified info was not well protected is one thing.</li>
<li>WHY she had a server in the first place - to avoid inspection, like Colin did is a much harder statement about what she was hiding.</li>
</ol>

<p>And Hillary has been investigated so much over the years, and has had so many scandals that this &quot;email&quot;-scandal was just a piece of cake for her. As long as the media didn´t dig just a little bit deeper.</p>
