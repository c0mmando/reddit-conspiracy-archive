       This is gonna sound crazy but is this sort of thing possible and or has it happened?

       It's mentioned in the MK ultra files as well as the Montauk project.

       What inspired this was watching stranger things ðŸ¤“

       The writers really tapped into the occult and various large conspiracies, and it has truthful elements to it.

       Tesla/Einstein did something along these lines with the Philadelphia Project.  The USS Eldridge was teleported from the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to Norfolk, Virginia, on October 28, 1943.  When it re-materialized there were seamen fused in the walls and several other atrocities.

       Holy crap! Got any links or anything I can dig into? Photos would be even more awesome, if such a thing was ever leaked/declassified.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always wondered if material items or people could theoretically "teleport" items, or themselves, across a distance and re materialize somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing as all matter is merely slowed to a vibration and everything is vibrating at an atomic level, I feel it could be possible to manipulate the atoms and somehow manifest somewhere else?

       You don't need to be a scientist to understand the basic science and fundamental dynamics behind it. Which it clearly seems you do.  After all, it's not rocket science.  ;)

       Einstein was right in that man wasn't ready for his unified theory.

       Nikola and Einstein are so far ahead of their time I'm always blown away by what they discovered in ONE lifetime!!

       I think anything is possible now.
      </p>
      <p>
       This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that's what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn't see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching "black cube ufo" for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening. edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas) edit: It was below the clouds. It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day.

       Hey man thanks so much for sharing. For what it's worth I "believe" you. It's silly that in this day and age with such sightings as yours people still get ridiculed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's even worse is 91%+ of people believe in aliens yet are so quick and eager to jump on someone's throat as soon as they speak of aliens or any space craft or weird instances.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's insanity and I'm sure it's highly frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have yet to see anything like you described or any ships (except for this meteor that looked like a ship but I think it was just a meteor)
      </p>
      <p>
       But the day I see it I would be so honored and grateful.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is literally the biggest openly kept secret in society right now and it's ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you man for sharing that was a good read. Don't let the rejections from people shut you down.

       Cool story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you've heard of this already, but check out Dr. Steven Greer's videos. He coordinated disclosure with dozens of major media outlets present. Their chief producers though all quashed it by pressure from the powers that be/owners of their "news outlets".
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading hundreds and thousands of stories, watching thousands of hours of footage, I have come to the conclusion that literally anything is possible. Our time reference is merely what we exist in like a bubble, our time is not applicable on a universal scale. There are light beings, to extra-dimensional beings, to what we'd see as monster entities. Many live on and within our planet, and others come from outside our known dimension set.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on, but complexity is increasing by the day. Our destiny is to travel the stars to be ETs to other underdeveloped people on distant planets (cycle of life, technology, evolution), but of course all the processes necessary to get to that point might take 30, 100 or 200 years. Given humans were going to the toilet in backyard sheds less than 100 years ago, now we have computers running everything, I'd say this new chapter is not far away.

       This always freaked me out.I think it could be some Israeli drone blimp but the fact that it was estimated to be 2 km wide begs to differ.

       My buddy has told me about an experience extremely similar to yours but he is from Houston, TX. Claims he was on a balcony at night as a teen and saw what appeared to be a huge craft of some sort that basically covered up the sky (the portion of the sly he could see from his balcony). The amazing thing is that he also pointed out that when he was observing the object move - there was complete silence. And prior to him seeing the object - there were street sounds (cars, ambience, wind). Reading such a similar experience gave me chills.

       I've been rabbit-holing down that way ever since I heard about Camp Hero and the other stuff they were trying to out Montauk way. Coast to Coast did several shows with Al Bielek / Carlos Allende and such. Dig some Art Bell archives, see what there is. Also (and again I'm NO FUCKING HELP WITH THE LINKS sorry) there's a great documentary on YouTube about the shenanigans surrounding the Philadelphia Experiment and its ties to the work going on in New Jersey at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fascinating stuff, but I don't think anyone tore a hole in anything. The question of vibration and projection on the other hand... I dunno. I'm a 46 year-old scientist and I still can't decide whether the whole thing is sexy and fake or terrifying and true.

       is a good start. The more olde time footage in the doc, the better. There is a really great Al Bielek video too, but I can't find it right now.

       Edit oh my god: it's Fort Hero, I think. Not Camp Hero. Also I don't buy Bielek's ALIENS shit. But that's just me.

       I will agree the subject is esoteric in nature but there is no need to be so aggressive and hostile.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I agree these kinds of topics are "out there" and "hard to swallow" because it alters people's world views of their own reality, it does fit the narrative of this sub.

       To say this shouldn't be posted here is advocating for censorship, and by limiting information you are doing more harm than good.
