    <div class="md"><p>I hate this talk of &quot;stolen&quot; taxes.... They all say omg the boston tea party, we fought to eliminate taxes. No.... back in the day they fought for taxation without representation... you&#39;re represented now ;p the country isn&#39;t going to run on hopes and dreams, it needs money. Now, I do believe there is so much to be done with how our tax money is spent. There is so much fucking fraud waste and abuse going on, and it doesn&#39;t change because that&#39;s just how stuff has always been done... contractors milk the contracts, every military branch and units spend every dime they&#39;re allocated because if they don&#39;t next year they won&#39;t get as much... They need to start rewarding spending less.  Oh hey..... you reduced your budget and spent 30% less? here... take 5% of that and give out bonuses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know the government makes as much money as it wants, right?  Do you realize that?  </p>

<p>They have the Federal Reserve on favorites.  They can call and inject as many billions of new dollars into circulation as they want.  In reality it works a little more complicated than that, but essentially that&#39;s what it reduces to: the US dollar is an imaginary asset created by the government.  </p>

<p>So now why would they need to take portions of that dollar back from citizens every year?  They don&#39;t actually need the money - they can just print more, remember?  So what does this taxation actually do?  </p>

<p>It keeps the peasant class in check, so they don&#39;t get too powerful.  </p>

<p>In 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution made the income tax a permanent fixture in the U.S. tax system. In fiscal year 1918, annual internal revenue collections for the first time passed the billion-dollar mark, rising to $5.4 billion by 1920.[14]</p>

<p>This is the problem I have. This may get me downvoted, but, I&#39;m all for single payer health and free university. I have no issue paying more, if I see my extra taxes create action!

<p>Money is the lifeblood of an economy.  The problem isn&#39;t the money we&#39;re using.  It&#39;s the Organization which controls it, and has a stranglehold on everyone from the highest politician to the lowest slave.  Instead of funneling our currency directly from a (uncorrupted) government, who can directly fund agriculture, public services, human rights, etc., we&#39;ve given this power to a capitalistic family of mobsters, funneling their money through banks and thieves, and they&#39;d rather murder a million people, than feed them.  The taxes tacked onto the end of this collossal scam are just the final insult they add, when the system has run its cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the money is made of doesn&#39;t matter.  It could be paper, gold, shiny rocks, or cheese.  What does matter is who controls it.  Wilson willingly handed our sovereignty to the FED, when he signed it into existence.  The government <em>should</em> be in charge of that, with loads of checks and balances.<br/>
But here we are, in a situation where our government is completely and utterly corrupted by these murderers, we have nobody to safely take over money creation.  The crooks in office are bought and paid for by the financial interests, and would only serve themselves and their masters again, given the chance.  The only way to &quot;fix&quot; it is to tear it all down, watch it burn, and start over with new uncorrupted leadership.  But then, the original Families will still be there to corrupt any new system put in place.  We&#39;re in a bit of a pickle, to say the least...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple things:  It would help with inflation manipulation, but it&#39;s pretty heavy, and still can be controlled by the top of the pyramid. And of course, &quot;Whoever has the gold makes the rules&quot;, right?  Do you think these multitrillionaires in power might have some gold stashed away, perhaps?  Second, our money isn&#39;t even made out of paper anymore.  Paper currency is just a small fraction of the &quot;money&quot; we have in circulation now.  Almost all of it is just loan balances, bits on somebody&#39;s computer, telling us how much money we have.  Fractional lending scams most of our economy into existence, but always at the mercy of the banks.  Saying it&#39;s made out of paper implies that they actually had to do some work to make it exist.  It&#39;s far far easier than that.</p>
