       I hate this talk of "stolen" taxes.... They all say omg the boston tea party, we fought to eliminate taxes. No.... back in the day they fought for taxation without representation... you're represented now ;p the country isn't going to run on hopes and dreams, it needs money. Now, I do believe there is so much to be done with how our tax money is spent. There is so much fucking fraud waste and abuse going on, and it doesn't change because that's just how stuff has always been done... contractors milk the contracts, every military branch and units spend every dime they're allocated because if they don't next year they won't get as much... They need to start rewarding spending less.  Oh hey..... you reduced your budget and spent 30% less? here... take 5% of that and give out bonuses.

       You know the government makes as much money as it wants, right?  Do you realize that?
      </p>
      <p>
       They have the Federal Reserve on favorites.  They can call and inject as many billions of new dollars into circulation as they want.  In reality it works a little more complicated than that, but essentially that's what it reduces to: the US dollar is an imaginary asset created by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now why would they need to take portions of that dollar back from citizens every year?  They don't actually need the money - they can just print more, remember?  So what does this taxation actually do?
      </p>
      <p>
       It keeps the peasant class in check, so they don't get too powerful.

       Yes, the government can print money, but you do realize we're not the only government out there... Get rid of taxation, and just print money and see how far your dollar goes from there. No one will want your paper.

       This is actually a slightly mistaken view: money exists to keep track of debts.  If there were only five people in a tribe, you wouldn't need money.  You would know through observation and gossip who was pulling their weight and who wasn't.

       Money is currently assigned a value based on many factors, we have a fiat system nowadays  it's not gold backed. It's not just to track debt. It'd a form of payment, measurement of wealth.

       So who's going to assign this value? Who decides its worth? Are we just going to say fuck it and go to a complete barter system? I honestly don't feel like having to go to my electric company who only wants to be paid in butter, but i don't make butter.... so I have to go trade paul for something he needs because he's the butter guy in town...

       Ok... let's take a look into this world where money doesn't matter we just print it whenever we want... It would be worthless. If you can just print money... why work? Are we going to become a welfare nation? Why join the military.... Why create infrastructure. You say you don't want to be taxed, or have dollars. What in the fuck do you want then? Come up with a viable solution...

       So you would rather move back to Salt and minerals as a our monetary source? I'm not disagreeing with the fact that there could be a better way. I'm saying that no one here is offering even a shred of a decent Idea. One that won't cripple our country trying to switch. I'm all for salt... and gold and silver... but that's a lot of damn salt to buy a car nowadays... I'd need barrels of the stuff to pay by monthly bills...

       The income tax was instituted alongside the Federal Reserve, because the international banking cartel that (still) owns the Fed needed a revenue stream to issue debt (dollars) against.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution made the income tax a permanent fixture in the U.S. tax system. In fiscal year 1918, annual internal revenue collections for the first time passed the billion-dollar mark, rising to $5.4 billion by 1920.[14]

       lol facts all you said was that taxation is theft, you didn't list a single fucking fact. Oh you want to use harsh words thinking you're an internet tough guy and make your opinion more valid? go fuck yourself some more. I bet you havn't voted or nominated anyone in a local election. Don't like that? go fucking run for office. Not good enough? Get the fuck out. How about that shit...

       By working you are agreeing to be taxed. You drive on roads that tax paid for. Take public transport, drink water... so much more. If you don't want to pay tax, don't use a single thing that taxes have paid for.

       You'll have to explain this free market to me. How is it set up? Are you talking a communist economy? One where people are not compelled with the threat of starvation if they don't sell their labor power, and therefore are able to voluntarily associate.

       This is the problem I have. This may get me downvoted, but, I'm all for single payer health and free university. I have no issue paying more, if I see my extra taxes create action!

       These sarcastic arguments supporting our "money" system are so misguided it's sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money is the lifeblood of an economy.  The problem isn't the money we're using.  It's the Organization which controls it, and has a stranglehold on everyone from the highest politician to the lowest slave.  Instead of funneling our currency directly from a (uncorrupted) government, who can directly fund agriculture, public services, human rights, etc., we've given this power to a capitalistic family of mobsters, funneling their money through banks and thieves, and they'd rather murder a million people, than feed them.  The taxes tacked onto the end of this collossal scam are just the final insult they add, when the system has run its cycle.

       Money is indeed the lifeblood of an economy. Which is why it is so important to use sound money instead of paper money. Any organization with the right to print money will eventually abuse the power.

       What the money is made of doesn't matter.  It could be paper, gold, shiny rocks, or cheese.  What does matter is who controls it.  Wilson willingly handed our sovereignty to the FED, when he signed it into existence.  The government
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be in charge of that, with loads of checks and balances.
       <br/>
       But here we are, in a situation where our government is completely and utterly corrupted by these murderers, we have nobody to safely take over money creation.  The crooks in office are bought and paid for by the financial interests, and would only serve themselves and their masters again, given the chance.  The only way to "fix" it is to tear it all down, watch it burn, and start over with new uncorrupted leadership.  But then, the original Families will still be there to corrupt any new system put in place.  We're in a bit of a pickle, to say the least...

       A couple things:  It would help with inflation manipulation, but it's pretty heavy, and still can be controlled by the top of the pyramid. And of course, "Whoever has the gold makes the rules", right?  Do you think these multitrillionaires in power might have some gold stashed away, perhaps?  Second, our money isn't even made out of paper anymore.  Paper currency is just a small fraction of the "money" we have in circulation now.  Almost all of it is just loan balances, bits on somebody's computer, telling us how much money we have.  Fractional lending scams most of our economy into existence, but always at the mercy of the banks.  Saying it's made out of paper implies that they actually had to do some work to make it exist.  It's far far easier than that.

       You're right we should all just get together as citizens and come up with a way to hire contractors to build our roads, sewer systems and schools. Everyone of us could chip in for it, it would be a lot more efficient than paying taxes. A lot of us are busy though so maybe we should just pick someone to over see it all and pay them a salary for doing it...

       Ok... let's take a look into this world where money doesn't matter we just print it whenever we want... It would be worthless. If you can just print money... why work? Are we going to become a welfare nation? Why join the military.... Why create infrastructure. You say you don't want to be taxed, or have dollars. What in the fuck do you want then? Come up with a viable solution...
