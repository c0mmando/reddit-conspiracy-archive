<p>So we keep hearing about all the PASTA references in his emails... finally busted the code word. Its a cocaine paste: </p>

<p>BBC Article on drug called &quot;Pasta Base&quot;: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26436094">http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26436094</a>
Wikipedia on &quot;Cocaine Paste&quot;: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26436094">http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26436094</a></p>

<p>Description from Wikipedia: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coca paste (paco, basuco, oxi) is a crude extract of the coca leaf which contains 40% to 91% cocaine sulfate along with companion coca alkaloids and varying quantities of benzoic acid, methanol, and kerosene. In South America, coca paste, also known as cocaine base and, therefore, often confused with cocaine freebase in North America, is relatively inexpensive and is widely used by low-income populations. The coca paste is smoked in tobacco or cannabis cigarettes and use has become widespread in several Latin American countries. Traditionally, coca paste has been relatively abundant in South American countries such as Colombia where it is processed into cocaine hydrochloride (&quot;street cocaine&quot;) for distribution to the rest of the world.[1] The cocaine content of coca paste may vary from 41% to 91%. The caustic reactions associated with the local application of coca paste prevents its use by oral, intranasal, mucosal, intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous routes. Coca paste can only be smoked when combined with a very inflammable material such as tobacco or cannabis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems like it needs to be mixed with stuff which explains why there are so many references to other things like walnuts and kale and cheese<strong>(see below for update)</strong> and sauces and things. they are all other drug codes. </p>

<p>I will cross post some of my findings about &quot;pasta&quot; references from another post I was commenting on here:</p>

<p>Offering late night pasta to Gabe Podesta (his brother? cousin?) Link: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36623">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36623</a></p>

<p>This particular one a friend says they are stuck in traffic (in march) and are sad to have to settle for the pasta that John gave them for christmas... wtf does that even mean? Settle for pasta from 3 months ago? Who says that? Then they presumably make it and John says &quot;thanks for coming. always happy to babysit&quot;. Babysitting is a clear drug reference. Link: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/44232">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/44232</a></p>

<p>&quot;Herb&quot; asking Ps. Do you think Iâ€™ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?&quot; So being &quot;on&quot; something typically is referring to a drug. Being on a drug. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35581">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35581</a> </p>

<p>E-mail to Mae Podesta... Is this his daughter? feel free to chime in on this. He asks if he should wait up for her to cook some pasta. Link: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36242">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36242</a></p>

<p>Email from a daily beast editor saying she understands why she wasn&#39;t invited to the &quot;dinner&quot; but hopes to get some of that &quot;pasta and walnut side dish&quot;. Link: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35581">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35581</a></p>

<p>Someone mentions valentines day... then John says he&#39;s trying out a new pasta machine tonight and invites the couple over. &quot;Machine&quot; being a pipe? or something to smoke out of? <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/20084">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/20084</a></p>

<p>From his friend Herb.. &quot;I hope you received the holiday package of pasta and sauce. I wish I could make it turn out as special as you do&quot;.  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15543">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15543</a></p>

<p>Someone else thanking them for an evening of food and company and urging them to &quot;definitely keep the pasta making attachment&quot;. Another pipe or smoking apparatus? <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2844">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2844</a></p>

<p>This guy says he met Podesta at a &quot;cooking&quot; fundraiser and even puts the word cooking in quotes to indicate that is not where the fuck they met. And then says he pasta was great btw. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6093">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6093</a></p>

<p>To His brother: &quot;What dish you wanna cook?&quot; &quot;Ok if I do pasta?&quot; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46134">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46134</a></p>

<p>Another to his brother: &quot;When are you getting to the apt? I&#39;m going to try to do my 8:00 and 9:00
conference calls from there over a bowl of pasta. Join me or do you have
dinner plans?&quot; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46941">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46941</a></p>

<p>From a friend Jim asking about walnut sauce for the pasta: &quot; But walnut sauce for the pasta? Mary, plz tell us the straight story, was the sauce actually very tasty?&quot; Not sure what the walnut sauce is. A different drug mix in?  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43113">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43113</a></p>

<p>From his brother: Trying to figure out the menu, asking what kind of pasta they will be &quot;doing&quot;. Must have different combos they make? <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40130">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40130</a></p>

<p>Mary his wife suggests pasta with the &quot;Kale that they have&quot; which I am guessing means with Weed mixed in it. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40737">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40737</a></p>

<p>There are a lot more emails that reference pasta... some of which may be about actual pasta. I think these people are smart enough to email about actual food sometimes, but it sounds to me like Podesta is a drug dealer and is known around town to make this cocaine paste. Not sure what the SAUCE is though. Any leads????</p>

<p>EDITED TO ADD: </p>

<p><strong>APPARENTLY CHEESE IS ALSO A DRUG</strong>. This explains the quote from above asking if the friend will do better playing dominoes on cheese or pasta. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35581">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35581</a> </p>

<p>From Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_(recreational_drug)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_(recreational_drug)</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cheese is a combination of drugs, made by combining heroin with crushed tablets of certain over-the-counter cold medication, such as Tylenol PM. Such cold medications contain acetaminophen (paracetemol), the active ingredient in Tylenol, and the antihistamine diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in Benadryl.[3] Cheese samples obtained in north Dallas contained between 2% and 8% heroin, in contrast to the 30% commonly found in black tar heroin.[4] Users commonly take the powder by insufflation (&quot;snorting&quot;) rather than by intravenous injection. This mixture is also known as &quot;Tylenol With Smack&quot;, by analogy to the Tylenol With Codeine series.</p>

<p>Gayle Smith sure is obsessed with bringing him some &quot;blue cheese&quot; and references it a few times.  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3477">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3477</a>

<p><strong>According to Urban dictionary, &quot;pizza&quot; is slang for ordering drugs</strong> (not the most relizble source, I know, but it is a link! <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pizza&amp;defid=871443&amp;page=4">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pizza&amp;defid=871443&amp;page=4</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>pizza 
drugs. ordering &quot; pizza &quot; means buying a certain kind of drug, which is reflected in the topping. a pizza with extra cheese is ecstasy, a pizza with pepperoni is heroin, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia lists Pizza as a slang term for Cannabis as well here :<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Cannabis_slang">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Cannabis_slang</a></p>

<p>Weird e-mail to brother: &quot;would love to get pizza for an hour? or come over&quot; That is oddly specific. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35053">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35053</a></p>

<p>&quot;The realtor found a map that is pizza related. is it yours?&quot; I don&#39;t know what map could possibly mean if not a sex term... Was trying to think of a drug reference for it, but can&#39;t. Perhaps an actual map... too far? haha <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795</a> </p>

<p>&quot;if you will be around for dinner or pizza on sunday...&quot;. So pizza is not referencing food for sure here otherwise it could be the dinner. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/22033">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/22033</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a pretty detailed explanation of the Clinton/Podesta code words from the latest leaks and how they line up almost exactly with UK drug slang (Pasta, Pizza, Cheese, etc.). It seemed more like a coincidence though and he even said he wasn&#39;t sure if that&#39;s what it was. From what&#39;s come out since then it seems like its pretty clearly something much more sinister (think pedophilia).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think when they talk about cheese and pizza and hotdogs and maps...that is related to what you are talking about. I think both can exist. I think this &quot;pasta&quot; and &quot;walnuts&quot; thing is specific to drugs though. I think if you open your mind to both being a possibility, you may see the truth. The main reasons are these:</p>

<ol>
<li>Multiple cooking references. Many drugs are cooked up.</li>
<li>Multiple references to tools used to making the pasta and to ingest the pasta.</li>
<li>The reference to &quot;babysitting&quot; while someone ate the pasta.</li>
<li>the references to Podesta gifting the pasta to people in boxes.</li>

<p><strong><em>Reference to pizza and chicago style hot dogs in the same email:</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/emailid/17922">RE: Pizza</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aaric Eisenstein: Anybody want to order <strong>pizza</strong> for delivery? It&#39;s nasty out there.</p>

<p>Reva Bhalla: i might be interested since Dan Burges lunch cheated on me again</p>

<p>Dan Burges: Yeah, but here she is, at my desk, jumping on the security lunch bandwagon....</p>

<p>Reva Bhalla: thats right...<strong>chicago style hot dog</strong> baby</p>

<p>Greg Sikes: Does Fred have anything to do with the ingredients used for the security lunch bandwagon???</p>

<p>Dan Burges: Anthrax included...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does this seem so far out of context? Reva appears to be making a sex joke to Dan. Why would she specifically mention chicago style hot dogs during a pizza delivery order? &quot;Chicago style&quot; is slang for &quot;no pants&quot; and Dan is talking about a female at his desk &quot;jumping on the bandwagon&quot;. And if we&#39;re talking pizza wouldn&#39;t we just say what kind of toppings are we getting, instead of &quot;the ingredients used for the security lunch bandwagon&quot;?</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html">RE: Get ready for &quot;Chicago Hot Dog Friday&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don Kuykendall: To celebrate all you hot dogs out there. Aaric, you can participate as
well!</p>

<p>Fred Burton: I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in <strong>pizza/dogs from Chicago</strong> for a private party at the White House not long ago, assume we are using the same channels?</p>

<p>Aaric Eisenstein: If we get the same &quot;waitresses,&quot; I&#39;m all for it!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s these same Stratfor guys again...talking about pizza and chicago dogs. Who would &quot;waitresses&quot; refer to?</p>

<p>At this point it&#39;s probably a good time to introduce you to <a href="https://www.stratfor.com/about/analysts/fred-burton">Fred Burton</a>. He worked for the U.S. State Department and is a security/terrorist mastermind. I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to write these emails off as casual banter.</p>

<p><strong><em>Reference to pizza and the colors black/white in the same email:</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">Did you leave a handkerchief</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (<strong>white w/ black</strong>) that was left on the kitchen island. The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems <strong>pizza-related</strong>. Is it yorus?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Come on, a pizza-related handkerchief? There is no such thing. People use handkerchiefs for wiping up bodily fluids. This has got to be sex related.</p>

<p><a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/emailid/18817">RE: headcount for pizza [Stratfor leaks]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the <strong>pizza</strong> offer include those of us who can&#39;t make the meeting because we&#39;re out here editing? &#39;Cos if so, count me in. This e-mail is color-coded in <strong>black and white</strong> and will combust in 30 seconds.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So what is this strange relationship between pizza, chicago style hot dogs, and the colors black/white?</p>
