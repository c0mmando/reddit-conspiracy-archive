       History. Just look at history and you'll see it. The people of this country have been lied to for many years and they're so weak minded now that they really don't care. There is

       He "lost" in the scripted version but in reality he wasn't selected by them. I get your take, though.

       The country doesn't elect anyone.

       What do you mean this is the first time the sheeple are hearing about it? Do you know what was pretty much on the news everyday in the 80s? Satanic worship, kidnappings, murders, rituals, etc. People blamed it on rock music (specifically metal), D&amp;D and gang load of other shit. People have turned a blind eye but make no mistake about it, the "sheeple" have known.

       We are saying that this time MILLIONS of people will KNOW. Because of the leaks. That's the difference. Is it so hard for you to understand? Let's say half the country learns about it in the weeks following the election. What happens then? Because that is what is happening.

       I've been trying to guess the illuminati plan for months. Now I think I see it very clearly.

      <p>
       These leaks are part of the illuminati plan. 
The illuminati are exposing Hillary Clinton as a satanist child sex ring leader.
The illuminati are doing it right before the "election"
The illuminati will rig the election so she wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I understand people didn't want Obama...but there was not a significant amount of people that thought Obama was a satanic child selling pedo.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if...this time...millions of people sniffed out that Hillary was a satanic priest that ran a world wide mob that dealt in war, drugs, and people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they found out right before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       And more and more info came out about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens next?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary can't be president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump can't be president.

       Let me stop you right there.  There is no such thing as "The illuminati." I'm
       <strong>
        NOT

       saying there isn't a group controlling everything,
       <strong>
        there is
       </strong>
       but they are not called "the Illuminati." If you have done your research you'll know when the Bavarian group was destroyed, who did it, why they did it and what type of assimilation occurred.

        These leaks are part of the illuminati plan. The illuminati are exposing Hillary Clinton as a satanist child sex ring leader. The illuminati are doing it right before the "election" The illuminati will rig the election so she wins.

       Name aside, they aren't "exposing" her as people already knew what she was/is. She is a Dark Mother/Black Queen, she knows full well and
       <strong>
        AGREED
       </strong>
       to it beforehand. They are not "rigging" the election, they have already selected who will be POTUS. There is no rigging involved as your votes don't matter.

       It will be spun as the cost of doing business. The shit goes on every day, people are desensitized and nothing will happen. You'll have people defending her on the grounds that it's ok to have sex with children (will cite religious text and cultures outside of the US), that it's ok to worship Satan (will come clean that this country was NOT founded on "Christian principles) and that freedom of religion is a good thing and then the war, drugs, etc will be spun as the cost of doing business/collateral damage.

       My fucking question is what will the Trump supporters do when they realize the election was stolen by a psychopath satanist child trafficker? That's my question. And yes, I know. Yes you know.

       They are already exposed. If they have control of the government what is there to do?

       I agree. But the difference in my hypothetical question is...what happens when the masses discover that Hillary Clinton is a child fucking satanist? Because that is what is happening.

       Who will be the president...because they have a plan and it isn't Clinton or Trump.

       I get it man! Fuck! If this were fair Trump would win in a landslide. Maybe all 50 states. But she is going to win. The election will be 100% rigged.

       I think there will be a lot of "suicides" by the fringe characters involved in the mess and then there will be a lot of trending hashtags for a while. #thoughtsandprayers type shit. Most people aren't going to get off the couch and try to make a difference because "somebody else" will.

       Obviously Trump is working for the same boss...but nothing will come out about him. His role is to look clean. But it won't matter because he lost the election.
