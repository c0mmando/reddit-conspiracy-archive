<p>History. Just look at history and you&#39;ll see it. The people of this country have been lied to for many years and they&#39;re so weak minded now that they really don&#39;t care. There is <strong>NOT</strong> going to be some civil uprising, people going crazy, etc. You will have one or two lone wolves going mad and that&#39;s it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obviously Trump is working for the same boss...</p>

<p>And you ask about it being business as usual?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but nothing will come out about him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well he has connections with the same pedos and was on the plane multiple times. How will nothing about him come out?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His role is to look clean. But it won&#39;t matter because he lost the election.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He &quot;lost&quot; in the scripted version but in reality he wasn&#39;t selected by them. I get your take, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem will be that the country will have elected a satanic child sex ringleader. People are going to like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The country doesn&#39;t elect anyone. <em>They</em>, select who will be the stooge and that&#39;s pretty much it. And you think this will be the first Satanic child sex sick fuck in office? No, this shit goes back centuries. <strong>EVERY. SINGLE. PRESIDENT.</strong> </p>

<p>And it will be business as usual. Nothing is going to happen. I already answered it several times now. You will have one or two lone wolves and everything else will be spun to make it appealign to the masses and it will be business as usual. How many times do I have to type it?

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to guess the illuminati plan for months. Now I think I see it very clearly.</p>

<p>These leaks are part of the illuminati plan. 
The illuminati are exposing Hillary Clinton as a satanist child sex ring leader.
The illuminati are doing it right before the &quot;election&quot;
The illuminati will rig the election so she wins.</p>

<p>Now, I understand people didn&#39;t want Obama...but there was not a significant amount of people that thought Obama was a satanic child selling pedo.</p>

<p>But what if...this time...millions of people sniffed out that Hillary was a satanic priest that ran a world wide mob that dealt in war, drugs, and people.</p>

<p>And they found out right before the election.</p>

<p>And more and more info came out about it.</p>

<p>What happens next?</p>

<p>Hillary can&#39;t be president.</p>

<p>Trump can&#39;t be president.</p>

<p>Something CRAZY will happen.</p>

<p>Let me stop you right there.  There is no such thing as &quot;The illuminati.&quot; I&#39;m <strong>NOT</strong> saying there isn&#39;t a group controlling everything, <strong>there is</strong> but they are not called &quot;the Illuminati.&quot; If you have done your research you&#39;ll know when the Bavarian group was destroyed, who did it, why they did it and what type of assimilation occurred.</p>

<p>Name aside, they aren&#39;t &quot;exposing&quot; her as people already knew what she was/is. She is a Dark Mother/Black Queen, she knows full well and <strong>AGREED</strong> to it beforehand. They are not &quot;rigging&quot; the election, they have already selected who will be POTUS. There is no rigging involved as your votes don&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Significant to do what? You&#39;re still operating under the assumption that your vote matters, it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>It will be spun as the cost of doing business. The shit goes on every day, people are desensitized and nothing will happen. You&#39;ll have people defending her on the grounds that it&#39;s ok to have sex with children (will cite religious text and cultures outside of the US), that it&#39;s ok to worship Satan (will come clean that this country was NOT founded on &quot;Christian principles) and that freedom of religion is a good thing and then the war, drugs, etc will be spun as the cost of doing business/collateral damage. </p>
