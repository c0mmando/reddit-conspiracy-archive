        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It gets MUCH worse than this. When you die you will be pulled into the &quot;Fake Heaven&quot; which is actually an Astral Holding Area. After a period you will be judged by the &quot;Archons&quot;. They will then say you must return for &quot;More Lessons&quot; and to remove &quot;Karmic Debt&quot;. Both are complete scams. Your memories will be erased and you will be reinserted into this hellhole. We are used over and over as &quot;Energy Slaves&quot;. The Archons are Parasites, and the Earth Global Elite work for them.. Google: 1)Archons White Light 2)Archons Reincarnation 3)Archons Lords Of Karma 4)Archons Reptilians 5) White Light Trap 6)Gnostics Archons 7)Illuminati Archons 8)Illuminati Lords Of Karma 9)Reincarnation Memory Erase. If you take the time and google search all these, you will come across a large amount of information.. It is much worse than you could imagine. If you google search what I have listed, you will come across an enormous amount of information. Watching &quot;David Icke&quot; videos on youtube will explain everything and is something everyone should do. Jeff Rense. Cameron Day. Jay Weidner and Henry Makow have all talked in detail about these Satanic Maniacs..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should check out Lisa M. Harrison. She recently has been talking about us living in a construct, meaning the entire universe is a fake. The story goes that we (as infinite conciousness) originally created the construct as a place to play and experience. We were then trapped here by the Archon and have been used as energy slaves ever since. Very interesting stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok but how do we get out and beat them? Is it true we can surpass this with Christ consciousness? Also referred to as Krishna conciousnessn in Hinduism and the Bhagavad Gita. It precisely talks about being stuck in material reeincarnation due to karma. However a lot of the holy text talks about how to break from karma. I think that&#39;s a direct way to beat the archons you talk about. Be sure to spread this because if we can change the consciousness of the world then we can beat the energy monopoly you are talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. The research regarding this predicament is ongoing. Theoretically; this is the most difficult scenario in our current existence.  We need to expand our Conscious Awareness on a continual basis. Realize this is a &quot;Fake Universe&quot;. Matter is Holographic. It is a Simulation and the programming can be overwritten with Advanced Thought. You have two difficult choices; 1) Move away from the White Light Trap, and attempt to escape into the Real Universe. 2) Confront the Archons in the Astral Afterlife. Declare any and all &quot;Agreements&quot; and &quot;Soul Contracts&quot; as terminated, this is incredibly important. You must declare all contracts with Archons as &quot;Cancelled&quot; by your own free choice. State you will now determine your own existence. Remain as yourself and then travel in the Astral Worlds as a free being. This can be dangerous, as you must always remember the truth and be ready to overwrite/self project your reality if necessary. This is also the only way to save those who have already died and have not yet been reinserted through Forced Reincarnation..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is our trap actually a negative, evil situation? Maybe in producing energy for them, we are catering to a net neutral or even good. We definitely are used for some purpose, yes, but maybe we&#39;re just at a bad point in earth&#39;s long life, stuck out in a distant universe with our elite acting as sociopathic lunatics. Our god force seperate from our elite. Yes, we are being mass controlled and mass mislead and ripped from our true lives and insticts farther and farther every generation, but why must it be otherworldly? Just a case of our collective unconscious wanting to scope out negative situations and emotion. I scope out dark drone music and depressing movies/books if I&#39;m in a mood to feel gloomy for no external reason other than maybe wanting to cry about something or feel down. Maybe All just wants to experience these feeling/events &#39;just because&#39;?</p>

<p>Or maybe as earth flys farther from the center of the universe, farther from god/creation/being whole, we shift closer to destruction. Spiraling out, to be abandoned by our creative force, losing the divine guidance at the center where consciousness of all is matched with the physical matter of all. Maybe what we are living is just a distortion in our heads. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been about what you&#39;re saying for a long time now, would just like to work out some thoughts with others who want to know reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blue and Stilton Cheeses eaten before bed can create Advanced Lucid/Interdimensional Dream experiences.  Kelp tablets because of the Iodine content do the same. MSM powder is also incredibly useful. 1000 mg powder at bed. Upon waking every 2 hours take 1000 mg twice more. Magnesium with Choline or Melatonin also exceptional.  make sure to rotate vitamins as using the same on consecutive days causes tolerance..</p>
