Theyre talking about making them pass out/ fall down with the use of a drug

<p>From christmas, maybe a child he was given for a christmas gift &amp; has hidden away somewhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve been really interested in all this strange stuff in Podesta&#39;s emails, and I decided to gather some of what I found most intriguing. Some of these code words might not be code at all, but hopefully we can get a good idea of which ones, if any, are legitimate code and what they mean.</p>

<p>I may add links dealing with potential child trafficking and I am assuming you guys have read about those connections. I also plan on labeling the links when I have more free time. I&#39;ll update the list if people send me new links that seem legitimate and interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a feeling they might call (COG) &amp; round up people and put them in camps, some of the adults they&#39;ll reprogram and use as slaves &amp; maybe they&#39;ll go through the children &amp; buy sell n trade them like the Isis slaves.
Could be why they don&#39;t mind all the refugees coming in because they&#39;re just going to get rid of them anyway they wanna start the depopulation campaign .. They don&#39;t care about those people, they don&#39;t care about the refugees, if they did they wouldnt have created them in the first place &amp; they don&#39;t care about us either obviously .. I&#39;ve read it from somewhere were they called the population &quot;useless eaters&quot;</p>

<p>I mean everything seems to be going towards like that&#39;s what being planned. I mean they&#39;re going to install Hillary the FBI nobody&#39;s doing anything.  They started all these fires and we&#39;re running around trying to put them out while they&#39;re robbing the bank.</p>

<p>They try to make you think they&#39;re doing something &amp; that they truly care about the country  and the citizens &amp; the Constitution and what&#39;s right</p>

<p>Were being played on grand scale I&#39;m afraid. Why would anyone in the Government Federal to state want to fix what&#39;s going on? Its not broken for them, they&#39;re not broke. United states of america incorporated the corporation . The corporation by the corporations for the corporations .  ...Not Of the People by the people for the people . Like the people think .. all BC of the coup after the the revolution &amp; the act of 1871 that turned America into a corporation &amp; the states into Corporations.. And the law enforcement and so on and so on.</p>

<p>if We really wanted to fix things wed have to start there and recognize that that was a false Constitution put in place to deceive us and extort money from us anddc take the country back that they lost , and so there is a shadow government we are being ran by a shadow government, not the original government that was intended.</p>

<p>I learned a lot on annavonreitz.com &amp; its in chronological order. I cried for 3 days
The greatest fraud ever.</p>

<p>I really feel like this is a computer model created by a computer and its just randomly putting together &amp; playing out different outcomes... There&#39;s billions of variations of outcomes but there&#39;s only one amazing perfect one, where everythings perfect.  There&#39;s green energy , the country is exactly what our forefathers intended, the world is complete and whole people live very long lives, we live off our land, we grow our own food, were free yet responsible we care about Community each other&#39;s children ...were self-sufficient, we have Commerce. We have effective space programs and we are colonizing and becoming Stewards of other planets, </p>

<p>There&#39;s no insurance, there&#39;s no IRS, no driver&#39;s licenses, you own your own home, people are not signing thier children away to the government as a slaves with a birth certificate to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange   . .... there&#39;s nothing unlawful ,, we&#39;re not Rats on a wheel , Citizens depend on local community government more than they do on national government, The law is &quot;no victim no crime&quot; there&#39;s only common law in civilian Courts presided over by common law judges which could be anybody fair &amp; honest in the community, instead of harsher admiralty law in military courts presided over by Foreign agents just to extort money, laws are only written to extort money from people ,.   . there&#39;s no more war in this perfect wave dimension because people are educated and they don&#39;t need violence to make things happen BC war is unheard of &amp; they use intelligence. it&#39;s Utopia people are telepathic; where we break out of The Matrix or the soul cage were trapped in here on the Earth due to the chemtrail metals being dispersed into the air and further controlled by harrp, metal in the food &amp; water  ..and even the Utopia runners-up that aren&#39;t So Perfect aren&#39;t even that bad to exist in,not as bad as what we&#39;re in right now.  </p>

<p>Everything&#39;s on a loop I think, the aliens are us evolved, they say the universe is expanding.. ever seen an Infinity mirror?</p>

<p>Sorry I went off on a tangent but point is, They&#39;re making money all of them they&#39;re going to cashless currency. I think no matter if Hillary or Trump gets installed Obama&#39;s might come back and do a third term and finish up on the grounds of &quot;National Security&quot;</p>

<p>Regardless what they do they can do whatever they want but one day there will be truth and justice</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised about anything just stay vigilant</p>
