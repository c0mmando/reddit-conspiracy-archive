    <div class="md"><p>Seriously. One of my cousins is gay and he&#39;s all over the Hilary bandwagon (he believes trump is going to round people like him up and put them in camps like Hitler did to the Jew&#39;s). I brought up the pay for play emails, and the emails rigging the dnc. His response was that he didn&#39;t need to read them the FBI said there wasn&#39;t anything bad in them. (Even though the FBI said that what Clinton did was illegal they just aren&#39;t pursuing charges), and that Hilary is better than  Donald because she&#39;s been in politics for the last 30 years.. this is the typical Hilary voter. They&#39;ve been indoctrinated that trump is Hitler and wants to put everyone who is different in camps and rape our women. Not knowing they&#39;re voting for the very person who&#39;s going to do all that and more to everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not mad at all. </p>

<p>Wikileaks did not disappoint, released what documents they had, and saved the best for last. They showed the American people the true Hillary Clinton. </p>

<p>Unfortunately only so many people read Wikileaks, and the Clinton&#39;s launched an aggressive counter propaganda campaign that worked on a lot of people. </p>

<p>Much like the Snowden revelations it takes months or years for the people to wake up, and the masses are too sick, tired, and poor to really do anything about it. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll see what happens with the vote today, my guess is Wikileaks will suppress Democratic turnout and increase Trump turnout. </p>

<p>I know Wikileaks was a key factor in me voting 3rd party this year. So yeah I&#39;d say Wikileaks did exactly what they could given their resources and reach. </p>
