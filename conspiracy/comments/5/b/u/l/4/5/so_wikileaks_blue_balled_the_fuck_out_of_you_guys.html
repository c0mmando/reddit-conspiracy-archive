       Actually they dropped a lot of stuff that should have Clinton and her entire campaign in prison. It's just the average person never read the leaks and whenever it's brought up to them repeat the same things they've heard on CNN.

       Seriously. One of my cousins is gay and he's all over the Hilary bandwagon (he believes trump is going to round people like him up and put them in camps like Hitler did to the Jew's). I brought up the pay for play emails, and the emails rigging the dnc. His response was that he didn't need to read them the FBI said there wasn't anything bad in them. (Even though the FBI said that what Clinton did was illegal they just aren't pursuing charges), and that Hilary is better than  Donald because she's been in politics for the last 30 years.. this is the typical Hilary voter. They've been indoctrinated that trump is Hitler and wants to put everyone who is different in camps and rape our women. Not knowing they're voting for the very person who's going to do all that and more to everyone.

       Seriously, it's like they're allergic to the issues and facts. They'd rather just act like children who throw a fit when they don't get what they want. We're fucked as nation either way. But at least with Donald imo we're less fucked lol.

       They've had a lot of damning stuff. You're basically ignoring it until some mainstream media source acknowledges it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You aren't thinking for yourself, just taking cues from others or waiting for some sensationalist headline, like an email where Hillary says she eats babies. Instead you get emails where they acknowledge donations from Saudi Arabia while also acknowledging that they directly fund ISIL.

A list of journalists who are completely bought and paid for, in our "free" press?  Open discussions about rigged primary elections?  Discussions about the illegality of the way the Clinton Foundation operates?

       Literally anything can be ignored.  Play along with me.  First, you close your eyes reeaallly tight.  Next, you take your two fingers, and you stick them firmly in your earholes.  Finally, you turn away from the evidence, and loudly scream "NAH NAH NAH I CAN'T HEAR YOU CUZ EVIL RUSSHINS!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       This strategy is most effective if you anonymously receive large sums of money beforehand, or your career/ability-to-remain-alive prospects depend on how little you can see.

       Seriously, everything in there is circumstantial at best, with no clear link of any wrongdoing by Hillary. The way Assange was talking, I was expecting an email with a clear order or something straight from her email address that would be impossible to spin. Instead, we end up with wild leaps of logic.

       Between wikileaks, veritas, and the Clinton Foundation, there's enough dirt to put her away for the rest of her life.  Unfortunately, on the scales of the American court system, gold weighs more than justice.

       Not mad at all.

       Wikileaks did not disappoint, released what documents they had, and saved the best for last. They showed the American people the true Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately only so many people read Wikileaks, and the Clinton's launched an aggressive counter propaganda campaign that worked on a lot of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like the Snowden revelations it takes months or years for the people to wake up, and the masses are too sick, tired, and poor to really do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll see what happens with the vote today, my guess is Wikileaks will suppress Democratic turnout and increase Trump turnout.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know Wikileaks was a key factor in me voting 3rd party this year. So yeah I'd say Wikileaks did exactly what they could given their resources and reach.

       We must be living on a different timeline, because from where I'm at these leaks not only helped to expose HRC but has awoken people to a sick, dark and twisted shadow government. It banded people together to awaken, research, and expose.

       The amount of change I have seen in people because of this election is astounding, it has changed a lot of lives that will never be able to look back.
