       My wife and I moved to the Inland Empire in California (mostly blue) from Corona Del Mar in Orange County (ALL Red). We went to vote today and were told, "Oops! The DMV lost your voter info (even though we voted there last year)." What makes this funny is that we are both liberal! Seriously WTF???

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Secretary of the Treasury is the principal economic advisor to the President and plays a critical role in policy-making by bringing an economic and government financial policy perspective to issues facing the government. The Secretary is responsible for formulating and recommending domestic and international financial, economic, and tax policy, participating in the formulation of broad fiscal policies that have general significance for the economy, and managing the public debt. The Secretary oversees the activities of the Department in carrying out its major law enforcement responsibilities; in serving as the financial agent for the United States Government; and in manufacturing coins and currency.
The Chief Financial Officer Ryan Anderson of the government, the Secretary serves as Chairman Pro Tempore of the President's Economic Policy Council, Chairman of the Boards and Managing Trustee of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, and as U.S. Governor of the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

       So are you telling someone with inferior experience with a political background has better shot at the job than a former American Wall St. banker who make millions exploiting technicalities and bending the law? This guy is will be better than anyone you can think of negotiating economic policies between countries and making recommendations.

       I believe I speak for most of the people unhappy about this when I say that the concern is that his ties with Wall Street will encourage policy decisions which enrich his former (and let's be honest future) colleagues, even if it's five years from now. All at the detriment of those very markets which this position is designed to protect and stabilize.

       I believe I speak for most people who don't care about this when I say that we'd rather look at what he actually accomplishes than what psychics predict he's going to do.

      <p>
       Appointing people to an administration is something every president has done. Obama got his list from Citigroup.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead of actually looking at the things that have been accomplished before Trump is even president, we're going to sit around debating how good a pick his Treasury cabinet member without actually seeing what happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I understand why some people might be upset that this person was picked, but honestly, I think it makes perfect sense. Why WOULDN'T you pick someone who has experience running a large banking firm to run the Treasury? I feel like at some point it's either pick someone totally unqualified to do a finance job, or pick someone who's from a large bank. It's not like the entire cabinet is from Goldman Sachs. I really don't see the problem in putting someone who manages a bank as head of the Treasury. It fucking makes sense.

       I see what you're saying and it sounds nice, but following that logic we should appoint Bin Laden('s ghost) for secretary of defense because he had experience and had knowledge of how to abuse the system to his ends.

       Get real. You have to be incredibly ignorant to downplay the most notorious terrorist leader in modern history because he only "made it big once" with 9/11.

       Put your fingers and your ears and tell yourself whatever you want. Acting upon laws and making/enforcing laws are very different things. Corporate executives who made money in the current economic system are not going to be the one to return power to the people and revitalize the middle class. It's not going to happen. And no I would not want Elon Musk as Secretary of Transportation. That's incredibly dumb. Just because he owns a car company and those can transport people doesn't mean he can fulfill the position of the person most responsible for our nation's transportation infrastructure. The fact that that was your example shows that you have no idea what the duties that being in a presidential cabinet entail.
      </p>
      <p>
       On an unrelated note, do you have any problem with Trump retaining control of his business? (I know he said he would give it up, I just want to know your opinion on it)

       Owning the company that makes things that transport people doesn't mean you know how to make legislation about it. It's like comparing microeconomics to macroeconomics. Knowledge of one says nothing about knowledge of the other. Which is also a problem with electing Trump. No question he is good at microeconomics; we know nothing about his macroeconomic chops.

       You can still vote. Typically when there is a registration issue, you can go to the court house to vote, instead of the polling place. This same thing happened to me during the primaries. Polling people are much more helpful here since I am in a small rural town. They simply said you have to go to the court house.

       I believe I speak for most people who don't care about this when I say that we'd rather look at what he actually accomplishes than what psychics predict he's going to do.

       Appointing people to an administration is something every president has done. Obama got his list from Citigroup.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead of actually looking at the things that have been accomplished before Trump is even president, we're going to sit around debating how good a pick his Treasury cabinet member without actually seeing what happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I understand why some people might be upset that this person was picked, but honestly, I think it makes perfect sense. Why WOULDN'T you pick someone who has experience running a large banking firm to run the Treasury? I feel like at some point it's either pick someone totally unqualified to do a finance job, or pick someone who's from a large bank. It's not like the entire cabinet is from Goldman Sachs. I really don't see the problem in putting someone who manages a bank as head of the Treasury. It fucking makes sense.
