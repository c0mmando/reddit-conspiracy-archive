<ol>
<li><p>Hillary was being paid by goldman sachs for favors, she was GOING GO HELP GOLD MAN SACHS for money.</p></li>
<li><p>This man **<em>formerly worked for Goldman Sachs</em>&quot;* one top 4 investment banks in the world</p></li>
<li><p>This guy has better experience than any politician to handle the duties of Secretary of Treasury which include:   </p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The Secretary of the Treasury is the principal economic advisor to the President and plays a critical role in policy-making by bringing an economic and government financial policy perspective to issues facing the government. The Secretary is responsible for formulating and recommending domestic and international financial, economic, and tax policy, participating in the formulation of broad fiscal policies that have general significance for the economy, and managing the public debt. The Secretary oversees the activities of the Department in carrying out its major law enforcement responsibilities; in serving as the financial agent for the United States Government; and in manufacturing coins and currency.
The Chief Financial Officer Ryan Anderson of the government, the Secretary serves as Chairman Pro Tempore of the President&#39;s Economic Policy Council, Chairman of the Boards and Managing Trustee of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, and as U.S. Governor of the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So are you telling someone with inferior experience with a political background has better shot at the job than a former American Wall St. banker who make millions exploiting technicalities and bending the law? This guy is will be better than anyone you can think of negotiating economic policies between countries and making recommendations. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t you want someone like Elon Musk in charge of this &quot;Secretary of transport&quot;? </p>

<p>Appointing people to an administration is something every president has done. Obama got his list from Citigroup.  </p>

<p>But instead of actually looking at the things that have been accomplished before Trump is even president, we&#39;re going to sit around debating how good a pick his Treasury cabinet member without actually seeing what happens?</p>

<p>I mean I understand why some people might be upset that this person was picked, but honestly, I think it makes perfect sense. Why WOULDN&#39;T you pick someone who has experience running a large banking firm to run the Treasury? I feel like at some point it&#39;s either pick someone totally unqualified to do a finance job, or pick someone who&#39;s from a large bank. It&#39;s not like the entire cabinet is from Goldman Sachs. I really don&#39;t see the problem in putting someone who manages a bank as head of the Treasury. It fucking makes sense.</p>

<p>Get real. You have to be incredibly ignorant to downplay the most notorious terrorist leader in modern history because he only &quot;made it big once&quot; with 9/11. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militant_activity_of_Osama_bin_Laden">Not only is that statement objectively incorrect,</a> it&#39;s just bad logic altogether. That&#39;s like saying &quot;yeah, Hitler made it big with the Holocaust, <em>but what else has he done?</em>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Put your fingers and your ears and tell yourself whatever you want. Acting upon laws and making/enforcing laws are very different things. Corporate executives who made money in the current economic system are not going to be the one to return power to the people and revitalize the middle class. It&#39;s not going to happen. And no I would not want Elon Musk as Secretary of Transportation. That&#39;s incredibly dumb. Just because he owns a car company and those can transport people doesn&#39;t mean he can fulfill the position of the person most responsible for our nation&#39;s transportation infrastructure. The fact that that was your example shows that you have no idea what the duties that being in a presidential cabinet entail.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, do you have any problem with Trump retaining control of his business? (I know he said he would give it up, I just want to know your opinion on it)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe I speak for most people who don&#39;t care about this when I say that we&#39;d rather look at what he actually accomplishes than what psychics predict he&#39;s going to do. </p>

<p>Appointing people to an administration is something every president has done. Obama got his list from Citigroup.  </p>

<p>But instead of actually looking at the things that have been accomplished before Trump is even president, we&#39;re going to sit around debating how good a pick his Treasury cabinet member without actually seeing what happens?</p>

<p>I mean I understand why some people might be upset that this person was picked, but honestly, I think it makes perfect sense. Why WOULDN&#39;T you pick someone who has experience running a large banking firm to run the Treasury? I feel like at some point it&#39;s either pick someone totally unqualified to do a finance job, or pick someone who&#39;s from a large bank. It&#39;s not like the entire cabinet is from Goldman Sachs. I really don&#39;t see the problem in putting someone who manages a bank as head of the Treasury. It fucking makes sense.</p>
