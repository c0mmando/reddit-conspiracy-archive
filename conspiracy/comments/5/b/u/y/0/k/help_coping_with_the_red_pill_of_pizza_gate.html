    <div class="md"><p>Man, I&#39;m in college. I don&#39;t have kids, this is my first time &quot;voting&quot; for pres, and I&#39;ve always kind of had the underlying feeling that things are not as they say, but this shit is so messed up. You&#39;re not alone in feeling so lost in all of this. After all that I&#39;ve learned in the past two weeks, I am genuinely afraid of how the future is going to be. I&#39;m questioning absolutely everything. I don&#39;t know if The States are going to be war-torn wreckage in 10 years. I know I&#39;m rambling, but I guess I&#39;m just trying to say that the only way to cope with it is to remember that you aren&#39;t alone. There are others who feel the same disgust and fear, and it will reach a tipping point. I just hope I&#39;m around to see it.</p>

<p>I really appreciate the response, and knowing I&#39;m not alone is definitely a huge comfort. If it helps too, what gives me the most hope, is that I know there to be a goodness at play as well. Everyone on reddit and 4chan and the people that have spent their lives working on exposing things, Wikileaks opening a lot of eyes, the idea of conspiracy and gaining serious traction among the public, and (in a religious sense) the consensus being that love / good / enlightenment will emerge the victors when everything&#39;s said and done... As bleak as shit looks, there&#39;s a legit chance of the good guys actually winning if this effort keeps going, and I don&#39;t see anyone letting up anytime soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read about it for about 4 years now in my search for truth. I live through it day-by-day because I don&#39;t have any children, and am not in imminent danger. I consistently find ways to speak out to friends and relatives about this, to varying degrees of success. I am also trying to relate it to the &quot;balance&quot; that Eastern meditation/energy practices speak of that must be maintained for natural law to function. I think now that the perversion may be in the extreme, and will cause the need for a serious cosmic correction. In being mindful of the balance (for my soul), I can&#39;t say to just off these sickos. Although my western mindset says just get out the torches and pitchforks at first. </p>

If I&#39;m being honest, I know this is kinda hokey but I do think there is some legitimacy to the idea of a war on consciousness.

    <div class="md"><p>It concerns me very deeply. </p>

<p>The only way we will every know for sure if the allegations are true, is if a reliable leak makes it through a channel like Wikileaks. </p>

<p>Should something like that happen I think there very well could be an entire social meltdown... How is it that officials in the police, FBI, DOJ could keep something as massive as THAT as a secret until after an election?? How is it that the upper echelons of government and security could allow the public to vote for a pedophile directly or indirectly (through marriage) and possibly put them into the White House?? I truly believe the social unrest would be over the top.</p>

<p>I hope (and I think it is) Pizza-gate is just bullshit, because the ramification of it being real and the general public finding out about it will be earth shattering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t wanna share anything on here due to risk of this getting taken down, however for me, the most damning evidence is either the artwork in podestas home, the ties to George soros or the multitude of Instagram posts from the comet pizza guy. </p>

<p>If you wanna know more, or get everything in one place... Google, reddit and 4chan have a multitude of blogs and threads that have compiled evidence including extremely odd phrased pizza related emails, pedophilia symbols, underground tunnels, a supposed torture chamber, pedophilia art, pedophilia ish Instagram posts, a video of a weird ceremony at comet pizza, pictures of potentially missing children with the podestas, the police sketches, and on and on. </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually pretty ridiculous at this point, how much evidence there is corroborating this theory. More so than even most other widely accepted conspiracy theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get over it. You can only control your own life. I used to obsess over this shit but didn&#39;t see the point. I still keep up with it but don&#39;t care as much. I have kids. I know all I can do is protect and teach them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. I&#39;m not obsessed or anything, luckily I already did most of my rabbit hole diving before either of my kids were even born. But ya, just revisiting it again now with the pizza stuff and seeing the pictures on the comet Instagram and the artwork and everything is just hitting home much more this time around. Obviously it&#39;s out of my control, just hard to stomach I guess. But ya I&#39;m just gonna try and do as good as I can by them and focus on our lives primarily. It&#39;s just important to me I stay current with what may be coming our way politically, and this is becoming more and more relevant to it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They might be outed as non-human, and that will be what triggers full disclosure. Seeing these inhumane acts and events, people will react as expected, rioting, protesting, but once it&#39;s announced these ultra-elite DC damn fuckers are not human, the same people will be like, &quot;wait what the fuck do you mean non-human?&quot; </p>

<p>Then more truths will come out as to our space faring destiny.</p>
