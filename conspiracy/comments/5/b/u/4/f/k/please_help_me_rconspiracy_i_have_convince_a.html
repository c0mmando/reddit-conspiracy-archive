    <div class="md"><p>Insulting their preference is just going to turn them off.    Insisting on your preference is no better.</p>

<p>What you need to show them is the level of corruption that has been taking place and that it serves no one except for the entrenched powers to hold on to their place of power and greed.</p>

<p>In other words,  the only wedge you have is doubt in the truth of what they have been listening to on the issues.  In other words,  they have to gradually be exposed to the possibility that their sources are propaganda machines. The real issues include the fact that wikileaks has presented actual evidence that cannot be shown as fabricated,  and that it likely came from US insiders.    If your friends have been listening to or have loyalty to certain disinfo agents like Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper,  you are going to have to show some other credible sources.</p>

<p>Its an uphill battle.    Don&#39;t sweat it,  the main thing is to keep your cool and not get caught trying to lay out too steep of a hill,  where you look nuts.    Its just a matter of five or ten bullet points that would be relevant in front of someone sane,  like Jill Stein.    </p>

<p>Any civil process from here would have to be incremental and deliberative.    There is no instant solution.   Was there an instant solution to German attitudes towards Hitler at the end of WWII?    Good Germans were very comfortable with their heads in a hole,  and very uncomfortable pulling their heads out.</p>

Let them get used to the idea of hillary being slime in the more traditional sense, it will make the more fantastical (but to my mind the most damning and believable) claims easier to swallow.

I would link some but it is already available to you. She has been lying about shit for decades. Take your pick of info. Benghazi is a great starting point. She said that she was under sniper fire when she arrived and yet there is a video that completely obliterates that claim. She was hugging dignitaries and other ambassadors when she arrived.

    <div class="md"><p>The Facts</p>

<p>As a reporter who visited Bosnia soon after the December 1995 Dayton Peace agreement, I can attest that the physical risks were minimal during this period, particularly at a heavily fortified U.S. Air Force base, such as Tuzla. Contrary to the claims of Hillary Clinton and former Army secretary Togo West, Bosnia was not “too dangerous” a place for President Clinton to visit in early 1996. In fact, the first Clinton to visit the Tuzla Air Force base was not Hillary, but Bill, on Jan. 13, 1996.</p>

<p>Had Hillary Clinton’s plane come “under sniper fire” in March 1996, we would certainly have heard about it long before now. Numerous reporters, including The Washington Post’s John Pomfret, covered her trip. A review of nearly 100 news accounts of her visit shows that not a single newspaper or television station reported any security threat to the first lady. “As a former AP wire service hack, I can safely say that it would have been in my lead had anything like that happened,” said Pomfret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haiti is accessible.  It&#39;s not murder cover-ups, pedo, or occult &quot;weird&quot; stuff.  A simple Google search will show how the Clintons siphons <strong>billions</strong> of dollars to their friends and associates, while a very tiny fraction was for helping the Haitians.  Hell, their most &quot;successful&quot; venture was a sweatshop they built in an unaffected area, &quot;employed&quot; (enslaved) less than 10% of what it was supposed to, and pays no taxes to Haiti.  The icing on the cake?  The us govt then assisted the corporations in blocking a minimum wage increase from $3 a day to $5 a day.</p>

Another $151 billion worth of Pentagon brokered deals to 16 of these nations. In all, governments and corporations involved in the arms deals approved by Clinton’s State Department have delivered between $54 million and $141 million to the Clinton Foundation as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the Clinton family, according to foundation and State Department records.

    <div class="md"><p>You will never <em>convince</em> anybody of anything.  You have to give them information that will allow them to convince themselves.  For most blue-pill consumers, the types of information they will &quot;allow&quot; themselves to accept is very limited.  If you talk about murder coverups, their eyes will glaze over.  Talking about CIA mind control, occult, or pedo rings will cause them to immediately shut down any information you give them.</p>

<p>The trick is finding the right <em>type</em> of information that they&#39;re willing to accept, and presenting in in a way that allows them to process it themselves, without too much of your own (ranting) commentary.  It&#39;s slow going, and it won&#39;t fully win them over, but it&#39;s a nudge in the right direction, and it&#39;s all you can realistically expect.</p>

<p>This is why, when discussing Clintons&#39; vileness with folks, I don&#39;t dive into elaborate murder coverups, pedocculty stuff, and any of that.  Sure, I believe it&#39;s true, but I know that they&#39;ll never listen to a word of it.  But I&#39;ve used the available Haiti evidence to convince a few Hillary voters to change their minds.  They still hate Trump, for good reason, but now Jill Stein has a few more votes :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My two cents: You won&#39;t convince them that she is evil. Can&#39;t be done. Everything you&#39;ve listed up there won&#39;t be believed for a second. Yet.</p>

<p>Discussions of politics these days have become a competitive place. When we discuss &quot;politics,&quot; we are addressing choice--mainly because that is all the power that the average person has. We chose Candidate A or Candidate B, red or blue, pro- or anti-. If we care about more than one issue, then we weigh the stated positions accordingly. &quot;Well, Candidate B is on my side of 8/10 of the issues I care about, so I suppose I&#39;ll vote for B.&quot;</p>

<p>Rhetorically, public discourse has been backed into a corner. It isn&#39;t that we actually discuss the issues themselves, we discuss <em>conclusions</em> related to the issues. There&#39;s little going on that leads someone to reach a conclusion themselves, just defenses offered against those who claim my conclusion is wrong or inadequate. This sets up a dialectic that we see modeled on the news, in the debates, etc., so that any regular person who wants to be &quot;politically engaged&quot; has plenty of reference models to look to when determining how to behave. It&#39;s about defending your candidate and undercutting the other, not about working through claims based on their merits.</p>

<p>Some here are likely victims of this, too. There is defeatism in the form of &quot;if Hillary wins, then we lose.&quot; Or, &quot;There are absolutely no good reasons to vote for Hillary even if Trump is the worse candidate.&quot; What does it mean to win? To lose? For a reason to be good or bad? Suppose I vote Hillary because were she to lose that&#39;s likely the end of her in politics. Maybe she needs to stay in the spotlight, make a few more moves to cover her tracks, keep all the attention on her so when she makes a mistake she&#39;ll be noticed. </p>

<p>Maybe I vote Trump. Just as many of use believed that Obama might usher in a new era of sincerity in politics, it seems that there are many Trump supporters who view his possible election as a gloriously erect middle finger to the establishment. It likely will not be. There is but one Trump; there are hundreds in Congress, thousands in consequential positions within the Executive apparatus who would all need to be on board in rocking the very boat that is sailing them to a happy retirement. I would not be surprised if the RNC brass are sitting on a Trump-ending bombshell that they could use in the event that he strays too far from the master plan.</p>

<p>It&#39;s less about who you vote for, and more about how you talk about politics. Winning and losing a race, a policy proposal, etc., is just participating in a framing device that Washington insiders have been using for decades.</p>

<p>Ask you family what makes a good government? What makes a fair process? How much should the people be listened to by those they represent? Ask them if they were in charge of making changes to politics that might result in a more representative, responsive government, how would they proceed?</p>

<p>Instead of being told what they can have and then accepting that they need to chose from one of the two, they can have an honest conversation about what they feel the purpose of a governing body should be. It will then be easier to show them how, on so many levels, we fall short of these ideals. It&#39;s about getting those you love to begin to ask questions themselves, not to be fed yet another conclusion--whether it comes from you or from the MSM.</p>

<p>So many respond, &quot;So what? That&#39;s the way the game is played. If you don&#39;t want to see how the sausage is made, get the hell out of the kitchen.&quot; Does this mean there can only be one recipe?</p>

<p>If your family is math oriented or are gamers or something, I&#39;d take some time to maybe explain or set up some play scenarios to illustrate ranked choice voting. The purpose is for people to look at the process of decisionmaking, not just the outcomes. Does RCV appear to be more fair? What are the relative strengths and weaknesses between RCV and first-past-the-post? Take a critical look at the concrete steps that are used in getting a candidate in office. Then maybe point to the letter the League of Women Voters wrote when they were <a href="http://lwv.org/press-releases/league-refuses-help-perpetrate-fraud">bumped out of the debate process in 1988</a>.</p>

<p>Sit down like you&#39;re reading over the rules of a boardgame. Does this seem fair? Why or why not? How can it be better? What kinds of things would count as a win for a voting public? Are these the same conditions of victory that might motivate a candidate for office?</p>

<p>Once we can ask these questions, it may be a little easier to see that there are certain dirty tricks out there that a campaign might use to achieve their goals that may not necessarily be in line with what might be best for a constituency. The goal is to get people to admit that A) Politics is a game in which fighting dirty is almost imperative to get ahead, and B) Having a game which basically requires winners to cheat is probably not a very good game for those of us on the sidelines.</p>

<p>This probably won&#39;t make them change their minds (and will likely take you months to adequately explain without alienating them completely), but maybe by next cycle they&#39;ll have a different outlook. &quot;How has it come to pass that this is the decision I am faced with?&quot; is a much, much better question than &quot;Who do I vote for?&quot; Teach a man to fish and whatnot.</p>
