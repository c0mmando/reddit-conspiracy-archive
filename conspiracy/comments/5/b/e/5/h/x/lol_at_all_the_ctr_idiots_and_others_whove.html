    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, we have a good chunk of users who do this.  They are legitimately insane IMO.  I was harrassed for my karma.  Let me reiterate, in a board full of paranoids, they are too stupid to realize that the really paranoid, swap accounts often.</p>

<p>If you ever use someones karma or account age as &#39;proof&#39; of someone being a shill, you are likely a paranoid buffoon, which is much different than an intelligent paranoid.  An intelligent paranoid thinks critically and knows how damaging having one account can be.  A series of comments that can be swept over to study the subject in question.</p>

<p>If you have a facebook page with actual locations...You shouldn&#39;t be calling others shills.  If you have never used multiple proxies or Tor, you shouldn&#39;t be calling other shills.  And for fuck sake if your account has more than 20k comment karma, you REALLY shouldn&#39;t call others shills, since a lot of us who are truly paranoid, are also spiteful, and will have no problem going through every comment and releasing all information about you.  I would.  In a fucking heart beat.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying having 20k or any amount of karma is bad, but do you realize the small bits of information that can be collected inside your overview?   You may think it&#39;s nothing, but knowing &#39;oh I work with this type of glass&#39; - turns out only 5 places in US makes that glass.  &#39;Oh, my neighbor really has a southern accent, much more severe than the rest&#39; - now we&#39;ve narrowed it down to the southern US.  etc etc.  It&#39;s small comments that reveal everything.  My wife makes this mistake all the time.  Shares everything on FB, including when we aren&#39;t home.  &#39;Off to florida, see you in a month&#39; - (slaps head).</p>

<p>Hey check this out. <a href="/u/sovereignman">/u/sovereignman</a> straight up said that the mods think that shills have just as much of a &quot;right to an opinion&quot; as you or me or any other real person. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rules either exist for everyone, or no one at all.  There is no functional difference between an exception to a rule, and a violation of it.</p>

<p>If I may speak freely, then the shills must.  If the shills can not, then it becomes possible for someone else to deny me the ability, if only by calling me a shill.  The American government first only spoke of terrorists as foreigners; but then the term &quot;domestic terrorist,&quot; slowly came into use, as did the mischaracterisation of militia groups and other people as such.  So a person on American soil can now be accused of being a terrorist just as arbitrarily as anyone overseas.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t how it starts.  They rely on your xenophobia and your sense of your own exceptionalism.  They say that only the foreigners will be called terrorists, and subjected to torture and the denial of due process.  Then, however, once the use of the word terrorist and what it implies have been widely accepted, it starts being used among the people who were initially promised, that it never would be.  Fascism knows no restraint, and it has no point of sustainable equilibrium.  It is an insatiable, psychopathic beast that consumes everything around itself before ultimately committing suicide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, this is the only sub I&#39;ve been in, where I am inclined to speak in defense of both the moderation staff and the rules.</p>

<p>I was a genuine anarchist when I was younger, but four years on 4chan cured me of that; as did observation of the Left&#39;s behaviour here.  These days, my attitude is closer to what I tend to refer to as rattlesnake Libertarianism.</p>

<p>That means there are rules.  There are <strong><em>very few</em></strong> rules, and the rules that exist are only those where the rationale for such is clearly and explicitly understood; but there are still rules.  Something I&#39;ve come to understand in the last few years, is that the only substance that physical reality actually has, is boundary lines around otherwise empty space.  This might seem to reinforce the Left&#39;s position that nothing is true and everything revolves around shades of grey; but ironically, it works equally well as support for absolutism.  The Left emphasise the empty space; the Right emphasise the lines.</p>

<p>People here recognize that criticizing Clinton doesn&#39;t make you a Trump supporter. They should be able realize that criticizing the deficiencies (factual or logical) of their critique of Clinton doesn&#39;t make us Clinton supporters.</p>

<p>Oh, and CTR is an actual organization that paid a social media team to combat what they claim are lies about Hillary Clinton on social media. Their budget for this election cycle was about 6 million dollars according to opensecrets.org</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it is a substantial chunk of the user base of this sub that has exposed themselves for the &quot;idiots they are&quot; this election. Breitbart and their ilk have shown with their consistent and deliberate misrepresentation how easily manipulable the modern conspiracy movement is. The constant upvotes for headlines which are non supported in the article but agree with your preconceived notions is a shining example of how the conspiracy movement has made its final fall from the concept of journalism into a circle jerk echo chamber.</p>

<p>There are some people here that have an ounce of skepticism and will actually read an article and question it&#39;s authenticity, and it seems like they&#39;ve been getting their voice heard a little more here recently. I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re the ones you think are idiots paid by those foul people at &quot;fact checking&quot; websites who demand &quot;evidence&quot; and know how &quot;burden of proof&quot; works.</p>
