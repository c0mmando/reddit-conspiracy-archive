       There are four emails that have been released referencing "expenses" for the Waverly group. All this is back in 2008. But they seem to still be in operation as of 2016 if you google the various names and locations you find as you go.

        Everyone that works for the company
       </a>
       is listed as having top secret security clearances and everyone appears to have extensive military backgrounds but is working for some vague business consulting that seems like a transparent front for arranging shady deals between defense contractors and the Clinton campaign and CGI and CF.
      </p>
      <p>
       There also seems to be a relationship between the people running that business and

       which does business in Qatar, India, and Dubai, and has private business areas separate from the main dining area.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this is easily searchable on google and evident from the wikileaks excerpts and they have clearly been doing brisk business for the last eight years but as far as I can tell I'm the first person calling it out on the internet as a shell company for something.

       Can anyone help confirm any of this is as shady as it looks? Has anyone heard theories about this group before?

       And how does such a small company get the funding and permits to open restaurants in such diverse locations?  The logistics aren't realistic.  We're just now getting Chick Fil A's in Washington state after all these years.

       The disbursments are basically in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year but the group is listed on multiple corp indexes as having an annual revenue of less than $500,000 and has hired a slew of major league ex defense people that they are ostensibly paying. I don't see how their finances make any sense.

       That's possible, but then it's also possible that your post is disinfo.  No disrespect, but we have no way of knowing.  We all research different paths and hopefully the one who finds something will share it with the rest of the web sleuths.

       My post is not disinformation.  But then again I'm just talking about other posts which might be. Garbage in, garbage out. But something somewhere doesn't smell right. One thing I do know is that a good way to combat a leak is to produce other bogus versions to generate uncertainty.  Then the original correct one is doubted.
