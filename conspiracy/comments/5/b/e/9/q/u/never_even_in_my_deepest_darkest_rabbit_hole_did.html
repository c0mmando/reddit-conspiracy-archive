       Jesus Christ! there are dozens of high profile cases that leave zero doubt about pedo rings around the world. This Sub had a user that used to make some amazing research Posts on the undeniable evidence showing these Pedo rings exist in plain sight. I would feel ill for days reading his posts. Does anyone remember the OP name?

       I am returning to jesus because of this. I don't believe and have no faith but our government is a satanist pedocult. Like, really? I was driving and Jay-Z (involved with spirit cooking lady) comes on the radio and I switch stations, then it's Katy Perry(said she sold her soul to get fame) and she is singing some SJW bullshit and I change that station. Then an ad comes on telling me to get out the vote on iheartradio. Turns out after some digging that company is a backer of Clinton. I just said fuck it and found some Jesus music. This is all so fucked. I am probably wrong and there probably is a God. I guess I was brainwashed into thinking there is no God. I'm just going to assume I am wrong for a while and even if I ain't and there is no god it's still better than being influenced by them.

       Good for you. And you don't necessarily have to adhere to Jesus, just know that there is a higher purpose to all things, especially our life here. TPTB want you to believe there isn't, so that they can replaced your forgotten God with their own. And theirs ain't pretty.

       Man let me tell you,  God is all you need! All Christianity is,  is people who realize this world is evil and going to be destroyed. That's what we get saved from! With promise of a new government set up directly by the creator himself

       Well there is a perspective problem in what you call waiting. The Bible teaches that this world will have to fall away because it is corrupt. The Bible never days to lie down and die but rather die for it. In the end the victory is ours by God. This stuff is real so you will see it unfold

       Catholicism is not christianity...read the bible..catholism is pagan rituals mixed with elements of christianity...which means its not christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rome was losing followers of paganism when christianity came along....so they converted worshipping multiple gods for everything ( like the god of water, the god of love, the god of fire) to calling them saint....and catholocism was born.  Now its the saint of water..patron saint of fire..etc.   Also they continued the worship of samiramus (nimrods wife from the tower of babel) and made samiramus into mary....who was not immortal or special...a normal sinner that God used to fulfill scriptures.

       It makes no sense if you want to be a Christian to go to Catholic service.
      </p>
      <p>
       Better read your bible ( at least the gospels and the nt) and read acts and find a church that is non denomenational and look like acts.  If you cant find one nearby i can share you great sermons online till u find one.

       The Greek Orthodox Church (aka early Catholic Church) compiled and canonized the first Bible in the first place. They literally picked and chose which books would make it in the Bible. Catholicism and Greek Orthodoxy were the only forms of Christianity up until the 1600s, nothing Christian existed outside those churches until Protestant reformation which was only a couple hundred years ago. The "Bible Believing" movement makes no sense because you are using a book to condemn the people who made it. You are basically implying that for the first 1500 years of Christianity they were all doing it wrong! Which contradicts the prophecies in the book of revelations that foretells the church falling further and further away from God. Makes no sense. The non denominational church movement didn't even exist till the 1800s! After the Protestant reformation Christianity in all forms was still steeped in rituals and catholic traditions (formal confession of sins thru a priest in order to be forgiven, praying to Mary) for a long time.

       That's not wrong, but it's not like modern Christianity (Protestantism) has a direct line back to the God-man himself either.

       Thank you, I was aware of catholic roots in paganism. I was born a catholic and now choose to follow this religion for exactly that reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give a criminally small summary of the two - Christianity is a belief in a benevolent God. Paganism is the worshipping of nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are two messages I believe in and will gladly use as values to guide my life. I do believe that God and nature are intermingled.

       Do you have any research you could point me to that would show when Occultism started separating into factions? Or is Occultism a faction of something bigger?

       I invite you to check out what the Bible says in revelations. For 2000 years the Bible has talked about a one world government and it would be headed by an antichrist who is under Satan's control. Talks about a cashless society with the mark of the beast,  but the worst part is that it talks about a tribulation period after the church is raptured out. It's no coincidence,  the Bible is right! About everything!

       Please dont get angry at flat earthers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long ago i found flat earth society website and went looking around. They had a chat feature so i started chatting. I went in assuming i would teach them something but instead i was faced with a lot of inconvenient facts and  unanswerable questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of getting mad at a flat earther, just change it around and ask yourself, why do some people believe the earth is flat? Try to find and understand the underlying model that flat earthers think upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically to understand a flat earther, you have to become a flat earther, and by that i mean that you have to have a robust, working model in your mind, similar to how you conceptualize a ball earth, solar system, milky way galaxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to say you have to remain a flat earther. I can go between the two models at will and argue from either side of the debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it is important to be able to conceptualize alternative models. For example we are all taught the Bohr model of the atom, even though later they admit the Bohr model is wrong but they teach it anyway because kids are too stupid to understand the correct model, whatever that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, learning to think in both models is as important as learning to add as well as subtract, learning to multiply as well as divide.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two models are different sides of the same coin, so to speak. You are missing out on a mind-blowing experience to have these two conflicting modelscco-exist within your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just youtube flat earth and start watching videos. Theres endless content. Dont seek to debunk flat earth, instead seek to understand flat earth, and thereby also understand flat earthers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spend a lot of time learning a lot of interesting things online,  and id say flat earth was worth my time and is worth your time.

       Thing is, if you understand the spherical model and the implications, flat earth is completely excluded and can not be accepted as even remotely probable. Unless you start defying logic.

       Depends on your models.  If your flat earth model is that everything you see around you is a fabrication, like the matrix then you could find a narrative where the real world indeed flat.  I dont believe this obviously, but my point is that they dont have to be contradictory.

       I've been to both hemispheres, have seen the different skies (southern cross that is never to be found in the north) myself. I have also experienced longer days on southern hemisphere during winter time in the north, which none of the FE models explain. I also haven't come upon a sound explanation of the coriolis effect having comparative 'strength' on both hemispheres.

       And that's a simulation, not the truth.  A Flat Earther could claim to have red-pilled to the real world, and thus experienced the flat earth first hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me reiterate:  I'm not advocating or debating about flat earth theories or that they are sensible at all.  I'm discussing logical consistency in narratives.

       It's pretty much everything. It's all rotten. Inverted. The medical mafia, for example, doesn't exist to make you well; it exists to profit from your sickness. And it's intricately woven in to the government, media, and education.

       what is being exposed with the clintons goes all across governments and the elite, rich and famous. But the level, or the levels, above is where the true power resides, with people like soros and the Rothschilds... the globalists.

       It's the 1980s all over again. The elites did a great job covering it up back then, making it look like one of those "crazy" conspiracy theories, but this time it looks like they won't be getting away with it.

       There was a great write up about how the movie Sucker Punch is about one of Their brainwashing/sex factories. 
The harsh editing apparently removed scenes that would have explained that more clearly.

       She's literally a High Priestess, or similar equivalent.  She practices Thelema. When you get into the specifics of Luciferian sex magick/Thelema and some of the rituals they're known to do... think of the most appalling and utterly debased acts you can think of and triple them.  Include sacrificing and eating children, bathing in blood, and raping them.  The Bushes, the Clintons, the Royal Family, anyone of real significance pretty much gets down with this sort of stuff.  Far more than you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are not people, not in the sense of morals and in some instances maybe not even genetics.  They literally exist to be everything that we are not, that is their "purpose".  Every act is a mockery of "God" and "his Creation".

       Ha, wouldn't surprise me.  Most medical pros have said that she probably is suffering from vascular dementia at the very least.  Cannibalism of infants is known in Thelema rituals though.  Their handbooks are very hard to come by but some people have gotten them and shared some of their info.  Pretty sick stuff.

       The Royal Families and Venetian/Black Nobility of Europe, particularly Belgium, Denmark, Britain for starters.  Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Morgans, DuPonts and other "bloodline" families.  Queen Elizabeth, The Vatican/Pope and especially the Superior General of the Jesuit Order are also pretty high up.  The true rulers are secret, and many argue, "not of this world".

       <em>
        they
       </em>
       believe it.  And considering they control the modern world it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not, because of their actions in service of it affect your life.  And considering these are the richest and most powerful people on the planet and yet they still believe in this crazy shit, you could probably infer that they might know something we don't.  Despite the fact that we live in a three-dimensional world there are things that go on beyond our sight and comprehension on the spiritual plane that we don't understand.  That's why individuals like these people thirst and are obsessed with "secret" knowledge, that's why they go into secret societies.  You can go back to your sippy cup and coloring book now that we've covered basic reading comprehension.

       Considering Middleton is a Rothschild and the background of Prince William being the future head of the Windsors/Saxe-Coburgs, who are essentially at the very center of it all, the likelihood is leaning towards yes.

       What blows my mind is that they have basically an unlimited amount of money, wouldn't you think at some point they'd spend a shitload of money to investigate the afterlife? What if they found out that there's absolutely nothing after death and that's why they feel like they're gods. They know that this life doesn't matter, it was a fluke, so might as well do whatever the fuck they want with no consequences.

       The afterlife scares them as does karma, which is why they have to "tell" us what they're going to do ahead of time hence all the 9/11 stuff years in advance that was hidden in plain sight. They're more concerned with staying alive forever, so they don't have to face the terrible music they're facing after death.

       Did you miss something? There is nothing new and I guarantee they will kill people and they will shut down all investigations. That is what always happens and no good people from MI6, CIA or FBI will ever win because they are all infiltrated with the occultists. After the election everybody will forget about it and new people will be again be astonished about such things even mentioned as if they do not exist. Cruel world.

       Whether they know it or not.  It all started at the tower of babel....funny enough...the united nations logo celebrates the tower of babel and the 666th seat in on of the eus parliment building was always empty...think about that...google it.

       Arabs are jerks to chicks and the Arab book Koran says Jesus was a jerk to chicks one book says he's good other says he's bad who knows but Arabs are jerks to chicks. Why are the sexes unequal treated in Christianity chicks can't be priests or popes why would god do that?  We don't know shit about Jesus Christian sources are all from one book written hundreds of years after Christ what about the pillar of salt story example there of lot being jerk to chicks under the lords instruction their is many more. 4 Where did god come from ? He was always there ?   again something from nothing 2, 3 is a work in progress you cant have all the answers Christianity is a tool to control the masses that is all to console and comfort loss i wish it was true i really do but there is no evidence for it stop being played enjoy your life here cause its all you get

       The koran is invalidated because because it does not have as much evidence supporting it as the bible.  It was written 700 years after muhammed...compared to the nt all being written and available within 65 years after jesus death.  Also muhammeds bones were found...meaning he was a human.  Jesus body was never found and historically he appeared to his followers and up to 500 after his death...meaning he resurrected and was God.  Call up your closest university..find an atheist scholar ( someone with a phd ) of the new testament and ask them about paul and the authenticity of the nt and the pauline books.  Ask them to compare it to other historical documents...them come back to me

       You are in error because u dont know much about the bible.  Why did you think the nt was written hundreds of years after?

       Jesus rose from the dead...appeared to 500+ people...then told his followers to spread the word because he fulfilled all the scriptures...then went to heaven.

       I am wasting my time.  I can provide sources if anyone is serious...but call your local atheist new testament phd scholar and ask them.  Just ask in your local university's religious studies dept.  Make sure he/she is an atheist though, cuz im not looking for suspected bias.

       Heres how i explain Satanism to people...
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask them, do you see a lot of churches around?
      </p>
      <p>
       They reply yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask, do you think some of the people in those churches are sincere?
      </p>
      <p>
       They reply yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask, do you think some people practice Satanism?
      </p>
      <p>
       They reply yes.

      <p>
       I ask, do you think some of those people are sincere?
      </p>
      <p>
       They reply yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what im saying is that just because you dont take Satanism seriously doesnt mean Satanists dont take Satanism seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you are an atheist doesn't mean Satanists dont exist.

       I love how words get hijacked. Fine. I mean gender as the sexual classification of male and female. In humans, XX=Female XY=Male. Two becoming one (sexual reproduction) in flesh to create life.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are rare (very rare. Like almost never happening and if so they are sterile so they can't reproduce) exceptions in nature. No matter who cooks the food in whatever culture, the man is the father and the woman wants a good man to be the father and take care of his kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satanists/Illuminati/powerhungry-idiots want all good to be confused or hidden or outright demonized (you got married then had kids? How archaic!) so there bullshit can be pushed on weak minded ignorant people.

       I think I must be an autist because I haven't felt
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of those emotions except for maybe anticipation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been in this since, oh, 2006?  I mean I got angry when I saw the videos of the riots in Toronto for the G20 event a few years back, and how that one cop said "You have no rights".  Yeah, that made me see red.  Thankfully he got reprimanded.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really, that's been my emotional high during my time as a "truther", conspiracy nutter, whatever.  So now I don't keep up with police abuse and brutality because I get uncontrollably angry.  Everything else?  I pretty much
       <em>
        expect
       </em>
       it.

       Of course the label "Conspiracy Theorist" was coined by the CIA to shed discredability on anything said that might prove the "Elite" are into suspect situations.  So the "Theorists" aren't necessarily coming from left field as they would like the masses to believe. That is just a psyop to lump together accusations that they do not wish to answer to.  Since FOIA and the Internet have proven so many times that there are devious motives and cover-ups involving so many recognizable politicians, businessmen, and so called "Elites", the issue becomes informing the public without sounding "too crazy". Even though the evidence largely can be found easily, it is not easy to sell truth to those who wish to think our "higher-ups and power-players" would never be involved in such filth. Unfortunately, they are.

       Why didnt you think this?   What do you think the ancient greeks, romans, babylonians and egyptians were?   Good and evil actually exist.   There js a universal law and law giver.  Hia name is God...and yes its the christian God....Jesus was real and really rose from the dead.  These occultists are nothing new....but what are you going to do about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was Kennedy and lincoln killed.   Both were growing powerful w. Personal flaws...but were just about to expose the occultists and reveal the shadow government...the hidden hand that follows Satans ways to control people.

       There's nothing in the Bible that condones pedophilia as being sanctioned by God, guaranteed. However the stories told in the Bible are all about humans with various flaws, who sometimes obey God and sometimes do not. So if one of them (or all of them) happened to practice this or that behavior, it doesn't automatically mean it's a reflection of God's rules.
      </p>

       As far as the clergy goes, the Roman Catholic Church is control grid. The Roman state made every effort to extinguish Christianity and failed, and after enough failure, took another approach, which was to co-opt Christianity and call itself the church. That's the story of the Roman Catholic Church, the same guys who sanctioned things like the Inquisition and the Crusades

       The afterlife scares them as does karma, which is why they have to "tell" us what they're going to do ahead of time hence all the 9/11 stuff years in advance that was hidden in plain sight. They're more concerned with staying alive forever, so they don't have to face the terrible music they're facing after death.

       Well there is a perspective problem in what you call waiting. The Bible teaches that this world will have to fall away because it is corrupt. The Bible never days to lie down and die but rather die for it. In the end the victory is ours by God. This stuff is real so you will see it unfold
