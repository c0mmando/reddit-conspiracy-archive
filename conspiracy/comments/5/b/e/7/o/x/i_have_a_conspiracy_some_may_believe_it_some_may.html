       From the "suspect" facebook:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hi All, Not sure if you saw the news today, but I was beat up at a Trump rally for holding a sign and falsely accused of having a gun. I am ok and have been released.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have NO connection with the Clinton campaign apart from me supporting her HOPE over Trump's HATE. I have canvassed for her for about 3 hours, have contributed to her campaign, and voted for her. Though I do not agree with many of Hillary's policies, we cannot allow a fascist/dictator to take our beloved freedoms to simply boost his ego and "get back" at anyone who disagrees. Take what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incitement of violence - against your own Republican brother with a stupid sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a Republican and cannot support Trump and his decisive rhetoric. This election cycle we all know what we need to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       PLEASE STAND UP WITH ME AND VOTE TO STOP TRUMP!
      </p>

       I think that it will be used for political gain, as it should be. And it was fake, but not by Trump, it was faked by the Hillary team, in fact the guy who did it already deleted his Facebook when people started calling him out as being named in the wikileaks emails. He is part of the opposition team, just like the guy chanting about Jews, just like the "Donald ducks" and violence at rallies, the Hillary team is behind it.

       He didn't purchase 1500 copies, he purchased ONE copy and his name appears on a list of 1500 that are being sent out all over the US. Small publishers print and sell in batches like that.
