       I've been in contact for almost 20 years with people close to these missions and I haven't seen mixed messages like this before.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is my understanding that the election is to blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a concerted effort to suppress stratospheric aerosols until after the November 8 election. But I am getting reports it will continue in earnest tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maryland, Virginia, Southern Utah, Nevada, Northern Florida, Pennsylvania/New York/New Jersey, Idaho, Michigan, Ohio and parts of Arizona and California are in the crosshairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are chemtrails on Monday, it signals the beginning of a new spray schedule to overtake the current intermittent aerosol dispersal and we can expect an uptick in Stratospheric Aerosol Injection for the next 3 months in the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be aware of crisscross trails, the ones that look like an X.
      </p>
      <p>
       By all reports, we should see a clear day for tomorrow (Sunday), but I would ask for reports from you to let me know what you're seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, my contacts are providing mixed messages about the spray schedules for the next 48 hours. Two have suggested this may indicate an alteration of the chemical composition the planes are deploying.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would not be ideal - and could signal a significant mission modification.

       Yesterday was a nice, clear day in MI.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trails started appearing midday, and by late afternoon the clear sky was gone and covered with a gray haze.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a kid I spent my summers outside, many days staring at the sky. Back then airplanes didn't leave permanent trails.

       Thank you. I took a lot of pics this morning (since I had that extra hour &amp; all. lol). I don't typically pay that much attention to trails, but I noticed some very interesting things as I'm in the pattern of a major airport. It looked to me, and I know nothing of these things, that we had very unusual commercial flight patterns today.
      </p>

       Idk if that means anything to you, but it did seem a bit off from what I'm used to seeing.

       The composition of the chemicals vary from location to location, but mostly the visual indicators are intended to lull the public into a state of malaise and disregard, so that no matter what is being sprayed, it's normal and there is nothing to fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "normal" mission is to inject disruptive materials into the biosphere. When this is consistent, it is ignored.

        article
       </a>
       is a good starting point, as it's NASA admitting Lithium is one of the ingredients being sprayed, but it's totally "harmless to the environment," so no biggie. There are several links within the article to supporting documentation as well as the NASA statement on video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nutshell is there's a variety of
       <del>
        toxic
       </del>
       harmless concoctions being sprayed globally, under the guise of geoengineering/weather modification, so we should ignore the patterns in the sky. We should also ignore that a lot of people have physical reactions that mimic allergies to flu-like symptoms to significant respiratory distress.

       That's what we've seen, in addition to confusion or "mental fog". Humans tend to agree with clean air, fresh water and a nutritious diet, as opposed to foreign/artificial compounds. I'm also concerned about wildlife and vegetation.

       Heavy spraying started last night in Phoenix around 10p. The sky was already that hazy barely blue just after sunrise. Spraying began again around noon. It was odd patterning as there were standard X marks, some double and triple straight lines, and then there were some short, stand-alone straight lines and all seemed to have designated "sections." The stand-alone lines were at a noticeably lower altitude than the others, but not the lowest I've seen over the last 14-21 days.

       While we are on this subject, lets talk about means of dispersal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is my theory that there is an additive added to the fuel, which creates the chemtrails we see in the sky, from most commercial aircraft. This would be the easiest method, and also very easy to implement and keep under wraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe there are aircraft designated for this role specifically, that have more advanced equipment to "spray".

       I also believe this is a fuel additive. I wish I had more information to offer other than this is also a personal theory of mine.

       You're welcome. It won't take long to pass terrifying and reach pissed. If you do a search for chemtrails on their search bar, it'll bring up additional articles and even more links. Happy reading.
