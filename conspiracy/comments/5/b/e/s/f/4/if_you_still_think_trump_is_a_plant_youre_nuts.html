       Come on man....you have to at least consider that he is controlled by TPTB...If Trump wins and things really do start to turn around for the people, great...but don't hold your breath. Obama preached "change" too...and look where that got us.

       Bill Clinton also took 26 rides on Epstiens jet and 5 of those times were without his secret service detail. Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite for preaching support for minority, women and homosexual rights but then she accepts money from Syria and Saudi Arabia where it is written into their laws that those groups previously mentioned are to be treated like dirt. Often times raped and killed.

       And no, he isn't a friend of Bill's or Epstein's. Look at what he said about Bill during this campaign. He embarrassed and exposed him. But yes Bill and Epstein are besties.

       Are you aware trump was prochoice and for universal health care when he was a democrat before 2010 ? 
In 2009 he donated to the Clinton foundation upwards of 101k. In 2007 he donated to her campaign and spoke extremely highly of her saying she was a great women.
In 1999 the Clinton and gore administration was interested in trump running third party. And a week before trump announced running bill Clinton called Donald trump right after hillary clinton announced she was running, and it was said bill Clinton was upbeat and encouraging trump to run.
Chelsea Clinton and Ivanka trump are best friends and both trump and Clinton have business addresses in the same building for tax evasion. Plus the hundreds of photos they have of them at fundraisers and some that the national archives are not releasing even though there is a foia request.

       No one is nuts for being skeptical, especially in today's climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump may very well be for the people, and I certainly hope he is, but that's also the exact type of mentality and fervent support TPTB have manipulated entire countries into many times before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, to his credit, does seem to be exposing certain things that if I were TPTB, I wouldn't want him saying, but maybe that's their tactic? Get the person we all know is corrupt indicted and put an anti establishment "savior" esque person in their place to give the population the illusion of a victory? Wouldn't be the first time methods like that were used.

       Anyway, like I said, I hope he's legit. But part of me also thinks it's impossible to be this high up and influential and still be legit, given how powerful TPTB has proven time and time again to be. I'm certainly hopeful, and MUCH prefer Trump over Hillary, but will remain cautious either way.

       I support Trump primarily because he represents the best chance to defeat the corruption in Washington, but I'm fully prepared for the possibility that it's all a sham and we're being led on a wild goose chase.
      </p>
      <p>
       I simply believe supporting Trump is the most logical option given our choices.

       I agree. I'm still voting for him on Tuesday, I just thought it was a bit of a stretch for OP to call skeptics nuts. There is always hella reason to be skeptical, on both sides. Especially in an election as batshit as this one.

       Neither Trump nor Clinton is acceptable in any way. One could draw the conclusion that the U.S. are pretty screwed. And you have been for decades. So are we in Germany. That’s all. Discussing Clinton vs. Trump IMHO means ignoring this simple truth.

       I'm not brainwashed. Willfully helpless, perhaps. I'm unwilling to go to jail for my beliefs. We (in the know, if you will) are proof the veil can be pierced. We see through the bs. There's no excuse for my neighbor, gf, mother, or co-workers except willful ignorance. To that degree America does indeed have the governments it deserves.

       He did a great job explaining the population media corruption,  trade deficit etc., but overall I find his thinking very peculiar; climate denying, low tax trickle down economy,  extending health coverage by allowing insurance companies to cross state borders- those are all idiotic ideas that will never work, and he, being a smart person,  knows it as well, so what is his game is unclear.Might as well be connected to fossil fuels industry.

       Thats the question ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean did someone sell Trump Pence. "Oh this guy is awsome look how well he made Indiana's economy go. oh and he's got a perfect family to counter act your cluster fuck. He's a Christian with wholesome values and Christians are one of the largest bases in the country he can really help get those votes. Plus you're so polarizing so amazing Donald that his calmness will help balance out the dish"

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Or they could have done it more subtle "here Donald files on a bunch of potential running mates if you want info on anyone let me know"
      </p>
      <p>
       Or did Trump find Pence on his own?
or do they have History?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Trump and Pence are the Relegious Plants. Its all a game just have to figure out the players.
I mean Trump in his speech announcing Mike Pence had a long tangent on relegion meniong a Lyndon B Johnson ruling hed change. Tax Exempt status...etc
      </p>
      <p>
       But watching him talk. I feel like he legit just studied everyone and based it on who he thinks was best for the job. I guess Indiana must have done really good as a state can any americans verify the status of Indiana right now comparative to other states? Edit: nevermind trump just started talking about what he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I def know why he picked Pence. Pence pretty much achieved Donalds Platform. Cut taxes, Create Jobs, Balance the Budget. Invest in Education, Infastructure, Veterans...etc Pence impressive achievements

       I have the same feeling. Either HRC or Trump's vp will take control and somehow be worse than anyone could have imagined the candidates them self could have been. I have a suspicion Pence or Kaine is ultra nationalist and will bring fascism or neo-fascism full swing in this country.
