The only thing that remains the same is my morality, but I can&#39;t figure out what to personally support anymore because I can&#39;t tell what has been manufactured, and what is truth. I have become paralyzed and can&#39;t act upon my morality, because idk what is harmful, and what is helpful. I guess I need some guidance on this dilemma from those of you who are more awakened than the rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is any of it real? I mean, look at this. Look at it! A world built on fantasy. Synthetic emotions in the form of pills. Psychological warfare in the form of advertising. Mind-altering chemicals in the form of... food! Brainwashing seminars in the form of media. Controlled isolated bubbles in the form of social networks. Real? You want to talk about reality? We haven&#39;t lived in anything remotely close to it since the turn of the century. We turned it off, took out the batteries, snacked on a bag of GMOs while we tossed the remnants in the ever-expanding Dumpster of the human condition. We live in branded houses trademarked by corporations built on bipolar numbers jumping up and down on digital displays, hypnotizing us into the biggest slumber mankind has ever seen. You have to dig pretty deep, kiddo, before you can find anything real. We live in a kingdom of bullshit. A kingdom you&#39;ve lived in for far too long. So don&#39;t tell me about not being real. I&#39;m no less real than the fucking beef patty in your Big Mac.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cant say im more awakened or anything but ive been in the tin foil hat world for ten years now. My advice is to act locally for what you believe to be right. Support a local church, or farm co-op, or charity. Something you are into. The heaviness of the global power struggle is a tough burden to put on yourself, and you can do very little about it unless youre rich or powerful. What you can do is act for your family or community and not give up your morality even when you see the illusion of it stripped from the elite. Good luck brother. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe your intuition. It&#39;s your morality speaking to you through your senses. Make a habit of analyzing what your gut is telling you versus your ego. Your ego uses your senses to protect itself not you and your morality uses your senses to protect your true self. </p>

<p>Basically if you don&#39;t feel right doing something because of how others would view you if they found out, that&#39;s your ego. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t feel good about something because you feel it would harm another then that&#39;s your morality.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t really help with how your journey will affect your personal life but learning to discern between the ego and the morality in you will help your inner life tremendously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Belief and hope hmmm its ok to believe in something  and hope its true but don&#39;t hang on to tight to belief be prepared to discover its all bullshit and move on analyse your beliefs be very critical each time you find you have been duped move on your one step closer to the truth. Hang on to your morality belief can strip it away never loose your compassion . look at those who are doing this or believing that examine them if they that will tell you what harmful, but the truth harmful it will isolate you . Only ignorant people are content and at ease in my experience but they will be the death of this world.  Keep asking questions and go down swinging. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t take everything so seriously. It&#39;s good to be awake but at some point you hit a wall. For example, I know what I know but until the masses are ready to change things I just take life for what it is. Maybe try some yoga/meditation. I personally enjoy zen/Buddhist teachings as well to kind of remind me that we are all part of this massive consciousness in motion and that the whole world isn&#39;t on your shoulders alone. If you use your intuition you&#39;ll have a good chance of finding what you need to find, and that&#39;s what has gotten you to this point right?</p>

<p>I always try to remind myself that everything we see and are told is what&#39;s being shown on the stage, there&#39;s an entirely different production behind the curtain. Analyze what is broadcasted by asking yourself what it is distracting you from. What does the MSM want you to believe / feel? And why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Refamiliarize yourself with critical thinking tools:  <a href="http://www.logicalfallacies.info/">http://www.logicalfallacies.info/</a>
This will help you to learn to rely on your own thinking processes and even help you to identify what&#39;s wrong if your intuition pings your brain that something about what you&#39;re being told to believe does not compute.
Go camping, reconnect with the natural world we evolved to live in.
Rely on the two most important moral algorithms:
1.Treat others how you want them to treat you and 2. people should not be used as a means to an end, they are an end in themselves. </p>
