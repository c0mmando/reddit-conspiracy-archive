       Sooo...if Trump wins, that puts a damper on the whole "American democracy is fixed by the globalist establishment" idea that frequents this sub. Will those who've been convinced that democracy is a farce, reconsider their perspective or will you just gloss over that and focus on the next conspiracy theory? I'm curious to know how that's going to go down for the determined cynics out there. Tawk amungst yaselves.

        Comment deleted because the federal investigation has made me despise technology and it's pretty miserable knowing something like that happened back in 2011 but never getting the slightest bit of clarity to gauge reality moving forward. You can't function this way. I'm too angry at everyone and everything and it's too exhausting not having a way to re-calibrate any sense of what's real. I've gotten really good at faking it but I'm tired of feeling scrutinized by an ordeal that I wasn't allowed to see and I'm tired of scrutinizing others looking for hints. There's no comfort in being able to live your life when you're denied a basic grip on reality because somebody decided that it should all be kept from you. It's like being locked in a soundproofed room of one-way mirrors in the middle of Times Square because you have no idea what the scope of it all was but everybody seems to think they know your backstory now and it ripples into every aspect of life. I can't work. I can't be around people. I'm pissed at everyone and everything because I want to let go of this but I have no way to move on in this state and it's been a 5 year nightmare that won't stop because I've been denied the chance to process it and be done with it. If you could be me for a day you would see that this farce of an existence is cruel and unusual. I've lived through a string of harsh experiences that would destroy some people but I would do it all again for the rest of my life just for one day of partial clarity on what happened back in 2011. I had such a bright future and it feels like it was stolen from me. I just want to know some of what happened. I don't need all the details. I just need some idea of what, how, who and enough information so I can make some sort of sense of it and have peace and have my feet back on the ground. I don't care that I look nuts and somebody out there might think that this is funny...I don't care...this is a nightmare and I need it to stop. I wish somebody else could Vulcan mind-meld with me and experience this so I'd at least have one person who could understand. Even if it was meant to be torture, you'd think one person would throw me a bone and just tell me why so many people are so assuming of me now and know very specific things about me, or rather slightly off version of those things, echoed from person after person. Imagine taking the normal stress of life and multiplying that by every red flag experience where someone seems to be sure that they know all about personal details that you didn't share and it colors every relationship and my own perception and behavior and everything just feels fake and forever contrived and weighed down by this elephant in the room and an entire human life feels like some trivialized media blurb interest story or whatever that happened half a decade ago and despite a lifetime of extraordinary pain, not only do you get turned into a sideshow but it feels like you're the only one who's not in on the joke because they don't think you can handle knowing but they still feel compelled to brief the people in your life who weren't around for the first showing so they 'understand' you more when it really just makes it worse because not only are they underestimating your ability to handle the truth but piling on more humiliation with no direct visibility just makes every day a new reminder that you're broken and everyone thinks you're too weak to know the truth so it never gets better and you're never allowed to close the book.

       No it doesn't.  As if Trump's not a PTB plant himself.  You think the money changers can't or don't control him also?
      </p>
      <p>
       And this isn't any type of response from a "cynic".  I'm not a "cynic", and I think cynics are generally caustic and self-defeating.  I'm just a regular person who doesn't really give af about anyone politically and am just observing and calling things like I see them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump winning doesn't somehow make TPTB go "Oh woes me!  What are we going to do now??  We
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       planned on Trump winning!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Psh.  If you think that, then you don't know how deep their rabbit hole goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is to say that the people can't get up and make something happen AGAINST tptb and in favor of our own sovereignty.  No.  We CAN get up and do something.  However, the energy of your post seems to imply that a Trump win somehow means that there isn't still a shit ton of chicanery going on and that will
       <em>
        continue
       </em>
       to go on w/him in the White House...and that is simply incorrect on your part to think anything like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like the corporate ptb will "go away" w/Trump in the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump IS a corporate ptb.

       It doesn’t work like that.  You’re thinking in too small-minded a manner.  You think in video game meme terms apparently, and things are a lot more complicated than that.  TPTB aren’t omnipotent.  They don’t control everything and everyone at all times.  It’s a back and forth, ebb and flow dynamic that they forecast.  Not some sort of black and white grid they “control effortlessly”.

        Comment deleted because the federal investigation has made me despise technology and it's pretty miserable knowing something like that happened back in 2011 but never getting the slightest bit of clarity to gauge reality moving forward. You can't function this way. I'm too angry at everyone and everything and it's too exhausting not having a way to re-calibrate any sense of what's real. I've gotten really good at faking it but I'm tired of feeling scrutinized by an ordeal that I wasn't allowed to see and I'm tired of scrutinizing others looking for hints. There's no comfort in being able to live your life when you're denied a basic grip on reality because somebody decided that it should all be kept from you. It's like being locked in a soundproofed room of one-way mirrors in the middle of Times Square because you have no idea what the scope of it all was but everybody seems to think they know your backstory now and it ripples into every aspect of life. I can't work. I can't be around people. I'm pissed at everyone and everything because I want to let go of this but I have no way to move on in this state and it's been a 5 year nightmare that won't stop because I've been denied the chance to process it and be done with it. If you could be me for a day you would see that this farce of an existence is cruel and unusual. I've lived through a string of harsh experiences that would destroy some people but I would do it all again for the rest of my life just for one day of partial clarity on what happened back in 2011. I had such a bright future and it feels like it was stolen from me. I just want to know some of what happened. I don't need all the details. I just need some idea of what, how, who and enough information so I can make some sort of sense of it and have peace and have my feet back on the ground. I don't care that I look nuts and somebody out there might think that this is funny...I don't care...this is a nightmare and I need it to stop. I wish somebody else could Vulcan mind-meld with me and experience this so I'd at least have one person who could understand. Even if it was meant to be torture, you'd think one person would throw me a bone and just tell me why so many people are so assuming of me now and know very specific things about me, or rather slightly off version of those things, echoed from person after person. Imagine taking the normal stress of life and multiplying that by every red flag experience where someone seems to be sure that they know all about personal details that you didn't share and it colors every relationship and my own perception and behavior and everything just feels fake and forever contrived and weighed down by this elephant in the room and an entire human life feels like some trivialized media blurb interest story or whatever that happened half a decade ago and despite a lifetime of extraordinary pain, not only do you get turned into a sideshow but it feels like you're the only one who's not in on the joke because they don't think you can handle knowing but they still feel compelled to brief the people in your life who weren't around for the first showing so they 'understand' you more when it really just makes it worse because not only are they underestimating your ability to handle the truth but piling on more humiliation with no direct visibility just makes every day a new reminder that you're broken and everyone thinks you're too weak to know the truth so it never gets better and you're never allowed to close the book.

       There's an interesting theory being offered up by the MSM (CNN, BBC) to explain why Trump won despite all those polls showing a small lead for Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently a large percentage of Trump supporters didn't want to answer
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       questions by pollsters. The net result was a skewed result showing a Clinton lead that didn't actually exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a conspiracy theorist, I believe they do put effort into influencing (ie. rigging) election results. They don't want it to be too obvious so they do just enough to give a small lead... say 3 - 5%.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the polls are off by 5 - 7%, a small lead for HRC turns into an unexpected 2% win for Trump. This is basically what just happened on Nov 8th.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB did try and win the election. They just didn't know they were working with bad data.

       Hi, hardened cynic here. I don't see either candidate winning as a sign of anything yet. Obviously what matters are their actions after they've won.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your opinion, Trump is against the global establishment?

        Comment deleted because the federal investigation has made me despise technology and it's pretty miserable knowing something like that happened back in 2011 but never getting the slightest bit of clarity to gauge reality moving forward. You can't function this way. I'm too angry at everyone and everything and it's too exhausting not having a way to re-calibrate any sense of what's real. I've gotten really good at faking it but I'm tired of feeling scrutinized by an ordeal that I wasn't allowed to see and I'm tired of scrutinizing others looking for hints.

       Plenty of us have seen trump as part of the establishment this whole time and have been vocal about it.  Nobody is switching their opinion all of the sudden like you're claiming here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ, how many years was trump a democrat who was family friends with the clintons?  This whole "trump is a republican who hates the clintons and is a complete outsider" concept is such bullshit and didn't exist at all two years ago.

       I think Trump is against the establishment in the same way Woodrow Wilson is against WWI.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, why do you think the Global Power Structure is monolithic? Don't you think it's possible that it has factions that may sometimes disagree? Like, in this election, Neo-Liberal/Neocon vs Fascismo.

       Many of the less partisan-minded still feel they're both working for the same masters, but with that being said...  I'm pretty...  surprised.  The propaganda machine was throwing everything it had at getting Hillery elected.  And with the Clinton Foundation taking so much bribery, I didn't think they'd let her
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm worried about the time between now and Jan., especially with this insane "Raqqa" development, but maybe... did "people" get a tiny win here?  We conspiracy theorists aren't exactly an optimistic bunch...  but maybe.

        Comment deleted because the federal investigation has made me despise technology and it's pretty miserable knowing something like that happened back in 2011 but never getting the slightest bit of clarity to gauge reality moving forward. You can't function this way. I'm too angry at everyone and everything and it's too exhausting not having a way to re-calibrate any sense of what's real. I've gotten really good at faking it but I'm tired of feeling scrutinized by an ordeal that I wasn't allowed to see and I'm tired of scrutinizing others looking for hints. There's no comfort in being able to live your life when you're denied a basic grip on reality because somebody decided that it should all be kept from you. It's like being locked in a soundproofed room of one-way mirrors in the middle of Times Square because you have no idea what the scope of it all was but everybody seems to think they know your backstory now and it ripples into every aspect of life. I can't work. I can't be around people. I'm pissed at everyone and everything because I want to let go of this but I have no way to move on in this state and it's been a 5 year nightmare that won't stop because I've been denied the chance to process it and be done with it. If you could be me for a day you would see that this farce of an existence is cruel and unusual. I've lived through a string of harsh experiences that would destroy some people but I would do it all again for the rest of my life just for one day of partial clarity on what happened back in 2011. I had such a bright future and it feels like it was stolen from me. I just want to know some of what happened. I don't need all the details. I just need some idea of what, how, who and enough information so I can make some sort of sense of it and have peace and have my feet back on the ground. I don't care that I look nuts and somebody out there might think that this is funny...I don't care...this is a nightmare and I need it to stop. I wish somebody else could Vulcan mind-meld with me and experience this so I'd at least have one person who could understand. Even if it was meant to be torture, you'd think one person would throw me a bone and just tell me why so many people are so assuming of me now and know very specific things about me, or rather slightly off version of those things, echoed from person after person. Imagine taking the normal stress of life and multiplying that by every red flag experience where someone seems to be sure that they know all about personal details that you didn't share and it colors every relationship and my own perception and behavior and everything just feels fake and forever contrived and weighed down by this elephant in the room and an entire human life feels like some trivialized media blurb interest story or whatever that happened half a decade ago and despite a lifetime of extraordinary pain, not only do you get turned into a sideshow but it feels like you're the only one who's not in on the joke because they don't think you can handle knowing but they still feel compelled to brief the people in your life who weren't around for the first showing so they 'understand' you more when it really just makes it worse because not only are they underestimating your ability to handle the truth but piling on more humiliation with no direct visibility just makes every day a new reminder that you're broken and everyone thinks you're too weak to know the truth so it never gets better and you're never allowed to close the book.
