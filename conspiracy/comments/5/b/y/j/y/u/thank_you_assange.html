       We haven't been saved from shit yet.  Spreading truth is great and all, but we're still deep in the shit.

       Let's see what de facto president Pence's marching orders from his neocon warmonger puppetmasters.   Trump talked a good game on isolationism and disentangling from foreign meddling, but I don't trust a goddamn thing that came out of his mouth.
      </p>

       And let's see what the hell happens with the investigations into Hillary and the Clinton Foundation now.  I am not holding my breath for justice to be served.

       I don't know man. The FBI, NYPD &amp; possibly Wikileaks &amp; anonymous are all in possession of the material found on Weiners laptop pertaining to peadophilia, corruption, treason etc - if the indictments don't come in the next week, I think we'll see a dump of the likes unseen outside of Jurassic Park.

       Unfortunately true. Unless enough of the higher-ups in the FBI want to expose her and fight for the truth to be revealed, most Shrillary-supporters will never know what she's done (or maybe they're choosing to ignore it).

       So those colluding globalist bankers are still firmly the colluding globalist bankers.  They still own everyone and everything and will find ways to pass their losses onto everyday folks - same as they always have.

       Assange isn't accused of breaking any US laws.   Nor has he been tried and convicted of breaking any US laws.   There's nothing for him to pardon.   It may be possible to appeal to Swedish authorities on Assange's behalf, and get them to dismiss the "Didn't wear a condom/rape" accusation though.

       Leader of the free world won't put him in gitmo now ? Bit of a grey area priminsiter gillard did describe his actions as illegal though not stating what law he had broken, my government does have a history of bending over for America surely Sweden was under similar pressure.

       I don't think he'd get put into Gitmo.     Assange is white, and folks in the Donald sub are singing his praises right now.   I think TheDon could probably pressure UK and Swedish authorities though - and he's got the interview on 11/14 with Swedish authorities at the Embassy in UK.    Maybe they'll drop it then.

       Yea man. Im glad you say that. I have been kinda wondeeing why certain leakers are getting more exposure than others. Especially since didn't manning leak info to snowden or assange? Also didnt it have to do with ships with unknown origin and strange alien sounding names? Need to refresh my memmory on that i guess. Either way you would think you would hear more about Manning.

       The MSM and TPTB prop up puppets that fit their agendas.  Manning most definitely does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       fit that categorization.

       He's not part of the greater plan like Assange and Snowden and Greenwald and those cats are.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you need to do to see who's a plant and who's the real deal is look at their current situations.  Snowden and Assange are free.  I don't give af about Assange being in some embassy and supposedly being a "prisoner" there.  Prisoner?  Really?  Try being in solitary confinment for a few
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       in an ACTUAL PRISON.
       <em>
        That's
       </em>
       being a fucking prisoner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting interviews by leading reporters that everyone's seeing is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       "being a prisoner".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have hate toward Assange and Snowden and those cats.  I just have a lot of hurt for Manning and the extent to which the citizenry have allowed the MSM to get them/us to simply fucking
       <em>
        forget
       </em>
       about Manning like he/she no longer exists...when he/she is the one being crucified the worst more than
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       else.

       Manning was reckless, dont make him out to be a hero. Indiscriminately dumping stolen data is most certainly illegal and potentially endangers lives. Just because no one died due to Mannings leak doesnt mean punishment isnt in order. Snowden and Assange's cases arw not that similar to Manning.

       I doubt that the Clintons will face jail time. There's too much dirt for everybody in it, and they apparently already took the deal. The material never materialized. The Bush'es also never went to jail, and Jeb had no chance which was excellent.

       Fully agree OP. Assange was a massive force behind outing the truth, and I truly hope he gets full freedom and some metal of honor to boot - also hoping the CIA didn't actually kidnap him in secret and orchestrate illusion announcements and stories to make it seem like he's sti in the embassy.

       More whistleblowers have been prosecuted under Obama's watch than any other president. Hopefully Trump can flip that practice on its head.

       After you said this a flash of concern came into me. What if they used this DNC leaks charade to give credibility to Wikileaks since it doesnt matter who gets into office. Could they be setting up wiki leaks as way to limit truth by using it as a tool hide real truths behind the non important truths?

       The best thing that could have happened was a split so he got nothing done. But this is scary, scary in a different way from Clinton (I feel like the WWIII doomsday clock has moved back a hair at least) but still really bad.

       Thank you Wikileaks for giving us some real coverage of world politics.

       We can now sit back and wait and see how Trump treats a real news gathering organization.

       My guess it will be more of same. Blame Russia and say it's a front for Russia and Putin.

       It's easier and you don't have to change anything. No sackings or other penalties for those who do wrong and who can do you damage if pushed.

       Leader of the free world won't put him in gitmo now ? Bit of a grey area priminsiter gillard did describe his actions as illegal though not stating what law he had broken, my government does have a history of bending over for America surely Sweden was under similar pressure. Guesse he will have to go outside and take his chances .
