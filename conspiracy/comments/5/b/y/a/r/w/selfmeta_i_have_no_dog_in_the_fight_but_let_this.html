       I found it really hilarious. Almost chocked to death when this morning I heard WITF on the radio ask themselves they can't figure out what was wrong with polling before the election. IF THE MEDIA WASNT BIASED. We would actually see reporting realtime. the democrats in there little smug circle saw those polls and probably even didn't vote because they thought they would win.

       It's true but it's also very telling. The "silent majority" is getting pretty sick of being told they suck just because they are white men. These are the salt of the earth guys who don't really care about politics or anything except having a beer and a ball game to watch. They are the ones losing their jobs and not being able to support their families. They are the backbone of America and like a backbone go fairly unnoticed most the time.

       Because it's not the politicians that are ultimately evil, they're just tools of the bourgeoisie meant to divide and distract us from the true masters, those with enough capital to buy and sell every damn aspect of modern society. They're the ones working us to exhaustion, they're the ones stripping our dear Earth barren. We need to all unite as Humans and end this mass bullshit..

       Hey comrade, it's 2016. Maybe you didn't know while hashtagging and shitposting but bourgeoisie means 'middle class' and the middle class haven't owned the means of production since 1914.

       Honestly, the root of the problem has nothing to do with race. This is the largest issue. The narrative has been spun that if you are against illegal immigration, you are a racist. This has prevented real conversations from happening. Any time someone tries to engage in a logical discussion, with the intent of alleviating the problem, cries of racism come forth (by design btw), which unfortunately stonewalls any progress. We all agree there needs to be immigration reform. But continuing the buy into the "racist" accusations is preventing meaningful discussion from taking place. Don't worry, there will not be mass deportations, there will not be a wall. Congress would never sign off on something like that.

       Me and my whole Hispanic family voted for trump but we collectively decided not to tell anyone because we would be called racists in a town that is about 96% Hispanic and is split in half by the Mexican border.

       legal immigrants understand that letting illegals take THEIR JOBS does not benefit them even if they share the same skin color. Hispanic communities in the boarder states live in fear, but not in fear of white people or immigration control, but of the extremely violent and radical drug cartels/gangs that play a heavy role in illegal immigration.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you look at border areas and see areas that are majority hispanic, the first question you should ask isn't "where have all the white people gone" but rather "where are all the black people". And the answer is that they have been chased our or murdered by hispanic gangs.  The real victims of illegal immigration in this country are poor blacks and hispanics.

       What's funny, I would venture to say 90% of those black voters are not college educated either. So basically they are upset that they couldn't swindle the blacks again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's very telling how the black vote didn't turn out this year because there wasn't a black man to vote for. Talk about educated voting blocs

       Politically he's a total unknown. I've listened to his rally speeches and visited his actual websites and his policies are very thin. On isidewith.com, I've disagreed with that which he's stated he wants, on matters of things like health care, domestic security, etc.

       Anecdotally my thinking is somewhat different.  I voted early and there was a line.  And what I was seeing was 30 and 40 something white professionals taking their aging parents to what probably will be their last election.  Too much madness to consider taking a frail adult out on the actual election day so these were people were voting early so they could stay home the night of who I'm guessing last voted in the time of Nixon or Reagan probably.  I think they were the folks who hadn't really voted for a candidate in possibly 20-40 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was interesting being the youngest guy in the voting line (I had the week off and I was curious about who was voting early anyway).

       It could be, that black people and hispanics vote more or less the same way, independent of education, age or sex. But this is maybe not true for whites, where the voting behaviour could be vastly different depending on sex, age and education.

       Trump got a 40% of the Latino vote,  so I would hardly call the Latino vote unified.

       I'm not talking about unified. I'm saying maybe about 40 percent of male Latinos, about 40 percent of female Latinos, about 40 percent of old Latinos, about 40 percent of young Latinos, about 40 percent of educated Latinos and about 40 percent of uneducated Latinos voted vor Trump. So it doesn't matter if you split the Latino vote into sex, age or education because the vote within each group is quite similar compared to any other group within the Latino vote. Has nothing to do with if the vote is split between candidates or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       In comparison, a lot of white men voted for Trump but far less white women. A lot of uneducated whites voted for Trump but far less educated (meaning people with a college degree) and there's also a big difference between age groups among white voters. You get my point?

       UK person here. The media pulled this exact same stunt in the UK following Brexit.  Media didn't get the result they wanted so decide to insult people who voted a certain way.  Part of the reason I don't trust everything shoved down my throat by the BBC anymore

       Beautifully stated. The media is literally saying "All of you voted incorrectly." Which implies we are supposed to do what we are told.

       I remember seeing the Brexit stuff. I was upset on the Brits behalf. All the media outlets were saying "people must not have known what they voted for."

       Ding! Voters engaged in the Primary Process who supported Sander's watched as polling locations didn't open, opened late, or closed early. They saw thousands of voter registrations mysteriously changed across different states. They saw Bernie supporters getting provisional ballots issued that ended up as toilet paper. And to top it off, they sure as shit saw when the DNC's emails were leaked and there was obvious collusion and bias against Sanders to usher Hillary Clinton in. Here lies the problem. You can't force Hillary down our fucking throats, piss on us, and tell us it's raining. Their strategy relied upon the idea that having Trump as president was such a disgusting option, that giant swaths of Sander's supporters would vote for Hillary out of perceived necessity. All along, they missed the point that one of the main facets of Bernie's movement was against establishment politicians...against big money interests, wall street, and wealthy campaign contributors buying candidates and elections. These ideas were part of the moral fabric that excited people, and assuming that they would just say oh well, and vote for the candidate who embodied the very opposite of those ideals was a failed strategy with a big middle finger to so many people. That is part of how you get a egomaniacal child elected President.

       Not really accurate: all of the major metropolises which hold massive amounts of electoral votes have massive low income housing communities that can be bought for a few dollars each. Get real. 50% of Democratic voters are in the ghetto.

       That's all true. Uneducated white people put a dangerous idiot in the White House. And it's the DNC's fault we got to that place.

       There has always been a strong thread of anti-intellectualism in the US. We've managed to suppress it for the most part throughout our history. Hillary and DWS's arrogance allowed it out of its dirty little trailer park and gave it the keys to the bus.

       That's how politics is I guess...politicians make lofty promises like reducing inequality and claiming to want to help the marginalised, when they don't even walk the talk, how hypocritical of them. :/ Then again, this hypocrisy is present in most countries' governments (seen it in my country), they'll say anything just to get elected.

        My project in the pages that follow is to review the media’s attitude toward yet a third politician, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination earlier this year. By examining this recent history, much of it already forgotten, I hope to rescue a number of worthwhile facts about the press’s attitude toward Sanders. Just as crucially, however, I intend to raise some larger questions about the politics of the media in this time of difficulty and transition (or, depending on your panic threshold, industry-wide apocalypse) for newspapers.

       Shockingly so. The podcast episode about it was
       <em>
        really

       good. Maybe the clearest and most respectful presentation of the views of white middle america. If you have time, I highly recommend it.

       I'm totally expecting a 180° change in Trump's demeanor too.  I bet he won't even need a warning though, as I'm fairly confident his stance against Clinton, news media and establishment Republicans was mostly pandering.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't mind if Clinton was made an example of, or at least exhaustively investigated, though. Unfortunately I have no faith we'll see it happen.

       I agree with you. I expected some kind of rise up if trump lost. I told my co worker on Tuesday, I fear the outcome of the election because of the backlash that will be had.

       Yeah, the irony is that the only two 3rd Party candidates that even showed up in the polls were Johnson and McMullin, both of whom would take votes away from Trump.

       Jill Stein didn't get shit. If Clinton lost votes to a Bernie write in, that's the DNC's fault for how they handled the primary. If she could have won without cheating, they shouldn't have cheated. If they needed to cheat to make sure Hillary got the nomination, she shouldn't have won.

       Look like, my state was well over 50% blue and hasn't voted red since 1976. The "if you didn't vote you're privileged" narrative coming from Clinton supporters from is garbage unless you were in a swing state... Bernie won my state. My absentee ballots submitted to my home state have been counted 50% of the time. Why the hell should I have voted for Clinton when I despise her and voted absentee for Bernie in the primary? That vote miraculously was counted. My absentee ballot for Obama somehow wasn't.

       No, you're wrong. Trump getting elected was the right move.
I don't agree with many of his points (lock her up, congressional term limits, tpp are good though)
      </p>
      <p>
       But because we didn't give into the corruption we may have won. Granted Trump has in fact grown his own brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Downside is that even if he does take down the Clintons we have 4 years with him. 
But as long as he doesn't get us nuked I think him being a burden on society for that time as a trade for taking out the garbage as it were is a fair trade.

       Let's just not do 8 years of it.

       I get your sentiment, but he has absolute power now. Most people on Reddit are too young to remember what Bush did, and how it destroyed the economy. Obama's work was barely able to pull us out of that. And Bush actually knew what he was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The on silver lining is that Trump is completely clueless so won't be able to accomplish much by himself. I'm just hoping Pence doesn't take over and run things behind the scenes.

       It sounds like cant possibly fathom why someone would vote for Trump. Also the tribalism hurting america is D vs R not White vs Minority. Take a second to understand the opposition (failing to do so is tribalism) rather than painting broad racist strokes, lest you get the wrong take-away from last night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also here is a liberal calling out a liberal publication in a liberal publication for allowing the Democratic party to forget they are the party of the people and not the Ivory Tower Elite.

       These two articles combined show that if the MSM wasnt so keen on painting Trump supporters as Racists you might have had President Sanders being voted in by the same people that voted in Trump. So maybe the "xenophobia" was a bit of a partisan hack job when you were being told what to hear when Trump spoke. He did say a ton of ridiculous stuff, but that can be attributed one-to-one in the voter's mind when being compared to Secretary Clinton's actions. Whether that ratio is accurate or real even is irrelevant. It only matters how it effects the voter. Cheers.

        Stop trying to project your liberal feelings onto other people. Not everybody feels the same way as you. This is why people voted in a different way from you.

       There is truth in statements about the margin (third party voters totals cover the victory margin in some cases), but there is never a guarantee those votes would go for anyone else if that choice was removed.

       funny how the blame has shifted completely to the DNC now. Not to do with her or the parties stances, not to do with her actions, but the DNC rigging NOW all of a sudden pops up. a week ago, not a single word of it

       and with that everyone keeps saying bernie would have won. that's not true either. bernie at least had different ideas than the status quo, but he would not have beaten trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       the sad part about bernie is, unless he was forced, his endorsement for clinton was just a big 'fuck you' and selling out to all the people who stood behind him. He kept going on about the 'big banks', then endorsed the candidate that is owned by them

       Lol you think that the American people would vote in a fraudulent, lying socialist? You people are out of your mind to think Bernie would have done better. The man argues pay in equality mean while he has been making 170k a year as a Senator. Get over yourself. He is, and was fraud who attempted to pander to blacks

       We can only hope that the DNC gets their collective heads out of their asses and puts a candidate the constituents actually support on the 2020 ticket.  I am no Trump fan, but if we must endure this to get a candidate like Bernie some respect, then it is a worthwhile sacrifice.

       On NPR radio now.  Blaming both Stein and Johnson supporters, also not enough black voter turn out.   I enjoy SOME of the discourse on NPR but they quite blatantly suck the Clinton cocktail.

      <p>
       Not to mention NPR, as a progressive radio channel, also marginalized and made arguments against Sanders and his cause during the primary.  Not that it's news to anyone here, just frustrating.

       Honestly the voters chose Trump,  so it's definitely their fault. People are idiots and American democracy has failed.

        showed Clinton neck and neck with trump and Bernie out way ahead.  Clinton isn't losing because she's a democrat, she's losing because a lot of her actions have been dishonest and people don't trust her.  That's where Sanders has the big advantage.  Even many Clinton supporters admit that they don't like her but they are only voting for her because they like Trump less.  What a glowing endorsement.  That's why Bernie was a better candidate but the Democrats had to have their queen and now they reap what they sow.  Now I know many people will argue that since Clinton &gt; Sanders and Trump &gt; Clinton that means that Trump &gt; Sanders.  This is incorrect thinking for a number of reasons.  Clinton was able to win the primary because she controlled the liberal leaning media and because the Democratic party worked against Bernie Sanders during the primary.  CNN, MSNBC, NY Times and many liberal comedic pundits were very much biased towards her.  This can have a profound impact on a race and drive many supporters away from Sanders to Clinton (even if they didn't like her).
       </p>
       <p>
        CNN was mocked as the Clinton News Network because of how biased they were against Sanders and many "comedic" pundits like Samantha Bee, Seth Meyers, and others were quick to bash Bernie and his supporters while ignoring the flaws in Clinton.  Bernie Bros spread like wildfire even though the Bernie camp had more women in it than the Clinton camp.  Clinton also adopted similar language to what Bernie Sanders was saying in order to woo Bernie supporters away from him.  So, while they didn't rig the electoral ballot, they sure put all their effort into crushing Bernie's movement instead of trying to understand why Bernie was getting so much support.  After he lost Clinton went back to business as usual and Trump catered to Bernie's supporters and tried to woo them.
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         But wait, if it's true that Clinton controlled so many media outlets and tv shows then why is she losing (maybe did lose depending on time of reading)?  By your logic, she should be crushing Trump.
        </em>
        Here, lies the biggest flaw in the Democrats plan.  They could influence many liberal leaning networks to show Clinton favoritism but Republicans don't watch those shows.  A hard core Republican doesn't care about what Samantha Bee has to say.  They don't care about MSNBC.  So that magical lead that Clinton could force over Sanders (barely) wasn't there against Trump.  And the fact that Clinton and the Democratic Party worked so hard to trivialize Sanders' supporters ended up biting them in the ass as many did not want to come out and support her.
        <em>
         You want to mock and trivialize me so much?  Fine, now you get your wish, I am non-existent in this race.
        </em>
        To put it simply, the Democrats misread the situation and didn't realize the anger boiling up against the establishment.  The second they won the primary they shifted tactics to wooing Republicans rather than sticking to Sanders' message because it never occurred to them that Sanders' supporters wouldn't want Hillary.  They assumed that Sanders' supporters would just fall in line (like in races before).
       </p>
       <p>
        So, yeah, Fuck CNN, Fuck the Democrats, and Fuck the new wave of shitty late night comedic pundits.  They are cancerous fucks who did everything they could to push out a populist candidate and elect their hated candidate.  They deserve what they got.
       </p>
       <p>
        P.S.  Everyone who thinks that this race was decided by Comey's letter about the email investigation being reopened is probably wrong.  That was released too close the election time to sink in.  Most Republicans will feel vindicated (but they're not voting for Hillary anyway) while most Democrats will feel distrustful of the letter.
        <em>
         He released it right next to the election time.  This is probably a setup to crush Hillary.  I won't fall for it.
        </em>
        So, yeah, I doubt it had much effect on the election but it will most likely still be a scapegoat for the loss (instead of researching the real reasons).

       I also think all the networks being controlled by clinton hurt her because americans were sick of being fed anti-trump shit yet nothing bad about hillary when there were emails about her being released every day.

       Totally. I haven't watched John Oliver or The Daily Show in months because of their one sided attacks. Uh, there is at least equal amounts of shit to make fun of or call out Hillary Clinton as there are with Trump. I didn't even vote Trump. I just couldn't stand the bias when Trump
       <strong>
        says

       stupid shit and Clinton
       <strong>

       Had Clinton been elected, we'd no longer have access to open discussion forums like this one. In fact, she already bought
       <a href="/r/politics">

       Here is an un effing believably prescient article from Harpers calling out the "Ivory Tower" liberals for forgetting to be the party of the people. It is a slap in the face of the WaPo for being laughably out of touch and completely oblivious to the rest of the country. Please read it if you have any interest in the current state of the 4th estate.

       Also the single most important Op-Ed of 2016 was written by none other than Cracked.com (no, seriously). It doesnt say so but you could easily see why Sanders would have killed it where Trump thrives. That giant ass red map would probably be all blue.:

       the reason this is actually worse than you think is that this is how you can take out opposition precincts with precision. Google knows your home address and how you are going to vote. They also know your voting precinct. They also know who you are likely to support. This means that you can change an entire neighborhoods voter affiliation without disrupting the entire election. So that people can still vote in the General without letting opposition participate in the Primary. Take out a dozen blocks of Brooklyn and you can win. This is it.
       <strong>
        This is how the primary was rigged against Sanders.

       100% this, plus add one more thing: Hillary scared gun owners to our cores.  She promoted confiscation of guns at gunpoint - that's what an "Australian style byback" meant.
       <strong>
        In the US that meant civil war.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie didn't scare us.  Yes, he was still no real friend of ours but he wasn't going to start a goddamn war with us or bring back the massive civil rights violations the ATF was infamous for during Bill's administration.

       Honestly I think that gun should be regulated way stricter in America but imo it's too late for that. Too much legal and illegal guns in circulation now, it would just leave the "good" people with no guns and the "baddies" with guns.

       It's on this point that I think you're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       People with guns regulating the government was maybe true before and after civil war but the truth is that you won't do shit against the government with your guns even with the help of some redneck survivalists. If the army doesn't back you up the people don't stand a chance with or without guns.

       She couldn't give the VP spot to Bernie. She already promised that to Tim when she got him to step down from DNC chair to let DWS take over and rig the convention from the top down. That deal paid off for her, but only after they had to cheat to steal back their rigged primary.

       I feel like DWS played a secondary role. She did nothing but sit on her hands for legislative elections during Obamas two terms. With everything we know now, along with the bitterness we know of Clinton (didn't even give a concession speech last night and didn't today until like 11AM-CST)  I am fully confident in thinking DWS was put in place to intentionally sabotage the legislature for Democrats during Obamas two terms just to spite him for Clintons loss because fuck him.

       I was arguing with my cousin about this the other day. By the end of it she said--because I will never forget it--"yeah, fine, she might have won by stealing the election. Because that's what winners do in politics, and Clinton is a winner." I just cocked my head and looked at her because I couldn't believe people actually think like this.

       Well, Clinton didn't win tonight.

       I like how the same people who say that, are the same ones who loved calling out Trump supporters who said he was a "genius" and a "good businessman" for avoiding taxes for years. If you rig an election, you're obviously not a winner and deserve nothing. I'm not a Trump fan at all, but I'm glad Clinton wasn't allowed to set a dangerous precedent.

       She lost two times big. The Obama loss was huge already. She also lost her State Department job "somehow".
How can your sister repeat that wrong argument with a straight face? Lots of crazy drum beat arguments in the media last weeks.
Huge media fail everywhere, also overseas.

       This sounds highly unlikely given her mini strokes and losing streak. Lost against Obama, lost the State job, lost against Trump.

       If the dirt gets brought out on the Clinton Family, no one will want them in office either. Look at the figurative wall Jeb faced, and not just against Trump. There was that live interview, where a random pedestrian screams out, "no more Bushes".

       I upvoted you but I'm not entirely sure I disagree that he's a long-term loss for democracy. That remains to be seen.

       While I've stopped giving campaign promises any credence (from any candidate), he does have the platform of draining the swamp. That would do wonders for democracy.

       Yeah whats funny to me is all the talk before tonight was about when Trump loses how the RNC will have to implode and rebuild, now I'm thinking the DNC and it's open corruption/collusion and favoritism might be the ones imploding. All of those in the DNC that stood by and let this bullshit happen on their watch? I hope their half way into a bottle of jack by now.

       Trump is a walking parody. He's been cought on camera and recorded being extremely sexist, racist, and an all around slimy person, this election should have been a landslide for the Democrats. It's an embarrassment on clinton that she lost and I'm extremely happy that she did. She got what she deserved. I'm not happy that trump won. I'm happy that clinton lost.

       I am a conservative, but I would have voted for Bernie as opposed to Trump.  From the beginning of the primaries, Clinton and Trump are the two I disliked the most because I feel they were in it for themselves, not for the people.  I think Bernie was trying to do what he thought was best for the people.  I respect that and would have voted for him if he would have ran.

       Trump loves this country. If you weren't brainwashed by the MSM you'd realize it. He's exactly what this country needs right now. A fucking colon cleanse. He has taken no special interest money and is indebted to no lobbyists. He's a sharp and ruthless businessman, but so are the donors of Hillary. Maybe he will get us a better deal. We've been getting shafted for too long brother. The corruption is too deep at this point. It has to be BTFO! I love this country. I hate to see the dissention. But can't we see that we've been played by the corporate oligarchs? Only a self-funded outsider could ever get the shit done that needs to get done. This isn't about parties man! I've never voted Republican in my life until now. And that's because I read the emails man. You can't elect that level of corruption. What's the message we send to our rapists? Red pills for all you!

       I don't agree with you at all, but shit, I understand where you're coming from and you basically reiterated why I believe Trump won.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is the anti-establishment vote. He's the guy that pisses off the locked-in politicians with connections and he played that card really well. He just had to tell people that "they don't want me in office" and people loved it. He said he'll get a special prosecutor for Hillary and people loved it. A lot of people like you believe this country needs a colon cleanse by a guy who isn't hooked up to donors like they're an IV. Hillary somewhat represents that evil that Trump promises to fight against and pull out of office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of people feel left out, feel like corporations stole the country, and they're fucking right. We have people living in tent cities that no politician is doing jack shit about. We have people suffering paycheck to paycheck being promised that they'll be taken care of, but then they get hit with medical bills and declare bankruptcy. And whenever you hear that they're going to make a move towards something like universal health care, there's always a ton of hints that insurance/pharmaceutical businesses are involved and will profit deeply off it. We're wage slaves, through and through. You can be making 6 figures and still be a fucking wage slave struggling in some parts of this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many people felt this way, and democrats watching Bernie get stolen from them started to feel this way even more so. He was the chosen one for lots of people, the democrat who represented a lot of this same mentality, but corrupt as shit politicians didn't give it to us. That pissed people off, and pissed off people will vote anti-establishment just as a fuck you to the people in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC dug their own fucking grave. Hell, I really hope Trump is the guy you believe he is, the America loving business man who will try to change this country and help the working class. I don't believe it whatsoever, but I hope to hell I'm wrong. Personally, I voted third party because as a Californian, I actually have a chance to vote conscience and not lesser evil. I hope Gary Johnson gets his 5% so third parties get some more exposure. My anti-establishment vote was by going third party.

       Your points might all be true, but it doesn't change the fact that he will not do any of the things he promised while campaigning.

       His promises will go unfulfilled. Just like most presidents before him, they say great things to take power, then it all gets ignored and their actions do not follow their speak. He will not put Hillary in jail like he said during the (second?) debate.

       I voted for Bernie, then Hillary.  I also voted for Romney last presidential election.  I'm definitely liberal socially, but I like to think I'm somewhat pragmatic.  I'm also the type that understands that democracy means I don't always win. So I'm willing to entertain your ideas.  But here's my random thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal opinion is that if you believe in a conservative message, then by all means elect a conservative congress.  But the president is our commander in chief and the face of our country.  And if he isn't our executive diplomat, then he appoints the Secretary of State, who would be our executive diplomat.  I just don't believe that Trump is the best face for our country.  I keep looking back to the things he said before he amassed a team that could control him.  Monitor all muslims in the US, and ban muslims from entering the US.... come on.  Global warming is a hoax created by the Chinese?  As an engineer and a member of the scientific community, this is laughable.  I think that early 2016 Trump is the true Trump.  Before he got a team that told him to shut up.  I think the recent relatively sane Trump that we've seen has been massively controlled by a very intelligent team that he luckily acquired.  Now that he's president I just can't see Trump performing admirably.  It's why I voted for Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read Tough Choices by Hillary and The Art of the Deal by Trump.  While both have done impressive things, Hillary convinced me that she is 100% a more capable representative for the United States.  I just can't see Trump having the intelligence to navigate delicate political discussions.  And Jesus, I'm terrified of his views on international environmental campaigns (humans are harming the environment people, it's a real thing, just accept it).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm willing to accept that this election is a message to corrupt political parties.  Maybe it'll all work out.  Time will tell.

       plus, trump is an oligarch. he is the literal definition. a rich business man who has political ties.

      <p>
       sure, downvote me. is he a rich business man? yes. Does he have political ties? he has donated to many campaigns and has made himself a part of politics. hell, he got his money from his father and has passed down that money/power from himself to his children.
      </p>

       he is just as much an oligarch as hillary is, except her parents didn't give her wads of cash or pretty much anything else.

       by the definition of oligarchy, no.

      <p>
       her power wasn't handled down to her. she didn't get her jobs by family connections and she didn't get her power by her money.

      <p>
       she gained her education and her position by her experience and work and through that she gained her own money. she isn't one of the richest, like donald says he is.

       she does border on oligarchy because of her connection to her husband but they were both lawyers before he started his political career and she herself has kept busy.

       Why will anything Trump does get blocked? The entire GOP is going to start sucking his dick tomorrow morning. Trump will do whatever the fuck he wants to do (and for the most part he doesn't care, he is going to let that lunatic Pence do whatever HE wants to do and the GOP will approve all of it).

       I just don't see Trump doing much as president.  I see him getting steamrolled by serious politicians and a staff that's much more politically savvy than he is.  I was pretty dismayed by tonight's election, but I really don't anticipate Trump being a powerful force during his presidency.  Feel free to disagree.  I'm open to discussion.

       Yeah, he will get steamrolled.. by the most extremely conservative politicians most people have ever seen in their lifetimes. Every ultra-conservative wet dream is on the table now. Mass deportations, extreme tax cuts for the ultra-rich, slash and burn social services, even less funding for public education and a massive rise of religious schools, they may completely abolish the estate tax, I think they may actually make abortion illegal again. You can't imagine how many people will lose their right to vote now. There will be literally THOUSANDS of public positions, especially judges, that the fucknut GOP have just refused to fill that will all be filled by the most extremely conservative candidates possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a huge win for dividing the rich from the poor, and for making elections as unrepresentative as possible. I wonder if they even have the power to completely abolish the minimum wage entirely. Public sector unions are going to be destroyed. Probably more than 15 million people will lose their health insurance, lifetime limits and pre-existing conditions will return, etc. Maybe they will eliminate the EPA and slash the funding for the FDA too. Oh, can't wait to slash banking regulations too!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the fucking shit people like Pence want. But just to make it extra awesome, Trump will add his own awful bullshit on top of that. Maybe people can start going to jail for criticizing him! Maybe they really will start killing innocent family members of terrorists! Torture is definitely back on the menu, Trump said he wants to do "much worse than waterboarding". Why the fuck not? This doesn't even touch on which wars the GOP will start, what a GOP majority in the supreme court is going to do for the next perhaps 20-30 years, etc. What a fucking disaster.

       The difference is that the GOP have gerrymandered the fuck out of the House. There are places where the Dems have won 55% of the vote and taken like 5/15 seats. They always fucking hold the goddamn House. For the last 3/4 of Obama's term they did just that. They oppose everything Obama wants, not just because it's not far right enough, but because not opposing sends the message that they think "the enemy" has good ideas. They don't have to oppose the enemy now, they can do whatever the fuck they want. Trump doesn't give a shit, he wants to win re-election, and it's the right that has elected him, he will just let them do whatever the fuck they want so that they don't turn their back on him next time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with the GOP thinking Obama was the anti-christ is that the GOP by and large is very anti-fact. Trump thinks global warming is a Chinese conspiracy, apparently his voters agree. All the scientists in the relevant fields certainly don't. The GOP base literally thinks Obama is a secret Muslim that is going to bring Sharia Law, the guy is fucking Christian and that is painfully obvious. There is not a single shred of evidence he isn't, the GOP base doesn't give a shit. FFS the guy is a centrist, they call him a socialist? That isn't even pretending to have a basis in reality. All the shit I just described is all the shit that same GOP base has been screaming about for years. Help the rich, fuck the poor, if you can't make it then fucking die. Let everyone do whatever they want so the rich areas do better than ever and the poor areas degrade into heaps of shit, rich powerful business owners like Donald Trump who LITERALLY doesn't even pay his own fucking contractors will "share the wealth". Defund all the regulatory bodies and let whatever the fuck happens happen, because apparently nobody knows less than the experts who've spent their entire lives devoted to a subject.

       There will be no obstruction, the Dems have no power to obstruct anything. Why is it exactly that you think the GOP would obstruct a GOP president who wants GOP policies?

       Everything one can say Clinton is guilty of with finance Trump isn't far off from.

       Some of the populace is out here struggling already and they pay taxes every year. Some don't even get returns at all... yet Trump can skirt that issue while

        making

       It's not hard to answer a question ... Wikileaks has raised probably 50 big ones (involving morals and money) that I think are
       <strong>
        vital
       </strong>
       to her proving her integrity and what kind of President she would be ... Hillary decided to decline to answer any of those questions, and that has cost her among many voters.

       This is exactly how "oversights" like Bill getting a "million dollar check" for a birthday gift happen - that is TOTALLY in breach of the rules for a politician (or their spouse) to receive a personal gift worth over $5k from a foreign government, while on an official government visit.

       I think her dirty plays worked against her partially because she kept pushing that "they go low we go high" bullshit. While insulting half the country, being outed playing dirty against Bernie, and totally playing the politics game we all freakin know is going on. How stupid do they think the populace is? It's one thing to accept that the "sausage making" of political campaigns is not always puppies and unicorns, but it's a whole new level of offensive for Hillary Clinton to tell the goddamn world that she's taking the high road when we can all see her and read her campaign emails.

       I don't believe that is necessarily a true statement. If Trump had won by a landslide, you might convince me. In reality, despite all the lies, corruption, and underhanded, sneaky, backroom deals, she still garnered
       <del>

       I agree with you regarding the level of corruption, but the fact is that
       <a href="http://imgur.com/GGZmXXW">
        she won the popular vote.

       That means that more than half the country is OK with having a leader who has very questionable morals providing that person is packaged as the candidate who represents all they things they hope to get. That statement goes for all sides of this equation.

       Honestly, this election has made me hate many typical liberal types with a burning passion, and I consider myself liberal.
      </p>

       I really hate that so many liberals can be just as bad as how I've always viewed conservatives to be-- their only redeeming qualities are that they typically believe in social liberal policies that I'm very passionate about, but it feels like so many liberals are just absolutely fucking clueless, and have the same message as conservatives with different wrapping/themes.

       Serves her right. I am in a very liberal town and even some of the hardened Republicans were looking into Bernie and agreeing with his points on money in politics. Trump echoed this with simple tag lines like "DRAIN  THE SWAMP" . Now we get a harsher revolution.

       Not just Bernie, literally any other Democrat; Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren... hell even Corey Booker would've beaten Trump in a landslide but the DNC allowed themselves to be kowtowed to Clinton's ambition and we went to war against the most hated Republican in history with the most hated Democrat in history and since democrats are categorically weak nobody should be surprised by the outcome.

       Not only that, but they deliberately supported a Trump campaign according to wikileaks. They thought he would be an easy target. Instead they fucking lost to the most hated man on Earth when their alternative candidate was routinely 10 points or more above Trump in polls. Fucking hell man.

       Exactly.  She and her cabal need to be removed from the political arena, permanently.  The level of corruption in the DNC as highlighted by their action in the primaries was utterly disgusting.  They treated the very idea of democracy with spite, and fought against the voice of the voter every step of the way, until they finally coronated a princess and tried to make her queen.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the price - not only handing the White House over to Trump, but also crippling any chance whatsoever for the democrats to gain ground in congress, will be paid for years.  However that one could have been worse - had she won, she'd almost assuredly have swung the house/senate even further the other way given her abrasive political presence and constant aura of scandal and controversy.  She was never fit as a candidate on that alone, but throw in the corruption and ethical issues and it is obscene that of all people for the DNC to betray their voters for, she was absolutely the least worthy.

       Probably won't even read this. I don't believe for a second that any of this wasn't planned. Nothing was handed down. Bernie was a challenge but never had a chance. Clinton and trump are one in the same and don't let the outcome of this bullshit fool you for even one second. Have no idea what they're thinking or what's to come but this is not a choice by the American people and you are a fool if you think it is.

       The man exposed Hillary, the DNC and the media. He's been serving the people of the world for years now and he's holed up in an embassy to avoid arrest. The guy hasn't seen the sun in at least a year. He's not even an American citizen, he shouldn't face the threat that he's facing. I really hope he can he free and live a more normal life, he must be losing his sanity behind those walls for so long. And he's doing it all for us.

       Who's to say Bernie wasnt ok with it? Even when she 'stole the presidency' from Bernie and rigged the primaries against him. He still endorsed her and continued to campaign for her.

       I can literally picture a political cartoon of Hillary with her hand on Bernie's head holding him back with her sleeve reading "DNC/liberal media" while the other hand holds a ball marked "presidency" behind her and trump behind her with one hand behind his back holding his tax returns, a small smug smile and upturned nose and his other hand slowly reaching out with thumb and middle finger for the "presidency" ball like he was picking a grape.

       The DNC is supposed to be neutral to every candidate. The voters decide who is going to be the Democratic candidate, and the DNC oversees.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be clearly seen in the emails that it did not work that way. From day 1, they (the DNC with Debbie Wasserman-shulz at the head of it) treated it as if Hillary was their man. They disregarded Bernie, tried to damage his reputation, then disregarded the votes, etc. Effectively keeping him from being the candidate. When all this came to light, Debbie stepped down. But it was too late at that point

       I have defended her for the past few months because I was scared of the orange menace. No longer. She fucked us, and the one consolation I can take from this is that the DNC is going to have to burn it all down and start over if they have any hope of being relevant ever again.

       That's true. But it's hard to vote for a man that says shit like "white people don't know what poverty feels like". The reason a lot of people didn't like Bernie was that he was clearly just saying everything that people wanted to hear. That's where the name Bernie Panders came from.

       Forget the media, he clearly said what more than half of America wanted to hear. And how is it pandering if what Bernie was saying was representative of his core values? Just because it's easy doesn't make it any less credible.

       What's ignorant is selectively deciding what's credible only when it suits you... given the context, what Bernie said wasn't as it is implied above. You can take hundreds of things trump says with context and see they are hardly credible as well.

       It is this exact facet of our culture, to hand out the pussy pass so freely (nominated based on gender) that made Trump the appropriate choice. Had it not been a factor, Bernie would have been nominated and a more appropriate president. But he was not. This makes Trump even more appropriate than Bernie.
      </p>

       Millennials these days are so full of hatred. They've been spamming my Facebook wall for the past year shaming men and whites for racism and misogyny that's grossly over exaggerated. The perpetuation of fake victim status has provided them justification for the vilification of masculine behavior. I've never seen so much reverse sexism/racism before in this country. This is how they got their own kind, Latinos, gays, and women voting against their own agenda. They are sick of watching the left gain unfair advantages by manipulating people with shame.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're the silent majority because we typically don't waste our time shaming others as I just did. How desperate and aggressive will they be to justify their hate? How deep will they dig their holes? Pussy pass and name calling was their platform and such thing is weak. Watch if someone replies wasting their time trying to use burnt out shame tactics against me.

       Because it'd require a 100% rig rate (give EVERY vote to killton) for it to win all the time, for the vote numbers to seem plausable they have to peg it as a certain percentage that's low enough to be ignored, and it's not like people can't just vote more for the other candidate and overcome that percentage.

       tl;dr rigging elections is tough business if you want to not get discovered.

        Even if I agree with anything he said, we're always going to have lower expectations of our leaders now, and we probably won't care as much about their credibility or if they can actually accomplish the things they promise.

        He hasn't doomed us yet, but he has severely lowered my expectations for the US in the future, and I know he has weakened and discredited us on the international stage.

       We are totally ready for a woman president, but not just ANY woman president. Hillary was and always will be a weak candidate who is bad at public speaking, yet carries the baggage of being paid millions of dollars for public speaking events by Goldman Sachs and the like.

       If Elizabeth Warren ran I think this would have been very different, but no, it wasn't "her turn" and now we have a president who is an orange game show host that doesn't even really want the job. It was your turn!...... to ruin everything...

       It wasn't up for vote in my state either, but Obama very recently said that he may act on the results of the weed referendums before leaving office. Medical is now legal in a clear majority of states. A rescheduling before January 20th is now a very real possibility.

       I don't agree with illegal abortion but you have your weed stances backwards. Hillary was all about her key players, who were all about weed's classification. It would have never had a chance being reclassified under her.

       Yeah it's not so much her stance but the key players that support her who she heavily relied on. It's the similar corporate machine that stopped Obama from pushing it. Trump has a better chance because the complicated relationships with drug companies have swapped hands too many times. He wants to tear down Obamacare.

       Well it sure would be nice to get a candidate who would take global climate change seriously. And push us into a new Space Age instead of focusing on bringing back sectors of the US economy that literally don't exist anymore. Hilary was likely not that President. But Trump is abso-fucking-lutely not going to be. Which is bullshit, but ah what're you gonna do?

       I think that's spot on - I don't know if Bernie would have won, but HRC's Achilles was the white, rural voter without a college education. Bernie Sanders would have done so much better with these voters. And, he could have hardly done worse with the Hispanic and African-American voters than she did.

       The Hispanic vote is more wiley than Dems anticipate, mostly because the projected machismo of R politicians is in line with their culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indians are also squirrel voters because many have conservative business values, coupled with a desire for immigration to be done fairly. Plus some are anti-Muslim.

       I watched the election with an Indian co-worker. The entire night at the office. He emigrated legally. It took him 5 years. Granted he was pro HRC, but I think we both left the office shocked and not that upset given what could have happened.

       Indians are notoriously clannish within their own country, and then it's x100 when it comes to Muslims.

       Even today my friend's (Indian) family flipped their shit when she said she wanted to marry her (Muslim) boyfriend. They dated for 5 years to try and pave the way for it happening.

       The polls that weren't fucking bent. I said from so early on that the "polls" I were seeing were not matching my own talking to people. Not so much more pro-Trump support. Just ANTI-CLINTON. That's why this blame game that is going to be played is going to be ridiculous. It was her fault. No one liked

       That I doubt, because none would've been as aggressive on the Clinton corruption as other Rs who are likely just as corrupt and they know it.

       Public works and a huge, unnecessary wall, along with expensive deportation squads and trips home for illegals, are not exactly conservative.  Neither is intervention in the Middle East, but Republicans have never really been conservative with defense spending.

       On what planet is using the immigration laws, and law enforcement officers we already have a deportation force. You act he is going to hire a gestapo to kick in doors and drag brown people back across the border. What will happen though, is people deemed to be illegally in this country will be deported
 No longer will our government ignore the law.

       Given the Podesta emails, that is probably very true.  Trump needs to be very careful in the analysis of his win.  Many of his votes, mine included, were against the corruption of Hillary and the DNC team.  If Trump returns to corporatocracy, he will be doing exactly what his supporters voted against.

       They had Ted Cruz. Remember the bit about his grandfather or something being involved in the Kennedy Assassination plus him being Canadian. Much like the reason Joe Biden didn't run is because they have on tape acting like the Pedophile he is.

       That came from the Trump campaign after he was already behind though. Ted Cruz

       Maybe the Trump campaign put it out there. Maybe they didn't. But you can bet the Hillary campaign would have used it to bury Ted if he had been nominated.

       I don't think so. Trump was just relentless in his campaign and it all paid off. I'm not quite sure any other republican could've had the same impact that Trump had with the voters

       Yes Bernie would've been 100% the winner but Hillary decided to steal and buy her way through the DNC primary.  I would like to thank Wikileaks for the great work it did.  I took WikiLeaks serious, but when the USA put pressure on Guatemala to stop Assange I took WikiLeaks as the bible.

       Good going DNC and Debbie the cunt Shultz. You stole the race from the best candidate the USA had PERIOD in over 50 years. The DNC just let a pedo, Corporate  bought, foreign nation funded, cannibal and war monger run over a fucking SAINT.  WELL FUCKING DONE!

       So true man! This election has shown me that the one true thing we Americans are united on is our disdain for in-your-fucking-face corruption.

       Didn't work, we don't play that game next time listen to the peoples will, the whole purpose of the primaries is to determine who the
       <em>
        people

       want to nominate for their party, when you steal this fundamental choice from the people...well...we don't forget....

       I've been saying this all night and since the primaries -- did they honestly think people were just going to forget? You're right, things will never be the same, yet to be determined for better or worse. Either way, people blaming third party votes or non-voters should be blaming the DNC.

       A real investigation into those leaks would be a good start. I still believe there's some real shit there. But the democrats could not have fucked themselves any harder. Presidency, house, senate, at least one justice. This one hurts already.

       That can still happen though, in any of the upcoming elections. As much as I hate to say this, many of us Americans seem to suffer from political amnesia, peppered with a bit of begrudging trust for career politicians and a side of mashed potaters and gravy.

       Oh, because I was more thinking about the whole taking millions of dollars in bribes from foreign countries like Saudi Arabia. Especially when said bribes are in exchange for controversial arms deals. And it doesn't help that Wikileaks proved that Clinton knew that Saudi Arabia gave clandestine support to the 9/11 terrorists and ISIS, but yet still accepted the bribes and still approved the deals.

       I'm sure we'll mostly hear about the sexists. Hilary hadn't lost yet, just close to Trump in a state she perceived she would have a landslide victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some chick pundit on NBC held up a word cloud with the most common words when Clinton was searched on the internet..."liar, untrustworthy, corrupt" etc, in huge letters.
      </p>
      <p>
       She said "people have this singular view of Hilary. But I think we need to talk about sexism. I think we need to finally talk about the white male voter turn out and what that means for a woman blah blah blah"
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously bitch? I'm a woman, let's talk about that word cloud. The reasons people said they wouldn't vote for Hilary had nothing to do with female stereotypes. No one said Hilary was too weak or too emotional or that she has periods or whatever. They said she was a fucking lying criminal. That had nothing to do with gender discrimination and everything to do with her being a fucking lying criminal!

       That's what the founders wanted to happen in these situations. It's outlined in the first two paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
       </p>
       <p>
        We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. —
        <strong>
         That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
        </strong>
        Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
        <strong>
         But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
        </strong>
        — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.
       </p>

       I can't wait to put this on FB then get called a crazy constitutionalist. Or a sexist, or racist, or a bigot, or a misogynist. Or whatever. Basically I can't wait to get blamed and called a horrible person for trying to do what our founding fathers implored others to do. I'm definitely the uninformed idiot though, right?

       You're not suggesting a political party strength is rooted in the electorate lending votes are you? That some respect for those voters, along with responsiveness to their requests is a reasonable courtesy for borrowing that power? Wow. This will re-write everything.

       Same in every way. It hurts, but there's no way I *wasn't going to vote against Hillary after the stunts that she/the DNC pulled to get her the nomination.

       I agree with you on that, but Trumps answer to taxes and healthcare definitely won't help me... I am a big fan of his space program though. (Assuming he can actually get it done.)

       It's about anti-establishment. There was one anti-establishment candidate to vote for. There should have been two, but the Democratic party gave us Clinton to vote for.

       It starts with the DNC colluding with Hilldog. She is easily the most corrupt politician of this generation, so wanting to end that also means not voting for her. Then it moves on to the values of the party. I have a violent past I work very hard to move further from all the time, and when I see our party sitting silent as people are bloodied for wearing maga hats, it is clear this is no longer the party for social acceptance of all people. Add in them supporting domestic terrorism from BLM, and I am driven to destroy what my party mutated into. Trumps camp accepted me, a middle eastern Jew, without hesitation. S4p banned me as soon as I suggested Trump was a better candidate than Hill. The left is so fucking vile now it sickens me. They are racist, sexist, an ironically, those are the two things they claim to hate most about Trump.

       You sure about that? Considering it's already been proven that the voting machines are more than capable of being rigged to flip votes from one person to another. I'm more inclined to reason that the DNC cheated during the primaries because they knew Clinton couldn't get the nomination legitimately. Why do you think the exit polls had such a large difference compared to what the totals showed?

       It was clear that Clinton's and the DNC were answering to non voting masters. What happens to all the money that was donated?

       My theory is;
      </p>
      <p>
       When Trump was crushing the primaries, the Dems thought "fuck it. We could run a Ficus against Trump and still win"
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet they knew that Bernie was more solid than Hillary, but Bernie would have been a pain in the arse to work with, for all the donors and masters behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They went with Hillary because she understood the game and plays along. They thought that even though she wasn't an actual alternative for people who don't vote Republican, they'd still vote for her because... well, Trump. I mean, the guy's a walking fucking punchline. Who could lose to that clown?

       Read the newer dncleaks, just this past week, and you'll see that Hillary was the assured candidate before she even announced.  The organization had all contingencies planned.

       Also American's noticed all the shit going on. Crazy revealing emails were being released daily, and not one network (besides fox) reported on it. Instead it was "look at this picture of trump looking at a little girl weird because it was captured at just the right moment". Americans aren't stupid and that shit got on their nerves.

       Clinton ILLEGALLY stole the presidency from Bernie, a man who had an 83% approval rating during the primaries, and literally handed it to Trump. The DNC should be ashamed that they put private interests over a true progressive candidate that was capable of defeating Trump. Let it be known that the DNC sacrificed democracy to line their own pockets, and in doing so gave the presidency to the worst candidate in American history. We do not live in an age where corruption goes unnoticed. Lets hope the Democratic party has learned their lesson, and no longer allows criminals to run for president for the sake of personal interests

       How exactly did they illegally stole the presidency? You are fucking nuts I swear. Repeating this enough doesn't magically make it true. The biggest thing the DNC can be accused of is wanting Hillary to win which of course is true, but what exactly did they rig and how? The "worst" evidence is that they talked about bringing up Bernie's religion in an effort to discredit him, which didn't even happen.

       There is conclusive proof in wikileaks articles that shows the DNC conspired against Bernie. The mathematical chance that the primaries wetebt rigged are 1 in 77 billion. You can ignore facts all you want, doesn't mean it didn't happen.

       I'm not IGNORING them for fucks sake, I'm literally asking how did they do that because I don't know, everything I've seen so far are just stupid private e-mails talking shit about Bernie, absolutely no evidence of any actual rigging. If you have it, show it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking this as someone that actually liked Bernie. The problem I have is that I see false facts repeated over and over until people start to believe them just based on that, and not on actual evidence. I've already asked a number of people and none would provide any evidence, so you can be the first.

       Did you read the article yourself? Did you evaluate the evidence presented there? I asked how exactly they rigged it, you provide me with e-mails of talking shit about Bernie, but what were the actual measures and actions taken? If you claim they illegally stole the Presidency then you better back it up with something concrete, not shit talking in mails, which is not illegal.

       I... I honestly don't know what the election season would have looked like if we had Bernie instead.

       When Clinton went low, Trump went low, and it was a race to the bottom. Bernie was a great candidate, but the whole dynamic would have been different. (probably all for the better too)

       Clearly this sub is very pro-bernie, but I don't think it's at all a sure thing.  Trump played very well to outmanoeuver his opponents, and I think he would bring the same skill against Bernie.  He would find a flaw in his character or platform and magnify it for everyone to see.

       I'd like to see what happens if they do that... Second Amendment nuts coming out if Trump lost the vote is one thing, but its entirely another thing if he wins the vote and they pick hillary anyway. At this point doing that would be a major mistake.

       Let's not forget Sarah Silverman calling Bernie supporters "stupid" at the convention, at a time when tensions were particularly high. Or the blatantly condescending attitude the hardline Dems had for Bernie supporters. Or the fact that Bernie supporters were called "babies", "whiners", and accused of being racist, misogynistic, and anti-LGBT for simply wanting their preferred candidate to get the nomination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night, some talking head said something along the lines of "Clinton was expecting [former Bernie supporters] to cross over, and that just didn't happen." How was that a shock? Who in their right mind didn't see that coming? You can't insult and belittle a large group of people who are ardent in their beliefs -- who are vocal about not wanting more of the same old establishment crap -- and expect them to suddenly vote for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC has nobody -- and I do mean
       <em>
        nobody
       </em>
       -- to blame but themselves.

       Like Hillary declaring Trump supporters deplorable and irredeemable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did she not realize that was Hitler Nazi style rhetoric?
      </p>
      <p>
       She meant to marginalize over half of the voters. Call them irredeemable. That's the first step to saying they are worthless and need to be gassed. That's where that sort of rhetoric gets you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on a tactical level, it was astoundingly stupid to say. First off, you are not convincing your own support base of anything. It's just more echo chamber ranting and hateful. Hillary supporters already demonstrated their hatred and disdain for those they don't agree with and their efforts to silence over half of their own party members by marginalizing their vote and rigging their own system. Did she think that demonizing Trump supporters would win over those who were disaffected and disallusioned by her efforts to belittle them and mock their support for Bernie with personal attacks? That's impossible. She only made them empathize with Trump supporters who were now feeling the lash of her nasty tongue. They would well relate to suffering under her dirty tactics and nasty hateful rhetoric. Now, still stinging over a rigged primary and the attacks and being marginalized by their own party they see the same tactics being used on Trump supporters. No doubt a great many empathized and then refused to vote at all. I mean, not voting for Hillary in the face of a surging Trump campaign was the greatest "Eff You, Hillary" they could muster. And it worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on the other hand, her nasty hateful rhetoric did nothing to win over her opposition and instead caused them to galvanize and head to the polls when a great many of them might have gotten lazy and neglected to vote. She's calling them "irredeemable". Who wants her for president? It was sickening and outrageous speech. I might not have voted if it wasn't for that one crack. That pissed me off more than all her scandals. If I could have done it and not gone to jail I would have gladly thrown a shoe at that evil nasty woman. But, not being fond of jail and being very fond of walking around in the sunshine all day I would never do such a thing. However, I can sure empathize with those who do and sympathize when they rightfully get jailed. Hopefully they will think more clearly during the next election cycle. And hopefully the DNC learned something valuable and took away the right lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously though, I doubt it. They've been doing this for a great many years and unless they do their own purging of the ranks they will continue to double down on nasty and repugnant tactics and hateful rhetoric.

       There is a big circlejerk of finger pointing anytime a party loses.  Maybe he could have done better with white voters but his position was so radical, and he was so untested in the primary, it is a stretch of "revisionist history" to say he would have won.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all the Bernie people pretty much lost too as Trump's ideas on healthcare and immigration are farther from Bernie then Clinton.  The one major progressive reform this decade, "Obamacare" could very well be dismantled.

       Well Hillary didn't beat them fair and square. She took the nominee away from Bernie and then was like "Fall in line, bitches!" At that point, they don't care to see things through. It's about just stopping her. She represents more than just her views.

       I compare it more to the "Brexit" mentality.  A big middle finger to the "elites" or "establishments" who they feel screwed over by.   At least this will only cost us 4 years and not 20.

       I hate to generalize people, but unless you were voting for the man, and not his policies, Sanders supporters are the most irrational people I've seen if they are happy about this.  Sure you can hate Clinton, but she was far closer on nearly every issue then Trump.

       Two?  He gets one.  Justice Scalia (ultra-conservative) is being replaced theoretically by a conservative.  Any court rulings since 2005 would come out the same.  (including upholding Obamacare and gay marriage).  If a liberal judge was added

       I wanted Bernie to fuck the system.  He promised to reign in corruption and money in politics.  If he's a shill(like he turned out to be), I'm more than happy to sacrifice the extra and let a blundering child do the raping of the system.  You misunderstand what is important to me and a lot of Bernie voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       He represented the ideal shift from the oligarchy.  Now we're stuck with Trump as the only option with that.  His promise to reign in corruption in Washington via term limits and lobbying bans resonates with us who want the system fixed.  If I have to sacrifice a few things to get what I want.. well.. I tried really hard for the better option.  I will have what I want with my vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like I did.  I can't wait to see the shit start to crumble and the voice of the people to actually be heard instead of decided for them by the masters.

       They are individuals who look out for themselves only.  They don't care what's best for the party or the country.  They see money and power within their grasp if Clinton gets elected.  They get positions and big salaries and career advancement by helping her win.

       The Democrat party needs to take a hard long look at itself in the mirror and ask themselves if rigging their party for the candidate that has OWNED them for 20 years has been worth it. They need to ask themselves why they allowed someone like Trump to beat them....badly. They nominated the person that is THE MOST polarizing figure in modern day politics. They nominated someone with SERIOUS problems with the truth. They nominated someone with more baggage than the entire Duggar family. They nominated someone that probably should be in jail. They nominated someone with more scandals attached to their name than anyone I know of.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they did this during a time when people are SICK AND TIRED of the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't really think that through. I hope it was worth it. I wonder if any heads will roll at the DNC. Something tells me there won't be.

       Sanders lost my respect when he endorsed Clinton and crawled into her shadow. Sanders vs Trump would be a different game, but not necessary one sided. Just like every libtard on the internet told me Clinton is going to win by a landslide and Trump is a lunatic..

       Hillary is basically a republican and doesn't give a shit about the environment either, so we'd of been screwed either way. I'm way more worried about the republicans controlling congress than our newly elected dictator.

       There are 330 million people in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of eligible voters is 235 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of 18-34 year olds who are eligible to vote is 94 million (40% of the total electorate).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, ONLY 4 MILLION VOTED (4% of the youth electorate) in the primary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the level of willful ignorance and shameless apathy is mind-boggling.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the age of the internet, ignorance is a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The youth need to get their act together. They need to stop what they are doing and put their life on hold and become well-informed on all the major issues of today and devote their time, energy, talents and resources to the political process to make sure that only the most Loving and most Wise among us become our public servants so that we can then finally transition to a Whole New Way of Living rooted in Love and Wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       If even only 80% of the youth electorate invested the time and energy to be well-informed and actively involved in the political process, it would be enough to overcome any election rigging and ensure that we have a progressive President, at least a 2/3 progressive Senate, at least a 2/3 progressive House, and a majority progressive Supreme Court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my proposal:
First the cities, then the states, then the nation and then the world.
Creating a Wonderful World. (let's get it done already)

       Well said.  I have considered the elections a fraud and forgone voting over the last 2 decades. While I have traditionally leaned left, I was so disgusted with DNC antics that I decided to vote just in case it wasn't rigged. As you said, my vote that would have  probably been for Bernie was given to Trump.  I am still on shock that Donald won.  Not because I like him,  because I was so certain that Hillary would steal it.  I am glad I am wrong and this somewhat restores my faith in the system.

       There you go. I knew it. I just felt sure that Hillary's ugly tactics against Bernie would back fire.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Like Hillary declaring Trump supporters deplorable and irredeemable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Did she not realize that was Hitler Nazi style rhetoric?
       </p>
       <p>
        She meant to marginalize over half of the Trump voters. Call them irredeemable. That's the first step to saying they are worthless and need to be gassed. That's where that sort of rhetoric gets you.
       </p>
       <p>
        But on a tactical level, it was astoundingly stupid to say. First off, you are not convincing your own support base of anything. It's just more echo chamber ranting and hateful. Hillary supporters already demonstrated their hatred and disdain for those they don't agree with and their efforts to silence over half of their own party members by marginalizing their vote and rigging their own system. Did she think that demonizing Trump supporters would win over those who were disaffected and disallusioned by her efforts to belittle them and mock their support for Bernie with personal attacks? That's impossible. She only made them empathize with Trump supporters who were now feeling the lash of her nasty tongue. They would well relate to suffering under her dirty tactics and nasty hateful rhetoric. Now, still stinging over a rigged primary and the attacks and being marginalized by their own party they see the same tactics being used on Trump supporters. No doubt a great many empathized and then refused to vote at all. I mean, not voting for Hillary in the face of a surging Trump campaign was the greatest "Eff You, Hillary" they could muster. And it worked.
       </p>
       <p>
        But on the other hand, her nasty hateful rhetoric did nothing to win over her opposition and instead caused them to galvanize and head to the polls when a great many of them might have gotten lazy and neglected to vote. She's calling them "irredeemable". Who wants her for president? It was sickening and outrageous speech. I might not have voted if it wasn't for that one crack. That pissed me off more than all her scandals.
       </p>
       <p>
        If I could have done it and not gone to jail I would have gladly thrown a shoe at that evil nasty woman. But, not being fond of jail and being very fond of walking around in the sunshine all day I would never do such a thing. However, I can sure empathize with those who do and sympathize when they rightfully get jailed. Hopefully they will think more clearly during the next election cycle. And hopefully the DNC learned something valuable and took away the right lessons.
       </p>
       <p>
        Seriously though, I doubt it. They've been doing this for a great many years and unless they do their own purging of the ranks they will continue to double down on nasty and repugnant tactics and hateful rhetoric.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So I suspected that many would be Bernie voters would actually be so pissed off that rather than sit the election out they would go so far as to vote for Trump. I was right. I wonder how many people there were like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually wanted to vote for Cruz. I would have. But Trump waged a mean and nasty primary campaign and got the nomination. He had alot of help as well and admitted he took advantage of a system that is now openly rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some asked him how he was so sure the system was rigged. He responded with stunning candor. "Because I take advantage of it". What can you say to that. He hates the rigged system but is willing to take advantage of it in his goal to get elected. That kind of pissed me off. But his honesty stunned me. I began to see myself in his assertions and rhetoric. I too hate the game but sadly we play politics at construction jobs as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ya, Trump hates the game but he learned to play it well. And he did. The problem with Ted Cruz is that he let himself take offense to a dirty game they are all playing. And Trump did go low. Like Cruz I forgave Trump and decided, he may be the lessor of two weasels but he sure isn't a corrupt monster like Hillary. So I voted Trump. He can be my president. I never felt that way about Obama. Each speech he made was full of snarky insults and clever nuanced speech. Sure, Obama plays the dirty politics game too. But he has no chill, is thin skinned and when he was in a position of power he gloated over his power and abused it and went far beyond decency with executive orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I hope to see Trump change things.If not, I'll realize that once again We the People have been had. Don't let us down Trump. America is watching.

       Yup.  And I've been conjecturing this evening that maybe the FBI , thwarted by DOJ, has directed its attention to better ensuring election integrity.  There's

        speculation

       that Anonymous and some election integrity activist lawyers got the FBI involved in Ohio, back in 2012, and that lead to Rove melting down on live TV as his planned theft was intercepted...

       I don't know so much about "normal", more or less just back to actually allowing people to shitpost &amp; troll how they please hopefully with more lenient rules &amp; the moderators chilling the fuck out on the ban hammers &amp; abuse of power, all out power tripping because of their political bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just yesterday I was banned from r/worldnews and I asked the moderators why I was banned, and the response was because I was being "disparaging" towards Islam for having the opinion that Mohammad was a warmongering pedophile who beat Aisha into submission (and remember, "Islam" means "Submit" or "Submission") &amp; raped her by todays Western standards, whether or not Aisha consented, it's still rape, and there's no amount of sugar-coating that Islam can do to explain that it was simply "consummating the marriage", fact remains that if Mohammad were alive today in the U.S. he would be charged with pedophilia &amp; sent to prison just like Subways Jared a short while back. This isn't ignoring that life expectancy back in Mohammads time was shorter, this is just comparing to how Mohammad would be treated in todays modern world as opposed to then. I don't think the moderators over at r/worldnews understand that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure I might've been a little assertive in establishing my opinionated (and biased) point but still, I can't call that being "disparaging" towards Islam by the very definition of the word "disparaging", just like how people throw around the word "racist" when they actually mean "prejudice" these days, they use these words without understanding or knowing what they mean.

       I call bullshit.  The base did this to itself. All Democrats had a chance to vote for Sanders. All independents had a chance to declare party affiliation, like I did, and vote for Sanders. But we didn't vote him in. He lost. No matter what the DNC did, it was the people of this country who failed. And now we're going to pay for it.

       One can only imagine the unfathomable things clinton has done to win this presidency and what she was going to do, and what favors she was going to pay back when she won. Now what has she? Wouldn't be surprised if she really IS dying and that is why the electoral votes swung to trump.

       Let me just say if it wasn't for Trump exposing and talking about the corruption openly it would have gone under the radar. We needed a political outsider with enough  balls to talk about what the DNC and Washington has been doing for years.

       What corruption would that be? The republicans in North Carolina openly gloating about suppressing the black vote? Numerous republican legislatures closing down polling booths and restricting early voting ensuring that there would be 3-4+ hour waits? Voter ID laws that prohibit minorities from voting?

       How about the DNC openly rigging their primary for one candidate, the DNC chair losing their job for being caught and then being hired immediately to the campaign they were helping behind the scenes, one candidate getting debate questions ahead of time, and collusion between the Democratic campaign and the media networks for starters?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody cared because the propaganda machine in the election year had so many believing Trump was a racist and sexist. They tried to hide their cheating and corruption behind finger pointing and distractions. It almost worked and if Hillary won nobody would have cared. We knew politics was dirty but it was finally exposed as to certain things that go on.

       If it wasn't for Wikileaks and Trump, who was a political outsider, having the guts to openly talk about this during the campaign then it would have gone unnoticed. As it is you don't care and all the Hillary voters didn't care about her and the DNC's open corruption. That is scary to me that propaganda works that well on the public. The corruption was exposed before your very eyes and yet you believe the corrupt telling you the other guy is worse.

       Mate, please. I don't think the Democrats are anything less than the Less Extreme Faction of the Business Party. You're welcome to try to find anything I've ever posted that suggests otherwise. But the fact remains they were the lesser evil than your violent lunatic who you have deified like a North Korean talking about Dear Leader. That's a shit situation and needs a group up change not just sitting idle for 4 years and then voting for whoever the party hacks foist up.

       This election many people were voting against the other candidate rather than for their own.  Many Trump supporters were because they didn't want more of the same old exploitation of the american public by an elite above the law.  Clinton was this incarnate.  Bernie represented a lot of positive change and I think he would have collected many of the anti-Clinton votes.

       It wasn't just sanders. I can't believe Biden and Kerry and maybe others didn't have some want to run but were told they wouldn't have the support if they did. HRC was basically crammed down the throats of Democrats. It wasn't a fair primary. The wise part is all the bad things about HRC were known then. But they went ahead and just decided it was time for a woman to be president without caring about the process.

       Dirty politics and rigging the system and cheating in the primary. She carried that into the election campaign but got caught out cheating. Cheating in the debates for one. She had the questions ahead of time, she had a teleprompter screen on her podium. She had a mic to her ear. You could actually hear it at one point. She was literally reading off her podium screen and it was obvious.

       It's easy to say that now,  but Obama had a 55% approval rating going into this election and usually a 50+ incumbent approval rating gives that party candidate a nice boost which she obviously didn't get.

       More or less. I think he really wanted to win but DNC sent a message from the Hillary campaign with promises and threats. They had something on him according to the Podesta emails. What it was is still unknown. Podesta complained that Bernie was not playing according to the "agreement" and "don't we have leverage on him?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Like in Mexico politics. "Plata O Plumo"  Lead or silver. In this case, the lead was "leverage" of some sort and the silver was an unknown "agreement". Bernie tried to actually win and got put back in check. So he couldn't deal with it and just conceded the primary to Hillary. If you are going to fall on your sword it's best to do it in one sharp cut rather than hacking it out with a dull butter knife.

       Neither Putin nor the USA can afford a war with each other. Especially in this time with the Islamic world on fire with ISIS. Oh, and Putin was spot on when he claimed that Hillary created and funded ISIS and John McCain helped. I saw a photo of John McCain meeting with "moderates" and agreeing to help them get weapons and other aid for their rebellion against the Syrian regime. Now we find that several of the people in that photo took the arms and then promptly switched to ISIS. Meanwhile Russia and Syria are the only major powers to fight ISIS while USA has been doing tiny pinpricks to look good in the media while at the same time dropping bombs on Russian troops and Syrian troops. Obama and Hillary have been shameless.

       Depends on how you mean "afford." I think there is a lot of good evidence that a significant portion of the ruling elite and deepstate feel that a war with Russia is the only thing that that can maintain US hegemony in the face of the death of the petrodollar. The general populace certainly can't afford it.

       Those fools can believe that. I've been looking at how the currency and our monetary system works for the past ten years. It's unsustainable. Nothing can stop it from crashing. It will happen. Just a matter of when and what the tipping point will be. Another huge war would speed it up.

       You're a retard. Maybe go watch this man's passionate speeches in Congress. He's one of the only real deals in the country. He only ran so he could represent the liberals in the democratic party due to elizabeth warren not running. Say anything you want about Clinton, but Sanders is nothing but the model human being.

       I know you don't know history when you say, "he served 4 terms".  He was elected to 4, but served only 3 months of that last.  Therefore, it doesn't surprise me the least that you mistakenly believe (and I realize you'll hold that ignorance 'till death) that FDR served two terms too many.

       lol I don't have time for high-energy redditing; I'm an adult with a good job.  Socialism is a beautifully rotten concept.  Socialists are thieves inherently, as communists are murderers.

       Whereas I like your post, Bernie would not have done better. The only reason it was close was due to the big money from the donors that Bernie opposed. Now, that is the very reason that I would've been conflicted in a Bernie/Trump showdown, just to contradict myself:)

       Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with him, all purely rational self-interested prisoners would betray the other, and so the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other.

       No this was another election of the lesser of two evils. Scary to think Trump is the lesser, either way our next president was going to have the lowest approval rating of any president elect in the history of tracking that.

       That's just not true. You have seen just how much all of those polls were worth that said Hillary would beat Trump. Those same people did the polling for Bernie vs Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not anti-Bernie. I'm hardcore Trump, but I would have lived with a President Sanders. He would have done what I want on foreign policy and trade, if not on social issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump doesn't have to be the most hated president ever. If he doesn't do what he said he would do to help the country, then by god hit him about it. I'll be right there with you. HOWEVER, I think you owe it to yourself to give him a chance. Look at his trade policy. Look at his stance on endless wars. Just take a break, take a breath, and look.

       I hope that you guys fix your party. I really do, but I don't think the answer for you is to go more to the left. America soundly rejected it tonight.

       Probably has been said but I'll say myself... i voted trump. If Bern was up there against him, I would have REALLY thought about giving him my vote. And when I say that I probably would have voted Bernie. Because he was a candidate that was great. I told my friend the past month the super delegate system is fucked. And hopefully this will change in the future.

       It's kind of amazing if you think about it. If I try to look up Conspiracy to elect Donald Trump, the first theory that comes up is the original conspiracy theory that Trump is trying to help Clinton get elected. It's a perfect way to hide the real conspiracy to actually elect Trump. I'm actually leaning towards this theory too, unless his presidency turns out great. Damn I really hope this isn't true. Do you know others who have thought about this and do you know of any sources on this topic?

       Honestly I don't, although a lot of electronic polling machines were down apparently so maybe the nuclear option for Hilary was nixed when the machines weren't even used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I look forward to the end of this demonic russia narrative that Hillary was certainly going to make a big part of her presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if he is a pawn neither he nor Clinton know it, the people in control are going to be his staff and advisors and we have no idea who's really going to pick them considering trump is probably going to take advice when picking people.

       The scariest thing to me is that DNC looks at this and think "maybe we should have someone more conservative than Tim Kaine" next time. That probably will happen unless people protest and show their anger at the DNC.

       Ah, no she would had not beaten Trump, stop it with the insane idea. He beat Hillary and the stacked cart that was against him, he would had whooped Sanders too. Here is a strange idea for everyone, people that voted for Trump didn't just vote for him because they didn't like Hillary, but because they actually want him to be the president.

       You say that now. Bernie would have all the "Socialism is bad"-votes against him. Don't try to fucking blame the fucking stupidity of this country on the DNC. Half of America voted for a racist, hate-spitting, lying, tax-evading, climate change denying, women-by-the-pussy-grabbing demagoge and the whole world will have to pay for it. He could also win against Bernie, because of how bad this country is in realizing Trumps unfitness for the Office. The only one who will benefit from this is Trump- as it always has been.

       Is there anything to back this up? I get it, Clinton has done very poorly against Trump. But is there any reason to think Bernie would do better looking specifically at states? And more than that, done well enough to win?

       He wins Michigan and Wisconsin maybe, but wouldn't he probably lose Virginia and Nevada?

       It still makes no sense to me. He won, how can he still be correct? Either the whole system is rigged and she wins or it isn't and he wins. How did you get the desired outcome but still believe the whole system is rigged? It makes no logical sense. It's like posting a youtube video and claiming it's banned in the country you are watching it in.

       HAHAHA yall can say that but its not true. Yeah it would have been a different, much better election I can agree on that, but we will never know who would have won. You think Bernie would win, I believe Trump would have destroyed his socialist "ideas" in the debates.

       Or maybe getting Sanders out of the election, going to such extremes to derail him, wasn't so Clinton could win, but so Trump would have no real competition? Sanders would have beaten trump in every popularity contest, in every debate, hands-down. Maybe they knew Clinton was toxic and everyone hated her from the start? Maybe we've had it backwards all along?

       I disagree on that. Bernie isn't a criminal nor a liar, except when he started supporting Hillary. If he was the one against trump he would have won but this is the way it was supposed to go the elite wanted trump. The people thinks he's not a pawn but he is

       Bernie wouldn't get the FBI suspicion and no Wikileaks. And most people voting for Trump was mostly a vote to make sure Hillary won't get in. At least that's the reason I voted for Trump.

       no, he would have won. Trump only won because of all the corrupt shit that came out about hillary. He's just as hated as she is.

       Bernie actually is one of the most liked.

       Let this also be a lesson to the RNC and all the corrupt fuck-fuck games they did as well - you can do whatever the fuck you want as long as wikileaks and internet trolls are working with you instead of the other guy.

       Yeah we all knew. Still people are optimistic and had hope, I don't care if we lost, anyone who had Sanders back, watched him win to be torn down by the establishment. Well that to me was a sign that maybe they were to stuck up their own ass they would lose, and I was right. We watched as this country went the other way, do I actually think anything will change or we will have World War III, no come on. The only candidate that our enemies wanted to win watched him win, why would they start a war now. It's going to be an interesting 4 years, I imagine at this point this is what Russians feel like. I wonder if in 4 years those who voted for Trump will have the same emotion Russians had right before they brought down the Iron Curtain. My experience is when you piss off people like the base that just won Trump the election they are fickle and turn on you in an instant. Maybe people with $ and power will be smarter next election, but maybe Trump will be a good president, I always thought he could get more done than Clinton ever could; now we know with a full Republican controlled Senate, House, and Presidency that's probably true. We'll just have to see what happens. It's going to be one hell of an interesting time to be an American.

       The idea that this narrative was at least bolstered by the Trump campaigners, foreign secret services, etc. to demobilize crucial support, especially among the liberal leaning youth is apparently too far fetched.

       Because people don't just vote based on their own ideals, they also vote out of hate. People disliked Hillary, so they either voted Trump, Third Party, or not at all. Bernie is seen as FAR more reputable than Hillary, so he possibly could've secured those votes that got away and then also gathered those who disliked Trump by default.

       The rigged the voting process. They also made a secret agreement with him to fall on his own sword at some point and not try too hard to win. He tried to hard to win and they used "leverage" on him to bring him back in line. It was a completely corrupt primary.

       So... Here's my contrary position. A wet napkin would make a better President than Trump, quite literally. The wet napkin would not do anything and Trump will. We could view this as a bad thing. There's now an ego the size of Alaska in the Whitehouse. But, on the other hand, Americans are going to get a taste of what being uninvested in the political process gets them. We're going to see what polarized politics of fear results in.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... And maybe then we'll stop pretending that the party someone belongs to is the only qualification that matters. Maybe we'll vote for someone based on where we think the country will be four years down the line. We currently face several major problems that can be resolved, but will require compromise, leadership and vision... I'm not convinced that any of the three candidates we're discussing had those three attributes in sufficient quantity to resolve these issues, and that's a deep indictment of the entire process!
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a non-plurality voting system. We need bulk money out of politics. We need a shorter election cycle. We need to stop voting for our party and get to know all of the candidates. We need to care about
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       election, not just the Presidency. We need to hold candidates accountable for placing party above governance.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things should be obvious. They're not controversial in academic or business settings (except for voting system, which is more recognized as a concern today than 20 years ago, but still not on most people's radar) yet in our largest organization, they're brushed off as crazy talk.

       In a fair response to your assertion, it was the DNC in collusion with the GOP that got Ted Cruz out of the race. Ted Cruz could have won if he had not been so brutally attacked by the GOP RINOs and the Mainstream Media. The best they could come up with is that he has a "Creepy" smile. "Nobody likes him". Both ridiculous claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP pushed Trump out front because they could not stand the idea of a law and order Ted Cruz as POTUS. The Hillary camp actively participated in the effort because they knew they had no one to counter Ted Cruz and they were sure US voters would never vote for repulsive Trump. They were wrong. Hillary was so much more repulsive and add to that she is a pathological liar, "sick and tired" (she kept repeating those words and no one understood it was a tacit admission) But anyways, "At this point, what difference does it make?"

       yea lets elect a communist... 
incase you've never read the Communist Manifesto, which Socialism is based on, here are two key points:
"In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property(Capatilism)" - Communist Manifesto
      </p>
      <p>
       "Abolition of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists. " - Communist Manifesto

       Nope. Bernie would have brought you to social security, like we still have in some ways in Germany (it is not the best, but we got it nordic countries are better in that appartment).

       False. President-Elect Trump was going to happen regardless of the opposition, Bernie would have at least been in the competition though but Donald was going to win the entire time, there was never any doubt about who will be sworn into office next year.

       You know this will probably be an unpopular opinion here, but I think Bernie would not win the presidency agaisnt Trump. I agree that he had a much better chance than Clinton because this election was all about being against the traditional politics and Bernie would certainly have a lot of ground to play on there, but he would not be facing a politician. If the republican candidate was Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz I would absolutely give the win to Bernie just like Trump won against Clinton. The thing that Trump has that would beat Bernie imo is his boldness. Trump just doesn't care what people say about him while Bernie would be limited by his moral compass, he would be unable to outright lie for support something that we know Trump is more than capable of.

       Yes, but he is aggressive about the errors of the current political establishment. Ex: He says NAFTA was a YUGE mistake, but advocates for freer market deals which is kind of a contradiction. His policies are pretty much irrelevent to the greater voting public, all they need to see is the political establishment fighting vehemently against him. I'm not saying this is agood thing which is not, people should pay attention to the proposals of the candidates, but the reality is they don't. And the sad thing is Bernie probably could not fight him in the pit, the same way Hillary stole the primary from him, Trump would take the presidency from him. But that is just my opinion like they say hindsight is 20/20

       NAFTA and other such deals are not free trade agreements, they are a series of agreements between powerful corporations and their state puppets on opening up certain markets and protecting others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nafta has allowed American government subsidised corn to flood into Mexico, this forces the campesinos off the land into factories in the city or forces them to head north to work illegally in the USA - or their only way of staying on the land and work for the cartels growing weed. Nafta prohibits the Mexican government from taking action on this, it must treat the foreign corporations as if they were a Mexican corporation. What sort of free trade deal allows in government subsidised goods?

       I don't think you can say NAFTA is not a free trade agreement when "free trade agreement" is in the name of the thing. If you think that voter suppression and intimidation is the thing that clinched this election I feel sorry for you because you either are delusional or out of a job.

       Just because they name it something doesn't mean it is that. That's pretty shallow of you. You need to look at the substance not just symbolic gesture. Its becomes thing to name policies one thing when they do the exact opposite. Nafta is not free trade, 'no child left behind' leaves children behind, etc.

       Bernie was a weak socialist. The guy, far as I can tell never had a life outside politics. He's just a Marxist shill. He's not that good at it either. I like him as a person. I would love to sit back and have coffee by the fire pit with him and eat some roasted kebabs and chat. But I wouldn't ever vote for him. Even socialists in China have more realistic pragmatical views. The man was praising socialism in Venezuela for crying out loud. And ya, he sold out. Or was threatened from what I see in the Podesta email. They had "leverage" and used it to put him in check when he violated the "agreement". That's some high level rigging.

       You can argue that his candidacy is also the reason that Hillary lost.  To compete, she had to swing to the banner of the status quos.  Had Bernie's followers all voted for her, she would have won.

       Over half of eligible voters didn't even bother to vote actually. And you are right we'll never know how many of those that didn't bother to vote would of showed up to do so had Bernie been the Dem candidate.

       You want to try and figure out whats wrong with all of the Americans that would rather have a fascist buffoon as president than Hillary. I'd say how telling is it that amount of dislike for her is so strong that so many people would rather roll the dice with a nut job then allow her to continue making decisions that effect the American people.

       Vote in your local elections.  Don't make the Presidency define your country.  Get involved on a local level and don't act like a bitch.  Recognise the diversity and viewpoints within your community without trying to marginalise, oppress or slander those coming from different life experiences.  One of the biggest mistakes this election made was precisely that.  Go local.  That's my advice.  That and stay actively engaged.  This has been a shitshow, one that many will just bury their heads in the sand or play the blame game over for years to come.  Keep optimistic and keep trying and you can and will make a difference.

       I doubt that. Trump would have destroyed that cuck with a debate focused on policy as opposed to whether or not he's a racist rapist xenophobe. The Clintons took him down more than anyone else ever could. He's just too good. Bernie cucked out BIG TIME. HE ENDORSED HILLARY. He has no dick whatsoever. Donald Trump wipes his ass with Bernie Sanders.

       Bernie would have alienated every swing voter in the country.

       I know this place loves Bernie, but the fact of the matter is that he's a radical angry Bridge Troll who thinks that everything he does is just
       <em>
        right
       </em>
       , and that anyone who opposes him can't possibly have a valid opinion. Who thinks Compromise is beneath him and refuses to back down on anything. Bernie is the
       <em>
        worst
       </em>
       elements of the Democratic Party, and I say this as a strong Social Liberal who is still in shock. I'd have voted for Hillary over Bernie in the primary in a heartbeat if I were a primary voter. Bernie would have been a candidate that makes the country choose between
       <em>
        two
       </em>
       angry white men who don't represent their ideals but promise massive change instead of a madman and a moderate.

       You're exactly right. People think he would have won because he was polling well back in May, but once his policies were subject to the scrutiny of a general election campaign people would realize that he is way further left than most voters are currently willing to go and I think he would have lost bigger than HRC.

       I'll admit, Bernie was my biggest fear, next to having a satanic, pedo, traitorous liar in the WH. What scares me even more is you morons who would vote for either a socialist, or a traitor.

       It's you socialists running around screaming and crying and berning stuff in the streets. Socialism is an old and tired concept that never sustains itself. It's collapsed over and over each time it's tried. France failed the first time it was tried, Russia failed, China failed and had to adopt market principles in its dealings with the outside world, Cambodia failed, Vietnam is no longer so communist as it's policies failed. Cuba's socialism failed and is still a horrible burden on the people. Venezuela has failed with food lines looking more like Soviet Russia than a country that was once flooding with plenty for all. A lush tropical country that can't feed itself and once had a thriving industrial base. Marxism of all stripes is a failure.

       Good thing this archaic view of socialism is NOT and has NEVER been what Bernie proposed. On the other hand, did we collapse after FDR? Has every developed nation in the world that outranks us in health, education, happiness, etc. etc. collapsed also?

       Nope, because it is stupid to equate what Bernie was proposing with the shit that has gone down in Cuba or Venezuela. This would have been the easiest argument to debunk in a general election.

       I know you can give me all the quotes on socialism that seem to favor a European model of the Nordic countries. That's worked for years until of late when they decided to become multicultural and open their borders. Then it begins to break down. There are good things about those countries. Yes I agree. The problem is when you tax the working class to pay for the non working class. Rather, I would see the taxes exempted from the working class laborer and private family owned business and applied to multinational corporations and import tariffs. As well as strict border controls on economic immigrants. Want to come to a foreign nation? Then come to work or study or work and study. Not come to be a drain on the economy. If you come, you work. Come across the border illegally without permission and vetting, get deported and denied all benefits. No second chances. This is my greatest beef with socialism. It devolves into chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, you say you are for democratic socialism or what ever brand Bernie was or is for. Then how about honoring that? I voted. Doesn't my vote mean something? My opinion count? But you would rather deny my opinion and mock it with sneaky sophistry and insults. Truth is. No brand of socialism really is sustainable because it always ends the same way. Either gradually or rapidly or is sustained through force. If you want real freedom and espouse real freedom, then give me the freedom to opt out. I live here. It's my country. I adhere to the founding fathers idealism. That's what I want and that's my right. Respect that or realize people like me will never be with you on it and will always be against you. I will die and be gone soon. But there are millions like me who are waking up to the shame and sham that is "socialism". The war against freedom will never end until all freedom lovers are dead. You've got a long war ahead. We will never be silenced until we are dead. And you just found out from your own party what it's really all about.

        Despite receiving trillions of dollars in oil revenue over recent decades, Venezuela is in the midst of an unprecedented economic collapse, owing precisely to the redistributionist programs that Sanders has extolled as a model for the U.S. economy. Grocery store shelves are barren, hospitals have no access to vital medicines, rationing is under way, and riots have begun to coalesce in the streets of Caracas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ecuador’s President, Rafael Correa, is preparing to leave a country mired in a deep recession and facing a currency crisis. Like Venezuela, Ecuador has been ruled by a socialist government that was able to subsidize its social engineering projects through oil revenues. The end of the oil boom has left the government without the means of paying for its programs, and as Correa prepares to leave office – most likely turning it over to Vice President Lenin Moreno – he used a recent earthquake as a pretext for a huge tax increase.
       </p>
       <p>
        Argentina, the third of Sanders’ economic role models, is a country with immense natural and industrial wealth that has seen its economy strip-mined by a kleptocratic government. Under President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the government’s official statistics agency, Indec, released a steady stream of fabrications to disguise the country’s decline – which were accepted at face value by credulous people like Bernie Sanders. Now that Kirchner is out of office, Indec has corrected the statistics, and the story they tell of the country’s economic reality is frightening.“Commiserations Argentines, ”began a recent essay in the Financial Times. “You are now poorer than the Chinese, Bulgarians, Azerbaijanis, Turkmen, Mexicans, Malaysians and Gabonese, not to mention your beloved neighbours in Brazil. All is not lost, though. You are still a smidgen better off than those in Botswana and war-torn Libya.”,

       We didn't go down like Venezuela because we have a larger nation made up of 50 states rather than just one state.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also didn't collapse because these states have a varied industrial and manufacturing base. We are not just a one song hit or one horse show. More like a three ring circus of many players. It takes much more to bring down a large and diverse union of 50 states. We were in serious trouble and much of it was because of the bankers and the monetary system. We would have been much better off without FDR. He caused the depression to linger on for much longer than it would have with his idiotic stimulus plans. Most educated people now realize this and freely admit it.

       The fact remains, you can only do so much socialism and social economic "justice" and each bit tilts the scale against productivity and the national economic health. To say nothing of the welfare of individuals. It's all fine and good for those who don't work or never will work. But what happens when you have a flood of people pouring in for the freebies? Open borders to those who have no marketable skills and can't even read?

       Fact is, Bernie never had a real plan beyond rhetoric and hyperbole. We are already deep in debt to the tune of 16 trillion and rising and our national debt will soon outstrip our GDP. When that happens I suspect it will be our tipping point. Those nations you speak of have a tipping point as well. Most of them are almost there and it's not like they've never gone down this road before. They have. Germany sure did. Only West Germany saved the day for East Germany when their monetary system crashed. Nobody was there there save Zimbabwe and it continues to slide down the socialistic rabbit hole of insanity.

       This would have been the easiest argument to debunk in a general election.

      <p>
       I just debunked  your argument using Bernie's own words. He praised Venezuela system.
      </p>
      <p>
       He praised COMMUNISM when it was in fashion. Now he realizes he was wrong and is morphing it to another style of socialism that is also failing.

       So you lied and failed to remember the past. Sorry bud. Bernie is just an old berned out socialist of what ever stripe happens to be in fashion for the time being. The day will come with socialists will tell us that Sweden, Denmark and Germany just got it wrong and now there is a new flavor.

       Thing is, socialism in those countries could have worked if they had stuck to the Nazi version of National Socialism. Being Jewish I know that sounds crazy but socialism does work if you stop thinking of things in a childish manner. It must be forced on a population and indoctrinated into the national psyche. It must become a cultural thing where it becomes unacceptable socially to ascribe to any other system. And it must be strictly controlled and for the citizens of that country. That's why National Socialism worked for a time in Germany. But the problem with that model was Hitler. He was a maniac control freak. His entire government was a cult of personality and he was their god. Same for North Korea. Remember, Germany went from being one of the most advanced nations on the planet to becoming a pariah among the nations. Culturally Germany never really recovered from that shame of the holocaust. So that's where their brand of socialism ended up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they have the modern updated welfare states of EU and they opened the gates to let the world in and share in the free goods. We'll see where that ends up.

       Where was it headed in 2016? Towards universal healthcare (been there done that I other countries) free college? (been there done that even in the good ol USA prior to Reagan fucking it up) wealthy people paying more taxes? (woah look at Mr Cuba over here!!).

       I know brown/black people supposedly draining resources away from you is a huge issue, and it shapes your fears about “socialism”. As a hungry pathetic peasant asking for crumbs from the aristocracy, anyone would get truly upset when more peasants join in to ask for crumbs also. Less crumbs to go around for everyone. Kick the immigrants out (who happen to be brown and different – SCARY) and make the dining hall begging great again! You know what you and the peasant angry about splitting the crumbs have in common? You bend over and appreciate the aristocrats for doing a mighty fine job at feeding you, while they rob 80% of the bread for themselves, and increasingly take more and more of the share of the bread. Instead, you direct your anger at the person beside you who is also hungry and robbed by the aristocrats. You LOVE socialism for the wealthy (you pay for their losses when they fuck up), and yet pull every article in the book to defend do-or-die capitalism at the bottom. Congrats?

      <p>
       See, despite our differences on who to be angry at (the wealthy robbers or the poor paupers at the bottom), I can agree with some of your solutions. Some level of protectionism is required at this point to balance out the credit-driven redistribution of wealth that has plagued the world for too long now. I agree with Trump on his trade policies (were similar to Bernie’s).

      <p>
       One slight difference in perspective we might have, as an immigrant (and now citizen) is that you will find the greater share of immigrants ARE actually working and trying to educate themselves to be good contributors to our society. If they are illegal? I agree to boot them out (my dad waited 10 years for our visa to be approved). I always come back to our difference being that you think the immigrant is draining our economy, while I think the corporations that write their own laws these days are the ones actually draining the economy (BY THE TRILLIONS) and draining away our jobs. Wealth has transferred up the chain, and not towards welfare recipients in general.

       But hey, you say you are for democratic socialism or what ever brand Bernie was or is for. Then how about honoring that? I voted. Doesn't my vote mean something? My opinion count? But you would rather deny my opinion and mock it with sneaky sophistry and insults. Truth is. No brand of socialism really is sustainable because it always ends the same way. Either gradually or rapidly or is sustained through force. If you want real freedom and espouse real freedom, then give me the freedom to opt out. I live here. It's my country. I adhere to the founding fathers idealism. That's what I want and that's my right. Respect that or realize people like me will never be with you on it and will always be against you. I will die and be gone soon. But there are millions like me who are waking up to the shame and sham that is "socialism". The war against freedom will never end until all freedom lovers are dead. You've got a long war ahead. We will never be silenced until we are dead. And you just found out from your own party what it's really all about.

       The first step to making your point across is not quoting utter reductionist bullshit. If you want to learn the vision that Bernie has, read about FDR, not dumbass Chavez.

       Thanks for admitting where the blame was, and were it lies today. You would understand that an unfair financialized economy is the root of most of our troubles in 2016, but you are too busy freaking about brown people hitting he emergency room and the whole “they took our jobs!” simpleton complaint (hint: the corps took your job and saved a few bucks at your expense). The funny thing is that all your links about Sweden, Denmark, Germany, etc. all fall back to a migrant crisis caused by a military industrial complex run amok in the Middle East (did you know the Pentagon blew $6 TRILLION in the last 10 years that they can’t account for?... man! That’s one big ass welfare check you feel giddy about… that’s a bunch of salary raises that our workers could have had, but that you adamantly defend because

      <p>
       Again, my point is that whenever I get into conversations with the other side about “socialism”, I have to remind them each time that they live in a pure socialist Utopia (but for the donor/owner class). I have to remind them that the real enemy is not the unknown brown person wanting to work, but the fat white CEO pocketing most of the money and distributing it amongst friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       There IS a solution to all of this, and it means redirecting the TRILLIONS in handouts to corporations, towards a few billion that could provide a base of support for all Americans for the most important aspects of life (health, education, etc.)

      <p>
       Has every developed nation in the world that outranks us in health, education, happiness, etc. etc. collapsed also?
Nope. Too bad you didn't name those nations. Israel is one of those nations.

       While no one is advocating for open borders (aside from Hillary), do you know what has ACTUALLY tilted the scale against productivity and the national economic health? Socialism for big corporations. Trillions funneled to the top of the chain, while the bottom is forced to borrow their way through life with stagnant wages (but indeed growing corporate profits and stock prices!). Our government is captured, not by puny welfare recipients at the bottom, but by powerful leeches at the top. You need to understand who your true enemy is. In the words of President Lyndon Johnson:

       No, I'm not cool with the system that's in place. It's unsustainable and getting closer and closer to a tipping point like they had in East Germany and other countries where the currency was trashed. It's happening here. You can only raise the taxes so much to pay for unsustainable social programs and then print only so much fiat currency and the system will eventually fail. It always has. Sooner or later. Just depends on how many forces are at play. Venezuela has reached it's tipping point and may not survive as a government or a nation. Luckily they have plenty of friendly socialist countries around them so perhaps just the government will fail and be replaced by a more reasonable system.

       Actually,
       <strong>
        less
       </strong>
       than half of the people who voted wanted Trump. Actually about 48% at the current count wanted Trump, and on top of that, Clinton has about 200k more votes than Trump...
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically less then half of our country wanted Trump, and more people wanted Clinton then wanted Trump.

       Get this. We are a United States of America. Not one State. Then there is the electoral college.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a matte of gross numbers voting one way or the other. This is so that rural areas that are low in population have an equal voice as large populous states and small states get an equal voice. Rhode Island has a equal voice to California or New York.

       While I will not debate weather or not the right person won, I will say that the electoral college is absolutely not democratic and should no longer exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason for our country to not have a purely popular vote election in this day and age. With our ability to put all of the votes into a computer system and calculate them immediately, there is no reason not to just tally all the votes.
       <strong>
        PLUS
       </strong>
       It would make our system much more democratic. In our current system My vote in New York is worth MUCH less than the same vote in Vermont next door, and that is completely against how our system should be...

       Actually I know what you are saying but you are thinking about it the wrong way. The electoral college is a genius system, it was designed so that one big bunch of people in a small area cannot tilt the scale and have disproportional influence an the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, without the electoral college, a shit ton of Klingons could move into NYC, breed out of control, and then send the election whichever way they wanted simply because they had the numbers, without significant numerical consideration of the rest of the country.

       While True, The Klingons would control the election if they were able to obtain a majority of the population. We would have a majority of the population which holds the same values as the president. Right now the majority of the population does not support the views of our president elect, and for that matter a majority of people disagreed with all of the candidates.

       We were never meant to be a pure democracy. It's a representative democracy. A republic. If you don't like it then please leave. Go to a mob ruled country like China. Or Russia. Or even EU where it's against the law to speak your mind if it's not PC.

       I never worried for a second about a Bernie presidency. Sure he's a socialist. But he could only have done anything the way Obama did it. With executive order and eventually congress and the senate would rebel and there wouldn't be much he could do about it. Even now as I write this the GOP of both houses are crafting a legal rebellion to defeat executive orders that are unconstitutional.

       Hillary on the other hand has real financial and political power through her myriad connections and clandestine donors and foundations. CGI and the Clinton Foundations and dozens fanning out from those groups. It's a sick demonic octopus of power and corruption that Bernie can't even begin to imagine. Bernie is just a failed, berned out socialist who never had a clue.

       Public works and a huge, unnecessary wall, along with expensive deportation squads and trips home for illegals, are not exactly conservative.  Neither is intervention in the Middle East, but Republicans have never really been conservative with defense spending.

       The saddest thing this election proves is tribalism doesn't need to end, it wins. White men of America took a clear stand that they're scared of anything other than themselves. That's horrifying to anybody who realizes what could actually make America great.

       The DNC is supposed to be neutral to every candidate. The voters decide who is going to be the Democratic candidate, and the DNC oversees.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be clearly seen in the emails that it did not work that way. From day 1, they (the DNC with Debbie Wasserman-shulz at the head of it) treated it as if Hillary was their man. They disregarded Bernie, tried to damage his reputation, then disregarded the votes, etc. Effectively keeping him from being the candidate. When all this came to light, Debbie stepped down. But it was too late at that point

       funny how the blame has shifted completely to the DNC now. Not to do with her or the parties stances, not to do with her actions, but the DNC rigging NOW all of a sudden pops up. a week ago, not a single word of it

       and with that everyone keeps saying bernie would have won. that's not true either. bernie at least had different ideas than the status quo, but he would not have beaten trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       the sad part about bernie is, unless he was forced, his endorsement for clinton was just a big 'fuck you' and selling out to all the people who stood behind him. He kept going on about the 'big banks', then endorsed the candidate that is owned by them

       Honestly I don't, although a lot of electronic polling machines were down apparently so maybe the nuclear option for Hilary was nixed when the machines weren't even used.

       Either way, I look forward to the end of this demonic russia narrative that Hillary was certainly going to make a big part of her presidency.

       I think if he is a pawn neither he nor Clinton know it, the people in control are going to be his staff and advisors and we have no idea who's really going to pick them considering trump is probably going to take advice when picking people.

       I just think they're too hopeful and naive and unwilling to believe that their hero is part of a corrupt organization.
