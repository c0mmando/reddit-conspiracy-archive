       I think it means they didn't factor in Wikileaks and the extent of The private server,  the futures are Down 600 points if the elite planned for this you wouldn't see such a huge drop.  The elite are the only ones hedging bets in after hours trading and right now they are scared

       I would think that an incredibly powerful shadow-government would be prepared for either possibilities and would have already made plans with each one. I don't think either candidate would get this far without their support if said secret political exists

       I agree in general, but for this election, pretty much the entire american (and foreign) propaganda machine has been pushing Hillary to the max.  Billions of dollars, dozens of reputations, and uncountable biased articles trying to hypnotize/force everyone to vote for her.  There seems to be some special reason that they feel they
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to have her in office.  If Trump "wins", I'll expect something very terrible and dramatic to happen between now and January.

       They over played their hand . They are extremely powerful but not in total control. They put their faith in media collusion and smear campaigns on msm but msm is not used utilized they way it was . The internet is what the newspaper was since msm died we all became journalists and political analysts   problem is they can't pay or kill us all.  Now they will engineer financial system meltdown and blame trump mite take 4 years but establishment try promiss you stability after that with a bush or Clinton type.  They still have players inside that government.  Its not a total loss for them it just make things a little difficult and set back some plans.  The potus is only one guy  any choices or plans he wishes to institute must pass threw congress. don't worry im sure the illuminate  will be ok  . hope he drones them all but lol.

       it was meant to be, lol. I got to see behind the curtain (on the 5th of november) and got a glimpse of the shadow cia (independent from everybody else). I saw the sickness, it has a common name. Corruption. But then i saw something much much worse.

       yeah thats is. Its unfortunate that mindless bullies who are charming can get to these positions. I have experienced it on personal level but now i know its on a much bigger level.

       well watching it in the rec room on black &amp; white tv it was funny....
how did they get offa the moon .... especially given the level of tech was at in 1969 no n no we boasted and we had to do something cuz  the decade was almost over and so we were never there and  kubrick filmed it...[the rocks had numbers just like a stage set....
      </p>
      <p>
       im not a kook i am an empathet i think science should be open minded to allow the seen and the unseen thats to me quantum all the way trusting that the math is gonna take you in the right direction....
      </p>
      <p>
       and there is still so much more to understand......[ps has trump won? or not offiial yet?

       Seems business savvy people are all about win-win situations. Like how if you have the know how and resources you can make money even in a failing economy (a la "the big short.") I see more war with a Trump Presidency so globalist a have really lost nothing. Waiting for Trump to do an about face and tell us the TPP is a "necessary evil."

       There's no consensus, even here. This place is not a hive mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thoughts have always been that of course both candidates ate selected by the NWO/Illuminati/cabal whatever you want to call it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the cabal is split into factions that are fighting each other for control.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the answer is both. Yes they win, and yes they lose. Which factions win or lose is the real question.

       I think if there are groups like this controlling it... Either A) They want Hillary to become president to do their bidding.  Or B) They want Trump to become president to watch him crash and burn and then elect whoever the hell they want in the next election.  Either way we're boned.  I'm kind of thinking whichever party wins this election will lose the next one.

       Hillary pushed herself with her "own" funding, TPTB just let it go 'cause it stirs up drama and we all know they feed on our collective emotional reaction to this.

       I think it'll go to show that all this has been more of a charade than we expected. Hillary does some bad shit, but she isn't the bad guy. Trump comes out on top and pushes for a more "successful" corporate America.
