They swing us into thinking Trump is legit, but they always have hands in both pockets anyways. Is Trump really uncorruptible? He might be since he is already rich enough, but power corrupts. What do you guys think? I mean you guys have always said that the election is just an illusion where lobbyists have hands in republican and democrat pockets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the reality of the situation and I called it in posts here over a year ago. It&#39;s just another version of Obama - &quot;outsider upstart who cares about grand ideals comes to make america great again and beats the evil clintons and corruption blah blah blah, makes great promises while campaigning and convinces the stupid poor people that they&#39;ve got their guy in and they should calm down and play along&quot;.</p>

<p>He&#39;s the fake Ron Paul who will sell the willing public whatever new war comes down the pike to socialize the existence of Lockheed Martin &amp; Friends, and who will sell whatever new police state laws the rich folks want to pass, ostensibly &quot;only to be used on the evil muslims and bad minorities and illegals, not on good white god-fearing folks who I&#39;m making america great again for&quot;.</p>

<p>it&#39;s just such an obvious scam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought that once, but now I&#39;m convinced from the emails this entire election was made to consolidate power. The best way to consolidate power is to have one completely bought out person backed by the establishment to go against the anti establishment and most inept appearing person.  You can&#39;t have the inept scape goat be part of the system.  </p>

<p>Bear with me please.  The moves were in place when Hillary became the Secretary of state. The Haiti issue and its gold mines. Bill Clinton becoming the special envoy to Haiti.  The constant war state Hillary pushed for. I can go on for ages. Once the DNC primary came around Hillary and the powers that be pulled more strings.</p>

<p>They even pulled strings to get the most inept canidate to run for the GOP.  I really do believe that is where the power structure stopped.  They played all their cards to get Hillary into power and Trump was selected as the fall guy, never once considered to win.  </p>

<p>Now its a matter if he will be bought out or not.  The first step to finding out will be if he prosecutes Hillary.  We all know the DOJ, the POTUS and other agencies are protecting Hillary. If Trump throws the book at her that will be a clear sign that he won&#39;t be bought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is true but she had DOJ protecting and Obama protection.  Once the director of the DOJ is appointed and Obama out of office Hillary will have zero protection from those two. Meaning its a open game, I just hope he does something with her.

They also figured since they controlled the media she had it in the bag. Lets not forget about Wikileaks roll in exposing all this bullshit.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know.  I think the powers that be seriously underestimated just how hated Clinton was until the last minute.  That&#39;s why all of a sudden you have Obama and Clinton rushing around trying to do everything they can, going to rock solid blue states (or what we <em>thought</em> at the time were rock solid blue states, their last minute campaigning there should&#39;ve been a big tip off), holding big free concerts.  Think about it, Trump is the almost the perfect candidate for her to win against.  And she still couldn&#39;t do it.  I think they basically thought, &#39;Yeah, well, they&#39;ll grumble and whine but in the end, they gotta vote for one of them and no way are majority of people gonna get behind Trump&#39;  And it looks like majority of the country called their bluff.    I think they let Trump get this far because they honestly were too arrogant to think he could win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. He was hired to be the clown, and became more popular than the flesh-eating witch. He undoubtedly knows what the deal is. He&#39;s also a megalomaniac himself, and probably thinks he can save the country. Then there are those in the intelligence agencies and government who also know what the deal is and are protecting him, because they need him as a figure-head.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know.  I think the powers that be seriously underestimated just how hated Clinton was until the last minute.  That&#39;s why all of a sudden you have Obama and Clinton rushing around trying to do everything they can, going to rock solid blue states (or what we <em>thought</em> at the time were rock solid blue states, their last minute campaigning there should&#39;ve been a big tip off), holding big free concerts.  Think about it, Trump is the almost the perfect candidate for her to win against.  And she still couldn&#39;t do it.  I think they basically thought, &#39;Yeah, well, they&#39;ll grumble and whine but in the end, they gotta vote for one of them and no way are majority of people gonna get behind Trump&#39;  And it looks like majority of the country called their bluff.    I think they let Trump get this far because they honestly were too arrogant to think he could win.</p>
