       Call me crazy, but I think Trump winning might be the end game. They swing us into thinking Trump is legit, but they always have hands in both pockets anyways. Is Trump really uncorruptible? He might be since he is already rich enough, but power corrupts. What do you guys think? I mean you guys have always said that the election is just an illusion where lobbyists have hands in republican and democrat pockets.

       This is something everyone really needs to consider. If he wins, we gotta stay on point. Don't let HRC's defeat blind us to any Trump evil that could start to pop up after the election.

       Yes, it's the end game. But i think that he is NOT corrupted by power, he is the man who deceives and destroys, like the bible had warned us: "False Messiahs", "False Prophets" and "False Teachers".

       I misread your comment, I thought you were implying he was the one who destroyed the 'false messiahs', etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right, he is false, but not the false messiah.  The false messiah comes after Donald destroys the economy and the world turns to chaos.  The one who will come to 'fix' all of our problems.  The same one who created them in the first place.

       It doesn't matter.  He's not a criminal that we know of.  Better to have a stooge (not saying he is, time will tell) than a criminal.  Need I remind you, Hillary Clinton made Al Copone look like a beginner.

       This is the reality of the situation and I called it in posts here over a year ago. It's just another version of Obama - "outsider upstart who cares about grand ideals comes to make america great again and beats the evil clintons and corruption blah blah blah, makes great promises while campaigning and convinces the stupid poor people that they've got their guy in and they should calm down and play along".
      </p>
      <p>
       He's the fake Ron Paul who will sell the willing public whatever new war comes down the pike to socialize the existence of Lockheed Martin &amp; Friends, and who will sell whatever new police state laws the rich folks want to pass, ostensibly "only to be used on the evil muslims and bad minorities and illegals, not on good white god-fearing folks who I'm making america great again for".
      </p>
      <p>
       it's just such an obvious scam.

       I thought that once, but now I'm convinced from the emails this entire election was made to consolidate power. The best way to consolidate power is to have one completely bought out person backed by the establishment to go against the anti establishment and most inept appearing person.  You can't have the inept scape goat be part of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bear with me please.  The moves were in place when Hillary became the Secretary of state. The Haiti issue and its gold mines. Bill Clinton becoming the special envoy to Haiti.  The constant war state Hillary pushed for. I can go on for ages. Once the DNC primary came around Hillary and the powers that be pulled more strings.
      </p>
      <p>
       They even pulled strings to get the most inept canidate to run for the GOP.  I really do believe that is where the power structure stopped.  They played all their cards to get Hillary into power and Trump was selected as the fall guy, never once considered to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now its a matter if he will be bought out or not.  The first step to finding out will be if he prosecutes Hillary.  We all know the DOJ, the POTUS and other agencies are protecting Hillary. If Trump throws the book at her that will be a clear sign that he won't be bought.

       Let's say Trump throws the book at her, do you think she will go quietly? They learned from the first Clinton scandal that they need more dirt to leverage and stay ahead of the game. If she is prosecuted expect for her to not go quietly.

       That is true but she had DOJ protecting and Obama protection.  Once the director of the DOJ is appointed and Obama out of office Hillary will have zero protection from those two. Meaning its a open game, I just hope he does something with her. She needs to be taken care of. Otherwise they will fester and spread again.

       If they are so smart why did they run someone against an anti-establishment candidate that is widely known to be as establishment as they come, during a period of time when the general sentiment of the population was as anti-establishment as it has ever been? Either they are not nearly as intelligent as people believe them to be, or they knew Hillary was not well-liked and ran her anyway.  Which is it?

       They were running on the idea that a Hillary being a female was enough to engage the anit establishment people.  They also figured since they controlled the media she had it in the bag. Lets not forget about Wikileaks roll in exposing all this bullshit.  Before all these damning leaks came out Hillary had double digit leads in battle ground states and the wikileaks prompted the public be sated by having a faux fbi investigation.

       Highly doubt it just by looking at the spin from the media the last few months.  If they wanted Trump all along they wouldn't have pushed Hillary so much and so blatantly.    If Trump wasn't the end game though and he just pulled the breaks on the Government Gravy Train...well, I'd be investing in some kevlar if I were him.

       I don't know.  I think the powers that be seriously underestimated just how hated Clinton was until the last minute.  That's why all of a sudden you have Obama and Clinton rushing around trying to do everything they can, going to rock solid blue states (or what we
       <em>
        thought
       </em>
       at the time were rock solid blue states, their last minute campaigning there should've been a big tip off), holding big free concerts.  Think about it, Trump is the almost the perfect candidate for her to win against.  And she still couldn't do it.  I think they basically thought, 'Yeah, well, they'll grumble and whine but in the end, they gotta vote for one of them and no way are majority of people gonna get behind Trump'  And it looks like majority of the country called their bluff.    I think they let Trump get this far because they honestly were too arrogant to think he could win.

       Agreed. He was hired to be the clown, and became more popular than the flesh-eating witch. He undoubtedly knows what the deal is. He's also a megalomaniac himself, and probably thinks he can save the country. Then there are those in the intelligence agencies and government who also know what the deal is and are protecting him, because they need him as a figure-head. This becomes a very confusing scenario.

       Did he won? Google news says very close. No way Clinton loses, that would make zero sense. They just want to make it close, lije always.

       Let's say Trump throws the book at her, do you think she will go quietly? They learned from the first Clinton scandal that they need more dirt to leverage and stay ahead of the game. If she is prosecuted expect for her to not go quietly.

       If they are so smart why did they run someone against an anti-establishment candidate that is widely known to be as establishment as they come, during a period of time when the general sentiment of the population was as anti-establishment as it has ever been? Either they are not nearly as intelligent as people believe them to be, or they knew Hillary was not well-liked and ran her anyway.  Which is it?
