       Alright folks, let this be a perfect example of how irrelevant the bought and paid for mainstream media is. With 24/7 shilling across the board for Hillary they still failed. Despite CTR literally buying reddit, they still failed.

       The ignorant, vocal minority failed. They lost.

       Yes, one billionaire insider who dodges taxes and takes corporate subsidies is better than the other billionaire insider.  Keep telling yourself that.  Neither candidate was in this race for you.  Both are insiders with ties to the monied elite and the oligarchy that run our country.  But you keep thinking this is that miracle election where everything is better.

       There will be a power vacuum in the Democratic Party. Now is a better time than any for Bernie to take that role. I really hope he takes it up, because we may be seeing an Empire Strikes Back with Hillary.

       I don't think so. Him doing that would make him look like a poor sport right away. The only way that would have work is had she refused to consent (challenging her to being a poor sport). He has to unify a very divided US, and spending months convicting Hillary would lead to riots.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't care about the WikiLeaks as much as they care for who wins. It's solely our responsibility to reveal the rest of the leaks, and make the information public. It's solely our responsibility to keep the Clinton's (and anyone else corrupt, out of politics). Whether Clinton's in prison or Saudi Arabia, she still has a hand in US politics. Seeing what she has done already, i'm concerned about continued violence being incited.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a small victory today in slamming the face of one globalist movement, but Trump is still guilty until proven innocent. The responsibility on our shoulders is as heavy as it ever was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Glad to see this discussion. It should really be its own thread. I want her to be held accountable to. I've been anti-Hillary the whole way through. As I said before, we need to continue digesting these leaks, and distribute them into something easy to reference/understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think
       <a href="/u/-Toms-">
        /u/-Toms-
       </a>
       right. He needs to let the FBI and DoJ do its job. I'm sure Obama will be pressuring them before he leaves office. There's a likelihood Trump may end up putting someone like Giuliani (whom hates the Clintons) in the DoJ, and just letting them handle it. Perhaps then she will just flee the country, egging on the continued investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone else needs to fill the role she mounted for the Democrats though (please Bernie), or she could guilt trip/fund the public into doing some stupid shit. It seems counter-intuitive, but if I was in Trumps shoes, i'd reach out to some of the more honest people in the Democratic Party now, and ask them to step up and take the reigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we can get the info out there, some of the subreddits will be the backbone to dispersing this divisiveness of this country. Shedding its scales into a peace, through revealing the sheer criminality of these crime families. This does not just include the Clintons, although it starts with them.

       What will I personally do? Not a damn thing. That's why I voted for Trump. He might actually get something done. I'm just a guy with a job who likes video games and sometimes getting laid when the right girl comes along. I have no political aspirations and don't plan on getting into a political career. That being said, Clinton sucks and after reading a lot about her on this sub I hope she is dealt with accordingly

       the only thing Trump needs to do in regards to prosecuting Hillary is to just let the DOJ and FBI do their job instead of backdoor pressuring them. It seems pretty apparent to me they have stuff to move forward on. Like the email scandal, she DID send classified emails over an unsecured server, she DID send classified emails to people who didnt have clearance. The laws governing that DONT say anything about intent, which is why Comey said he didnt want to indict, she didnt INTEND to break the law. Well nobody gives a flying fuck, the law doesnt give a fuck about intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is she did it, the FBI knows it, the DOJ knows it. Get Loretta Lynch and the handful of other people shown to be in with the Clintons out of the DOJ and get Comey out of the FBI. Then let the chips fall where they may when people do their jobs.

       Hillary knew the law and decided she didn't care.  If FBI didn't prove that, it's because the investigation was curtailed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at this point, we don't care about the email server.  That's merely gross negligence.  We care about their use of the Foundation for profit, because they sold SAP level state-secrets to foreign governments.  Treason.  And hopefully they can bring her circle down besides.

       If Trump doesnt get her put on trial, I believe that would send a message to the entire ring of "corrupt politicians" that they have nothing to fear.

       Donald is a total wildcard, Bernie may get a bigger voice than he would've with Clinton. It would be a very smart move for trump to offer an olive branch to him, his approvals would skyrocket quickly. His base admires Bernie, even if they disagree with his positions. It would be a win/win for Trump and would humanize him.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A few months ago, I was interviewing Trump by phone and I recommended that he not pick a vice president whom the mainstream of the Republican Party liked too much. If he did, I told Trump, they might help get him elected and then get rid of him.
       </p>
       <p>
        And by that I meant impeachment — not the other thing.

       Uhh.. That's what the American system was setup to be. Through corrupt presidents and government officials being out into place through the years and pulling the wool over people's eyes it has slowly eroded to the point where it was becoming more of a dictatorship. The American constitution was founded on just that though, keeping the power with the people.

        "If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs."

       After the Brexit polls and this I'm convinced that they intentionally select regions that are favorable to the cause they have allegiance too.  I'm not much on conspiracy theories but its blatantly obvious the media has bias, and the polls support the bias, so what other conclusion can one possibly come to?

       It's not so much that the polls are faked, it's that the media worked to demonize Trump so much that people didn't want to admit that they were voting for him. They'd say they were undecided, independent, or straight up Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the DNC legitimately thought they had it in the bag, especially Pennsylvania, because of the polls showing their victory as the most likely scenario. They thought they'd have record turnout because people were afraid of a Trump presidency, but it appears that the opposite was true.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of disenfranchising the primary voters, they got complacent, and failed to recapture all of those blue collar and union voters who were such staunch supporters of Bernie.

       If Hillary had campaigned as if she was losing, she might have won. The DNC's and Hillary's arrogance lead to this, and they have no one to blame but themselves. It's going to be at least 2-4 years of a Republican majority Congress combined with a Republican President...a lot is going to change, for better or worse.

       I think she never had the charisma for victory, her only claim to political fame was being the wife of Bill. She's as qualified as Trump's current wife. I think things will change for the better, people are getting more involved in democracy. We are just gonna have to put up with a lot of stonewalling for the next couple of years,.

       Favorable representation in the media, being described as "muscular" or "tremendous", less negative press, favors for establishment Republicans in exchange for not stonewalling in congress, the list goes on. He only needed the popular vote to get into office, he's there until impeachment now.

       Politics is a compromise game, if you truly don't know this, it just shows you voted based on catchphrases. Nobody who increasingly promises such big, impractical things actually delivers, just look at Obama.

       You are correct. He will negotiate as negotiators do, but ultimately he has a game plan and he will stick to it. He's doing it so his kids will have a country with a future. Draining the swamp is pretty high up on the list, I definitely see it happening.

       Every president wants an easier job, and being able to spread the narrative that you want affords a leader an enormous amount of power.  Hillary promised news outlets exclusive stories in exchange for choosing how they were written, and somehow still gained about 50% of the vote despite this, and her rampant corruption, being exposed.  Spin is in huge demand in politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump will be president now, he doesn't need the private sector to help distribute stories.  Paired with the fact that Obama repealed the laws prohibiting the US government from making propaganda, Trump already has an effective mouthpiece for his narrative.  Anything he gave to news companies would be eaten up, and spun however he wanted in exchange for the exclusive rights to the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       His history with the media will have no bearing on his presidency, if he's smart.  Plus, he's already talking about coming together as a country, I doubt he'll even press for justice in the Clinton case.  He's in power, he doesn't need anyone else's approval now, until he runs for re-election, or needs the senate's favor upon impeachment.

       You're a fucking jackass for interfering in other countries' elections, and especially for backing such a dumbfuck. If your shitposting habits indicate your preference in politicians, I hope your shit country keeps the numb dolts it elects until you become so irrelevant that people assume you're part of Antarctica.

       Did you think to do any fucking research before you become a foot soldier for the guy? Of course fucking not. You're Strayan. You don't know he's a habitual liar, cheat, con man, megalomaniac, pompous, crass windbag. You don't know the majority of the country views him as a joke. You wanted to be a centipede because it made the other cucks on 4chan notice less that you only post boring prattle.
      </p>
      <p>
       News media in America has been discredited, biased, and outed for collusion in our country so many times, that people either ignore it or just get news from social media. And because of stupid, bored, unproductive, fucking attention seeking little shits like you, they have a completely wrong picture of what they're getting over the next 4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I could, I would give you my spot in this country as punishment for forcing this on people too young to vote. Since this isn't possible, I guess I'll just have to be satisfied that you're you, and you will have to be for the rest of your life. You truly are a piece of shit, and you deserve that the only thing people came to your shit island to see is now dying. Fuck yourself, hard.

       At the end of the day, if you run a shitty candidate you will lose. In this era of transparency, the internet, etc, very little goes unnoticed. The Democrats ran a candidate they KNEW was bad for the country and it should be no surprise that voters in "not to be fucked with states" like Florida, Michigan, and Wisconsin stood up.

       Huffington post gave Trump a solid 1.6% chance of winning. Then bragged about their prediction track record.... The page predictions were replaced with live election results so I don't have a good link for you now

       Also, when FL was called by multiple outlets to Trump they didn't update their tracker but instead automatically updated with CA.
      </p>
      <p>
       For almost an hour they had a 20+ delegate lead in Clintons favor and avoided giving Trump FL during that period.

       I was flipping from Fox to CNN and noticed that. They refused to call Florida for a long time after Fox had already done so. I guess they were just trying to keep hope alive for Hillary.

       They were even 30 minutes behind on updates about states that Hillary won, though. It took them a good 20 minutes after Google, Fox News, and local stations announced she had taken a late lead in Virginia to even mention it.

       I only looked at CNN for about a minute, but they had no real information and their screens were just filled with minutiae. I don't give a fuck about what Darryl Johnston of Buttfuckia Iowa thinks give me the numbers for the country/state! That's my quota of CNN for the next 3 years.

       So they are comparing Trump to Aurelian? (The Roman emperor who took power in AD270: famous for temporarily halting the decline of Rome: he conquered the lost eastern provinces and ended the crisis of the third century.) I think that's being very kind to Trump, and is probably over optimistic.

       r/politics?  What about this sub?  It's been projecting that HRC was the pre-chosen winner since two years ago; many here didn't even vote because voting is for idiots who think it matters.  Now the very thing they thought was established fact is slowly crumbling before our eyes.

       Same thing with Brexit.  The morning of, everybody here was dumbfounded, saying "this doesn't make any sense" or "this wasn't supposed to happen..."

       This sub'll have to to some deep soul searching to find out who the real baddies are.  Within a year, they'll turn on Trump and call him a monster.

       And I couldn't be happier as a result. I have zero problems shedding preconceived notions in light of facts. It's the very definition of being open-minded.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, I made a post theorizing the general was rigged (especially because god knows the DNC primaries were). The fact that Trump won is the biggest symbolism that our votes may still matter for reform.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love the election results for the single reason that it proves to me that the will of the people still determines who gets the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, truth plays out alongside events. Trump could no doubt be a monster--most of us are saying he's a terrible candidate with terrible policies--but the crux of this election for most of us here is whether or not a corrupt candidate with every possible advantage could swindle her way into the white house. The answer to that question was no.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, of course our attention will turn to Trump, his actions, and if he's at all honest (he probably isn't). Maybe it'll be discovered that Soros funded Trump and other more powerful factions actually appointed him for president--this theory isn't likely, but the main point is,
       <em>
        we will stay open minded

       Man, that's the thing making this so much less exciting. Nothing was "won" today. Good job america. Out of fear and hatred for
       <strong>
        one small example
       </strong>
       of how shitty our system is, we voted in a differently awful individual. Trump will of course be a disaster, but in the chaos real opportunities for change might accidentally spring up, and it will be entertaining as fuck. But people need to realize Hilary was just one ugly head of the hydra, and the elites will probably learn a lot of lessons from this so it only gets shittier from here unless people really wake up to what is going on.

       I don't think so. The man knows how to bring in a team of experts to manage the areas he doesn't know about and that's how he banked in Business and licensing. Its not that hard to be President, you literally just have to surround yourself with geniuses and manage them.

Who is he gonna pick for his experts? Either random friends or people he has met through hanging with hilary and/or people his VP suggests(fuck all those options). The thing that will make him a disaster is also his saving grace; that he will be so out of his league and confused that he might not accomplish anything at all. I suspect his VP and congress will get him to do what they want for the most part, which will be the will of the corporate. He's too egotistical to just quietly do coke while his VP runs the show so hopefully his meddling keeps them from being effective too.

       Because he runs a multi-billion dollar Real Estate and Licensing company. Sure he made some bad moves/decisions, but always came back and learned from it. The biggest thing is that Trump has said a few years ago that we are undergoing a Deindustrialization and slow collapse that is destroying the country (Thanks NAFTA/Bill Clinton/Globalists) and that he would consider running for Pres in the Future to undo this, so he has his own empire on the stake as well.

       His company is literally a team of experts: construction/development partners/financing/lawyers/etc that help run a number of companies with Thousands of employees. Running the U.S. is somewhat similar in that you have a board of directors in place and you manage them. Pence also brought in big time incentives in Indiana that convinced a number of businesses/factories to move there and create jobs.

       Of course there is a chance for that, and Dems cock blocking any bills he tries to pass. But I doubt it. I'm sure this man understands the Brevity of what is at hand. He's had a ton of interviews directly calling out the elite/1% globalists, George Soros, Banksters, etc and No One has run for President and lived, talking in this manner.

       He already had money and connections thanks to his family. And during the decades he built his name, real estate prices were going crazy. Pretty much anyone could have had a successful business starting out the way he did and just buying random land. I do agree that we need to bring back production to the country, so maybe he will help with that. I don't think being president and being CEO are very much alike other than that they are figureheads. Companies and a world power are not run the same way. If we start worrying about quarterly financial reports that only allow growth over growth(i.e. what shareholders want the CEO to do) then this country is fucked, because we've seen what kind of horrible HR situations that causes in the big companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dems won't cockblock him because the republicans took congress. What do you suppose he will actually do against the 1% though? He isn't gonna bust up Monsanto or the telecoms or energy companies. He isn't gonna go after the money guys and Wall Street, unless they make him look really bad and it bruises his ego. I do agree they will probably blame him for the market crash(which would have happened under Hilary as well, every 4-8 years as we all know), and unfortunately that will be a boost for globalism if they convince people his isolationism caused the crash. Lets see if he can get all the international corporations and Cayman island bullshit actually taxed, eh? (I'm not betting on it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Resetting DNC would be nice since they need it after all the decay from shitty liar neocons like the Clintons and Obama. But that's not 100%, not even 10% win. With Hilary gone there would still be a ton of bad guys in DC. Congress, all the agencies and contractor companies and stuff between defense, energy, fda etc etc etc. And, again, he won't be able to(or probably even try) to do much about the corporations that are above international law at this point. Knocking out Hilary, Podesta and another dozen people from the leaks is nice(and mandatory) but it's token; the corruption is still all around and now they know to keep it subtle. Stepping on a few cockroaches versus poisoning or starving the whole swarm, you know? Or even burning the house down.

       You... You're the type of person that doesnt understand how being filthy fucking rich is (when you didn't initially try). You can fuck up every single time in life if you were born into money, and still be alright. You were born with connections, and born with a plan laid out for you. All he did was follow it, and he still fucked up a ton on the way to stability (like investing in the housing market right before 2007, for one).
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a "multi billionaire" does not imply shit. Rich people can basically buy luck, and luck is all takes to get there. Luck in keeping your connections, meeting the right people, and the luck to have your investments work out. Life is determined soo much more by chance than by choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, most people on reddit have a hard time accepting that life is Almost completely out of your control. All he knew was business, so of course he never pussied out. When you've got that much luck, all you got to do is keep trying and its a matter of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that a makes sense.
 it's similar how it just comes down to chance where you're born: People in poverty didn't strive to be poor their whole.lives, most were born into it. Don't believe its always their fault. Don't believe its always rich people's fault that they're rich, either.

       Also look at the beginning. He was uncontested. The republicans relied on him because they saw that he could bring out the worst in people and not be held accountable like his political counterparts. Steep move, but against Hillary it worked out. If he was running against Bernie or even Carson.. not so easily obtained.

       Have you heard him talk? He isn't intelligent, he is occasionally clever. Without wikileaks and a mass frustration with the way things are, he would not have won. He was brexit; he didn't win this election on his own credentials. He won because he isn't hilary.
      </p>
      <p>
       From another comment of mine: during the decades he built his name, real estate prices were going crazy. Pretty much anyone could have had a successful business starting out the way he did(money and connections from family) and just buying random land.

       I would argue that Trump's dodgy past, his failed business ventures, his alleged links to the Mafia, his refusal to release his tax returns, etc. are all relevant subjects (i.e. potential conspiracies) for discussion in this sub, but unfortunately it's just turned into a pro-Trump echo chamber.

       The funny thing is, we're only seeing comments like this now because we aren't being brigaded by The_donald.  There's nothing to gain here anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been saying this shit for months, that Clinton is godawful but Trump has a whole 'nother set of problems we'll have to protest against.  And he's a lot more likely to take it personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope it turns out alright, and that I'm wrong in believing he's potentially the greater of the two evils.  I just read a biography on Nixon though, and considering the parallels I am not very optimistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nixon actually admitted he was wrong too, even if it took him a while to get there. I don't think we'll ever see that from Trump, I'm not even sure if he'll recognize the next election's results and leave office.

       I don't think she'd necessarily start ww3, I didn't believe the pedogate bullshit, but I knew how much she put her own interests ahead of others'. There's no room for that in politics, without even beginning in on the corruption issue.

       I have no doubt we will see a new war under Trump, though. And I think it'll do enough to our economy and appearance to ensure that we're never a world leader again.

       That's terrifying. We can survive 4 years of backward thinking, sure. People will get offended and hurt and maybe others will struggle financially and some will be ruined entirely. But war is different. War happens once and the effects are felt for lifetimes, not presidential terms. That's what scares me.

       Nobody is, or will ever be. I don't know if that kind of war can/will be fought anymore, but if it can then there will be so great and terrible a conflict that no place on this pale blue dot we call home will be safe, and everyone will be forced to pick a side. It will be the bloodiest and most costly war that ever was and possibly will be, depending on the outcome.

       Of course not.  We have all kinds of enemies we could antagonize into striking us first.

       I think that would all be more likely with Clinton, considering her track record. At least with Trump you have someone who's espoused isolationist tendencies. I'm hopeful that we can finally get out of the war business, even though it will come at an enormous financial cost (military equipment and movies are just about the last two things the USA makes).

       I think we'll find room for other industries if we don't spend everything on defense, though.  At least I hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that Trump is the isolationist candidate you were hoping for, though.  He's pretty hard for ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you're equating it with his economic isolationism, but in my eyes, he should have the opposite stance on the two.  I don't want to go back to being a manufacturing based economy, entry costs are too high now to benefit anyone but the multinational corps.

       What we really needed was a candidate with the cleverness and boldness to lay out a plan that puts pressure on kids and parents to get legitimately smart (as opposed to training for standardized tests). In the upcoming century the people who thrive are going to be the ones who can do complex, critical thinking and can supplement that with mathematics and scientific knowledge.

       I think the US people have to pull back significantly from consumerism and entertainment and reform our paradigm into healthy living and self-improvement. Sort of the Star Trek idea. Lead the world into a better future.

       Unfortunately, I've accepted that we probably won't make it into space before we kill off our chances of surviving on the planet, by means of war, pollution, or overconsumption.  I just can't find a way to hope anymore.

       One of the things that keeps me somewhat optimistic is that this
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a possible shift from the slow deterioration of the USA. With Hillary we
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       it was going to continue to get worse.
      </p>

       As I said to my depressed parents, sometimes in life the things that we want the least happen anyway and we find that they do great things for us. Nobody wants to get fired...until they get a better job. Nobody wants to get dumped...until they find the love of their life.
      </p>
      <p>
       A guy like Trump might just do some good stuff. At the least, it seems like he wants to do some major lobbyist and campaign finance reform. If we can wrest our country away from the parasites then we could have a government that works on our behalf. Gotta start somewhere. Hopefully that gives you a little hope.

       He's already caused damage to the presidency, by challenging the validity of the elections, permanently lowering the level of discourse in the campaign process, encouraged violence and lack of education in the voter base, accusing the government of past conspiracy theories, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if I agree with anything he said, we're always going to have lower expectations of our leaders now, and we probably won't care as much about their credibility or if they can actually accomplish the things they promise.
      </p>
      <p>
       He hasn't doomed us yet, but he has severely lowered my expectations for the US in the future, and I know he has weakened and discredited us on the international stage.  I don't believe that he's a Russian puppet, but he has certainly done a lot that will shift the globe in the BRICS nations' favor.

       Certainly hasn't beaten my dog but he has spoken out against our basic human rights to practice any religion. He's bragged about assaulting people, not just women. And he has vocalized his disdain for several races and cultures. If Obama did any of the above... he would have been shot down. But not this guy. Why? Play the politics game all you want but everyone knows he is under qualified and is basically a small child playing with big boy toys. Someone is bound to get him to pull their agenda by taking advantage of his power because he is uneducated in the ways of the law. Yeesh you wouldn't trust this guy to defend you as your lawyer but he's your president!!

       Bottom line. If you don't feel unrepresented by a misogynistic president, than you have a privilege the rest of us do not. I suppose that is the one time your idiocy and lack of intelligence will benefit you. Ignorance is bliss.

       I did, I told everyone I knew from the start that the end would be a ton of shit being uncovered about Clinton. And Clinton would counter attack the moment it would surface (grab her by the pussy), but they would keep putting it out. Pretty simple strategy, the Clintons just couldnt produce enough to counter wikileaks, but I knew it was coming, they said this stuff would be released from the start.

       As an outsider, this sub has gone from a kinda goofy place where people still think Bush did 9/11, WTC 7 yada yada, to a de-facto Trump/Rep echo chamber. Of course it's not my place to dictate what the content of this sub should be, but I would've thought that it should look at and discuss possible conspiracies wherever they may be and whoever they involve.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub was true to it's original cause we'd see, for instance, discussions on Trump's alleged links to the Mafia while building his business empire; and if Hillary had refused to release her tax returns and was accused of tax avoidance we'd see no end of references to how, at the very best, it's immoral, and at worst, completely inappropriate for a presidential candidate. But all I see is a whole lot of cognitive dissonance surrounding his past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've seen a whole lot of accusations of CTR taking over
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . Well, if you think that Trump didn't hire people to do similar work for him - maybe even here in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       where 2/3 of all mods were appointed 1 year or less ago - then you need to take a long hard look at yourself.

       vote for what? A clinton (the second) the president's wife "versus" a clinton donor and family friend, TV personality and WWE Raw actor / slumlord Donald Trump, such democracy, wow. people's democratic republic of america over here. No worries everyone this is how we have our say in how the country is run!
      </p>
      <p>
       next time we'll get a president's son "versus" his own frat brother, like it was when Bush the Second "ran" for president. does not matter in the least who you vote for. It's the american equivalent of Putin's wife and Putin's donor/golfing buddy being set up to "run against each other" for president in Russia, it's totally and utterly meaningless and is only there to control the national political narrative, legitimize the Putin mafia regardless of who 'wins', and keep the Russian poor thinking they've got a voice or a 'vote' so that they stay in their houses and don't make trouble for the ruling class out in the streets - and so the ruling class can use violence against everyone else in society while hiding behind a legal framework they pretend is based on democracy, meanwhile claiming 'peaceful transfer of power', when really we see people in our country seize power over others with violence every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       When 2 families are passing the highest offices and appointments back and forth between themselves and their own wives, sons, frat brothers, and donors, there's something very obviously wrong here, and you are contributing to the problem by pretending otherwise, and by pretending everything is normal and "go vote" etc. etc. The fact that so few people even bring that up is another sign of a North Korea level social management scheme. Everyone wants to believe in whatever ideals make them feel good about themselves and empowered, nobody wants to deal with the horrendous realities, here in the US or in DPRK or Russia or China or anywhere else. Watching the whole "go vote" thing is like watching a parade of people in North Korea crying over dear leader. it's just for show and everyone should know it by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe some day people will quit all the pretending and start dealing with facts, and with the facts as they are, how anyone can keep pretending that the voting actually matters is beyond me.   Nothing can improve if people don't recognize that there's anything going wrong.  People in positions of power can do
       <em>
        whatever they want
       </em>
       for as long as a majority of us just don't question what we can see is wrong. They can get away with murder, fraud, mass murder, repeated mass murder, mass theft, tax theft, confiscation and suppression of information, kidnapping, false imprisonment, etc. - until people go "wait a minute.. something is wrong here."
      </p>
      <p>
       the voting literally does not matter in this instance. voting would matter if people took it seriously on a local, state, and congressional level. The presidential elections are given such media hype
       <em>

       </em>
       they don't really matter and they are symbolic of 'power', not actually where the power lies. The 2 candidates can be picked/pre-selected so that nobody who will rock the boat can get in, and here we are, watching all the things I've described above take place over and over.

       Voting would matter if people cared about it for more than just a single office once every 4 years.

       You can rig a primary, but you can't rig a general election, at least not in the sense that people think. It's simply not feasible in an election of over 100 million votes to use voter fraud or rigged voting machines without drawing too much attention, and the penalties are so great that it's not worth the risk. You have to do it by winning the hearts of people and by getting them fired up to vote for you, even if your policies aren't 100% in line with their views. Clinton failed to do that, and unsuccessfully swayed voter opinion enough to win her those key swing states. All of those deplorables and basement dwellers vote too, and theirs count just as much as everyone else's.
      </p>
      <p>
       There simply wasn't the drive to get out and vote for her like there was for Bernie and Trump. After the primary, it seemed like most left-leaning voters were either begrudgingly voting for Clinton, not voting at all, or voting for Trump out of spite. That's no way to win a general election.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one side has a candidate that voters are fired up about, and the other is simply depicted as the lesser evil by their constituency, I'd bet on the one that voters are fired up about every time. Those are the voters who will definitely be in line to support their candidate and who will convince undecided and middle ground voters to vote for them.

       Alot of attention was drawn but ultimately a controversial 5-4 supreme court decision ended the recount in Florida on which the outcome hinged and awarded the presidency to Bush Jr. Add to that later testimonies of people on the inside that the electronic voting system was purposefully engineered and you got your case. In the end you dont have to rig 100 Mio votes, just the thin margin that determines the winner. Some links:

       I'm loving the posts though, not even 24 hours after the unashamed pro Hillary brigade of posts the top posts now are about how the 'Mainstream Media looked the other way this election' and how 'Now true investigative journalism is more important than ever'...the irony is quite amazing.

       This is also kind of the problem though. you are literally calling the opposition traitors. You guys really need to stop being so polarized by the media propaganda machine from both sides and somehow believing that you all aren't just normal people with slightly different views on what is best for the country.

       so what does that make Trump supporters who do the same thing? I mean there is just as much video evidence of that happening as on the Democrat side. Your country is all kinds of fucked up man and your attitude is as much a part of the problem as the Clinton supporters you saw.

       No. Show me trump supporters who commited treason and they can hang as well. Treason is very much a real crime and those who did commit it will go to jail or be put on death row, as long as the courts come to the same conclusion.

       What was the act of treason here though? He is saying Clinton supporters are traitors, not Clinton herself. And even then the argument for treason is a weak one. She is corrupt and careless, but she hasn't tried to sell out the country to a foreign power that I know of.
      </p>
      <p>
       To call her supporters traitors because they passionately and sometimes violently oppose Trump is rdiculous. Which is why I ake if he also is the few violent Trump supporters as traitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't by the way. I view violence from either side reprehensible but not treasonous in any way.

       no I'm honestly curious how you see the Trump supporters who do the same thing? Are they also traitors or are they somehow patriots? I don't know you which is why I'm asking, but all I'm hearing is vitriol and hate for your fellow countrymen which is a huge damn problem with your country.

       I just want to know what r/Conspiracy will have to say about all the claims that the election was rigged in Hillary's favor? Will people be taking that back and backtracking on the false narrative that our elections were rigged for Hillary?

       Are you serious? Haha wow. There is just no arguing logic here, huh? For weeks r/Conspiracy has pushed the narrative over and over that the voting machines were owned by so and so that was somehow related to Hillary and that they were calculatedly manipulating her win illegally. People shared over and over the stupid Time magazine post that showed Hillary as a winner and cited to that as evidence that "Hillary was always going to win" - you can't just walk away from all of that without owning up to being wrong. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Either Trump won fairly, and r/conspiracy was wrong about all the alleged election rigging, or the system was rigged and we should still be questioning the outcome. So which is it?

       Its quite possible that after a certain value is reached, the voting booths could not extend their own votes past a certain point. (Maximum risk value) Also the  people who were informed were extremely vigilant , and seeing a rigged system, (eg. The broken booth in Pennsylvania) will instantly go viral because people are looking for rigged stations specifically.

       You political types really are fucking dense. The whole system is utterly corrupt, and a sham designed to give the illusion of choice to imbeciles that barrack for their favorite team. If Trump is in, it's just to further that illusion. Hurry on back to pol and tell them we said hi.

       It was still rigged. There was a reason some of the heavy Democratic precincts came in late. They have electronic voting machines so its not like they were counting votes. They where doing calculations on how many votes they needed to tip the state. Unfortunately for them it would have needed more votes than they had available. It's hard to rig a landslide correctly.

       It was, all polls all media, all narratives were working for Hillary, they tried to rig it but they underestimated that all the publicity they gave Trump while sheltering clinton backfired on them. They underestimated the American people, they thought the people would swallow their manufactured narrative. After all, it worked before, but the Internet exposed the bullshit, and the people got sick of it. It's almost like they voted for Trump to spite the media masters insulting the intelligence of common Americans.

       This outcome actually gives me some hope.  Not the hope that we have a voice, but that power is not as monolithic and unified as some think, and that there are competitors for the throne that can yet tear each other down in their ascent to power.  I feel less like the whole thing is a show, and more like it's just mostly a show.  A Hillary Clinton presidency would have been the ultimate slap in the face of the public by the ruling elite, and with her gone it still seems to me that they don't want us to turn our full attention towards them and that is at least a sign that we as a people still have some power left, however small or fleeting it might be.

       I don't think the middle class think that at all.  I think much of the vote for him is an anti-hillary vote.  We will never know.

       Jill Stein was the best choice to govern the USA, in my opinion. Probably the sanest voice I read/listen to throughout the US campaign. Even more so than Bernie... Did she/her party win any 'seats' (sorry, not from the US not sure what the correct term is?). Anyway, two party systems are inherently flawed.

       I said a real investigation and prosecution (for government corruption) and (the employing station) firing newscasters shown in collusion. They were separate things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also emphasized REAL investigation by making it caps. I don't think REAL investigation implies jailing newscasters, shutting news stations, and government news censorship. You stupid twat.

       I for one am VERY excited that Trump won. Though I didn't vote for him, or anyone. I was one of those, votes don't matter guys. (Which is true to an extent.) I was hopeless and thought no matter what we did TPTB would pick our leaders for us and continue fucking us over. This proved me wrong and I LOVE it!
      </p>
      <p>
       This election proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that if the people rally hard enough behind a candidate they can win. The establishment piled heaps of shit on Trump. They called his followers all kinds of nasty things. If you support Trump you are an uneducated racist misogynistic bigot! They just kept piling the shit up and piling it up. So what did the people do? They saw through the bullshit, elected Trump, and shoved the shit right back into the face of the establishment! Oh what a day to be American!
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never been more proud of my countrymen. Trump is not perfect, by anyone's standards, but he's a damn sight better than that corrupt puppet Clinton. I am sorry for not believing sooner and taking my ass to the polls, but to those of you that voted, THANK YOU!

       well stated man. Often when people asked me who I wanted to vote for I felt a deep sense of shame if I wanted to say "Trump" so I just kinda mumbled something about how "Oh I dunno if I'll vote" and felt like such a gigantic pussy. I'm so happy he won. Hillary is the living embodiment of evil and I refused to believe Trump was as shitty as everyone was saying. There were DIRECT COMPARISONS to Adolph Fucking Hitler. I'm like, guys.....Trump might not be the most upstanding fellow, but I don't think we are getting death camps anytime soon here

       Alot of the negativity I saw about Trump was about the things he says. I actually respect Trump for his filthy mouth. Everyone I know has a filthy mouth. I think that's preferable to a polished professional liar like career politicians are. Trump is not saint, but at least he's not more of the same. If he can actually do half of what he proposed in his campaign, I'll be happy.

       I was actually not going to vote until I saw a Hillary ad. The ad in question showed a little boy (who wouldn't be able to vote for what seemed like the next two elections) watching a commercial for Donald speaking and it infamously cuts to the part where he says "I would tell them to go fuck themselves" and then a few more things that were anti-Trump. I didn't know it was an ad campaign until the end when it said "paid for by Hillary Clinton" or whatever it says. I had a few thoughts. The little boy was irrelevant and pandering, Clinton is a bitch because it's pure smear and nothing positive, I respect anyone that can have the balls to tell someone to go fuck themselves in front of thousands live and millions watching. It backfired and I decided then and there I will vote and that vote will be for Donald Trump

       Ok, but every one of you has pretty much been saying this election is rigged the entire time cause all the polls said Hillary was going to win. But now that Trump has won.....? 
So if you say there was a conspiracy the whole time then you're refuting Trump's election. But if you say there was no conspiracy then you're refuting everything every one of y'all has been saying the past year.

       In the US the majority of the Main Stream Media is basically just propaganda. Enough people watch them that they believed that Trump had zero chance of winning. When your reality gets busted it can be shocking.

       Nah bro, the best part will be watching the US fall from grace off the world stage. Russia will go full tilt in Syria and the Ukraine. Turkey will wipe out the Kurds and try to invade Iraq. China will take over the South china sea and won't hesitate using military force. Iran will fire up it's nuke program. Israel will probably 'cleanse' Palestine. NATO/UN will have no power.

       Dude, Shilldog would've continued the status quo of Obama's legacy. Which means the world would have stayed stable. Not to mention she is well versed in world politics. Corrupt as fuck but well versed none the less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a fucking reality TV star. Who was saved from bankruptcy by the Rothschild dynasty in the late 80s. He has some big promises to fulfill. I'd say he'll be feeling more terrified than anyone else at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that for a minute. You have a 70 year old man that has never done anything unless it was in his self interest. Dude isn't even aware of what's taking place in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       America has just elected a senile joke. World leaders are going to take advantage of this. I can just imagine the parties happening in political circles around the world. Vlad is probably erect, without the help of viagra, for the first time in years.
      </p>

       My advice, to those of you in the US, is to buy gold. Your dollars not going to be worth shit in a year - in fact it'll probably be on parity with the peso.

I don't even like trump, but fuck if I'm enjoying laughing at them.

       "Wikileaks has a 10-year record of never releasing a single falsified document, and is not connected to Russia. Everything they released were the actual e-mails of Hillary Clinton and her campaign staff. You had the opportunity to look through a window into the Hillary Clinton campaign, but you didn’t.
By ignoring the leaks, you ignored reality.
By not listening to your fellow Americans, and accusing them of being “conspiracy theorists” and trusting the corporate media, you ignored reality. By only following other liberals on social media, and only reading liberal or corporate news, once again ignoring reality. When Hillary Clinton was caught rigging the primary against Bernie Sanders, and Democrats nominated her anyway they ignored reality."

       I have a theory about that, I think the vote was rigged, maybe even as much as twenty percent, but Trump supporters came out in droves to vote, more than they predicted. That is why we don't have any recounts going on because then the investigations would show the mass corruption.

       NBC, ABC, and CBS all stopped reporting the progress, both LIVE and on the net. It was hours at a 'standstill' when clearly Trump was the winner yet they 'refused' and LIED about the numbers being too close. BS.
One could easily find the LIVE voting counter for each state. You could see which state Trump would easily win and vice versa. The last few hours was bought out media corruption. You could feel their uneasiness and they were all pro-Clinton. Regardless, she needs punishment for all the crimes she has committed.

       It sure will be exciting listening to all  of the Hillary supporters blaming everyone but their candidate for losing to a guy that makes George w look competent. I guess rigging the primary is way easier than rigging the general.

       It certainly won't be the dismantling of Amendments 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. That part is gonna suck. So is seeing Obergefell v Hodges and Roe v Wade overturned. The dramatic drop in the value of the dollar isn't going to be fun.

       my dear retarded american friends. for more than a century you have been subject to slavery through the federal reserve.

       it is not yet time to selebrate!!! you still have the great deed waiting for you yet. to kill the great dragon. your very privatelly owned central bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       for more than a century you been engaging in endless wars. beginning with WW I to the cold war and war on terror.
      </p>
      <p>
       for more than a century they been trying to strike fear into your hearts and distract you from the unlawful creation of the federal reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       they did this through wars and economic depressions. through media brainwash and addictive sub cultures. through crimes and school indoctrinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       through empty hollywood bollock dreams. through inflations and endless social issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is time to rise up and strike down the great beast. and your time is now!!!

       It's amazing to see the CTR smoke clear. Holy shit the propaganda was a sight to behold, and the biggest joy I find today as a Sanders Democrat is to watch the massive failures of David Brock, CTR, and the rest of the elitist propaganda.

       I'm just sincerely hoping people are not going to fold up and quit. There are still people of power that need to meet justice. Wikileaks to sort out. An organized campaign to take down the media's meal ticket. A message to reddit and other social platforms that the cowardly behavior they've displayed will not be tolerated. We can vote with our money, our webpage hits (or lack thereof) right on down to sending mass emails to news stations, local newspapers and similar.
      </p>

       I have a website idea,. actually, but unsure of its legality. Basically, you call it something like realfakenews.com. It trolls all of the major news outlets and by some smart algorithm takes short, highly accurate snippets of that sites content. When a story hits, realfakenews is first on google (somehow) and takes hits away from  the major news sites. It'll smartly itemize content based on political leanings, potential business influence, etc. Any metric desirable can be measured and highlighted to show agendas. We can view their biased nonsense for giggles and restrict ad revenue and page hits all at the same time.

       Likely not, but the underlying principle has some merit. The media is supposed to report the news. They used to, then decided they'd toss in their own opinions. Before long, it's just another arm of the government. They don't even report actual news. That wikileaks/hillaryforprison stuff wasn't just happening on some sleazy pocket of the internet. It was huge, and the media kept it hush. Luckily for us, we beat them at their own game. I'd now like to finish the job and destroy them.

       the only thing Trump needs to do in regards to prosecuting Hillary is to just let the DOJ and FBI do their job instead of backdoor pressuring them. It seems pretty apparent to me they have stuff to move forward on. Like the email scandal, she DID send classified emails over an unsecured server, she DID send classified emails to people who didnt have clearance. The laws governing that DONT say anything about intent, which is why Comey said he didnt want to indict, she didnt INTEND to break the law. Well nobody gives a flying fuck, the law doesnt give a fuck about intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is she did it, the FBI knows it, the DOJ knows it. Get Loretta Lynch and the handful of other people shown to be in with the Clintons out of the DOJ and get Comey out of the FBI. Then let the chips fall where they may when people do their jobs.
