       All you fuckers saying he is a Clinton plant, and that Clinton is anointed, are either ignorant, useful idiots, or CTR. President Trump! Let's make America great? Not again, but great once and for all (back to our stolen roots).

       That being said. Now, why? Trump has gone rogue? Controlled op? Let's get back to our roots here... Anything goes...

       Putin turned on his "groomed" role brought in by Yeltsin. I'm not saying too much, but I was there.... Yeltsin was a whore to the West, and Putin wasn't having it. I see similarities.... I don't care about downvotes....

       I agree, I've read about it - I'm curious for examples as I've never seen anything from his campaign, but no worries. (I was referring to US Presidents anyway).

       You smart you loyal. Nah but like something something in-your-face-bias and something something accusatory(sp?) tone turns people off even if you're right/been right all along, and you know this. With a post like that you're only going to get people to ignore your realism/realistic view point.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S. the comparison between Trump and Obama is valid IMO mate, Obama shows us/the world that false promises and baseless claims are possible even with a "dark horse" candidate, therefore while all of Trumps possible proposals on governmental reform sound dope as fuck, he could just as easily not follow through on them (even tho he is yo boi).

You're misinterpreting me and putting words into my mouth. If you know me, I say fuck all gov. I'll make a post about current situations though. Doesn't mean I agree.  Don't listen to me, don't trust me, don't follow me. Do your own damn research. I give breadcrumbs. I have no answers... I've always made that clear. Your comment reeks, and fuck off.

       All a politician has to do is say one thing when they are campaigning, and once they get into office flip flop and do something else. It happens over and over and over again, and everytime people fall for the bs. All I am saying is wait and see what Trump does. I think all his supporters will be disappointed, I've seen it happen too many times in the past to expect it to be different now.

       I like you man, but what is the theory? Hillary plant is 2D chess, not leaving out 3D chess. Hillary plant isn't it. She's just a wicked cunt. Doesn't have much power, Bill (Clintons) may have some, she doesn't... (imo).

       It's not my theory, and it might well be wrong too. Only time will tell on that count.
       <br/>
       As long as Hillary gets fucked over for her myriad crimes it's all good because if it
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a fix there's fuck all anyone could do regardless really. She deserves to lose.
       <br/>
       My personal theory was Hillary pushed him to run and pulled media strings to get him in opposition because she
       <em>
        thought
       </em>
       he'd be a pushover, he actually resonated with Middle America and became a monster she couldn't control. He learned about the fix and went balls-out to beat her hence the vicious debates.
       <br/>
       Again, just a theory too, I might be wrong.

       Okay but take this into consideration: if Trump wins the election what does that mean? Probably that those in charge WANTED him to win (probably because of all the shit HRC is going through now) otherwise he wouldnt. At the very least they feel he's not a threat or can be easily manipulated. If he was indeed a plant then he was already under their influence and it was simply a shift from one puppet to another.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's safe to say those in power would not let someone who was a genuine threat to their position into the white house. In other words you can't have an organization assumed to control the political system by controlling positions of power and also have someone who they couldn't control placed into one of the most prominent (public) positions of power. It wouldn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if TPTB has the level of control always attributed to them then Trump wouldn't win by chance, and if he did win by chance then TPTB can't even pull off rigging the election (which I'm pretty sure they could)

       No, he has too many people behind him. JFK had his bro, who was also killed. I think Trump has been playing this smart. Just my own opinion... I SHOULD LET PEOPLE KNOW. I don't/didn't vote.

       Bro calm your tits. Words are like bullets they go right through you. That's interesting I could see him playing this, this well but he would have to of IMO been a plant at first who for whatever reason decided to go rouge. I honestly think She wanted him to run against her, probably coaxed him to do so but totally 100% underestimated his resignation within middle America.

       This might have gone over better if you hadn't called people stupid or fuckers simply for being skeptical and cautious. You really don't know that Trump isn't still bought and paid for. You have no idea. So let everyone have their opinions unless you have a magical 8 ball of truth.

       Yeah, nobody asked you to defend your shitty attitude. Just your shitty logic. I want to believe Trump is real, but jumping off the bus already and running off to suck his dick is a bit extreme at this point. It's made worse when you turn around and moon the bus full of people you were previously civil toward.

       Bro calm your tits. Words are like bullets they go right through you. That's interesting I could see him playing this, this well but he would have to of IMO been a plant at first who for whatever reason decided to go rouge.
