<p>P.S. the comparison between Trump and Obama is valid IMO mate, Obama shows us/the world that false promises and baseless claims are possible even with a &quot;dark horse&quot; candidate, therefore while all of Trumps possible proposals on governmental reform sound dope as fuck, he could just as easily not follow through on them (even tho he is yo boi).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not my theory, and it might well be wrong too. Only time will tell on that count.<br/>
As long as Hillary gets fucked over for her myriad crimes it&#39;s all good because if it <em>was</em> a fix there&#39;s fuck all anyone could do regardless really. She deserves to lose.<br/>
My personal theory was Hillary pushed him to run and pulled media strings to get him in opposition because she <em>thought</em> he&#39;d be a pushover, he actually resonated with Middle America and became a monster she couldn&#39;t control. He learned about the fix and went balls-out to beat her hence the vicious debates.<br/>
Again, just a theory too, I might be wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay but take this into consideration: if Trump wins the election what does that mean? Probably that those in charge WANTED him to win (probably because of all the shit HRC is going through now) otherwise he wouldnt. At the very least they feel he&#39;s not a threat or can be easily manipulated. If he was indeed a plant then he was already under their influence and it was simply a shift from one puppet to another.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safe to say those in power would not let someone who was a genuine threat to their position into the white house. In other words you can&#39;t have an organization assumed to control the political system by controlling positions of power and also have someone who they couldn&#39;t control placed into one of the most prominent (public) positions of power. It wouldn&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>So if TPTB has the level of control always attributed to them then Trump wouldn&#39;t win by chance, and if he did win by chance then TPTB can&#39;t even pull off rigging the election (which I&#39;m pretty sure they could)</p>
