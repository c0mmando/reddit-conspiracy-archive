       Exactly. I'm watching the PBS coverage right now and they're trying to explain what happened and talking about "soul searching" as if they're unaware of all the scandals. The simple fact is Bernie Sanders was more likable, had better policies, and was not a fucking straight up cocky liar like Hillary. I have hope for Trump. I think if he gets good people around him, he could do very well.

       They had a chance with Bernie, now i will never trust the DNC again as a long time Democrat.

       Looking at the numbers in each state it seems like if the DNC had picked Bernie they would have won because it was as close as 75,000 votes in some places. The way I see it, each scandal lost them at least that much. Bernie would have easily brought that many more people out just based on the fact that he was likable. The email scandal alone probably lost Hillary that much. Having a dead fish of a VP like Kaine probably lost her that much. I have always leaned left and I really don't like Trump's policy on abortion, for instance, and that would make me vote Bernie if it were Bernie, but like you I think most people are sick of the lies from the DNC, and those of us who have been paying attention to the latest revelations absolutely could not vote for her in good conscience. The only solution for democrats is just a complete reform of the DNC, but don't lose hope on Trump yet because he could surprise everyone again.

       I voted Stein, she may be a little coocoo, but i believe that the two party system is toxic for politics in this country.

       The two party system is definitely crazy. The fact that the so-called "presidential debates" didn't include other candidates like Stein is a mockery. My issue with her was she was talking about 9/11 conspiracies while she could have been focusing on the DNC conspiracy which was more relevant at the time. She could have gathered a lot more support for third parties.

       They didn't fuck they country.  The DNC did by trying to strong-arm them into picking a candidate they didn't ask for or want.  And I like how when bringing up arguments about 'who's at fault' you dems always seem to have concluded that the next two terms are going to literally destroy the country.

       No, you did by not accepting the democratic choice of the party and then crying "she cheated" when she didn't, and then voting for a candidate who is, for the most part, the polar opposite of Bernie Sanders out of spite.
      </p>

       No one said destroy the country, they just said set it back for 20 years.  People won't forget that this was your fault.  Stop trying to blame the DNC for what you did.

       theoretically possible, but Bernie didnt run, had he did, he may have imploded and got real cucky and burned himself down. We are talking apples to oranges. A guy (Sanders) who is being viewed through rose colored glasses and Trump who actually ran the race. This is like saying. Well i know Usain Bolt smoked everyone in a race, but this new guy would have won had he ran.

       No that's false. Facts are facts he was out performing everyone drawing larger crowds. But because the blackout and blatant cheating by HRC he got screwed.
      </p>
      <p>
       People want Sanders are a much larger scale than they wanted Hillary that's why they voted for him but the DNC didn't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fact and there is evidence of it. 
Pollsters have a 5 point margin of error (they say) the problem is every poll had Bernie WAY outside of that  margin. 10+ points on every candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no apples to oranges he was the choice. Short of him declaring his determination for a fourth Reich but he is Jewish so idk how that would work.
      </p>
      <p>
       He stuck to issues, that would have destroyed Trump because there's no banter to have Trump would have made a fool of himself and Sanders would have been stoic and on message. 
His honesty and pedigree made him the choice.

       No I'm looking at his past and the facts. 
Facts show he was cheated. Facts show he was pulling more people. 
Facts show he was well above the pollsters margin of error against his opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not the idea, it's fact. People turned on him after he was got to by Clinton and he endorsed her in a party first type deal. 
But he was pulling way bigger crowds, posting way bigger numbers, had way more support.

But Trump didn't actively fuck America out of their candidate.

       They may not have voted Trump but they sure as shit didn't vote Hillary.
Trump also had MASSIVE support compared to Hillary. On top of that, Hillary was screwed because Trump's campaign was banter.

       I've never trusted either thing. This election just made sure I NEVER will. It has also shown me in stark terms that at least 47.3 percent of my country is retarded and has no concern for responsible behavior. And that, more than the president, is disturbing.

       On a slightly bright side, most of that stupidity is confined to the East Coast and West coast and state capitals. The trendy areas of the country which depend upon the working class to exist.

       I'd bet anything he doesn't.  No reason.  He already started the backpedaling a little with his speech.  Not that I think it's necessarily the wrong call, he won, it's over.   Trying to jail her would just rile shit up again.  He's better off just letting it lie.

       My theory (my head canon) is that the powers that be wanted Clinton to be president so they did their did scheming to get a republican nominee who was so ridiculous that even republicans wouldn't vote for. What their arrogance prevented them to see was that the people hate Clinton so much that they voted for the bozo or better yet, voted for a 3rd party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: forgot to mention that in my head canon, Trump was unaware that he was being used.

       Tell you what.  I don't expect you to believe me, I'm just some guy on the internet.  How about you save my comment and I save yours, and then in 6 months from now we see what Donald has done/not done, and whether he actually 'defeated' TPTB.

       That's what its all about for so many trump supporters? That they're going to be with the winner. That these people that have so offended and affronted them, some how, are going to get their just deserts and you are going to get what has been denied to you. Some how not exactly specified.

       Ever heard the term "reverse psychology"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing the US media knows without a doubt about the American public is that the vast majority of them do not trust the media. They know that if the media says one thing, most people will believe the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how do the powerful use the media to their advantage when that is the situation? They simply get the media to support the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       of what they actually want.

       Nope.  I don't buy that for a second.  The last year and a half was continuous, fawning coverage of their golden child on every station, in every newspaper and magazine with few exceptions.  Too bad she was corrupt to the core though.

       Riots are starting to break out. And I believe will continue for a long time. I think it is Hillary's contingency plan. These riots are going to rip our cities apart. Only she or Obama could talk them down and endorse Trump to quell the surge. And they will only endorse if he pardons them. Buckle up BUCKAROOS

       You had two choices today. If you didn't vote Clinton you allowed Trump to win. You have no right to complain about Trump unless you voted Clinton. She screwed over Bernie, but there was nothing that could be done about that. Don't try to make yourself feel better.

       Your logic is faulty.  It's a very simple concept you are missing.  The right person was knocked out of the contest illegally, unethically, immorally.  This is the bed the DNC made for itself, now it has to lay in it.

       Hillary was about to start WWIII with the Russians over the no fly zone she was insisting on over Syria.  Have you heard about this at all, or completely oblivious?

       go back to /pol and jack off to trump memes with all the other betas who are afraid of women. That cunt is filthy rich and is respected throughout the world (corrupt or not).

       I love when people say things like that. I am almost asleep after taking my sleeping pill and snuggling with my dog. I am calm, laughing too loud at videos from the night, and very sleepy. Thank you for the concern. God bless you and these United States of America. You might want to get your feels check, btw. That seething anger must be coming from somewhere :/

       Nope you are wrong, I voted Gary Johnson in Califronia, a state Hillary won in spades. I didn't contribute to her losing and I didn't support trump winning at all. Both candidates were shit everyone had an option to support a 3rd party and they should feel good not supporting either candidate

       Hillary won California by a million votes, my vote for Gary Johnson had no effect on Hillary or Trump and supported neither, I voted 3rd party because I don't support war, nor do I support Hillary or Trump. So again you are wrong to say voting 3rd party resulted in Trump winning.

       <em>
        You
       </em>
       are the real problem with American politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people like you convince others that a 3rd party candidate can't win, you perpetuate the corrupt two party system.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand you have people that would prefer the Libertarian candidate voting for the Republicans, and on the other you have people that would have preferred the Green Party candidate voting for the Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all those people actually voted for the candidate they preferred, rather than settling for "second best", a 3rd party candidate might actually win.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead people like you convince them that voting against their interests is in their interests.
