        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hours ago, the FBI warned of potential terror attacks in the United States in advance of the election.</p>

<p>&quot;In one release provided to the U.S. Treasury Department, the FBI warned of &quot;the need for heightened awareness concerning the potential use of chemical/biological and/or radiological/nuclear weapons of mass destruction as a precautionary measure.&quot;</p>

<p>The warning cited no specific threat, but cautioned building officials to be prepared to shut down air handling systems in the event that a terrorist attempted to use ventilation ducts to spread toxic substances.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2016/11/04/fbi-warns-of-possible-pre-election-day-terror-attacks/">http://nypost.com/2016/11/04/fbi-warns-of-possible-pre-election-day-terror-attacks/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sources-us-intel-warning-of-possible-al-qaeda-attacks-in-us-monday/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sources-us-intel-warning-of-possible-al-qaeda-attacks-in-us-monday/</a></p>

<p>The dirt that is being discussed on forums like this -- the pay4play, Uranium deals, trafficking, vote rigging, terrorist connections, and more -- is certainly rifling feathers of certain members of the elite. I cannot think of another moment when those elites would be more inclined to distract the masses and media.</p>

<p>There&#39;s virtually nothing else going on in the news besides election coverage. And soon (and it&#39;s already begun), media outlets will begin reporting on what /pol and others are discovering and discussing. Now is the time for the elite to act before this really gets out of hand.</p>

<p>My baseline concern is that the elite will attempt to derail the investigations by orchestrating a devastating attack.</p>

<p>One theory, could be that Saudi Arabia, which wants HRC to win in order to have power in the US government, is becoming concerned the leaks are threatening her victory, and so will fund a terrorist attack, as they are known to do, in order to distract from the investigations, and also to inspire &#39;unity&#39; in the states, and the election of an &#39;experienced&#39; leader.</p>

<p>Stay vigilant. Upvote for visibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody actually cares. The biggest sham in false flags in the modern world history took place in the US. You let it slide and you allowed for most blatant hijacking of liberties of all people, including your own Murican people. You mock people demanding better answers on that event, so in essence, the entire USA is complicit in letting such catastrophe slide.</p>

<p>Go take a look at some 9-11 impact video, no commentary no news analysis, just the planes hitting the building. Loop that video couple of times.</p>

<p>You, the Murica yeehaw liberty eagle trump freedom blah blah blah...you let that event, on your soil, in front of your faces, you allowed for the &quot;Dem dirty arab Bin Laden did it&quot; conclusion. </p>

<p>Again, my whole life, I was really against anyone uttering that tired old cliche &quot;dumb fat americans&quot;. I don&#39;t know about your weight, and I don&#39;t care, but you sure are a bunch of dumb motherfuckers. I&#39;m talking real dumb, not endearing or cute. Actually stupid people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize you&#39;re probably just venting out some frustration, but I hope you&#39;re adult enough to realize Americans are an enormously large group of people that span a wide range of beliefs. Some people are more inclined to be cynical than others. We question everything. If you attempt to silence us, or berate us, you&#39;re just contributing to the problem. You can complain that most Americans are unaware how much they&#39;re lied to and manipulated, but you should also be respectful to the many of us who are trying to do something about that through education.</p>

<p>Your country is ran by AIPAC (to illustrate, I&#39;m well aware that&#39;s not the only organization but it&#39;s one of the most prominent) and you do their bidding.  If it was some African backwards country in grips of AIPAC, it would be kinda silly to point out how some small poor country listens to a more powerful &quot;master&quot;. That&#39;s how things usually go.</p>

<p>In your case, however, it&#39;s literally laughable. From territorial ratio, to population ratio, to military ratio...yet you still obey. It&#39;s on some bizzare and actually sad Mad Max Thunderdom MasterBlaster shit. Those people bring cartoon depictions of bombs to make a point across and send your kids to fake wars, and then your presidents make jokes about those sole reasons for. Please spare me the &quot;not all Americans&quot; rhetoric. </p>

<p>Dumb as shit - the end.</p>

<p>Huh? What am I supposed to do? Mention THEM in public one time too many and get my life ruined? Thanks - no thanks.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be pragmatic about this shit. I will be aware of my stupidity, with a strict threshold - I will never ever pick up arms. But picking up arms is, at the moment, completely abstract proposition. </p>

<p>Call me close minded all you want. Confucius said that the beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name.</p>
