       These are the couple reports:
      </p>
      <p>
       “What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
       But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Money laundering
Child exploitation
Sex crimes with minors (children)
Perjury
Pay to play through Clinton Foundation
Obstruction of justice
Other felony crimes

       Yes this needs to be looked into and we should treat it as rumour, hearsay, or hoax until otherwise proved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that It isn't a possible. Given the charges related to Weiner and the Bill Clinton, Epstein links it certainly would fit into that whole narrative arch.
      </p>
      <p>
       However without an on the record source or other means of verification it should be taken as no more than rumour. This is an election and both sides are throwing as much shit as possible so we should take it in that context until proved otherwise. I'm sure supporters of Trump will take umbrage to that point but rumours and innuendo are no way to prove a point and be taken seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a wealth of 100% bona fide and damning evidence already out there on a range of criminal acts. Focus on what can be proved without question, Allegations like this without evidence will be used as a stick to beat down the truth of the cold hard facts that we can actually prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been following this from the start. The first place I saw it mentioned was on a random twitter account 3 days ago. So I guess twitter is the best place to start. Find tweet zero, research the tweeter and contacts on multiple social media platforms, cross reference those to NYPD and governmental sources 3 steps removed including family members and friends. I don't have anywhere near the time to do that now but if someone wants to do it that's how you start.

       I know man.  I was banned from there pretty quick.  I posted one of the police shootings and tried to have a rational discussion or two.  The mods there aren't having any of that.  I'd love to think if they were half a fucking human that they would try and make sure if the shit is true that is being reported, they won't let it go unreported to the public.

       great effort, hoping for something as well. to track him down would take a listing out of all of the "chiefs" and identifying people who know each of them and having them reach out to anyone who can connect/verify the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       unfortunately that probably would take significant luck, time, and people all of which results in a big game of telephone.

      <p>
       hoping for another solution or an actual drop from the NYPD and/or FBI which, to me, feels like it could come any day now before the election

       This is still second hand heresy. I made a comment elsewhere that it bugs me with how they refer to the NYPD Chief by making  it sound like there's more than one. There's the current and one previous one who could be the source as the other recent former Chiefs include the current Commissioner (and then why wouldn't you refer to the source as such) and one who abruptly retired due to a corruption probe

       NYPD has many Chiefs. That's the problem with their source. The mayor appointed head of the entire NYPD is the Commissioner (James O'Neill). The highest uniformed position is called the Chief of Departments (Carlos Gomez started in Sept. '16). Everyone under the Departments Chief is also a Chief. They're all called 'Chief of..' There's almost a dozen different "Chiefs" in office right now.

       Do we really believe that HRC, being a professional lawyer for years and years, is going to WRITE DOWN and confess in unsecured emails that she molested kids? I highly doubt that, but we shall see.

       great effort, hoping for something as well. to track him down would take a listing out of all of the "chiefs" and identifying people who know each of them and having them reach out to anyone who can connect/verify the story.
      </p>

       unfortunately that probably would take significant luck, time, and people all of which results in a big game of telephone.

       hoping for another solution or an actual drop from the NYPD and/or FBI which, to me, feels like it could come any day now before the election

       I don't think the NYPD or the FBI has released any specific details about what is on Weiners computer. That means that until then anyone can claim anything.
