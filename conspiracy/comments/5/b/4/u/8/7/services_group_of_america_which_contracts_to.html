       Prison guard unions love it more.  They are partly responsible for California's three strikes laws and stopping other initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://mic.com/articles/41531/union-of-the-snake-how-california-s-prison-guards-subvert-democracy#.6vgTTaNCU">
        &gt;The union has been one of the leading backers of tougher sentencing laws. It spent over $100,000 to pass the original Three Strikes law. It dropped another $1 million to defeat Prop 5, which would have reduced sentences for nonviolent crimes and allocated more resources to treating drug addiction. It spent over $1 million to beat Prop 66, which would have reduced the number of crimes that carry mandatory life sentences

       How many states have private prisons? I believe there used to be 2 in NC, but they were reverted back to the state at some point.

       Lots and lots. Private prisons are big business. I'd look it up for you but I'm on mobile and that makes me lazy.

       Short story is that capitalism enables obscene things like for profit prisons. We should be collectively ashamed.

       I believe in capitalism, but sometimes we have to defer to common sense a little but.  I also believe in the 2nd amendment, but I don't believe that everybody should be able to walk into a store and buy a handgun the same day no questions asked.

       If soembody wants to crusade to keep marijuana illegal for personal reasons, I guess that's their business.  This is just wrong.

       I don't agree with a lot of conspiracy talk especially around here. But these things ARE real and it IS bullshit. There's no other reason why they'd be donating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want money kept out of politics as much as possible. But unfortunately for these kinds of things, it's hard to get support (or opposition) for propositions without these kinds of donations behind it.

       This isn't really a conspiracy it is just a corporation doing what is best for their bottom line.  I think private prisons should be banned but you can't blame a company that profits off them for trying to make as much money as possible.

       It's profiting off ruining peoples' lives for victimless crimes. I get that it's just a part of business to increase profits even if it hurts others, but there's certain limits and ethics that should be involved.

       Not defending it at all, I'm just saying it isn't a conspiracy when it is out in the open and it is the whole business of the corporation.

       Well a conspiracy isn't necessarily illegal, but I doubt they'd openly say "yeah, we're opposing this bill so we can make money off putting people in prison"
