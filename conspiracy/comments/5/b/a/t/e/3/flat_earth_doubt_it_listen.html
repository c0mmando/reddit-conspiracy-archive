<p>The ball-Earth model can predict eclipses with 100% accuracy. The flat-Earth model cannot. In this respect, the ball-Earth model is better.</p>

<p>Continuing in this fashion, what observable effects can the flat-Earth model account for that the ball-Earth model cannot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean.</p>

<p>My point has to do with which model better represents observable reality. You say that the path of a solar eclipse is weird under the ball-Earth model? That doesn&#39;t really matter, as the ball-Earth model predicted with 100% accuracy the solar eclipse in the first place.</p>

<p>When and where are the next solar eclipses predicted to occur using the flat-Earth model? Show your work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the moon rotates around the earth in an eliptical orbit called the lunar cycle this movement does not stop during a lunar eclipse. The moons position relative to the earth and sun changes as the earth is not only orbiting the sun the earth is also rotating. 3D visuals exist that perfectly explain your &quot;flat proof&quot;. as I said before you are literally an idiot.</p>

<p>in the same way the earth is not flat the orbit of the moon is not &quot;flat&quot; with the earths orbit of the sun <a href="http://tcaa.us/Images/EclipseNodes.jpg">http://tcaa.us/Images/EclipseNodes.jpg</a></p>

<p>Also, using the theory you explained, how does the  mass of the planet accelerate in two opposite directions at the same time? Say if you drop a pencil on opposite sides of the earth at the same exact time. Given that, according to your gravity theory masses must accelerate towards each other.</p>

<p>The pencils would then float in mid air? Of course that doesn&#39;t happen. The pencils still fall. Which means according to your theory the mass of the earth accelerated in two opposite directions at the same time.<br/>
But there&#39;s a problem with that though, isn&#39;t there?</p>

<p>yes. but you still don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>You arrogantly talk down to me like you think I&#39;m some fool.  And yet, your quote: &quot;The forces acting on the Earth (from the pencils) would cancel. The force acting on the pencils would not.&quot;</p>

<p>if the forces acting on the earth are cancelled then the forces acting on the pencils are cancelled as well.</p>

<p>you can&#39;t ignore the forces just for your convenience in trying to prove gravity. if the earth doesn&#39;t act then the pencils don&#39;t act either.
There is no action without reaction. All forces happen in pairs equal and opposite.</p>

<p>Nothing that we&#39;ve spoken of is difficult to grasp. I know you hold yourself in high regard, but it is all very simple. Even a fool such as myself understands your concepts, flaws and all.</p>

<p>In following the rules of gravity, the first pencil cannot exert a force because it has been nullified by the other pencil. this conflict and fatal flaw arises from &quot;gravity&quot; itself, thus proving gravity as an unsatisfactory explanation. the net force thus exerted on the earth is zero. The force exerted by the pencil being zero, the earth cannot exert a force on the pencils either.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re right. There&#39;s 0% chance I&#39;d understand your inconsistent theories.
It&#39;s easy to understand nature though. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about the mass of the object regaining momentum progressively as it hurdles towards the Earth.  Even in your model it doesn&#39;t accelerate indefinitely.

<p>Certainly not. And i never stated it was necessary.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t claim understanding of something by simply giving it a name. And you can&#39;t prove the theory of gravity if you dont know how it works and offer no explanation for how it works.</p>

<p>So it begs the question. Does &quot;gravity&quot; exist at all? If beyond a name you can you offer no more of an explanation.</p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not asking for you to explain the phenomena again. We all know that the pencil will fall to the ground if you drop it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my problem: I&#39;ve seen a lot of videos on NASA, Flat Eart, Antarctica... and I was raised on the standard education system... and I know the powers that be lie about everything, and deceive to ensure power...but the reality is I haven&#39;t been to space...and I&#39;ve watched regular people lie about what they had for lunch...</p>

<p>why should I believe the Earth is round?  Why should I believe it&#39;s a globe? why doesn&#39;t anyone see that math and science are based part-way on guessing.  It&#39;s like a sudoku puzzle with nothing filled in.  Sure you can put a 6 in one quadrant and come up with a workable solution, but what if you put a 3 there instead? still get a solution, just a different one.  It&#39;s like we&#39;re not supposed to see this... but I do.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why there has to be this dialogue of certainty around everything.  People who literally haven&#39;t been outside of their county will sit there and rail you for thinking space isn&#39;t real.  wtf is that?  That feeds right into what the conspiracy theorists say about flat earth and archons and power through deception.  And yet, people are perfectly happy to go about their lives acting like it&#39;s all good.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s spin this around... why would they lie about?</p>

<p>For me, to seem plausible a conspiracy theory has to meet two criteria: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why would they lie about this? Is there an advantage to it? I don&#39;t see one here.</p></li>
<li><p>Could they keep it a secret? How many &quot;moving parts&quot; does it have? How many people have to keep their mouths shut? Again, I think this fails. I think far too many people have to be in on it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, we&#39;ve been teaching that the earth was round, all around the world, since before we dreamed of going to space.  So if you have a reason you feel is plausible for the first question above, apply this to it and see if it still holds up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a separate issue,it&#39;s not always practical though. For instance, I can&#39;t go to space. I don&#39;t even know who I would contact about that sort of thing.  I&#39;m a little long in the tooth for astronaut training, and they probably don&#39;t make spacesuits in XXXL.  That guy from that boy band did it, but I suspect millions of dollars changed hands, and I don&#39;t have that.  However, if I went, and came back and told you all about it, I suspect you wouldn&#39;t believe me - you might even try to explain why what I saw wasn&#39;t what it appeared to be.  But that&#39;s speculation.</p>

<p>It looks like we started teaching that the world was round somewhere in the 1500s.  Let me see if I have this right - correct me if I&#39;m wrong.  You&#39;re proposing that even though we started teaching that the world was round - they in fact knew that it wasn&#39;t. Even though there was no space program, no satellites, no airplanes, and no conceivable reason I can see to lie about it, this lie perpetrated.  For 500 years.  Eventually causing multiple superpowers around the world to fake space programs, again for reasons I don&#39;t personally understand.  This is what you&#39;re saying?  This seems reasonable to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Relatively few people have been to space, it looks like it&#39;s ~533 people (I actually would have guessed more).  So that is manageable.  But we depend on satellites for a lot of things.  And a LOT of engineers depend on them when they design things that receive a signal bounced off of a satellite.  And they know how a signal degrades over distances etc.  So I think they would know if there were no satellites.</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t see a reason for them to lie. It&#39;s not proof that they&#39;re not - but I don&#39;t have proof that the sun will come out tomorrow either.  I&#39;m pretty sure it will though because besides the statistical proof that it seems to every day, we have science that tells us that too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Were those things still a consideration 500 years ago?</p>

<p>I can see that any secret they&#39;ve kept they don&#39;t want to admit that they lied about. I still think it&#39;s pretty far fetched that they made this up and got every nation on earth to go along, especially when a lot of us don&#39;t get along. </p>

<p>We spent the better part of 40 years eye to eye with the Soviets. If there was an advantage to taking off the blindfold and saying &quot;look what they&#39;ve lied to you about&quot;, it seems likely that one side or the other would have done it. That&#39;s just one possibility. Even if you remove &quot;why would they keep this a secret?&quot;, there&#39;s still &quot;could they keep this a secret?&quot;. I think the answer is a resounding no.  You wouldn&#39;t just have to have the 500+ people who&#39;ve been in space lie about it. Everybody who was ever in the space program.  The space shuttles went up - I know people who watched it - where did it go if it wasn&#39;t in orbit?</p>

<p>Can we agree that the moon is round? Venus and Mars are clearly visible with the naked eye. Can we agree that they&#39;re round?</p>

<p>Edit: this is the first answer anybody has given to &quot;why would they lie about this?&quot;, and it boils down to &quot;so they don&#39;t find out they lied&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the answers are in the video I linked in the comments (linked several times, but here you go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4YqPtvJao">:)</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s no proof it&#39;s a plate (or a disk), it could just be a plane of existence.  Presumably it isn&#39;t an infinite plane, but in this theory, Antarctica is an ice wall that surrounds the known areas of the world.  *note that all of the Antarctic flight, cruise, and expedition companies track back to the same ownership group (not that their onerous cost and the locations inherent temperature isn&#39;t enough to keep most people away)</p>

<p>The ice wall stretches for miles (and there is documentation supporting this, including insight from one of the first American explorers of the Antarctic).  </p>

<p>And that should give you all the more reason to doubt what they teach in schools.  They don&#39;t fucking know if the core is a spinning ball of iron or a <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MtObrnaovrI/hqdefault.jpg">monkey banging symbols</a></p>
