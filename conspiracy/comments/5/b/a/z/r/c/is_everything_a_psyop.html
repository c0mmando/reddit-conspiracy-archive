        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hear me out, I&#39;m probably just falling down a rabbit hole of paranoia, but since the last couple days, watching Steven Pieczenic&#39;s latest videos, repeatedly, and what looks like DESPERATELY urging the public to concede to inevitable corruption, and not to &#39;fight&#39; back, but to so &#39;rationally&#39; and once the results come in Nov. 8 to accept the result, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure others are thinking the same way...but what if everything really is controlled opposition to further reinforce the fact that we are all truly <strong>powerless</strong>.</p>

<p>What if Alex Jones is made to make anyone that questions the narrative like lunatics? </p>

<p>What if the recent claims of pedophilia and child trafficking against the Clinton Foundation and others are to further discredit us for people to assume we  will believe everything.</p>

<p>What if this endless repetition that  JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED against the Clintons, i.e. the fbi, the nypd finally taking a stand is a psyop to make the public feel like something WILL happen, it will take care of itself - for us to sit back and do NOTHING. Not go out into the streets and protest, not act. </p>

<p>What if the people who now mod r/t_d are in on it too? The never-ending refrain of &quot;LANDSLIDE INCOMING!&quot; when the reality is, that on Nov. 8, Hillary will &quot;win&quot; by a hair, and memories of Trump and this movement will all but fade away. </p>

<p>Please, can someone inject their opinion into this. I can&#39;t help but discern that I&#39;m getting increasingly distrustful of the contradictory messages constantly encircling us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pieczenic is horse shit wanting to make some cash and raise his profile. All the NYPD rumours are just that. Nothing substantial there until proven otherwise. The same goes for raids and everything after too. All the performance art stuff is just hyped up by wish fulfilment.  </p>

<p>In the last few days this forums signal to noise ratio become very weak. There are so many real provable crimes this woman has committed. There is a huge amount of evidence backed up with a paper trail a mile long. Yet still we are being sidelined with nonsense. </p>

<p>Imo nobody is going to arrest her before the election. There will be no raids there&#39;s simply nothing to support that. In fact the opposite holds true. Everything we&#39;ve heard about the investigation is that it will be done methodically and with care and diligence. That&#39;s not a five day event.</p>

<p>Bottom line here is if people don&#39;t want Hillary as President don&#39;t put your hopes on her being dragged off. The only way you&#39;ll achieve change is if you go out and vote and with all we&#39;ve discovered even that may not help but still it remains all you can really do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I suppose in modern times every op is  psy op and every war is a proxy war.  It is funny how quickly we went from &quot;Hope and Change&quot; to &quot;Despair and Surrender&quot;, whether or not you think Obama has done a good job, at least he ran to defeat his opponent rather than the electorate. </p>

<p>The big takeaway here is that America has been inundated with reason to distrust their government, and their news media.  Democrats want to pin that on Russian subversiveness, but so much springs from news media incompetence that it would be hard to tie it all back to a single cause.  We shouldn&#39;t have an Alex Jones character as the only person discussing conspiracy, he doesn&#39;t have the brains or temperament for it.  But, Jones is the only popular public voice for conspiracy because we no longer have journalists who will look into conspiracy and see where it&#39;s going.  They investigate from their desks and go out into the field by taking their laptop down the street to get coffee.</p>

<p>There&#39;s quite obviously some real tension between the justice department and the FBI that needs to be resolved.  Even if everyone involved is above board and operating rationally, ethically, and openly, the end result will be a loss of governmental trust by US citizens and a likely abortion of justice.  If someone is telling you to stop worrying about judicial vs. executive right now, ignore them, that&#39;s a fucked up situation even on the surface.</p>

<p>Alex Jones isn&#39;t really important, he&#39;s playing a character regardless of the reason.  He may be a plant to make conspiracies all seem implausible, but his temperament, penchant for hyperbole, and lack of transparent sourcing on his statements mean he shouldn&#39;t be treated like a good resource for anything.  If he says something that sounds interesting, take a look.  I bet someone could make a living tracking down the exact percentage of truth in any Alex Jones bit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you should take to the streets or light things on fire or whatever if the election goes the wrong way for you.  You&#39;ll end up shot by cops or in jail, and it doesn&#39;t look like a good time to bunker down in a prison cell.  Though with the prison strike going on, at least you wouldn&#39;t have to work while you&#39;re there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Michael Savage is a very popular, also crazy, but definitively more intelligent and grounded alternative to Alex Jones in the pursuit of truth. He&#39;s been predicting what we&#39;re seeing right now for years, he&#39;s written books about what is happening. He is on 400 radio stations coast to coast from 3PM EST to 6PM EST every weekday, he is the 2nd most popular radio show in the country, he is a New York Times best seller even though they refuse to review his books or properly chart him most of the time, and he was voted into the radio hall of fame by his viewers (he got popular vote, he&#39;d never be chosen for such an honor otherwise given he is very conservative/libertarian). He has mentioned that he has 3 studios in San Fransisco, one in case his primary one has problems/is shut down that is a few blocks away, and a secret studio in an undisclosed location in case the world goes to shit so he can stay on the airwaves and provide people with the truth as much as possible. This is the guy to listen to, yes he is a guest occasionally on Alex Jones show, but he&#39;s a doctorate in nutrition who chose to go into conservative radio because people ultimately related to how he feels about the state of American leadership, or lack there of - of quality leadership. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;d categorize him as a conspiracy theorist, but more of a realist/pessimist conservative/libertarian with a very clear ability to see the truth through the web of lies that is spun constantly in front of American eyes. He&#39;s the guy to listen to that doesn&#39;t give you the impression you are being fed BS, at least he&#39;s pretty sure what he&#39;s telling you is the truth or the best he can provide you with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way i see it, they control every aspect of media. Do we really think TPTB dont have the power to shut down wikileaks?  They arent because they want it to be seen. They are simply testing the success of PHase 1 in ideological subversion. &quot;Can we put truth right in front of them and they still wont believe it?&quot;</p>

<p>You are spot on with Alex Jones. He there to make everyone sound crazy. Same with people like David Icke. Lots of truth to what they say then suddenly its all about FEMA death camps and Lizard people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Everything</em> you see on TV or read on popular websites or the newspaper is scripted drama. It&#39;s fake as a three-dollar bill. Trump is a psy op, too. </p>

<p>Trump supporters usually agree that the MSM is owned and controlled by a handful of people, and that they all hate Trump because he is a threat to &#39;the powers that be.&#39; They think that makes him a real outsider. Well if that&#39;s the case, then why has the MSM showered so much publicity on him? Positive or negative, it doesn&#39;t matter. Even bad publicity is good, especially when your viewership doesn&#39;t trust you. </p>

<p>They tell us he gets so much coverage because he is a huge ratings draw. Puh-leeeeze. If they didn&#39;t want him to be noticed, he wouldn&#39;t be noticed. It&#39;s no accident that he is a household name. They have been pumping him up all along. The fact that he is so famous and gets so much coverage is already proof that he is <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">part of the game.</a> I can&#39;t believe more people don&#39;t see it.
