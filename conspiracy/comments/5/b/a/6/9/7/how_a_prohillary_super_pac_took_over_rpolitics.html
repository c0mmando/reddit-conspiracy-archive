        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">187</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-11-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/rationalcomment.html">rationalcomment</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have never seen a more over the top and unsubtle example of political astroturfing than what happened to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for rational and balanced discourse, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> has been taken over by a Super PAC and is now  complete and total pro-Hillary propaganda <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fItaEy9.png">to an absurd degree</a>, a user did an analysis of the first 15 pages of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (375 posts) and found <a href="https://i.sli.mg/gHjmfW.png">87% of them were anti-Trump and ZERO were pro-Trump or anti-Hillary.</a> </p>

<p>Take a look at the following on any day:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.notreddit.top/">http://www.notreddit.top/</a></p>

<p>This shows the most downvoted posts on Reddit. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> dominates, and downvotes everything that goes against the pro-Hillary/anti-Trump narrative. Everything. It is the most downvoted new section by a country mile. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/4z7vjx/rpolitics_is_under_a_constant_bombardment_of/">It&#39;s absolutely shock full of new accounts doing this and there is no way that this is organic</a>, especially when the Hillary Clinton sub is a ghost town. Anyone saying anything positive about 3rd party candidates is quickly shut down.</p>

<p>For the unaware that sub has become a part of the Correct the Record Super PAC that aims to control the narrative in specific social media channels in order to convince people to vote Hillary. In fact they&#39;re very open about targeting Reddit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>more than tripling of its digital operation to engage in online messaging both for Secretary Clinton and to push back against attackers on social media platforms like Reddit</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://correctrecord.org/barrier-breakers-2016-a-project-of-correct-the-record/">http://correctrecord.org/barrier-breakers-2016-a-project-of-correct-the-record/</a></p>

<p>At this point it&#39;s not even remotely subtle, they replaced their entire modding team within the last year, including adding <a href="/r/EnoughTrumpSpam">/r/EnoughTrumpSpam</a> mods. Take a look at the post history of the mods of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> like Qu1nlan to realize just how openly biased they are, they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/4xw642/its_too_late_for_him_tigger/">post anti-Trump garbage on /r/EnoughTrumpSpam</a>.</p>

<p>The mods actively censor and delete pro-Trump posts, and they ban you if you mention Correct the Record. In fact they will straight up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/56qgv5/176666968_well_donald_trump_just_threatened_to/">delete a thread with nearly 8k upvotes and 7k comments simply because the people in it are calling them out on their censorship</a>. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even anything rare, go to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and you will find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/search?q=%2Fr%2Fpolitics&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=month">hundreds of censored /r/politics threads in the last month alone</a> or the long stream of people complaining in <a href="/r/subredditcancer">/r/subredditcancer</a> about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/523j7x/rpolitics_censorship_by_a_thousand_cuts/">their comments and submissions being deleted</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00578997">CTR is very well funded and organized, last quarter they spend $6 million in just 3 months</a>. We don&#39;t know yet what they spent this quarter but once it&#39;s announced expect it to run into tens of millions. Their strategy on Reddit seems to have been to first use <a href="/r/EnoughTrumpSpam">/r/EnoughTrumpSpam</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5npOuMj.jpg">a subreddit which suddenly saw virtually all of its subscribers join in two days,</a> incidently at exactly the same time that CTR announced their increase in funding! Then after Bernie endorsed Hillary, they saw an opportunity to apply their forum sliding tactics to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and dominate the discourse there. </p>

<p>They now even have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/57wtd7/the_top_rall_post_from_rpolitics_right_now_is_a/">HillaryClinton.com links as their #1 thread and shower it thousands of upvotes,</a> while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GaryJohnson/comments/57yunk/rpolitics_mods_removing_links_to_johnsonweldcom/">links from other candidates sites are instantly removed</a>. But then again they also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/56k5l7/rpolitics_we_also_do_not_allow_wikileaks/">don&#39;t even allow Wikileaks</a> and delete anything that goes against the narrative. Which at this point they don&#39;t need to do anymore as anything that goes against the pro-Hillary or anti-Trump narrative is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/4z7vjx/rpolitics_is_under_a_constant_bombardment_of/">instantly brigaded by the flurry of new accounts that camp on /r/new.</a></p>

<p>Their expenses are actually public record, you can see thousands of disbursements:</p>

<p><a href="https://beta.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&amp;disbursement_purpose_categories=other&amp;committee_id=C00578997&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&amp;max_date=10%2F05%2F2016">https://beta.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&amp;disbursement_purpose_categories=other&amp;committee_id=C00578997&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&amp;max_date=10%2F05%2F2016</a></p>

<p>The shills they hire are all part of public record and can be looked up by anyone:</p>

<p><a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/318/201607159020655318/201607159020655318.pdf#navpanes=">http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/318/201607159020655318/201607159020655318.pdf#navpanes=</a></p>

<p>Why do the admins allow the biggest political subreddit that is meant to be a place of discussion and intellectual diversity to devolve into a propaganda piece for one candidate? Well even Alexis Ohanian, the executive chairman of Reddit <a href="https://shift.newco.co/an-open-letter-from-technology-sector-leaders-on-donald-trumps-candidacy-for-president-5bf734c159e4#.pgo7pz6fj">denounced Trump openly in a letter.</a></p>

<p>The sad thing about all of this is that it&#39;s killing the sub. It had less pageviews and active users in October than the Trump subreddit. This is a horrible state of affairs for political discussion on Reddit when we need open conversation more than ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone posted a stickied thread on conspiracy where it&#39;s a multi-phase plan to control the narrative:</p>

<p>Infiltrate the reddit company first, which they did after Aaron committed &quot;suicide&quot;</p>

<p>Next infiltrate the moderator positions to control what is allowed on reddit. Most moderators have been replaced with new accounts in the last few months. </p>

<p>Remove the old voting system which showed total numbers of positive and negative votes, and replace it with a supposed system that that&#39;s the sum of the two and provides a value. They don&#39;t want people to know how many people are really on your side. </p>

<p>After you have control of the mods, and the voting system compromised, you ban, shadowban, and delete accounts which post negative information about their cartel, or candidate. </p>

<p>Finally hire a bunch of low cost labor,  to troll the treads, post disinformation, upvote positive information about their candidate,  downplay and distract when negative information does become public, and to monitor for any organized intelligent opposition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said. Thanks for taking the time there.</p>

<p>I still wonder how they made their huge entrance initially. And the must have had help from the inside, I mean look at the stats you state. It must be obvious to the owners of Reddit.</p>

<p>You know, as crazy as it sounds it just hit me regarding Aaron&#39;s suicide. I was just thinking of the legal problem he had and not Reddit. I guess he was key to &quot;take out&quot; in order to make an entrance? I mean would he have ever left Reddit, or did he? Any recommended stories on Aaron&#39;s &quot;suicide&quot;?</p>

<p>Thanks again,
