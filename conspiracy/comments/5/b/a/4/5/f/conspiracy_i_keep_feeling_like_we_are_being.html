       I'm afraid I think it's naive to rally up behind Trump like we've been led into in a reverse psychology way. Of course he's their guy and It's pretty obvious he's playing a role. The fact that media covers him at all even if negative is a red flag. Bernie they shut up about no matter what. How's that largest ever prison strike going BTW?

       If you're rich you cooperate with the even richher. Not because what you could gain, but because of what you would lose if you didn't. And these are the guys who literary has all the money because it's their monetary system.

       I still think she
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the "move". Look no further than the CFR, Kaine's womb.
       <em>
        He

       will administer the attempt at One-World-Rule. He can't even speak non-CFR-ese. The words themselves are pregnant with alternative meanings lining up with the globalist agendas.

       Great post, I agree that we are being played by both sides. We have the MSM, the government, federal agencies and various hackers all telling us a slightly different version of one story (for the most part) and various independent and alternative media/personalities telling us information. One side wants one candidate, and the other side wants (for the most part) the other. How convenient.
      </p>

       I've thought for a long time that anyone we actually know the names of, aren't in charge. Why take the risk? The names we have are the best sociopaths, narcissists, social climbers and religious affiliates that have gotten on the right side of their masters.
