    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid I think it&#39;s naive to rally up behind Trump like we&#39;ve been led into in a reverse psychology way. Of course he&#39;s their guy and It&#39;s pretty obvious he&#39;s playing a role. The fact that media covers him at all even if negative is a red flag. Bernie they shut up about no matter what. How&#39;s that largest ever prison strike going BTW?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re rich you cooperate with the even richher. Not because what you could gain, but because of what you would lose if you didn&#39;t. And these are the guys who literary has all the money because it&#39;s their monetary system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, I agree that we are being played by both sides. We have the MSM, the government, federal agencies and various hackers all telling us a slightly different version of one story (for the most part) and various independent and alternative media/personalities telling us information. One side wants one candidate, and the other side wants (for the most part) the other. How convenient. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve thought for a long time that anyone we actually know the names of, aren&#39;t in charge. Why take the risk? The names we have are the best sociopaths, narcissists, social climbers and religious affiliates that have gotten on the right side of their masters. </p>
