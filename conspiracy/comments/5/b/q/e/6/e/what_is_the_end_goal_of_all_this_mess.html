       As the title says...
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note a question i have: I just saw a post mentioning Illuminati/Satanism/Pedo while also mentioning names of people in power...my questions are:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) Why is pedophilia associated with those things?
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) If Satanism is involved, does that provide some sort of credibility to Christianity as the "true" religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) A lot of conspiracies seem to be tied to Judaism or Christianity, at least that i know of, if they turn to be true, is this a "proof" of the validity of the religion?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd ask r/debatereligion but i don't think i'd get any helpful answers.

       It goes back to sexual magick and the power they believe comes from it.

       A couple of things here, and I'll talk about this the more I make threads here but many of them are Luciferian, which isn't the Satanism you are thinking of. Others are involved in demonolatry. The problem with all of this is the umbrella/wide net being cast. As for Christianity being the "true" religion what is that? Yeshua (Jesus) wasn't a "Christian."

       He was Jewish, but some people saw him as the Messiah, which became Christianity, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So if conspiracy x has ties to Christian and Jewish theology and it is true, no longer a conspiracy, but fact, would that mean Christianity and Judaism are fact also? Lets say this happens with multiple conspiracies that become fact. Are these now proof for the religion they are linked too?

       He preached what is known as "The Way" and his followers were known as "People of the Way" or "Followers of the Way." The term "Christian" didn't come around until over 40+ years later and it was meant as a derogatory word.

       No, it would simply mean that that aspect of the conspiracy and the connection is fact.

      <p>
       No, see above. Also, the main point of Christianity is not fact but the bloodshed for remission of sins, grace and faith. However, the OT did have a very simple criteria when it came to someone making prophetic claims. If it came true, cool. If it didn't, stone the person.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ultimately, what you're asking is if these conspiracies are true, and it's always about these religions, then aren't those religions true? I am saying don't look at it like that because you can run into an issue of
       <em>
        syncretism
       </em>

       Well, when you look into conspiracies about UFOs you will see it in Hindu text as well. So it really depends on what type of theory you are looking for as there are different motifs from each religion. But usually the Abrahamic religions will usually focus on a messianic figure (on both sides of the coin), a one world system, a final battle, judgement and punishment.

       Why is pedophilia involved - because in their beliefs doing these things translates to power in the realm of spirits they believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does actually verify both the good and the evil and that bit is the real divide at the end of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       the validity of the truth is in the evidence. The people who rule this world (have ruled it for a long, long time) believe in a Luciferian power. They're insane, yes...but they're not one bit stupid. They're very clever in knowing how to get worldly power and keep it. That says something about the truth of the spiritual side of it.

       They believe in it and succeed with it because it has real power. That's the evil part of it...and since there is an evil part of it, yes, there is a good side with real power as well. In fact God's side is going to be the answer to all this evil in the end. None of us really will be.

       Following Christ Himself is the truth..following a church leader is following a church leader, however. So, being careful with a label is a must.

       If someone in the US can commit acts of pedophilia and not be held accountable for it, then it proves they have a certain amount of power.  You say that the power is in the realm of spirits.  What if the power is from controlling law enforcement and the judges?  If you have enough power and influence and MONEY, then you can control the entire judicial system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary is showing that she can control and influence the FBI and Department of Justice, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch the documentary on youtube called Conspiracy of Silence and you will see what I mean.  The people being accused of molesting kids are being protected by the police, judges, and prosecutors that should be protecting the kids.  They system is working backwards, and some of the molested kids actually end up in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       No spirits are necessary to make this happen.

      <p>
       It is just an alternative interpretation.

       I would have to say that if they had not seen the results they wanted they would not have continued this path for generations. They believe they communicate with these beings, they believe these beings are their gods, in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe some would not take this as explanation enough, but for me, the answer is right here:
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;
      </p>
      <p>
       And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. - Mat 4:9,10
      </p>
      <p>
       This offer was refused by Christ, of course..but its the very offer that the rulers of the world have taken.

       "illuminati" or Luciferian stuff is reall simply put an inside out version of allegiance to Christ. It is the counterfeit of the Truth. Being that it is that, rather than just an overtly evil thing you will find that as the bible states:

       The end game certainly isn't a debate over religion. Every non-defective human can agree that raping and killing children is not acceptable. Or maybe not... the Catholic Church still employs and protects it's rapists and defilers with little to no objection...

       Have you read Atlas Shrugged?  I hate this fucking book, and I hate Ayn Rand.  Anyways, a lot of people in power love this book and they worship Ayn Rand like she had something important to say.

       The gist of Atlas Shrugged is that money is to be worshipped.

       When you read the Wikileaks emails, what concerns these people the most?  They are not discussing how to get clean drinking water to the people in Flint.  They are not discussing helping humanity.  They do not give a shit about us, the voters, except how to best manipulate us into accepting them as our leaders.  The roads where I live used to be nice, but now they are getting shittier and shittier.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people worship money.  And, I mean both the Democrats and the Republicans.  They are not humanists.  They do not care about humanity, especially the poor.  I recently read that they want to decrease the worlds population very significantly.  This is on my long list of things to look into more.

       1.) Why is pedophilia associated with those things?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is all about being human.  Sex is a basic need because we are sexual beings.  We also desire power and control.  If you are at a level in society in which you can commit a crime, get away with it, and be sexually satisfied, then apparently you will do it to demonstrate your power and control.  Please keep in mind that other societies have practiced pedophilia openly because it was acceptable and even encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another aspect of this is control of the population.  The people in power view "us" in a certain way.  We are the governed.  We are to be preyed upon.  This is why we pay taxes that are used to subsidize the businesses of the rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess we also provide children that can be taken away.  I was looking for FBI statistics regarding how many children go missing each year.  It is not at all clear.  Maybe they do not want us to realize the true number.  What numbers they do provide are not broken down into age groups other than "Under 18".  There is a video on youtube called Conspiracy of Silence.  There are also interviews with teenagers that claim they were abducted and used at sex and drug parties, and even at the Bohemian Grove.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) If Satanism is involved, does that provide some sort of credibility to Christianity as the "true" religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth.  The Ninth Rule is "Do not harm little children."  There are also Nine Satanic Sins, which are interesting to read.  Anyways, the Bible does not include in the Ten Commandments a prohibition against harming little children.  I am not sure in what sense you would consider Christianity as being "true".  I am a secular humanist, so I am not disparaging Christianity.  It just seems that the Christian God would have commanded us to not hurt little children, like the Satanists...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what we are dealing with here is the Occult.  Some call it the Illuminati.  Either way, I know there is something because of the symbolism, such as on our currency.  Why would someone go through the trouble of putting those symbols on our money if it was not important?  There is also the architecture and the rituals.  I am currently reading about Freemasonry and the Illuminati, but it is not easy to find sources that are not from whacked out people.  I would like the know who the expert is on this topic; someone with the expertise of a Chomsky.  Then I know the information is accurate and will not lead me to UFO's or bigfoot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, there is some organization that is pushing its agenda upon us.  We can make it easy for them, or we can push back.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) A lot of conspiracies seem to be tied to Judaism or Christianity, at least that i know of, if they turn to be true, is this a "proof" of the validity of the religion?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure how to answer this one.  Have you read about Freemasonry?  It is a secular organization.  They do not care which religion you follow, as long as you believe in a Creator.  It seems like the lower levels of Freemasonry are there to groom you for what comes next.  I have no idea what that could be, but, whatever it is, it must be unbelievable without the grooming first taking place.  It is why they do it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is probably like Scientology.  They do no tell you about Zenu and the volcano until you have already committed much time and money to the organization.  If they tell you about Zenu and the volcano at the very beginning, then you will see how batshit crazy it is and walk away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of our founding fathers were into Freemasonry.

       Interesting. Well i didn't end up joining. I got a bid, but didn't mostly cause i financial reasons(Fraternities are expensive) and i was only doing it for the party and girls lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, im more disturbed by the fact that at my school alone you got hundreds of freshmen fraternities joining and they don't even know what theyre really about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guys in this particular one were cool, but i like to question everything, down to the symbols on every shield, and i found answers...Most others don't do this and simply remember important dates. If they are given a handbook, i doubt they read them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if all they have some odd connections? If so, could that explain the constant date rape, partying, and general hedonism that they are accustomed to?

       Yes, it seems like the Greek life is to condition people...  I never joined either.  It really is not my style.

       I think the lifestyle they promote is what the "typical" young person "should want in college". We see it all the time in movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone claims to be "woke" but they don't question things that a basic skeptic or person who generally wants to know the "Why" would question. I was chilling in a student lounge today with some friends and everyone was going on and on about president stuff this and race relation that...I don't have the answers to everything but i have a feeling that all that stuff they bicker about isn't even really our control; its kinda thrown at your face and the people who fall for it, fall for it hard.

       It's Luciferian not satanism. 
Christianity is a cover for the real truth. 
I'm not sure we will know in this lifetime.

       Because the "Christian" story (Bible) has been edited, translated and rewritten by those in power for thousands of years, there has to be a reason for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some traceable historical truths involved but the stories surrounding it have been fabricated and embellished over time to serve a purpose in swaying the population to wage wars and choose sides we barely understand. I fear that the real story of our existence and the meaning of life is being downplayed and hidden behind the veil of man made religion.

       I thinked about this and came up with one explanation ....
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         E-mails were hacked , or taken by FBI , or something.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They've been in possesion of J.Assange from then on, 
because everybody knows he is Prime Master Leaker.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why leak them in segments ?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why not drop the whole bomb?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Remember someone say "you won't believe the shit they're up to!"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         J.Assange is negotiating his position with slow (possible chosen) segmented leaks.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If Trump wins, "Let's see how I helped you win , and what can you do for my position ? (PS. I might have something on you, too)"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If Hillary wins (since she's actively pro war with Russia, anti-wikileaks, drop the whole bomb , see the world burn in fire!
        </p>

       Well , you can repeat just enough times about how evil Putin is , then you have to go to measures used in Irak, Libya , and Syria .... You don't see the media pattern ?  Anyway , it's all about resources.
