<p>On a side note a question i have: I just saw a post mentioning Illuminati/Satanism/Pedo while also mentioning names of people in power...my questions are:</p>

<p>1.) Why is pedophilia associated with those things?</p>

<p>2.) If Satanism is involved, does that provide some sort of credibility to Christianity as the &quot;true&quot; religion.</p>

<p>3.) A lot of conspiracies seem to be tied to Judaism or Christianity, at least that i know of, if they turn to be true, is this a &quot;proof&quot; of the validity of the religion?</p>

<p>I&#39;d ask r/debatereligion but i don&#39;t think i&#39;d get any helpful answers.</p>

<p>It goes back to sexual magick and the power they believe comes from it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2.) If Satanism is involved, does that provide some sort of credibility to Christianity as the &quot;true&quot; religion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A couple of things here, and I&#39;ll talk about this the more I make threads here but many of them are Luciferian, which isn&#39;t the Satanism you are thinking of. Others are involved in demonolatry. The problem with all of this is the umbrella/wide net being cast. As for Christianity being the &quot;true&quot; religion what is that? Yeshua (Jesus) wasn&#39;t a &quot;Christian.&quot;</p>

<p>He was Jewish, but some people saw him as the Messiah, which became Christianity, right?</p>

<p>So if conspiracy x has ties to Christian and Jewish theology and it is true, no longer a conspiracy, but fact, would that mean Christianity and Judaism are fact also? Lets say this happens with multiple conspiracies that become fact. Are these now proof for the religion they are linked too?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He preached what is known as &quot;The Way&quot; and his followers were known as &quot;People of the Way&quot; or &quot;Followers of the Way.&quot; The term &quot;Christian&quot; didn&#39;t come around until over 40+ years later and it was meant as a derogatory word. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if conspiracy x has ties to Christian and Jewish theology and it is true, no longer a conspiracy, but fact, would that mean Christianity and Judaism are fact also?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it would simply mean that that aspect of the conspiracy and the connection is fact. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lets say this happens with multiple conspiracies that become fact. Are these now proof for the religion they are linked too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, see above. Also, the main point of Christianity is not fact but the bloodshed for remission of sins, grace and faith. However, the OT did have a very simple criteria when it came to someone making prophetic claims. If it came true, cool. If it didn&#39;t, stone the person. </p>

<p>But ultimately, what you&#39;re asking is if these conspiracies are true, and it&#39;s always about these religions, then aren&#39;t those religions true? I am saying don&#39;t look at it like that because you can run into an issue of <em>syncretism</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, when you look into conspiracies about UFOs you will see it in Hindu text as well. So it really depends on what type of theory you are looking for as there are different motifs from each religion. But usually the Abrahamic religions will usually focus on a messianic figure (on both sides of the coin), a one world system, a final battle, judgement and punishment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is pedophilia involved - because in their beliefs doing these things translates to power in the realm of spirits they believe in. </p>

<p>It does actually verify both the good and the evil and that bit is the real divide at the end of the day.</p>

<p>the validity of the truth is in the evidence. The people who rule this world (have ruled it for a long, long time) believe in a Luciferian power. They&#39;re insane, yes...but they&#39;re not one bit stupid. They&#39;re very clever in knowing how to get worldly power and keep it. That says something about the truth of the spiritual side of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone in the US can commit acts of pedophilia and not be held accountable for it, then it proves they have a certain amount of power.  You say that the power is in the realm of spirits.  What if the power is from controlling law enforcement and the judges?  If you have enough power and influence and MONEY, then you can control the entire judicial system.  </p>

<p>Hillary is showing that she can control and influence the FBI and Department of Justice, for example.  </p>

<p>Watch the documentary on youtube called Conspiracy of Silence and you will see what I mean.  The people being accused of molesting kids are being protected by the police, judges, and prosecutors that should be protecting the kids.  They system is working backwards, and some of the molested kids actually end up in prison.  </p>

<p>No spirits are necessary to make this happen.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1.) Why is pedophilia associated with those things?</p>

<p>I think it is all about being human.  Sex is a basic need because we are sexual beings.  We also desire power and control.  If you are at a level in society in which you can commit a crime, get away with it, and be sexually satisfied, then apparently you will do it to demonstrate your power and control.  Please keep in mind that other societies have practiced pedophilia openly because it was acceptable and even encouraged.  </p>

<p>Another aspect of this is control of the population.  The people in power view &quot;us&quot; in a certain way.  We are the governed.  We are to be preyed upon.  This is why we pay taxes that are used to subsidize the businesses of the rich.  </p>

<p>I guess we also provide children that can be taken away.  I was looking for FBI statistics regarding how many children go missing each year.  It is not at all clear.  Maybe they do not want us to realize the true number.  What numbers they do provide are not broken down into age groups other than &quot;Under 18&quot;.  There is a video on youtube called Conspiracy of Silence.  There are also interviews with teenagers that claim they were abducted and used at sex and drug parties, and even at the Bohemian Grove.  </p>

<p>2.) If Satanism is involved, does that provide some sort of credibility to Christianity as the &quot;true&quot; religion.  </p>

<p>There are Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth.  The Ninth Rule is &quot;Do not harm little children.&quot;  There are also Nine Satanic Sins, which are interesting to read.  Anyways, the Bible does not include in the Ten Commandments a prohibition against harming little children.  I am not sure in what sense you would consider Christianity as being &quot;true&quot;.  I am a secular humanist, so I am not disparaging Christianity.  It just seems that the Christian God would have commanded us to not hurt little children, like the Satanists...  </p>

<p>I think what we are dealing with here is the Occult.  Some call it the Illuminati.  Either way, I know there is something because of the symbolism, such as on our currency.  Why would someone go through the trouble of putting those symbols on our money if it was not important?  There is also the architecture and the rituals.  I am currently reading about Freemasonry and the Illuminati, but it is not easy to find sources that are not from whacked out people.  I would like the know who the expert is on this topic; someone with the expertise of a Chomsky.  Then I know the information is accurate and will not lead me to UFO&#39;s or bigfoot.  </p>

<p>Either way, there is some organization that is pushing its agenda upon us.  We can make it easy for them, or we can push back.  </p>

<p>3.) A lot of conspiracies seem to be tied to Judaism or Christianity, at least that i know of, if they turn to be true, is this a &quot;proof&quot; of the validity of the religion?</p>

<p>I am not sure how to answer this one.  Have you read about Freemasonry?  It is a secular organization.  They do not care which religion you follow, as long as you believe in a Creator.  It seems like the lower levels of Freemasonry are there to groom you for what comes next.  I have no idea what that could be, but, whatever it is, it must be unbelievable without the grooming first taking place.  It is why they do it that way.  </p>

<p>It is probably like Scientology.  They do no tell you about Zenu and the volcano until you have already committed much time and money to the organization.  If they tell you about Zenu and the volcano at the very beginning, then you will see how batshit crazy it is and walk away.  </p>

<p>Most of our founding fathers were into Freemasonry.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Well i didn&#39;t end up joining. I got a bid, but didn&#39;t mostly cause i financial reasons(Fraternities are expensive) and i was only doing it for the party and girls lol.</p>

<p>Still, im more disturbed by the fact that at my school alone you got hundreds of freshmen fraternities joining and they don&#39;t even know what theyre really about.</p>

<p>The guys in this particular one were cool, but i like to question everything, down to the symbols on every shield, and i found answers...Most others don&#39;t do this and simply remember important dates. If they are given a handbook, i doubt they read them.</p>

<p>I wonder if all they have some odd connections? If so, could that explain the constant date rape, partying, and general hedonism that they are accustomed to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the lifestyle they promote is what the &quot;typical&quot; young person &quot;should want in college&quot;. We see it all the time in movies.</p>

<p>Everyone claims to be &quot;woke&quot; but they don&#39;t question things that a basic skeptic or person who generally wants to know the &quot;Why&quot; would question. I was chilling in a student lounge today with some friends and everyone was going on and on about president stuff this and race relation that...I don&#39;t have the answers to everything but i have a feeling that all that stuff they bicker about isn&#39;t even really our control; its kinda thrown at your face and the people who fall for it, fall for it hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the &quot;Christian&quot; story (Bible) has been edited, translated and rewritten by those in power for thousands of years, there has to be a reason for that. </p>

<p>There are some traceable historical truths involved but the stories surrounding it have been fabricated and embellished over time to serve a purpose in swaying the population to wage wars and choose sides we barely understand. I fear that the real story of our existence and the meaning of life is being downplayed and hidden behind the veil of man made religion.</p>
