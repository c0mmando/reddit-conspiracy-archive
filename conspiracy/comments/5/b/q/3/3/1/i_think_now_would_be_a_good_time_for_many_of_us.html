<p>Corruption seems pretty acceptable.</p>

<p>So we have delved into&quot;tabloid&quot; territory because the info is there. I know a sketch is a stretch but that is exactly how leads are created. </p>

<p>Huge speculation, but a dude who happens to look like sketch and has some weird pedo allegations going on is not an insane thing to investigate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I can see your reasoning there, that it should be worthy to be on the front page.  And I do think that people get excited and want to break new ground (there&#39;s an almost hero worship of it).  </p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s something I don&#39;t encourage or discourage because it&#39;s all very new to me.  For me, less than 6 months ago I would&#39;ve thought it was ridiculous to say false flags were staged, or even question 9/11, so that I&#39;m not comfortable rejecting anything.  Hell, up til a year ago I believed the official JFK story!</p>

<p>If you have more experience with it, I can see why it would seem really ridiculous. (I honestly can&#39;t fathom why so many people in charge would be interested in sex with children; isn&#39;t that a specific kind of mental illness for all these people to share)?  And I do also question judgement when I see Madeline MCcan, but there&#39;s a new, tiny &quot;what if?&quot; that I cannot ignore, and that is what drove my answer above.</p>

<p>You seem to think the front page exists to entertain you, and that it should only contain content that you personally think is valuable. The reality is that this is a discussion board, where various conversations are shaped in real-time by the input of thousands of contributors daily. We figure out what material deserves to be promoted by having posts reach the front page where everyone can see them and evaluate them, not by comparing them against the personal tastes of one asshole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s a pretty fallacious fucking leap you&#39;ve got there, saying that an inert post on a message board actually has a causative effect on some dickhead deciding to run up on a grieving family. I mean if this were a scientific model I would expect to see repeatability, but instead we only have this one outlier who accosted Sandy Hook victims when thousands upon thousands saw the posts without incident. Just saying, that thinking doesn&#39;t really fly bro.</p>

<p>If you were hot on the trail of some organized pedo shit and wanted to crowdsource more people to help investigate and see if it held any water, how exactly would you do it? There really isn&#39;t any way to do it without associating the pedophilia with those parties in your communications with the crowd. If that&#39;s all it takes to accuse and be inappropriate for doing it, you&#39;re essentially promoting a model where things are not allowed to be investigated under any circumstances. Seeing how the very purpose of this board is to investigate, I don&#39;t think that approach makes any sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well the truth is, a lot of my argument was a devil&#39;s advocate, trolling practice sort of argument, and I agree with a lot of what you&#39;re saying. Unfortunately, I think the only point that actually matters is that solving the issue is dependent on the competence of the individual, which means that doing things your way is effectively impossible. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t support investigative material being presented as though it&#39;s factual any more than I support weirdos going after Sandy Hook families, but I also don&#39;t think there&#39;s any logical place to draw a line when it comes to how much discretion the individual should exercise to account for the possibility his conduct could justify the behavior of some unknown fucking mental disorder.</p>

<p>also, I think this PizzaGate stuff is more substantial than you&#39;re willing to consider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its unlikely any concrete evidence will be found on this pedo/satanic narrative. It&#39;s far more likely that the people who believe and are pushing this pedo/satanic story are unwitting pawns in the real conspiracy to distract, discredit, delegitimize the clear evidence that exists in the wikileaks for actual crimes committed. Right out of counter intelligence playbook... muddy the waters and obscure the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. There&#39;s actually evidence that the elite is involved in this kind of stuff (see also: Jeffrey Epstein and friend, which include Clinton and Trump and Dershowitz and Summers and etc), but what&#39;s going on right now here with the ridiculous witchhunts is incredibly discrediting AND distracts from the real DC corruption being exposed in these emails.</p>

<p>I saw someone post something the other day about an email that was obviously a conversation about a lobbyist Christmas gift where users were jumping to all kinds of embarrassingly stupid conclusions. Like &quot;cheese&quot; is drugs or child porn...when right there, staring them in the face - is actual monetary corruption in these emails, all kinds of conflicts of interest, but no, we gotta act like an actual pizza place is a human trafficking hotspot because someone on 4chan made some crazy shit up and we can&#39;t spend five minutes to think for ourselves and titillation is a lot easier than following the money...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but when a lead doesn&#39;t pan out you have to be able to walk away from it, not grasp at another straw and force it to fit your preconceived notions. Like a lot of people have pointed out there is no evidence that anything OP mentioned is true... Don&#39;t give me code words and police sketches. When there is evidence it&#39;s a conspiracy theory, when there isn&#39;t is just a fairytale/wishful thinking/confirmation bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This election is exactly what many of us have at least came across at some point in our own researches. It&#39;s near textbook wet dream for a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>The pedo rings, all of us have came across a story that references elite pedo rings. This is like watching what you&#39;ve feared come to life.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not going away, and it&#39;s part of the Grand Conspiracy.</p>

<p>How many people is Podesta working for in these emails? How many paychecks? Whose causes championed?</p>
