       I think it's being done to discredit the conspiracy theorist once again. A way to lump us all together and dismiss us without giving consideration for any conspiracy fact that has been proven correct.

       Maybe, but high profile people are going to be big news if they get caught doing anything.  This is something that could essentially be like opening a can of worms if caught.  To much risk on what if.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should someone get caught doing something p there's probqably vows of silence that are chosen meaning you do it yourself or we'll do it for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The types of things and secrets, I would expect people in those circles to have and are expected to keep would be far too valuable to risk on something like this.  By 2007 JP had already been in politics and was a known player.  Any membership ritual was likely somthing he encountered long before serving for Bill Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may be right but why release the info right now? To feed a villain to the masses perhaps? If HRC wins the electoral and steals the election then the people will want some kind of blood or at least something else to chase after.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps hes agreed to be thrown to the wolves.  Its like one of the released emails said about offering Bernie a way to win even when losing.  Same strategy applies though with us...give us something to shift focus on until inauguration is over. Divide the focus and try to comeback and corral everyone on the same team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows what's really happening except that its getting fake up votes and keeping us from having more combined focus on other things.

       The majority of the accounts that are pushing this are also very young accounts. I haven't seen one established conspiracy contributor attempt to push this narrative. It's wholly outside our established community, including most of the commenting inside the threads.

       Until there's some real hard evidence I'm not touching it with a ten foot pole. Just be aware that if someone encourages you to harass any business or individual you may be a victim of an agent provocateur and be made an example of. It's one thing to investigate, it's a whole other ballgame if you start harassing people.

       The financial connections are real. If this is all just a coincidence, oh well. The result is that we learning about the financial arrangements between these entities. That alone is the real trail that no other obsessed group is looking into as obsessively.

       I've also noticed that accounts pushing this idea the hardest mostly seem to have accounts which are only a month old. Very unusual, highly suspicious. Especially since I was looking into these connections before they blew up on this sub, as they were first breaking on 8chan and there does seem to be some credible connections. Is it possible they would push us to look at something real that won't get traction in the mainstream consciousness because they know it won't get traction due to how extreme the allegations are? Would they point us at real pedophilia to distract us from other criminal behavior that COULD permeate the public consciousness, like Hillary illegally emailing classified material to her maid to print out?

       The resemblance is uncanny. The comparison photo is striking at first glance of a preview size. The referenced stories requires opening and reading a long piece. Because of this, I think the votes could be the legit.

       It's important to keep in mind, that a lot of people look alike.

       This is not my opinion, but I have read that others have theorized that she was given drugs, because the parents wanted to go out. (sleeping pills).  After they got back, she was dead.  They dumped the evidence.

       This is my opinion -&gt; One of the sketches does look like the father a little bit.  I'm not saying he did anything, or anything other than her father happens to be one of the people who looks like the sketch.

       The image of McCann's abductors is actually one abductor:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Their evidence was compelling, but it was only in October 2013 that two e-fit images of the man, compiled by police from descriptions given by Mr and Mrs Smith, were released by Scotland Yard to coincide with a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction of Madeleineâ€™s disappearance. He remains a suspect.

       Tineye.com , a reverse image search engine, links the composite pictures to the McCann case as early as 15 October 2013. The resemblance is more than just coincidental between the Podesta brothers and the suspects. A lot of stories don't gain traction because they're  too theoretical, but when a story goes from conspiracy theory to conspiracy analysis, obviously readers are going to push the story to the top.
