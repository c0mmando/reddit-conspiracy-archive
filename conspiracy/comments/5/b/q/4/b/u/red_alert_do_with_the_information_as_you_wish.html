    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but high profile people are going to be big news if they get caught doing anything.  This is something that could essentially be like opening a can of worms if caught.  To much risk on what if.  </p>

<p>Should someone get caught doing something p there&#39;s probqably vows of silence that are chosen meaning you do it yourself or we&#39;ll do it for you.</p>

<p>The types of things and secrets, I would expect people in those circles to have and are expected to keep would be far too valuable to risk on something like this.  By 2007 JP had already been in politics and was a known player.  Any membership ritual was likely somthing he encountered long before serving for Bill Clinton.  </p>

<p>You may be right but why release the info right now? To feed a villain to the masses perhaps? If HRC wins the electoral and steals the election then the people will want some kind of blood or at least something else to chase after.  </p>

<p>Perhaps hes agreed to be thrown to the wolves.  Its like one of the released emails said about offering Bernie a way to win even when losing.  Same strategy applies though with us...give us something to shift focus on until inauguration is over. Divide the focus and try to comeback and corral everyone on the same team.  </p>

<p>Who knows what&#39;s really happening except that its getting fake up votes and keeping us from having more combined focus on other things.</p>

<p>Until there&#39;s some real hard evidence I&#39;m not touching it with a ten foot pole. Just be aware that if someone encourages you to harass any business or individual you may be a victim of an agent provocateur and be made an example of. It&#39;s one thing to investigate, it&#39;s a whole other ballgame if you start harassing people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve also noticed that accounts pushing this idea the hardest mostly seem to have accounts which are only a month old. Very unusual, highly suspicious. Especially since I was looking into these connections before they blew up on this sub, as they were first breaking on 8chan and there does seem to be some credible connections. Is it possible they would push us to look at something real that won&#39;t get traction in the mainstream consciousness because they know it won&#39;t get traction due to how extreme the allegations are? Would they point us at real pedophilia to distract us from other criminal behavior that COULD permeate the public consciousness, like Hillary illegally emailing classified material to her maid to print out? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tineye.com , a reverse image search engine, links the composite pictures to the McCann case as early as 15 October 2013. The resemblance is more than just coincidental between the Podesta brothers and the suspects.
