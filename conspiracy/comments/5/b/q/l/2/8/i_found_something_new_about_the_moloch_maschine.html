        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so I googled &quot;Moloch Maschine&quot; (after coming across <a href="http://imgur.com/a/C9ljv">this</a>), and lo and behold, the first thing that came up was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mxjZvu-u3s">song</a> in that creepy &quot;minimalist&quot; (untalented and basic) style that Majesticape and the people in their clique seem to think is music. Aside from the song, the only other reference to it was <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Moloch-Maschine-Kultur-Wirtschaftskrise-Welt/dp/B003WUEYGG">this book</a> titled &quot;Moloch Maschine: The economic crises of the world&quot;, by a guy named Stuart Chase. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Chase#Selected_bibliography">The guy&#39;s</a> wikipedia page has a &quot;selected bibliography&quot;, but the book isn&#39;t mentioned on there, and it&#39;s only available through websites written in German. The only thing I could find about the book is a reference to it in the footnotes of <em>another</em> book, which you can see <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9idlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=moloch+maschine+stuart+chase&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OXEHNLQ-1Q&amp;sig=Jw21mplpnTU47OSJ7KqU2iRQ6rk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK3s7JipjQAhXjj1QKHczHA10Q6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=moloch%20maschine%20stuart%20chase&amp;f=false">here</a>, saying it was a book championing the role of technology in society.</p>

<p>Dunno why the book was titled that way, or what Moloch has to do with technology and society, or why it would make such a perfect gift to the weird ass owner of a pizza shop, but I figure it couldn&#39;t hurt to share. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one off the top of my head:</p>

<p>The increase in technology decreases the need for people, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/vJgtRBkFnfw">like Elon Musk was saying</a>.</p>

<p>We know that the elite would like to keep the population down to 500 Million according to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones">Georgia Guidestones</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch">Moloch is the god of child sacrifice.</a></p>

<p>SO, maybe their goal is to automate the earth, and reduce the population with child sacrifice?</p>

<p>I dont know man... Doesn&#39;t seem too far fetched at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Population trends toward childlessness when child mortality goes away and people have leisure. In essence, the Gates of the world are reducing the population growth by introducing developing nations to hygiene, birth control and controlling malaria. If people did relatively well for themselves, population would decrease instead of increasing as is happening in Scandinavia where my family comes from. How could population control via infanticide ever be a viable doable thing? Even if it was practiced by thousands, sounds impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh they have wayyyy better eugenics in place already than to resort to child sacrifice as an effective process. Poisoning the world seems to be doing just fine when u mix in war and whatnot. 
IMO their rituals are for personal satisfaction (psychopaths need extremes ends and they are all psychopaths) and also because they are forced to embrace it. 
It&#39;s the only way they can keep checks and balances on each other. Make sure everyone is as fucking sick as you are and they can&#39;t really challenge you in the real world. Then they learn to like and even love it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it does. Mindless, emotion based, material consumption. Also &#39;buying&quot; into your urges and carrying them out upon others unjustly to feel &quot;superior&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>This resonates with me as well. I don&#39;t know many &#39;elites&#39; but they have a disdain of us regular people and base their self-worth on being part of the group (initiated into) or own the group (rich). And as queen-mab says suck up all the life out of those at the bottom. Which I&#39;ve never seen as literal until now.</p>
