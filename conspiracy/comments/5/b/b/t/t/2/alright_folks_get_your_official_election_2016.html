<p>Yeah, but you said voting is real. I&#39;m trying to focus on that for a bit.

<p>Ok...and how is this related to what you are being asked?</p>

<p>What are you trying to convey here?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You just said Trump and Clinton as representing two warring factions of the elite. So, if this is true, and remember those are your words, wouldn&#39;t that mean voting is a psyop and that we&#39;re willingly accepting their dictates?</p>
