       Please stop for a moment and consider this... Consider that instead of child trafficking, their main biz is a huge drug ring. Think about
      </p>
      <p>
       -pizza references- sound more like drug speak than child stuff
      </p>
      <p>
       -that have a perfect transport situation... Private planes no security
      </p>
      <p>
       -"medical" offices like the one hrc visited after she passed out
      </p>
      <p>
       -there are some many more!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm posting this in various threads... The Clintons are possibly a drug ring!!! Think about all the pizza references... They pertain to drugs!!! We need to get on this... Child trafficking etc were just a diversion...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not ctr, and I'm not trolling, we need to research this angle/theory
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to figure out how this all connects
      </p>
      <p>
       Please just consider this for a moment

       I agree. My gut reaction to the "playing dominos on pasta or cheese(I think?) " sounded like they were getting high and playing dominos. I am a nobody and my opinion doesn't matter. Just saying that's how it read to me. Just put these fucks in jail forever.

       I personally think it is about drugs also. It actually makes even more sense when the words are replaced with drugs. When you replace the words with the child sex slave stuff it's still written very awkwardly and still doesn't make that much sense. Thinking about it critically, I don't think the Clinton camp would be stupid enough to talk about this stuff on these unsecured channels, but talking about drugs using these codewords seems extremely plausible for the Clinton camp as they could just say it was other things. Point being that drugs makes a lot more sense in every single email that has food in it with the context clearly laid out, with the child sex in the place of these emails the emails still seem extremely poorly written and still off-sounding. Just my pov right now.

       I mean I would love for it to come out that is actually the pedo ring, but I think people here just saw these emails with codewords and wished the same trying to push that narrative that people have suspected for a long time. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they are involved with that, but I'm personally not convinced at all that these emails are talking about the pedo rings.

       But I completely agree with the lingo being used. - like leftover pasta from xmas - ummm that sounds like drugs to me just the logistics of keeping drugs vs children. But then again it could all be that fucked.

       Drug smuggling is small potatoes. There is mountains of evidence that the Clinton's have smuggled drugs since Mena, Arkansas.

       This child sex ring has a chance to end her. And you are trying to put up a smoke screen for her. Sorry pal, I think people in this sub are too smart for that.

       The clinton foundation deals in human trafficking, drugs and weapons. All of these food references are about the sex ring. I think the child sex ring has WAY more influence than drugs. I think you think that too.

       Look up the Mena connection. I grew up in Mena, AR, it has (I think) the largest noncommercial international airport in the united states. In a town of 5000 people. The airport is a major industry in town and they do repairs on planes of all sizes, all the way up to 737s. From what I've been told, and I know several present and past employees, is that cocaine was stuffed into seats of large plans and brought into Mena, where during "renovations", the government (with Bush Sr. as president and Bill Clinton as AR governor) would remove the cocaine, fill the seats up with guns and weapons, close them back up, and fly them back out. Huge cover ups and investigations and planes flying in and out all day every day.

       I definitely think they could be or are interested... I just don't see the talk about the drug smuggling that could coincide

       The drug angle would be easier to prove, but as history teaches us, the police stop looking once they believe the public is satisfied. Check out Operation Ore (UK) and Operation Avalanche (US). Both of these investigations into child trafficking and abuse resulted in arrests, but were stopped before anyone of any status could be brought down.

       Would be consistent with Arkansas airstrip/s being some kind of distribution point for smuggled cocaine at the peak of the cocaine and crack 1980s. If they were bribing police and officials in south Florida the same cartels would have no problem bribing officials else where in the US.

       Didn't government informant Barry Seal and other pilots including the ones in the documentary Cocaine Cowboys mention Arkansas as drop off point?
