<p>-pizza references- sound more like drug speak than child stuff</p>

<p>-that have a perfect transport situation... Private planes no security</p>

<p>-&quot;medical&quot; offices like the one hrc visited after she passed out</p>

<p>-there are some many more!</p>

<p>I&#39;m posting this in various threads... The Clintons are possibly a drug ring!!! Think about all the pizza references... They pertain to drugs!!! We need to get on this... Child trafficking etc were just a diversion...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not ctr, and I&#39;m not trolling, we need to research this angle/theory</p>

<p>We need to figure out how this all connects</p>

<p>Please just consider this for a moment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think it is about drugs also. It actually makes even more sense when the words are replaced with drugs. When you replace the words with the child sex slave stuff it&#39;s still written very awkwardly and still doesn&#39;t make that much sense. Thinking about it critically, I don&#39;t think the Clinton camp would be stupid enough to talk about this stuff on these unsecured channels, but talking about drugs using these codewords seems extremely plausible for the Clinton camp as they could just say it was other things. Point being that drugs makes a lot more sense in every single email that has food in it with the context clearly laid out, with the child sex in the place of these emails the emails still seem extremely poorly written and still off-sounding. Just my pov right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I would love for it to come out that is actually the pedo ring, but I think people here just saw these emails with codewords and wished the same trying to push that narrative that people have suspected for a long time.

    <div class="md"><p>Look up the Mena connection. I grew up in Mena, AR, it has (I think) the largest noncommercial international airport in the united states. In a town of 5000 people. The airport is a major industry in town and they do repairs on planes of all sizes, all the way up to 737s. From what I&#39;ve been told, and I know several present and past employees, is that cocaine was stuffed into seats of large plans and brought into Mena, where during &quot;renovations&quot;, the government (with Bush Sr. as president and Bill Clinton as AR governor) would remove the cocaine, fill the seats up with guns and weapons, close them back up, and fly them back out. Huge cover ups and investigations and planes flying in and out all day every day. </p>
