<p>When in reality reptilian is in reference to the primal reptilian center of the brain that we all have that go back to our roots. It&#39;s the basic animalistic nature of the brain.</p>

<p>There is no actual reptilian race. It&#39;s just referencing the reptilian center of the brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is said the pineal gland is our link to alternate dimensions of consciousness/altered states of being/shamanic visions/etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also a fact that the pineal gland produces Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in our brains.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever taken DMT the drug (or ayhuasca in which DMT is the active ingredient) then you&#39;ve likely traversed these different dimensions/states of being.</p>

<p>It&#39;s said that fluoride in our water acts to calcify the pineal gland, rendering it weak/useless/not working at full capacity.</p>

<p>So there is a possibility that we are being fed fluoride to keep our pineal glands in check, therefore rendering us unable to open our minds/spirits/etc.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, that&#39;s not a fact. It&#39;s a fact that DMT is being produced somewhere by our body, because we&#39;ve observed the evidence and seen that it&#39;s in our bodies, but we have no idea whether it&#39;s the pineal gland or not. That&#39;s just some nonsense speculation (it might&#39;ve been part of Strassman&#39;s theories, I don&#39;t remember any more) and people decided to run with it because it parallels the occult beliefs of ancient mystery teachings, which is probably the reason it was originally suggested in the first place.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve smoked shitloads of DMT myself, for the record, I&#39;m not anti-DMT by any means, but facts are facts.</p>

<p>That&#39;s confusing. I just figured one was named for the other.</p>

<p>You&#39;re quite wrong about this. Have you actually read his work? When he first started talking about reptilians, there was no ambiguity there: <em>he was talking about an actual reptilian race</em>.</p>

<p>Just a few of many quotes from The Biggest Secret:</p>

<p>&quot;My own research suggests that it is from another dimension, the lower fourth dimension, that the reptilian control and manipulation is primarily orchestrated. Without understanding the multidimensional nature of life and the universe, it is impossible to follow the manipulation of the Earth by a non-human force. As open minded scientists are now confirming. Creation consists of an infinite number of frequencies or dimensions of life sharing the same space in the same way that radio and television frequencies do. At the moment you are tuned to the three-dimensional world or third dimension and so that is what you perceive as your reality.... It is from one of these other stations or dimensions, that the Serpent Race, the Anunnaki, is controlling this world by &#39;possessing&#39; certain bloodline streams... &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Other people know this as the lower astral dimension, the legendary home of demons and malevolent entities in their black magic rituals.... Then there are the experiences of Cathy O&#39;Brian, the mind controlled slave of the United States Government for more than 25 years, which she details in her astonishing book, Trance Formation Of America, written with Mark Phillips. She was sexually abused as a child and an adult by a stream of famous people named in her book. Among them were the US Presidents, Gerald Ford, Bill Clinton and most appallingly, George Bush, a major player in the brotherhood, as my books and others have long exposed. It was Bush a paedophile and serial killer, who regularly abused and raped Cathy&#39;s daughter, Kelly O&#39; Brian, as a toddler before her mother&#39;s courageous exposure of these staggering events forced the authorities to remove Kelly from the mind control program known as Project Monarch. Cathy writes in Trance Formation of America of how George Bush was sitting in front of her in his office in Washington DC when he opened up, a book at a page depicting &quot;lizard-like aliens from a far off, deep space place&quot;. Bush then claimed to be an &#39;alien&#39; himself and appeared, before her eyes, to transform &#39;like chameleon&#39; into a reptile.... I know other people who have seen George Bush shape-shift into a reptilian.&quot;</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>&quot;It is clear that Diana knew about the true nature of the royal family&#39;s genetic history and the reptilian control. Her nicknames for the Windsors were the &quot;lizards&quot; and the &quot;reptiles&quot; and she used to say in all seriousness:&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;re not human&quot;...</p>

<p>&quot;The brotherhood obsession with Scotland, she said, was because there are many entrances there into inner-Earth where the physical reptiles live... She said that during the sacrificial rituals the Queen wears a cloak of gold fabric inlaid with rubies and black onyx. The Queen and Charles have their own ritual goblets, inlaid with precious stones signifying their Illuminati-Brotherhood rank. The Mother Goddess says that that queen makes cruel remarks about lesser initiates, but is afraid of a man code-named &#39;Pindar&#39; (The Marquis de Libeaux) who is higher in the Satanic hierarchy.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>There is nothing ambiguous about his beliefs. He&#39;s talking about actual, physical, shape-shifting lizard people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the frustration I&#39;ve had for years.  I know the reality of the situation, but no one -- NO ONE -- is going to buy it.  So why bother blowing the whistle?  Because when you do, there are several strategies that come into play to silence you:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Culture</strong>: The carefully cultivated concept of &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is a powerful, effective weapon.  Our society has been conditioned to &quot;trust the narrative&quot; without question, and 99 out of 100 people who try to expose the evil in control are simply typecast as &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and ignored.  Also, human nature plays a role in that to realize the truth of reality is absolutely different from what you&#39;ve believed your whole life is a paradigm-shifting, worldview-shattering experience.  The strong cognitive bias is a psychological self-defense mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character Assassination</strong>: For the 1 out of 100 who are actually able to obtain evidence and some level of credibility, the first non-passive approach used is to destroy the possibility anyone would take them seriously.  Planting kiddie porn on their computer, digging up embarrassing dirt from their past, etc, etc.  Joe Blow comes out with video evidence of a child sacrifice, and suddenly he&#39;s arrested for rape, and &quot;analysis&quot; reveals the video was staged.  It happens, folks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unfortunate Circumstances</strong>: No description needed.  I&#39;ve seen this over and over again.  Someone getting too close to the truth suddenly dies from an accidental carbon monoxide leak.  A former occultist is killed in a drunk-driving incident.  The private investigator who had a heart-attack during the peak of his physical fitness... The movie director who survives a mysterious, skin-eating infection.  &lt;-- Not everyone dies -- some are just given a message.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Alex Jones might be a shill, but he&#39;s right about the demonic satanists in the government... and police forces, and colleges / universities, and local courts systems, and schools, and churches / mosques / synagogues, and the bakery down the street.  You name the profession / occupation, and there&#39;s someone in that position involved in this.</p>

<p>Cold, hard truth of this world.  No one wants to believe that, so most people won&#39;t.</p>

<p>to realize the truth of reality is absolutely different from what you&#39;ve believed your whole life is a paradigm-shifting, worldview-shattering experience. The strong cognitive bias is a psychological self-defense mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly the same thing that makes parents of abused children deny the abuse when they hear about it.  Especially when it happens within their church.  It destroys their world to believe it can happen so they chose to not believe.  I think we see this sort of thing happening now in society where they do not want to believe our political leaders are corrupt.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s exactly the point I&#39;m trying to make.  The &quot;satanic panic&quot; involved one or two <em>real</em> cases of SRA that the media picked up on.  The next thing you know, you have schools and daycares across the country reporting possible satanic-related abuse to kids, almost all of which were completely fabricated.</p>

<p>Who do you think flooded the news with stories of egregious abuse which were so easily proven wrong?  And aside from obscuring the real activity, what&#39;s the ultimate effect that denial &amp; deception tactics on the collective attitude towards such allegations by the general public in the future?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have any evidence of this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not -- these people will never be condemned by <em>habeas corpus</em>.  Hence the frustration: when you&#39;ve personally experienced / been affected by something such as this -- when you know it happens, and you know lots of other people also know, to feel so absolutely helpless to expose (much less stop) it is maddening.</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t have evidence.  And if I did, it would (a) be completely discredited, and/or (b) place me and my family in significant danger.</p>

<p>So he&#39;s not a journalist. He&#39;s an out-loud-reader.</p>

<p>Looking around these threads and these times, I see lots of redefined words, and lots of implications left to the imagination.</p>

<p>I wonder if everyone is communicating effectively, considering we are all projecting our own bias into all these opportunities that inconcise speech creates. </p>

<p>I&#39;m finding that to convey any thought accurately, I must explain my intent and implications as well, otherwise the spoken language alone can be misinterpreted, and the goal of communication lost. </p>

<p>I find that finishing my thoughts has a positive impact on my spoken clarity. For example, instead of saying &quot;Noun is wrong&quot;, also indicate why.</p>

If anything I am second-hand embarrassed for the bored, disconnected wealthy people who fall for this hack artist&#39;s shtick and think they&#39;re doing something edgy and meaningful.

It&#39;s like going to a haunted house attraction for phony intellectuals with a pathological addiction to exclusivity and superiority.</p>

<p>Let us not forget that satanists, wiccans, etc are actually really fucking lame.  It shouldn&#39;t be surprising to us that our leaders are so indulgent and detached from reality that they consider this a good time.  </p>

Thats a huge leap. Thats the kind of thinking that lead to Marilyn Manson getting banned from cities in the 90&#39;s. Like saying rock n roll leads to sex and satanism.

    <div class="md"><p>Rock and roll does lead to Satanism. Zeppelin, Sabbath, Stones, Beatles all referenced or heavily influenced by Satanism.

Sabbath, Kiss, Priest all used the SS. The roots of rock and metal go directly to Satanism especially Crowley inspired Satanism.

Overprotective housewives is rhetorical and pejorative and blatantly untrue to anyone with half a brain.

<p>Owned Crowleys house</p>

<p>Admitted to going into trances and summoning spirits</p>

<p>Song lyrics about Satan</p>

<p>Esoteric sun worship emblems</p>

<p>Esoteric dragon robes</p>

<p>I&#39;ve detailed the moment for me on another post but man, it was my first year following football, like REALLY following it, I was obsessing with the drafts, mostly focusing on what QB we were going to pick, I was hoping for Teddy early in the first, for whatever reason I just loved the dude, watched a bunch of his tape and followed him through the pro day and combines and was thinking &quot;damn it would be awesome if we snagged the guy I&#39;ve been hyping about all summer.&quot; Then we chose Barr, and I was pretty disappointed thinking we lost our only shot at Teddy, but I knew he would be a great pick too. So I&#39;m still watching the draft over the next hour or two when that 32nd pick came around, I was planning to turn off the tv and do something else, but then there it was, &quot;Seahawks trade their pick to the Vikings&quot;, I had never been so excited and proud about a stupid little hobby of mine in my life. Of course I knew it would be Teddy. </p>

<p>The only antidote to such frustration is the knowledge that the paradigm thrust upon us cannot replace natural law, the pendulum always swings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The McMartin preschool was children being coerced into saying the things they said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Later research demonstrated that the methods of questioning used on the children were extremely suggestive, leading to false accusations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just watched a video someone linked from an old case in 2015, where it led to a UK case, was on liveleak, anyway, people were saying shit like &quot;I know kids, I&#39;ve been a teacher for x years and they are telling the truth!&quot; (in various forums discussing the content)</p>

<p>No..They weren&#39;t.  They were told to say that, and the guy filming was the abuser, along with his wife, you can see it in the microexpressions.  Besides that, there was the way both children immediately responded in the exact same manner, that is due to being told what to say, over and over again.</p>

<p>There has not been a legitimate case like that.  There has been pedophiles, but once babies heads getting chopped off and animals being fucked, and all this other shit is involved, especially when on a massive scale, it is children being told what to say.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll see if I can find the video, you&#39;ll realize how obvious it is they have been trained if I can find it again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re partially right. I think not all of the McMartin kids were real victims, and were mishandled by the interviewers, but a lot of the kids were indeed real victims. Dozens of them showed clear signs of butt rape and vaginal rape, as confirmed by doctors. A lot of the kids even had STDs. All of this was buried. And cases like this went on all over the country. Last year it happened in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, skeptics of ritual abuse in the public print often have dubious bona fides themselves. Some even participate secretly in the pedophile and occult undergrounds, most notably a couple of Los Angeles writers who have written the only two book available on McMartin, taking mental health professionals, police, the press and prosecutors to task for pursuing false allegations of abuse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The body of the woman whose complaint began the McMartin preschool molestation case was found in her home on Friday, and the police today began investigating the circumstances of her death.</p>

<p>The woman, Judy Johnson, 42 years old, whose mental stability has been the focus of a pretrial hearing going on in Superior Court here, was found dead Friday afternoon in her home in the affluent, seaside community of Manhattan Beach.</p>

<p>The discovery of the body came as many of the participants in the McMartin case were in a courtroom 22 miles away in Los Angeles, listening to Raymond Buckey, the chief defendant, plead for release from jail. </p>

<p>Much of this came to the defense&#39;s attention after Glenn Stevens, a former prosecutor in the case, related it to two screen writers, <strong>Abby and Myra Mann</strong>, who turned the information over to the defense. </p>

<p>Mr. Stevens, who left the prosecutors&#39; office in January after expressing misgivings about the case, voiced doubts in taped interviews with the Manns, <strong>who are writing a book and a movie</strong> about the case with Mr. Stevens</p>

<p>I think the highlight of this was trying to charge the woman running the daycare with murder <em>when no children were in fact missing.</em>  The videos of the police telling kids that they would never see their parents again unless they admitted to being sexually abused are apparently deeply disturbing but I have never seen them.  </p>

<p>The fact that they bulldozed the entire school to find the supposed secret basement - which wasn&#39;t there - indicates how fucked up the American justice system is, not that Satanic ritual abuse is a thing!</p>

John O&#39;Neill is viewed as the man who tried to stop Bin Laden, but I&#39;m convinced he faked his death, and that he was one of the key plotters and designers of the Bin Laden narrative.

    <div class="md"><p>Abramovic is probably one of the most famous/influential artists of the last forty years. She&#39;s not really a pretentious hack or anything, even if you don&#39;t like the genre of performance art</p>

<p>This Spirit Cooking thing doesn&#39;t seem to have been a very well known piece until now and I still don&#39;t understand exactly what it is. It doesn&#39;t seem like the piece was ever performed publicly, <a href="http://www.editionjs.com/img/abramovic/">all there is a series of prints</a>. There&#39;s a sort of history in this style of art of writing out bizarre instructions like this that aren&#39;t actually meant to be followed, for example the book &quot;Grapefruit&quot; by Yoko Ono has a lot of little poems like &quot;step 1: climb a ladder to heaven, step 2: take a bite out of the sky&quot; and shit like that. That&#39;s what this seems like to me, but then again we do know that she was hosting events of some sort based around this, so there had to be a performance component as well.</p>

<p>Personally I REALLY doubt that Podesta &amp; co. were hanging out drinking blood and breast milk and what not at these dinners. At most maybe they sat around and watched Marina and maybe some other artists do stuff like that as a performance piece. But who knows</p>

<p>But they probably don&#39;t? They probably just see it as art (even though obviously Abramovic is inspired by the occult). I guess it&#39;s not impossible that these guys are doing dark rituals in order to influence the outcome of world affairs, like what just happened in South Korea, but until there&#39;s more evidence in that direction it&#39;s more rational to assume that they&#39;re just going to performance art events that are advertised as such.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much that this is &quot;mild performance art&quot; from that perspective - its the implecations of WHO is doing this/participating in it and WHY -- These are leaders who sell their entire self-image to the public as some hyper christian-vanilla-moral-angel.</p>

<p>The fact that performance artists do weird shit, is fine for performance artists.</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t literally be unable to connect the dots with all the bits of evidence and chock this up as performance art. Thats fucking naive.</p>

<p>They can attempt to disguise this as &quot;performance art&quot; but your completely clueless if you think thats all it is.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen them at a &quot;performance art charity event&quot; as a high-level politician? Ever even ONCE heard something like this mentioned publicly in &quot;support of the arts&quot;?</p>

<p>No - this is NOT performance art. This is people using code words and private planes, private parties, and known child traffickers in countries where they literally fly in right after a disaster to exploit it for all its resources - human or otherwise.</p>

Look into the Corona project, the first US spy satellite program, and how things like the place where spy photographs were analysed in a photo shop that was featured in pro-US literature. I keep reflecting on this and how stuff like this fucked up, repugnant shit like spirit cooking get written off as performance art or movies like Eyes Wide Shut are put in front of us as art/fiction when these people are literally showing the world what these sick fucks do. Maybe they get off on the danger of being caught.</p>

Directed electromagnetic energy control, RF implants, and other outlandish crap intentionally obfuscates the true mind control projects: Widespread addiction to entertainment media, using that media to conduct cultural desensitization and moral destabilization, and wrapping the agenda in a fictional narrative in plain sight, which serves to disassociate that agenda from reality in the general population.</p>

It&#39;s that practitioners can take is seriously (the artist in this case is quoted as saying that it is only art if performed as art, but in a private setting it would not be) and can involve victims. If you watch the video, you&#39;ll see that the blood/sperm/milk mix is poured onto the effigy of a child. </p>

<p>If you are aware of the pedophilia that the group in question is allegedly (but with strong clues pointing to it being real) involved in, you might ask yourself if the children they play with can sometimes be &quot;used&quot; when these rituals are performed privately. If they are involved, are they alive, do they remain alive?</p>

<p>The programming room was painted a good dissociative color white. In the middle of the room, cages were suspended with chimps. The examining table was metal, which was cold for the victim, but easy to wash for the attendants. The victim was placed in cages and could observe white dots light up in different dot patterns over the door on a panel of lights. The low level shocks to the victim were coordinated with the dot patterns. (Some of this relates to <strong>domino programming</strong>.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. And the Hillary logo with the pizza slice over it, with pepperoni oriented like dominoes. The point seems to be to remind slaves of their trauma.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s something in the same article that discusses sex slaves which is likely relevant to Abramovic&#39;s TED talk plans to build an &quot;institute&quot; where people count rice grains.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For this reason, Grande Dames, who are involved in programming, will spend time drawing and showing faces to the child and seeing if the child can recognize identical faces. Almost any other item will be used, candy canes with stripes (match the candycanes with the same no. of stripes), trees, or pencils. The child must learn to match identical items very early--even before they can speak. This is so they will be able to build mirror images into their mind. All the senses are trained for building the mirror images; for instance such as silks and cottons can be used for the sense of touch. The child will have to match textures. The Programmer, the Grande Dame, and Grande Mothers will teach the child to have good abilities in copying, reflecting, repeating, echoing, or re-echoing, and mirroring. They will be taught for hours how to re-echo something verbatim.</p>

<p>Some of these teaching methods are almost like games. For instance, 20 pins will be in a box and the small child is given a short time to decide how many pins are in the box. A certain level of intelligence and creativity is needed for time to be invested on programming.</p>

<p>Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art. The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not. </p>

<p>However - I take your point, but I also stand by mine. She may be &quot;pandering for money&quot; - but that doesnt preclude the other aspects of such things.</p>

<p>When you tie all this in with the other dots of flying around with known pedos, known exploitation of nations, known killing of children whimsically, pardoning a woman trying to steal a flight full of kids, documented flights to pedo island, code words and referneces in emails/phone transcripts to attendance of parties where &quot;sauces from the pizza party got in her hair&quot; etc...</p>

<p>It is deeper than just performance art. I know a lot more about this stuff than I want to, but I would not simply say &quot;oh yeah, well its just a performance art piece&quot; as I do not believe that for a second.</p>

<p>We fucking have sadistic torturers with their own private airline and black sites flying people all over the world daily. You think that we are some innnocent/performance art based nation? Yet we can do the horrific torture we do with even our lowest level grunts?</p>

<p>Are you not aware of what the CIA did throughout all of south america, the school of the americas? WE FUCKING TEACH SADISM as the US is one of the secretly best at it.</p>

<p>But the leaders who initiate this against the world are just some art faggots from manhattan who like to see &quot;performance art with blood and semen&quot; painted on the walls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She says it herself, there is art, which is performed outwardly, then there is their rituals - performed internally. To assume that they aren&#39;t practicing black occult rituals is not totally true.</p>

<p>Now, with that said - she could also be exploiting those who <em>think they want to be in the inner circle</em> -- There are those who are serious about this stuff - then there are those who think they know whats up. In previous, we called them &quot;those that think they think&quot; versus those that Think. (Meaning those that understand the power of thought, word, intent, emotion, submission to the ritual)</p>

<p>So yeah, level 1 looks like &quot;envelope pushing art&quot; -- then it goes up from there.</p>

<p>In this case, think of the podesta dinner as more od a way to extract funds from them to support the performer whilst the attendees <em>think</em> they are gaining access to the inner circles.</p>

<p>Unless they actually go deeper into these rituals, then they are just being used and made to feel a false sense off inclusion which opens them up to further exploitation by those like abramovic...</p>

<p>Think of the low level Masons and what not who think of it as a fraternal org helping fellow buisinessmen out vs - an actual circle of power connection like 322... Whereas 322 members ARE put in compromising situations to build up the brotherly connection and secure trust. But it goes deeper. One aspect though of the connections ties back to the infamous idea that &quot;wont you help this poor widows son&quot; as the call to help from one mason to another - having all the upper circles in the same org, like 322, from a base power-protection-level bonds them via the org via anything else. So you can have people who are publicly &quot;opposed&quot; but secretly in alliance (bush/clinton)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, Okay. This is...this is entirely taken out of context.</p>

<p>Marina Abramovic is an accomplished performance artist. Making people uncomfortable is what she aims to do. (For more information, check out a documentary on her entitled The Artist is Present). She embraces the strange and weird and uses that for her art.</p>

<p>Whether that actually counts as art or not, that&#39;s up for each individual person to decide. Not my personal cup of tea but in her head, it&#39;s art. </p>

<p>That being said, clearly what is going on here is that Podesta is a fan of her work and supports her art. </p>

<p>Does that make him a satanist? No.
Does that make him interested in this material outside of this context? No.
Does this make him fucked in the head? No. </p>

<p>Do you have every right to be uncomfortable with this material? Yes.</p>

<p>But this says nothing about the &quot;evilness&quot; of the government. This is just performance art that&#39;s for shock value. It&#39;s designed for a certain type of consumer. It&#39;s not indicative of any moral shortcomings for Podesta. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t Bohemian Grove. It&#39;s not ceremonial magic. It&#39;s not Freemasonic rituals. It resembles no version of satanic ritual I have ever seen. It&#39;s a artist trying to be edgy in public. You will get more actual occultism, satanism, magic, etc.. at your average metal show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I&#39;m only simply playing devils advocate, people are overthinking this before they know the facts. I can&#39;t say I am up to date with everything regarding the leaks, there is so much its hard to keep up, but regardless of any other case, this alone, isn&#39;t punishable or unlawful, its weird as fuck but if you heard that Ashton Kutcher was the one inviting this girl over to his house for &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; you wouldn&#39;t think hes actually jizzing in the buckets and cutting his finger, you would think its one of this crazy artist&#39;s performances being admired. Completely out of context with everything else, and given the only facts that we have, I don&#39;t think this is even <em>that</em> weird. I&#39;m not arguing any other context, these are slimy people we&#39;re talking about, but this specific case seems weird at most. </p>

<p>Hard to remove them once their in power? You sound scared of their sex magic. I have hope for the greater good of the general public that these leaks will lead to justice, I honestly am optimistic about this. Even though we may discover our countries leaders are sick criminal fucks, I believe they will be imprisoned and we will seek new leadership. This is an unforeseen circumstance for this country that can lead either way, but I, for once, am optimistic about the outcome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The upside down cross is St. Peter&#39;s cross. Even though it is seen as demonic in pop culture it is considered one of the more holy symbols in Catholicism. St Peter refused to be crucified upright like his Savior because he didn&#39;t think he was worthy of that honor. So they flipped him upside down. The cross is a symbol of great humility and piety. Most popes use this symbol as their symbol because they hope to follow in his path of humble service to god. </p>

<p>Similar to how Hollywood pushes chloroform as a drug to incapacitate people, when it&#39;s not capable of doing that sort of damage, they push Saint Peter&#39;s cross as a demonic symbol when it&#39;s actually the complete opposite. Probably just some superstitious guy started it off and then it caught on.</p>

<p>Now the upside down crucifix is a different story.</p>

<p>There are so many sources now, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html">wikileaks</a> is the most reputable, it&#39;s just a matter of time before spectacular arrests are made and the puzzle pieces get connected together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes you really have to remove yourself from the situation and look at things objectively, without trying your hardest to draw lines between everything.  If you already believe something, or want to believe something is true, it&#39;s real easy to start buying into something that is really nothing.</p>

<p>That link you just posted....... sure it could be some code for a weird pedolphile ring if that&#39;s what you want to believe....</p>

<p>OR... He&#39;s taking a jab at Obama for giving the impression he&#39;s a regular joe who eats hot dogs and pizza when in reality he spent $65,000 of taxpayer money catering a lavish party.</p>

<p>This email isn’t even part of the Podesta leaks, and it also wasn&#39;t sent to or from anyone in Obama&#39;s inner circle, so I&#39;m not sure what it proves in either case.</p>

<p>Yes there are powerful forces who oppose her. Nationalism vs globalism is certainly a conflict that comes to mind.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that the child sex rings that have been uncovered are phony. It is possible for these to interweave.</p>

<p>But I also recognize that one is much more palatable than the other, so I can see why you wouldn&#39;t want to believe it&#39;s possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: What place do you see the occult having within contemporary art; can magick be made (not simply appropriated/ performed)?</p>

<p>A: Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. <strong>If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art.</strong> The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Abramovic is probably one of the most famous/influential artists of the last forty years. She&#39;s not really a pretentious hack or anything, even if you don&#39;t like the genre of performance art</p>

<p>This Spirit Cooking thing doesn&#39;t seem to have been a very well known piece until now and I still don&#39;t understand exactly what it is. It doesn&#39;t seem like the piece was ever performed publicly, <a href="http://www.editionjs.com/img/abramovic/">all there is a series of prints</a>. There&#39;s a sort of history in this style of art of writing out bizarre instructions like this that aren&#39;t actually meant to be followed, for example the book &quot;Grapefruit&quot; by Yoko Ono has a lot of little poems like &quot;step 1: climb a ladder to heaven, step 2: take a bite out of the sky&quot; and shit like that. That&#39;s what this seems like to me, but then again we do know that she was hosting events of some sort based around this, so there had to be a performance component as well.</p>

<p>Personally I REALLY doubt that Podesta &amp; co. were hanging out drinking blood and breast milk and what not at these dinners. At most maybe they sat around and watched Marina and maybe some other artists do stuff like that as a performance piece. But who knows</p>
