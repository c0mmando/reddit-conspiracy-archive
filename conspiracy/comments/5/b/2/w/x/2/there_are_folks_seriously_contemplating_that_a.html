<p>and second thing, you basically are voting 3rd party every year hoping that they get 5% of the popular and then they will get extra federal funding? So every year people cast a vote 3rd party in the hopes that next year the rd party will have more $ to possibly go further? seems like the biggest crock of shit to me...3rd party vote 2014 &quot;Ah dam no extra funding! Oh well there&#39;s always next year!&quot; 3rd party vote 2015 &quot;&quot;Ah dam no extra funding! Oh well there&#39;s always next year!&quot; and so on and so on.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Satanism&quot;.... and pedophilia?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few thoughts.</p>

<p>One, we live in a society where the majority hates pedos/molesters. Maybe the whole Satanism thing is just a way for these people to satisfy their lusts, but without seeing themselves for what they really are. ie. I&#39;m just doing this because it&#39;s &quot;part of the ritual&quot;.</p>

<p>They&#39;re OK seeing themselves as satanists, but not as child molesters.</p>

<p>Another thought, it looks like there&#39;s more and more proof that a lot of people at the top are rotten to the core. You are almost forced to conclude that you have to be a certain type of person to make it to the top.</p>

<p>One more thought. If the people in power are satanists, or something similar... it makes you wonder about some of the shit you see going on in the world. It&#39;s easy enough to suspect false flags take place to serve as a deception or a distraction. Would it be so hard to think that certain &quot;disasters&quot; are actually <em>sacrifices</em> that have been staged to look like something else?</p>

<p>What about all the people that go missing? Did they all just wander off and disappear somewhere... or is it possible that many of them were taken by the same strange fucks that are running things?</p>

<p>I imagine that the people who hold true power in this world probably look at the rest of society the same way a kid with a magnifying glass looks at a bunch of ants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the problem: if you worship the biblical Satan, then you are confirming your belief in the rest of the Bible.  You&#39;re also admitting that the Bible is true and you&#39;re fighting for the losing side.  </p>

<p>Nobody does this.</p>

<p>What people know as satanism is a psudoreligion based upon the teachings on Anton levey.  Not the teachings of Satan.  The term satanism was adopted just to freak people out essentially.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s either that or people are mistaking bullshit pagan rituals and symbolism for Satan worship.  This is more common than anything.  People see a pentagram and associate it with the pop culture idea of satanism and then make erroneous claims of Satan worship.</p>

<p>Also it doesn&#39;t help that it&#39;s common in the practice of satanists to tell people that they think are beneath them that they worship Satan himself.  This also muddies the waters on this issue.</p>

<p><strong>This</strong> is an accurate description of Satanism.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re conflating your own religious beliefs with the actual definition of what Satanism is. By your stupid logic every religion that isn&#39;t Biblical is &quot;Satanism&quot; by stealing people from the Bible.</p>

<p>Again, you either lack a basic fundamental understanding of what Satanism is, or you&#39;re just making up your own definition which just so happens to be completely wrong.</p>

<p>In a sense, this is completely correct. </p>

<p>Also, I think it&#39;s high time everyone stop talking past each other and finally acknowledge that there are autonomy-worshipping atheists who have hijacked the term &quot;satanism&quot; and there are genuine, occult practitioners worshipping a being most would recognize as the devil of Scripture or something very near/in line with him, although these worshippers may recognize him as such or may not by recharacterizing his &quot;true&quot; role/history/identity. </p>

<p>One of these two groups has a legitimate claim to the term Satanism. The other, as some have already stated, donned the label merely for shock value and in actuality denies the supernatural altogether. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s stop pretending that there&#39;s one monolithic group of people in total theological agreement who fall under the term satanist. </p>

<p>Because there are satan worshippers without a doubt.  Google a little.</p>

<p>If youre just clarifying thier beliefs then you&#39;re still wrong...  all Satanists are following his beliefs/doctrines aka worshipping him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand all that you wrote.  However, the greatest trick satan has pulled off is making people believe hes not real.  This applies in so many ways.  The philisophy from many satan worshipping religions is &quot;do whatever you want in life&quot;.  They dont want you to believe in the bible or satan himself its not necessary if youre still following his lead.</p>
