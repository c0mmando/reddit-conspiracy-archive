       Hey r/Conspiracy.
       <br/>
       I've read many posts on here by people who deny global warming. Please help me understand the reasoning behind this. Personally, I think it's a serious problem, but my mind is open to those who have important information to share. What is the point of making up global warming? What information is so damning to you that dismantles all the evidence pointing towards climate change? What ulterior motives do corrupt politicians/shadow organizations have to promote global warming and how could it negatively affect us?

       They are all contrails.  Your ignorance is letting airliners off the hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'chemtrail' conspiracy was likely concocted by airliners to take advantage of people without a basic understanding of meteorological sciences (like yourself) so that they could continue to save money by flying routes that were more fuel-efficient yet generated more contrails.  Thanks to people like you, who are so easily distracted by pseudo-scientific nonsense, they can continue to do so, as so many people are fooled by the idea of 'chemtrails' rather than protesting the actual issue at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Educate yourself rather than pointing to the sky and claiming that contrails are anything other than condensation trails, you are doing the world a disservice while simultaneously broadcasting your ignorance.

       If you believe in 'chemtrails' it demonstrates a lack of ability to determine the validity of information, to do adequate research, or to understand the very basics of meteorology.  So yes, it reflects on your level of education.

       Just because you've been fooled by profit-seeking charlatans who photoshop images to prey on the ignorant doesn't mean that everybody is.

      <p>
       You don't understand the basics of meteorological science, which is why you believe this nonsense.  If you find the time to educate yourself regarding the concept you might actually find a way to dedicate your obviously misguided passion towards where it should actually be directed.

       I guess I have a problem with it when I see how every now &amp; then the MSM get hysterical about it at opportune times, like just before the UN brought on Agenda 2016 (the new Agenda 21) then it seems to fall from interest again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I saw the same hype when I was a teenager, then no one seemed to care about it for 10 years!! Then the establishment got all excited about it again (&amp; so the MSM too) around when someone came up with idea of carbon taxes &amp; credits, etc. To my jaded mind it just seems to be an effective tool for people to feather their pockets and push NWO type ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for looking after the environment but I call bs on man-made global warming. The evidence of the Earth going through various warming &amp; cooling cycles, the fact that the sun has been having a very active period of late, the fact that the issue seems to be used as either a propaganda, money making , divide the people, distraction, or a push an NWO ideology tool by TPTB, makes me cynical. Never mind the fact that the experts can't even predict tomorrow's weather accurately...
      </p>
      <p>
       And the tactics used against deniers...if you deny it all sorts of insults are thrown at you even if you are for the environment, want clean energies &amp; to reduce pollution. If you aren't allowed to question something civilly, you should get suspicious.

       Exactly, when the idea behind "Global Warming" seems to be an exploit to tax people because of the "fear" then there is something shady going on. Cause taxing people doens't exactly do anything to "fix" the issue. What does it do? Give maybe 4% to help the cause and the rest of the 96% goes to the politicians that enacted these taxes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cause that is a likely scenario for nonsense tax like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       While yes, pollution is a serious issue, the grander scale of us affecting the earth as a whole with our CO2 emissions can be questioned because there are so many other variables on earth that are of the natural occurrence that have the potential to add more CO2 then we could ever add to the atmosphere.

       I appreciate the response and your insight. Ideologically, I'm in the same boat with you. I don't know what to believe, and I heavily scrutinize all mainstream agendas. It's what I'm doing to global warming right now, trying to understand how promoting this information could affect most of the earth negatively and benefit the people doing the promoting. Right now, the evidence points man-made climate change being a real thing and it being a serious problem, but many things are unsettling about the way politicians and scientists draw attention to it and one of those things is denouncing skeptics so harshly as you mentioned.

       Just because there is nearly universal scientific consensus that humans are significantly contributing to climate change doesn't mean that the elite won't find a way to exploit this fact for their own benefit and profit.

      <p>
       People seem to think that people needed to manufacture the idea of human-made climate change in order to profit from it, when they could just as easily profit from it if it were true.

       If you want to degrade this into a discussion regarding the philosophy of science then I'd suggest a different forum.  If you want to discuss the actual science behind the concept of human created climate change and the scientific validity of that theory then that is what this topic is about.

       If you're incapable of doing your own research, don't expect people to spoonfeed you knowledge.  This was never supposed to be a discussion regarding the philosophy of science as the other person tried to divert it towards.  Do you have anything to add to the discussion, or are you here just to complain that people aren't making things easy enough for you to understand?

       You can't actually rationalize humankind as being incapable of hindering earth's circumstances? We have weapons that can destroy every living being on the planet right now? We could completely decimate all living things on earth, even ones that have been thriving for the past 500 million years? We have been responsible for the extinction of several species, with another one about to go extinct from poaching right now. We have leveled millions of miles of wildlife environments for human civilization.

       So many "conspiracies" don't actually deny climate change...they just state that man-made cc will pale in comparison to natural fluctuations built into our planet. I am in a scientific field heavily reliant on critical analysis of science (medical school) and personally I think some of the claims hold water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without first viewing this documentary (with some of the most respected academics in the area), anything I try to explain will just seem crazy. You may think the subject of the pyramids is unrelated...but humor me and give this a shot, might blow your mind.

       Why do you actually think it matters if there is relevant global warming or not, personally?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is and it's caused by human activity there is no solution you will be able to find acceptable nor practicable. It will run its course anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       If space weather is responsible you can't do anything about it either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony is that just 40 years ago the "Club of Rome" pushed fear for another ice age. In the last 15 years it was global warming, the exact opposite. Do you seriously think the earth changes between two opposite states in that timeframe?
      </p>
      <p>
       That should signal you that a certain group uses the idea as a hook to reach all people on an emotional level for a global agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about global government and building a financial structure for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean there aren't valid concerns for a global government to manage resources more efficient but this isn't a world anybody sane would enjoy living in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a neo feudal world where eugenics controls every aspect(life and death) for the lower class. Watch Soylent Green and you get the program.

       Man made climate change will cause warming sea level rise, more viruses, more extreme geological events, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a natural "wobble" to our magnetic poles. This oscillation waxes and wanes within a range of the "true top" of our globe. Occasionally (possibly soon) that oscillation will get so large that the poles in fact reverse. This pole reversal is arguably responsible for 4 or 5 of the great extinctions. During this pole shift we lose our protection from solar radiation for possibily days, in addition to massive geological and oceanic events.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just one theory, but it has 100% happened before.
      </p>
      <p>
       That does nothing to deny man made climate change, but it may be irrelevant in the end. 
Furthermore, it is a strong possibility that certain groups of people who "run society" know this is going to happen....which would completely explain the lack of concern for the state of the planet or its people...no need to adopt green energy or solve world hunger if the next great extinction is imminent (via pole reversal)....what would you do? Stockpile resources for a select group of people (ultra rich) and build your military as strong as possible, restrict personal freedoms and wait for the flood....kind of sounds like what America is doing, no? Kind of sounds like the biblical/Aristotle account of the cataclysm, no?

        the most drastic climate change has occurred within the last 50 years

       . Is there a source supporting what you are saying? That video is titled "2014 was the warmest year on record", now it's 2015, probably going to be 2016 this year. If it's caused by the ice age why is it so abrupt recently?

       Look at it this way, get a ice cube. When it starts to melt, it melts slowly. When it gets smaller it's starts to melt faster. The earth has always been warming up.

       I think you would have to be pretty thick to think deny that ecological collapse on a massive scale is happening right now, however the powers that be give us "solutions" like carbon based tax schemes and state controlled thermostats.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they came out and said "global warming is a serious problem- what we need to do is stop all of the wars, get off of fossil fuels, replace our food production with decentralized permaculture farming, and stop having a consumption based economy" people might get behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that all of the "solutions" for global warming seem to benefit the people who are most responsible for destroying the environment?

       "What information is so damning to you that dismantles all the evidence pointing towards climate change?"
I would invert this. Why should I believe in global warming. I usually give this analogy:
      </p>
      <p>
       A world famous physicist ask you to fly in a plane with him that he made.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask him "Well have you ever flown a plane before"
      </p>
      <p>
       He says "No"
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask "Has this plane ever been flown by anyone before"
      </p>
      <p>
       He says "No"
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask to take a look at the plane. And its a mess..their is exposed wiring, ducktape all over the place...you look at it and it just doesn't look right.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then ask "Well how do you know this will work"
      </p>
      <p>
       He says "Well I got the best scientists in the world. Thousands of them to review the theory of my plane, to conduct extensive simulations and worldwide there is not only agreement that the plane will fly but indeed that given my flight simulator training I should be able to fly the plane. In fact there is worldwide agreement among thousands of engineers, scientists that everything should work. There are literally thousands of peer-reviewed papers confirming it"
      </p>
      <p>
       My question to you is: are you going to get in that plane and furthermore do you think it will successfully fly the first time
      </p>
      <p>
       My answer to the question is simple: HELL FUCKING NO I AM NOT FUCKING GETTING IN THAT PLANE.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would it take for me to get in the plane. Simple, the physicist should have flown the plane over and over again a hundred times 
successfully himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will believe climate scientists about their 100 year predictions when they have successfully made at least 100 of them. So far they haven't made even one. To me that is equivalent to getting in a plane that has never been flown before and I think that is insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice that I don't need to know shit about climate science to make this judgement. As far as I am concerned climate science is a black box. All I need to know is one thing:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How many times have you successfully done this thing that you are claiming you are able to do
       </strong>

       Who would benefit more from global warming being fake? The mega rich oil corporations all over the world in various continents across the globe whose stakes are fully invested into oil continuing its dominance until we run out of it. Why? Profits. I understand skepticism is the nature of this sub, but the amount of scientists that have shown evidence that as far as we can tell, this is a serious issue. Our CO2 emission numbers are not fabricated, these are real issues. Global warming is not a joke

       OP needs to explore engineered weather that has been going on for generations. Granted, I cannot say what they
