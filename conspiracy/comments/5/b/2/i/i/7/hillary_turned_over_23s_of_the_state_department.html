       "A single defense contractor -- one that has faced allegations of poor performance -- raked in more than two-thirds of the $4 billion the State Department has spent rebuilding Afghanistan in recent years, a government watchdog says.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the late 1990s, two employees, Ben Johnston, a former DynCorp aircraft mechanic, and Kathryn Bolkovac, a U.N. International Police Force monitor, independently alleged that DynCorp employees in Bosnia engaged in sex with minors, and sold them to each other as slaves.[93][94] Both Johnston and Bolkovac were fired, and Johnston was later placed into protective custody before leaving several days later.[95]
      </p>
      <p>
       On June 2, 2000, an investigation was launched in the DynCorp hangar at Comanche Base Camp, one of two U.S. bases in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all DynCorp personnel were detained for questioning.[95] CID spent several weeks investigating and the results appear to support Johnston's allegations.[95] DynCorp had fired five employees for similar illegal activities prior to the charges.[96] Many of the employees accused of sex trafficking were forced to resign under suspicion of illegal activity. However, as of 2014 no one had been prosecuted.[97]
      </p>
      <p>
       The State Department cannot account for more than $1 billion it paid out to contractor DynCorp to train police during the first years of the Iraq war, in just one example of management shortcomings that have put at risk $2.5 billion worth of money spent on training policemen around the world, according to a damning new report."

       She gave billions to her pedo friends!

       Not really but they did have a ton of government IT and facilities contracts which all split off from the DynCorp International Merc stuff after a buyout from CSC.
