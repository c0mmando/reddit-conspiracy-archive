    <div class="md"><p>You Ladies and Sirs have just been served the classic <strong><em>BIG LIE</em></strong>!</p>

<p>Think about it every few days we hear about the release of 25 thousand emails here, 35 thousand emails there. Waiting breathlessly for something to atrocious that they&#39;ll have to indite Hill &#39;n Bill and release us from the Satan&#39;s Legions. </p>

<p>Some punk neofascist inside the FBI, a student of Hitler, raises his pointy head and says, &quot;I know! Lets release SIX-HUNDRED AND-FIFTY-THOUSAND! That&#39;ll shut them up! Especially when we find <em>nothing</em>!&quot;</p>

<p>A big lie (German: große Lüge) is a propaganda technique. The expression was coined by Adolf Hitler, when he dictated his 1925 book Mein Kampf, about the use of a lie so &quot;colossal&quot; that no one would believe that someone &quot;could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s so much actual dirt in the already released emails that we don&#39;t even need to go into the spirit cooking stuff. </p>

<p>From pay to play references, cross checking appointments with industry insiders and contracts given to their companies from State Department, using &quot;charity&quot; money for themselves, there&#39;s enough things to indict the Clintons already; we just need to keep bringing attention to the already known facts. </p>

<p>It&#39;s too much of a silver bullet to believe in without something more than circumstancial evidence based on the word pizza alone.</p>

<p>Not saying we shouldn&#39;t follow the lead, just don&#39;t wait for it to solve our problems in two days. Keep focus on actual crimes they (unwillingly) admit to on twitter would be my bet.</p>

The general public seem fine accepting the corruption/ignoring it as they get told there is worse out there every day, whether that be Trump or ISIS. The people with their eyes wide open have not accepted this and putting these theories (even if they are true) out there just sets the bar higher for us, that we will ignore what is out there until the worst theory is realized, which may never happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real Jesus was a warrior, and the Christianity you speak of is a watered down, socially engineered version of Christianity that makes Jesus out to be a wimp rather than the badass he was. Jesus was the conspiracy theorist of his day, battling against the Jewish money lenders and the religious heads of his day. That is, if you believe the Bible, which, even if you don&#39;t believe it historically, you should actually look into what happened just to know Jesus wasn&#39;t a pussy, and was a actually a noble warrior against the corruption of his day. If not historically, you should at least know the real story.</p>

They had this election fixed already.<br/>
Fbi faked the investigation to distract people from wikileaks, let media go nuts about dikileaks so people think media is not biased in covering &#39;leaks&#39;, they have dead people voting, they will change bernie writeins to hillary vote, all while hillary met with election directors throughout the country.

<p>This is a meaningless statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Point out w facts how either isnt apt. Otherwise its just a way to bail out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve already explained how your suggested use of warrants is factually inaccurate.</p>

<p>Merriam-Webster defines a metaphor as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1
:  a figure of speech in which a word or phrase literally denoting one kind of object or idea is used in place of another to suggest a likeness or analogy between them (as in drowning in money); broadly :  figurative language — compare </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You were not using figurative language. You were using literal terms. You can&#39;t metaphorically order a warrant against &quot;the establishment&quot;, and you weren&#39;t using it in place of something else. If you were, you did a horrible job forming your metaphor because I have to idea what that something else could be. Explain this to me, because as it stands, it makes no sense whatsoever as a metaphor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary is a member of the establishment, in fact she&#39;s head member of the establishment right now. </p>

<p>Issuing a warrant against the head of the establishment is tantamount to issuing a warrant on the establishment .</p>

<p>Any warrant issued would be narrowly tailored.</p>

<p>Let me reference pop culture to make this point:</p>

<p>&quot;Judge Randolph: The government&#39;s objection is sustained, Lieutenant Kaffee, and I would remind you that you are questioning a Marine officer with an impeccable service record.&quot;</p>

<p>Who us being searched is considered. It shouldn&#39;t be but it is. </p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re still missing the point. Even if it would be true that a search warrant differs depending on the person (it doesn&#39;t), you still can&#39;t issue a search warrant for all emails Hillary has on her server, since she&#39;s not part of all the emails.</p>

<p>If you want to search emails between X and Y, you need to get a search warrant for X or Y. You can&#39;t get one for Z. Same thing as you can&#39;t open letters addressed to X, just because they happened to end up at Y&#39;s house and you have a search warrant for Y&#39;s house.</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry I couldnt find a link. I only have the hard copy.</p>

<p>Youre incorrect about scope as well.</p>

<p>But youre kinda correct. </p>

<p>The scope of this warrant if narrowly addressed to illegal mail on server could result in narrow warrant.</p>

<p>If the scope is framed as illegally held info on any device and evidence of corruption all emails could be searched.</p>

<p>This is how cops get off the hook. Prosecutor pulls punches and makes it appear like its the judge or the law.</p>

<p>The problem with this methodology is that there is no validation done by the email server to ensure the content is the same each time the &quot;chain&quot; is replied to. </p>

<p>That&#39;s going to take some serious man power doing a lot of by hand editing over classified documents to make sure the computers redact the correct information. THAT, is not what happened with the second wave of these emails. We didn&#39;t get a press release like that this time.</p>

<p>The common misconception with this investigation was the FBI was looking classified stuff in HRC&#39;s email. That wasn&#39;t really at all what the deal was. People all over the State Dept were using private email to print and move things. It happened all over the place. What the FBI was trying to figure out was: did HRC do this maliciously to hide things. They concluded basically that she doesn&#39;t know how computers work and that her State Dept staff was full of morons. That&#39;s not intent.</p>

<p>My guess is its a lot easier to a few thousand emails and run some searches on them than to getting to the bottom of why she was doing govt. business out of her own computers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of this talk of facts and none of you are bringing any. But implying I&#39;m a redneck because I hate liberals and soccer moms is an interesting tactic.</p>

<p>The only anti-negros I see are Obama and Clinton.</p>

<p>Obama has tripled the national debt.</p>

<p>Corporate profits are up 144 percent.</p>

<p>Food stamps are up 44%</p>

<p>Black abortions continue to rise along the continued deterioration of the black nuclear family: <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/2016/05/11/black-lives-matter-28-of-abortions-done-on-black-babies-but-blacks-just-12-of-population/">http://www.lifenews.com/2016/05/11/black-lives-matter-28-of-abortions-done-on-black-babies-but-blacks-just-12-of-population/</a></p>

<p>Home ownership has fallen ~4%.</p>

<p>Minority income down almost 20%</p>

<p>Black unemployment is universally down 10%</p>

<p>Hillary calls them super predators. And allegedly calls her staffers racial lines.</p>

<p>So while you think liberals are somehow intellectually superior to the rednecks you mock, and think the democratic party elevates you, you&#39;re not and it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>What you guys are is useful idiots, toeing the party line like good little needies, begging for handouts and government restitution and intervention. You&#39;ve indiscriminately destroyed the middle quality of life for everyone, but in particular the minorities and specifically blacks you claim to champion.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve advanced social, racial, and economic division to us at a never-before-seen rate and volume. You&#39;ve elected leaders who&#39;ve instituted programs that have devastated the national economy. You&#39;ve brought riots, you&#39;ve taxed our speech and expression, you&#39;re rendered our schools complete indoctrination centers and have installed hierarchical victim politics.</p>

<p>It is the liberal/democratic party that is the party of the KKK, and even had a grand dragon mentor the beloved Hillary.</p>

<p>Liberals are the filth of society. Try to equate the right with dumbed down, gun-toting rednecks all you want. But it doesn&#39;t change the horrors you&#39;ve inflicted upon them and everyone else. I don&#39;t want to hear anymore about how Obama is a benefit to the small person. And certainly not Hillary. They are the ultimate corporate fascists and don&#39;t give a damn about &quot;negros&quot; or anyone else.</p>

<p>And yes. I&#39;m keeping my guns, because one day I may have to clean up this mess you&#39;ve dumped on us, or defend myself from your system. And trump has never said anything remotely &quot;anti-negro.&quot; It&#39;s you tolerant anti-racists who keep interjecting race into everything. But the truth is evident, isn&#39;t it? BLM, race-specific issues, all of that. If you want to know who the real racists are, just look at the actions and motives of your own.</p>

<p>No. You&#39;re not &quot;right, bro.&quot; Not about anything you&#39;ve typed. You couldn&#39;t be more wrong and deluded.</p>

The entire hard drive and access to all of its contents is logical and prudent as scope within the warrant. My example is appropriate. They confiscated his laptop in an original investigation, and its shared evidence across multiple cases. Why would they only look at a subset of information when considering a crime and its evidence? How can they conclude nothing else is pertinent without properly searching, inspecting, and indexing it?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why would they only look at a subset of information when considering a crime and its evidence?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because that is likely what the warrant requires. You can&#39;t simply get a warrant for all information on a computer, you get a warrant for evidence pursuant to a crime. If you&#39;re investigating a financial crime, the warrant may include things like invoices, receipts, and ledgers, but would not include personal photos. </p>

<p>The department of justice specifically says this in their warrant guidelines: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-ccips/legacy/2015/01/14/ssmanual2009.pdf">https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-ccips/legacy/2015/01/14/ssmanual2009.pdf</a>. See page 70, specifically. </p>

<p>For the FBI, I suspect their investigation has very distinct parameters. They are investigating whether HRC illegally sent or received classified information while secretary of state. Therefore, all they need to do is cross match the 650,000 with the 30,000 they already have, and look at the specific subset which were sent or received by Clinton, while SOS. This takes seconds to do if things are properly set up, and likely resulted in no or a very small number of emails. </p>

<p>Saying they can only look for classified information imprioperly sent or received is like saying you can&#39;t bust someone for running a coke cutting operation in their basement when they call you there for a burglary attempt.

    <div class="md"><p>The point I feel like needs to be made is the entire laptop should be considered within scope of the warrant - even if its not.</p>

<p>Is it natural to confiscate entire laptops and only get scope of a warrant for very small portions of said laptops, and not the entire thing in its accessible form? If your answer to this is &quot;yes,&quot; what reason do I have to simply believe you? As someone fairly trained at digging and problem solving, it would be naive to consider anything off limits before you even looked at it - especially when you are talking about personal electronic devices.</p>

<p>This would also be the same line of thinking that would lead to the government to say &quot;hey we should be able to track everything everyone does on the internet and in their houses because it &#39;could&#39; be relevant to some investigation&quot; </p>

<p>I like how r/conspiracy freaks out over snowden NSA shit but when it has to do with Clinton all privacy concerns go out the window</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true, what is up with embracing Trump? The guy talks about violating the constitution practically every time he opens his mouth. </p>

<p>If there&#39;s anything these emails revealed to me, it&#39;s that the Clinton political machine is a cut-throat, effective, calculating team seeking the presidency. Which is pretty standard for any group of people seeking public office on the national level.</p>

<p>But Hillary deleting emails shouldn&#39;t have been an issue in the first place. Another standard practice for public office:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/02/mitt-romney/romney-says-he-followed-law-and-precedent-taking-h/">http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/02/mitt-romney/romney-says-he-followed-law-and-precedent-taking-h/</a></p>

<p>This stuff is par for the course. Can&#39;t understand why people are convinced that Trump is not power hungry, self interested, and pocket lining. The Trump Foundation is way more of a fraudulent scheme than the Clinton Foundation. His &quot;charitable&quot; organization paid a $25K to the attorney general of Florida right before her &quot;investigation&quot; didn&#39;t find any wrongdoing with Trump University.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/us/politics/pam-bondi-donald-trump-foundation.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/us/politics/pam-bondi-donald-trump-foundation.html</a></p>

<p>Politics is an inherently dirty business, but enough with the double standard here. You have to view all the candidates with the same amount of scrutiny. </p>

<p>TL;DR:</p>

<p>Politics is dirty, quit it with the double standard for Clinton as more corrupt than Trump. You have to view everyone with the same skepticism, through the same lense.</p>

<p>I still find none of this surprising. Assuming that most of the emails were duplicates (which we don&#39;t actually have to assume, considering that the FBI told us this straight up), they could push through all of those likely in a day or less assuming they bothered to database search. The remaining fraction of non-duplicates were likely mostly personal, with some tiny sliver of business-related ones that slipped through the cracks when Hillary&#39;s lawyers printed them out the first time.</p>

<p>FFS people. The entire point of the FBI investigation was to see if Hillary Clinton used her email server to send restricted information while she was Secretary of State. Now that not good enough for you? Maybe we should dig up the notes she passed in class when she was 13? We still haven&#39;t seen her note pads she used when she was in college.

    <div class="md"><p>In that regard, I will argue that Comey clearly exhibited a judgement resulting from a conflict of interest. He SHOULD have recommended to prosecute her since <strong>gross negligence</strong> is a crime, too. Based on the fact that she lied many times under interrogation and under oath, it would have been an obvious case for gross negligence and a subsequent cover-up. But instead, he made up a fake category to describe Clinton&#39;s actions, absolving her of a &quot;gross negligence&quot; case.</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks Hillary is without sin is laughably naive. Her voters are useful idiots who defend her indiscretions even though she thinks of you people as completely expendable as she wines and dines with bankers and oil magnates on private jets while you retards protest the 1%. She&#39;s built her career on using public office to further her personal finances and objectives. Her supporters are walking, talking embodiments of cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>This is expected, though. Only sociopaths ascend to power the way Hillary has: by being a pathological liar and pandering to delusional collectivist utopians.</p>

<p>Under Hillary, though, I think you should enjoy the continuation of endless wars, rising national debt and erosion of border laws and national culture. This is what we&#39;re going to get.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, yes it means there are no crimes where there is sufficient evidence to indict much less convict. Also, I&#39;m not a Hillary supporter rather one of the many displaced Bernie voters who will be reluctantly casting a ballot for Hillary because of the complete shit show that is Trump.</p>

<p>&#39;endless wars&#39; comes with both candidates, I&#39;d rather raise the debt by ~$1.5 trillion instead of $13+ trillion  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>erosion of border laws and national culture.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahh, and now the true colors are shown - the xenophobia rears its ugly head once again. We have no &#39;national culture&#39;, we are the mother fucking melting pot, we take what we like from every culture we interact with and embracing those various cultures is what makes America so fucking awesome so telling me that we will continue to be multicultural isn&#39;t a deterrent to me voting Hillary, if anything it makes me even less reluctant to do so</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump has repeatedly stated that he wishes to return to a more isolationist foreign policy, that&#39;s the opposite of a warlike stance. Hillary Clinton has repeatedly stated that she wanted to invade Iran and she wants to set up a no fly zone (which means a hot war against Russian forces in Syria). As a Finn you should know well the care that must be taken in provoking Russia, with a Clinton Presidency WWIII seems pretty fucking certain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, listen, I get that visa&#39;d workers are a problem and is one we especially see in my industry (software development) and Trump&#39;s want to restrict H-1bs might be the sole issue I agree with him on but  he has been wishy washy on details.  At the same time, opening up competition isn&#39;t a bad thing and in my experience foreign workers, while cheaper, generally deliver a sub-par product.  Not to mention, the areas where these visas are typically used are exploding and having a hard time finding workers as is - so, sorry, I don&#39;t fear that my job will be in jeopardy under a Clinton presidency especially when there are people on both sides of the aisle sounding the alarm against H-1B workers - we certainly won&#39;t see them expanded and are likely to see the program reformed all together</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Washing Post is highly critical of Trump, you&#39;ll have a terrible day trying to find a single positive article on Trump. Reason being Besos owns it. What interest would the owner of Amazon have in regards to the election? Think about it.  Have you ever had computer related or order related issues dealing with Amazon? If you have your most likely transferred to INDIA. My argument isn&#39;t as specific as H1-B Visas, at least those individuals are in the country and contributing to the economy. My issue is with manufacturing going to other countries, service industries going to other countries, ( and by going I mean outsourcing,). Do you honestly believe that by outsourcing workers in America are benefitting somehow? I&#39;m trying to figure out your logic, but its difficult. If you believe in open trade with other countries that do not have the same standard of living and wages as the U.S. is smart. Than you may as well start the paperwork for your bankruptcy now. We cannot compete with slave labor, i.e. service and manufacturing, with other countries. All she wants to do is increase minimum wage, so corporations can outsource jobs more than they are now. Then &quot;rebuild infrastructure&quot;, that&#39;s just bs for we&#39;re going to use taxpayer money to create temporary jobs. These aren&#39;t actual business, the prosperity won&#39;t last, its not a Apple or a Facebook. Its rebuilding infrastructure, I don&#39;t know what to say, but I am truly disappointed, that people would be convinced enough to vote against themselves in an election. Voting for Hillary is basically the same as saying, its ok to be unethical, immoral, dishonest as long as you gain power and become rich. Sad but true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does this sub all harp on about Hillary&#39;s corruption? Trump abuses his power also, that&#39;s the definition of corruption. He grabs pussy, or says it, because he can. He avoids taxes because he can. He says things to others that&#39;s disrespectful or even riotous but because he&#39;s rich and powerful, he does it because he can. He shafts his contractors because he can. He has over 3,500 current lawsuits of supposed injustices against others. Just look at his attitude, he thinks he&#39;s invincible because he has so much money. At least Hillary is just a bit more humble and out of 30 years of being in public office and accounted for, how much can you rail against her personality, of being a dickhead to people? </p>

<p>And many of you would say Trump does it because it&#39;s legal. Why can&#39;t you say the same for Hillary because she hasn&#39;t been deemed to break any laws. Whether she did or not is a different story but legally, she hasn&#39;t been ruled guilty of anything. Why not just face it, she&#39;s in a corrupt system and that&#39;s what she learned in all her years of public office. Yet you charge her for possibly taking advantage of it, the same thing that Trump does. None are innocent but how many of you just see past how corrupted and corruptible Trump would be is just jaw-dropping. </p>

<p>That type of commenting is the modus operandi of a super PAC known as Correct the Record, which goes around trolling anti-hillary comments on the internet in an attempt to make it look like she has more support than she does and also to control the narrative in order to get people parroting the message that their campaign wants spread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what CTR is. And I have no problem with them.</p>

<p>Many (not all) Trumpees and conspiratards peddle bullshit about clinton and politics on a regular basis, and I love the idea of a group of people dedicated to putting them in their place. The shit they spew gets read by people with good intentions, and then those good people are poisoned, because they&#39;re too lazy to do their research. Take this post, for instance. It&#39;s such bullshit that I can&#39;t help but laugh. But others may read this and not think too hard, and it may affect them. It shouldn&#39;t. Let&#39;s poison as few people as possible here, and keep the damage caused by all the dumb pieces of shit in the world to an absolute minimum.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>trolling anti-hillary comments on the internet in an attempt to make it look like she has more support than she does</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are aware that clinton has a <strong>majority support</strong> in this country? Especially among college educated white people, which I bet the majority of people on reddit fall into (at least, in college)? So don&#39;t you, in your infinite conspiratard wisdom, think that <em>maybe</em> the support she&#39;s receiving is real, and not just CTR &quot;shills&quot;? Or perhaps, are you too afraid of this fact to face it? I would <em>expect</em> that <em>at least</em> for every trump supporter here there is a clinton supporter. It&#39;s probably weighted even more towards clinton, however. So, for every pro-trump (or anti-clinton) comment you see, you should <em>expect</em> to see a pro-clinton (or anti-trump) rebuttal.</p>

<p>I will not respond to you or anyone on this shithole of a subreddit again. Ever again. This sub used to have decent offbeat articles and intel. But now? Utter shit.</p>

<p>Well your previous post asked what it was.  </p>

<p>That is awesome that she has majority support.  I didn&#39;t make her create an astroturfing super PAC.  CTR exists and performs its stated function.  If she had the support she needed already, you&#39;d think that CTR would serve no purpose.  But assuming she does have that support, it is after CTR&#39;s existence which undoubtedly contributed to her current support.  Again, if it didn&#39;t contribute to it then it would not exist.</p>

<p>The comments I&#39;m talking about are not rebuttals.  They are comments that shoot off one liners to change the topic or make it somehow about Trump instead. Exactly what the first few responses to my comment did.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the people who do participate in this sub appreciate your using a slur to describe them, and I&#39;m sure you will be missed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the public have lost their trust in the FBI. I agree to an extent but she is running for office, so transparency isn&#39;t that much to ask for. Also completely innocent is a bit of a stretch. A completely innocent person wouldn&#39;t have destroyed evidence the way Hillary did. By doing so she&#39;s brought this negative attention on herself, maybe even causing more damage than the initial crimes. They are still investigating the Clinton Foundation and Comey himself said that had this been a normal investigation, a normal person would have been charged for the use of the private server in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys need to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/fbi-directors-letter-to-congress-after-review-of-newly-discovered-clinton-emails/2129/?tid=a_inl">read the statement he made earlier today</a>... he says the emails dont matter and he stands by what he said in July... then compare it to what he actually said in July... I think he&#39;s just watching his ass... Playing the baddies... the way it sounds he might just be fuckin&#39; tricky. </p>

<p>&quot;This will be an unusual statement in at least a couple ways. First, I am going to include more detail about our process than I ordinarily would, because I think the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest.&quot;</p>

<p>My interest couldn&#39;t get anymore fuckin&#39; intense... July 5th was his debriefing for us. </p>

<p>&quot;After a tremendous amount of work over the last year, the FBI is completing its investigation and referring the case to the Department of Justice for a prosecutive decision.&quot; Not closed then... just saying they had to hand it to the DOJ</p>

<p>&quot;To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are <strong>often subject to security or administrative sanctions.</strong> But that is not what we are deciding now.&quot; Adding <em>now</em> to the end sounds like they will decide that later. </p>

<p>The whole thing is just really carefully worded... check out the rest of his original speech... </p>

<p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system">https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system</a></p>

<p>Trump straight out said at a rally last night that he had Comey on his side... the crowd started to boo and he settled em right down like Trump knew Comey wasn&#39;t part of the corrupt system. He just has to tread very carefully until it&#39;s go time. edit - Trump lightly trashtalked about him at a rally tonight.  </p>

<p>Who cares about the handling of emails? Small potatoes... Like worrying about a jaywalking ticket for the guy that just finished a downtown killing spree. The email was a smokescreen that had even us fooled... covering them working on the huge case behind the scenes. The real juicy stuff isn&#39;t hillary and email... it Clinton Foundation and hard evidence. </p>

<p>Best Case Scenario - Tonight&#39;s statement could be interpreted to mean Clinton Foundation will be deemed International Terrorists by the U.N.</p>

<p>Possibly unrelated but interesting... This was released 2 days ago... </p>

It&#39;s totally plausible to process and review 650k docs in a week, analytics engines and matching algorithms do all the work now. Just Google e discovery assisted review.

    <div class="md"><p>Every day this subreddit is filled with things about imminent &quot;false flags&quot; that don&#39;t happen, made-up things that are 100% debunked in about 10 seconds, and claims about satanic imagery that&#39;s almost undoubtedly a coincidence 99% of the time. If I had a dime for every underground satanic child sex ring that was actually exposed, I would have 0 dimes. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say every theory/accusation on here is false. But the logic here is that Obama/Clinton/whoever is behind anything bad that happens before any flimsy evidence even comes out to support it. You can say the MSM has a slant, but they can get in trouble for making wrong claims/accusations without proper verification (look at Rolling Stone).</p>

<p>Conspiracy reporting sites, on the other hand, actually have a vested interest in making up wild claims. Sites like infowars completely depend on this. When national news organizations do real investigative reporting that shows evidence of a scandal, they can make bank. But they have to have a level of accuracy, and they make their profits because they&#39;re trusted to report the news. These other sites HAVE to say such-and-such is a false flag, conspiracy, etc to make their money.</p>

<p>Get. Fucking. Real.</p>

<p>There is no journalism in corporate media. It is a branch of the White House as public relations that serves THEIR interests. Not us.</p>

<p>Just because you haven&#39;t heard about false flags or whatever you want to mention, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t true. </p>

<p>And try looking up the definition of &quot;conspiracy&quot;. It means to conspire against. Not &quot;all conspiracy information I don&#39;t know and am not open minded to is wrong and obviously not true since it goes against what I was taught&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it were as extreme as you make it, especially when it comes to media being complicit in coverups, that kind of information would&#39;ve undoubtedly leaked out by now. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t deny that there&#39;s slant to each side. But their track record on being verifiably right is infinitely better than any conspiracy website or subreddit. </p>

<p>What I mean when I talk about false flags, is every time people claim something &quot;big&quot; is about to happen and literally nothing happens. Then everyone forgets about that. Like Julian Assange being supposedly assassinated by the CIA a few weeks ago. Or is the one that we&#39;re seeing a fake disinfo agent? I can&#39;t keep up anymore. There&#39;s always strange logical leaps that are made to explain why X doesn&#39;t disprove a theory. </p>

<p>I study conspiracy theories a lot. I know my stuff with them. But it&#39;s not one way or the other, either. There are conspiracy theories that could be, and some that have been, true. But to claim that these theorists are more accurate or have any less bias than MSM reporters is blatantly illogical. </p>

<p>There is no way a laptop could hold 650,000 emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The average email size is very small. (Only a small percent of them have file attachments.) First result on a search for &#39;average size of an email&#39; says 15 KB. Even if these emails&#39; average size was as much as 100 KB, that would be about 62 GB total (if you count it as 1024 KB per MB and MB per GB; 65 GB if using 1000-unit increments instead like the hard drive marketers do) for 650k emails. </p>

<p>Looking up specs for laptops sold in 2009 (dunno how old Weiner&#39;s laptop was supposed to be, but seems about right), the first result I randomly looked at, for a <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP579?locale=en_US">13-inch Macbook</a>, says it was sold with hard drive sizes of 250 GB, 320 GB, or 500 GB - any of which would leave plenty of space for such a quantity of even above-average-size emails. </p>

<p>Few people will even talk about this a year from now. Less well care an no one will actually do anything about it?</p>

<p>I used to think we were moments from revolt but the truth is, we are fucking lazy, scared people who haven&#39;t had real leadership in generations. Our poets are dead. Our philosophers are ignored. Our revolutionaries are deemed crazy and silenced. </p>

<p>None of you/us will do much of anything bc iphones and Netflix. GG corporate overlords already won.</p>

<p>Announcing that it is &quot;ALL CLEAR&quot; yesterday, helps the media cover that story all day, without having to talk about Clinton Foundation crimes, Vince Foster, Ron Brown, treason with Qatar/Saudi Arabia/ISIS, Spirit Cooking, NYPD pedophilia claims, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>None of us have any control at this point, so let&#39;s see what happens tomorrow. No news will come out today that the news will cover. </p>

<p>No one knows yet how effective social media canvassing versus wholesale media/regime propaganda in favor of the Clinton Mafia is, until Nov. 9. We will see.</p>

You know they can very easily eliminate the duplicates (through many available programs) that they&#39;ve already checked, which likely accounts for the vast majority - if not <em>all</em> - of them. Then it&#39;s a matter of checking the rest that might <em>pertain</em> to Hillary.</p>

<p>When you send an email, <em>each</em> person gets a copy. So all of hillary&#39;s emails to Abedin (these are already investigated!) will have been checked and removed. This might very likely account for absolutely everything.</p>

<p>So bottomline, you&#39;re all retards, case closed. But we already knew this, so our ruling remains the same as it was in July.</p>

<p>Is it natural to confiscate entire laptops and only get scope of a warrant for very small portions of said laptops, and not the entire thing in its accessible form? If your answer to this is &quot;yes,&quot; what reason do I have to simply believe you? As someone fairly trained at digging and problem solving, it would be naive to consider anything off limits before you even looked at it - especially when you are talking about personal electronic devices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of this talk of facts and none of you are bringing any. But implying I&#39;m a redneck because I hate liberals and soccer moms is an interesting tactic.</p>

<p>The only anti-negros I see are Obama and Clinton.</p>

<p>Obama has tripled the national debt.</p>

<p>Corporate profits are up 144 percent.</p>

<p>Food stamps are up 44%</p>

<p>Black abortions continue to rise along the continued deterioration of the black nuclear family: <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/2016/05/11/black-lives-matter-28-of-abortions-done-on-black-babies-but-blacks-just-12-of-population/">http://www.lifenews.com/2016/05/11/black-lives-matter-28-of-abortions-done-on-black-babies-but-blacks-just-12-of-population/</a></p>

<p>Home ownership has fallen ~4%.</p>

<p>Minority income down almost 20%</p>

<p>Black unemployment is universally down 10%</p>

<p>Hillary calls them super predators. And allegedly calls her staffers racial lines.</p>

<p>So while you think liberals are somehow intellectually superior to the rednecks you mock, and think the democratic party elevates you, you&#39;re not and it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>What you guys are is useful idiots, toeing the party line like good little needies, begging for handouts and government restitution and intervention. You&#39;ve indiscriminately destroyed the middle quality of life for everyone, but in particular the minorities and specifically blacks you claim to champion.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve advanced social, racial, and economic division to us at a never-before-seen rate and volume. You&#39;ve elected leaders who&#39;ve instituted programs that have devastated the national economy. You&#39;ve brought riots, you&#39;ve taxed our speech and expression, you&#39;re rendered our schools complete indoctrination centers and have installed hierarchical victim politics.</p>

<p>It is the liberal/democratic party that is the party of the KKK, and even had a grand dragon mentor the beloved Hillary.</p>

<p>Liberals are the filth of society. Try to equate the right with dumbed down, gun-toting rednecks all you want. But it doesn&#39;t change the horrors you&#39;ve inflicted upon them and everyone else. I don&#39;t want to hear anymore about how Obama is a benefit to the small person. And certainly not Hillary. They are the ultimate corporate fascists and don&#39;t give a damn about &quot;negros&quot; or anyone else.</p>

<p>And yes. I&#39;m keeping my guns, because one day I may have to clean up this mess you&#39;ve dumped on us, or defend myself from your system. And trump has never said anything remotely &quot;anti-negro.&quot; It&#39;s you tolerant anti-racists who keep interjecting race into everything. But the truth is evident, isn&#39;t it? BLM, race-specific issues, all of that. If you want to know who the real racists are, just look at the actions and motives of your own.</p>

<p>No. You&#39;re not &quot;right, bro.&quot; Not about anything you&#39;ve typed. You couldn&#39;t be more wrong and deluded.</p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t matter but it does. Type of case matters. Important cases are called heaters.</p>

<p>Read this and get back to me.</p>

<p>Myron W. Orfield, Jr., Deterrence, Perjury, and the Heater Factor: An Exclusionary Rule
in the Chicago Criminal Courts, 63 U. COLO. L. REv. 75, 75 (1992)</p>

<p>Edit: Sorry I couldnt find a link. I only have the hard copy.</p>

<p>Youre incorrect about scope as well.</p>

<p>But youre kinda correct. </p>

<p>The scope of this warrant if narrowly addressed to illegal mail on server could result in narrow warrant.</p>

<p>If the scope is framed as illegally held info on any device and evidence of corruption all emails could be searched.</p>

<p>This is how cops get off the hook. Prosecutor pulls punches and makes it appear like its the judge or the law.</p>
