<p>The painting was specifically mentioned 9 months later in an article on Podesta by Time Magazine.</p>

<p>“On the wall in his office at Hillary Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters, campaign chairman John Podesta has an oil painting on loan from his lobbyist brother, who is an avid art collector,” the Time article states. “The image shows two men hunched over a dining room table, bearing knives and forks. On the table lays a man in a suit, who looks vaguely like Podesta.”</p>

<p>Podesta explained during the interview that he regularly tells colleagues that he would prefer to be the man with the fork.</p>

<p>“It’s better to be the guy with the fork than the guy on the table,” he said.</p>

<p>I tend to shy away from inforwars as a source, but they are doing an alright job of sifting through the podesta dump. This is just outright odd to me, a painting of two cannibal surgeons hangs in his office, and you mention two surgeons in a book that relates to these criminals eating what they &quot;spirit cook&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, basicly, it&#39;s a form of Mad Cow disease.</p>

<p>&quot;Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) causes the brain to become damaged over time. It is fatal. Symptoms include:</p>

<pre><code>Tingling, burning, or prickling in the face, hands, feet, and legs. But there are much more common illnesses that cause these same symptoms. Having tingling in parts of your body does not mean you have vCJD.
Dementia.
Psychotic behavior.
Problems moving parts of the body. As the disease gets worse, a person is no longer able to walk.
Coma.
</code></pre>

<p>If a person does eat nerve tissue from an infected cow, he or she may not feel sick right away. The time it takes for symptoms to occur after you&#39;re exposed to the disease is not known for sure, but experts think it is years.&quot;
