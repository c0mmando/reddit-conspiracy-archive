<p>We only have 2 days left. </p>

<p>Today was another day wasted on another false promise of the gigantic crushing blow we&#39;ve all been waiting for.</p>

<p>If they keep giving us deadlines, we keep waiting. And many people -while they&#39;re waiting to see who saves the day- stop trying to save the day themselves.</p>

<p>We need to stop listening to these &quot;coming soon&quot; headlines and keep doing the work ourselves. Don&#39;t rely on anyone else. Keep digging. And don&#39;t stop. No matter what these bastards trick us in to believing.</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re trying to keep us from doing. </p>

<p>Edit: Or maybe the problem is that were focusing on the candidates. Not the people who are putting certain candidates in certain powerfully round, oblong shaped offices. </p>

<p>I could certainly see <em>those</em> people enjoying all our futile efforts toward the wrong goal.</p>

<p>We&#39;re sitting here worrying about which brand of battery to put in the smoke detector while our house is almost completely engulfed in flames around us. We need to go after the fucking fire, people.</p>

<p>(PS: daylight savings. don&#39;t forget to change your batteries)</p>

<p>Our parents, their entire generation, all they did was just accept what they were given. Their entire lives.</p>

<p>Acceptance of that&#39;s the way the world is, and that it is our reality that our government is this insanely powerful, complex, dangerous, and heinous entity that actually only cares for itself. It is nothing like human history has seen - its scope atleast.</p>

<p>Primitively speaking, we lived for a time as predators - that was our role in nature. The sad realization is that we still are and we&#39;ve turned on ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;Coming Soon&quot; and &quot;Breaking&quot; headlines we&#39;ve been seeing are what&#39;s called &quot;narrative drive&quot;. It&#39;s the promise of something more that drives interest not the actually delivery of that something. That&#39;s why soap operas and series like Lost are so compelling. They always hint at a mystery but never actually reveal it.</p>

<p>Why are these being used? Seems to me to be a distraction. They&#39;ve basically turned our interests against us, keeping us captivated by a &quot;conspiracy opera&quot; of their own design while the work of real conspiracies runs amok.</p>

<p>What should we do? By default, we should disregard anything and everything that says something is &quot;breaking&quot; the next day or &quot;coming soon&quot;. I&#39;ve never seen one of these portents come true.  If something happens, it will happen, and we will hear that it has happened. Give no credit to these hollow cries of alarm.</p>

They&#39;re stalling this narrative so you just sit and wait for &quot;the happening&quot; instead of being out right now and demanding answers from your government. You&#39;ve been given enough info for you to especulate. They just need to tamper enough votes to steal the election no matter how big the landslide. Once she becomes president what ? You will not protest, and on the first 100 days you WILL regret it.</p>

<p>Investigators believe FBI agent, Michael Brown, 45, shot and killed his 33-year-old wife, Susan Brown, late Friday night before setting the couple’s home on fire and then turning the gun on himself. Brown was a 12 year veteran of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department before spending the last six years in the FBI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TLDR: Burn all the evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brown is believed to have started the gasoline-fueled fire but spared the life of his beloved beagle, Dixie. “Prior to the fire, he dropped off the dog at a neighbor’s house,” Frederick said. “He put the dog in a neighbor’s backyard.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TLDR: the invader had to deal with a barking dog prior to the invasion, you do the math.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy theories are running rampant throughout many alt. right media outlets, leading many to believe this was another “hit job” by the Clintons in retaliation for the FBI email leaks so close to the presidential election. Media outlets like Alex Jones’ Infowars and WND are running with the theory that globalist assassins, working for the Clintons, had the Brown family murdered and their home burned to destroy any possible evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>THANK YOU. This is what I&#39;ve been saying to the people around me all throughout this election; they don&#39;t hear beyond my qualms with Clinton and jump to the conclusion that I support Trump regardless of his actions/rhetoric.I live in Canada so I can&#39;t even vote but here it&#39;s like say anything against the accepted opinions of the left-wing and your character is automatically attacked. You&#39;re labeled as a bigot or racist. I just prefer to think which candidate am I most likely to survive 4 years with leading our biggest ally and trading partner. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I can def relate. Any time I have a discussion, I have to begin with something along the lines of &quot;I do not believe Trump is a good candidate. BUUUUUT.....&quot;</p>

<p>I was a Bernie supporter. If you would have told me a year ago that I be hoping for a Trump presidency on Nov 7th, I would have bet you anything or any amount of money that there was no way this could have been true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole election cycle has been mindfuckery. I&#39;m looking forward to getting off the ride because while it&#39;s been fun, I&#39;m beginning to feel nauseous. </p>

<p>All of my energy has gone to this election, to the point that I&#39;ve straight up hinged my beliefs about democracy on the outcome.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s a part of me that always knew my attention of these issues was a form of consent. By paying attention to it I was also legitimizing it.</p>

<p>I often vacillate on the issue of which is more important: living a life where I construct an alternative to the power structures so that they are irrelevant... or, being knee-deep in it and actively combatting it. I think there&#39;s a balance, but in the former I control my life and in the latter I don&#39;t feel as if I do.</p>

<p>Even more disheartening was Assange openly stating &quot;they&quot; won&#39;t allow a Trump win. This guy has more insider info than we do, and my concern is that the vote is already rigged. </p>

<p>My only takeaway from this giant exercise in tuning into all of the corruption and fraud is to take the reins of one&#39;s on life, realize one&#39;s own power to shape and control life for the better, and in doing so, strip the tacit consent from these sick fucks.</p>

<p>That is f&#39;ing incredible!</p>

<p>If you want something more blatant, you deserve to be disappointed because you&#39;re just deluded, thinking you&#39;re going to get a video of a Clinton boinking a little boy. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve got to bring the noise - the FBI and wikileaks are giving you those stupid little plastic kazoo&#39;s!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. They get away with that by having a &quot;no politics&quot; rule, but you also can&#39;t post them in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s part of why this subreddit has been more political than usual. I&#39;m not annoyed by that, because frankly a lot of stuff about this election is appropriate for this subreddit.</p>

<p>However, there&#39;s a stigma to this subreddit. I see it posted all the time both in other subs as well as this one. </p>

<p>If you mention anything wikileaks related or anti-clinton related in the default/large subs there is almost <em>always</em> comments telling you to go back to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where your crazy ass belongs.</p>

<p>The same kind of thing happens here as well, but they instead say shit like &quot;oh I forgot I was in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where logic and sanity don&#39;t exist!&quot;</p>

<p>Both sort of comments serve the same purpose: painting this and similar subs as reddits own mental institution. If you question the status quo, you&#39;re told to stay here. Not because it&#39;s relevant to conspiracy - but because you&#39;re crazy and this is where you belong.</p>

<p>Watching that kind of thing happen every day gets pretty infuriating after a while.</p>

<p>If you use social media, block all of these left-wing and right-wing parasite opportunists. Anonymous is full of shit, too. </p>

<p>When Hillary is elected, don&#39;t let your kids join the military to be bullet fodder and a commodity for her billionaire buddies to use as pawns to macro-manage resource-rich third world countries through aggressive military adventures. Fuck everyone else. Protect your own and yourself.</p>

Maybe we missed our November gift because the agents did their job,  or perhaps once again there is nothing, maybe tomorrow?</p>

<p>Edit: killing trump is not a gift, I meant it more sarcastically everyone keeps saying X date and there was something today.  Just didn&#39;t pan out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say this: have heart, OP. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 95% sure Wikileaks is intentionally holding back Clinton emails with the intention of dropping them. I think this is most evident by the fact that we have so little correspondence between Podesta and Hillary--there&#39;s no way they could&#39;ve communicated so infrequently, so my guess is that they&#39;ll be dropping that batch separately and ideally, soon.</p>

<p>We haven&#39;t seen the best of WL, that&#39;s for sure.</p>
