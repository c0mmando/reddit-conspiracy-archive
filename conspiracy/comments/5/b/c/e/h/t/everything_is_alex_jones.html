       I will try to make this as short as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guys at the top, the so called Powers That Be are no where near as powerful as most of us here believe.  They are just guys.  Old men with plans for the world longer than their lifespan.  Their plans involve their own children and even grandchildren.
I am in my 30s and somewhere in the Rothschild Manor there is a guy my age who will eventually carry on his families legacy.
They are extremely smart, well educated and well organised, but just people at the end of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       When i first started working for a big company i thought the CEO in charge must be such a smart guy.  Then as i worked my way up i saw how unorganized, dumb and corrupt he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The success of TPTB as we know comes from their secrecy and private organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This current situation in the U.S with regards to the corruption 'leaks' is not a new tactic of theirs.  Nixon was outed as corrupt and yet the same exact system repeated it's self.  It will continue unchanged i assure you.  They want you to see your system is corrupt and rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason i bring up Alex Jones is because he is a huge part of their long term plan.  Alex was probably a genuine skeptic at one point, until he was propositioned / threatened etc.  Now he is part of the game. (although i think a relative of his was CIA but still...) Alex Jones is the puppet showing how corrupt everything is because they want us to see everything is corrupt.  They are smart.  They know people want to end wars between nations.  They know a global peace agreement would be a great idea, and that people will eventually demand it.  so they will poke and jab at us with endless wars until we rebel.  Then as if too easily, a global government will be offered up on a silver platter.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the UK there was a drug addict Pop star called Russel Brand.  no one listened to a work he said.  He disappeared for a few years and is now back after a relationship with a well known high level freemasons daughter and now he is the voice of establishment rebel!  What a turnaround.  With a 33 tattooed on his arm.  He is the English Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russel and Alexs job is to make us think there are people fighting for us.  Make us think ah well if he is saying that on TV then there must be thousands of people who think the same. All good i'll not get off my ass and not do fuck all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now with these recent 'leaks' we are told there are people in the FBI fighting for us!  Don't worry guys, don't bother trying to stop anything or do anything about it, these no named guys in the FBI will fix it for us.  Bullshit.  Ask them to release the 9/11 details and watch FBIanon lie his way around that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its very clever and really tackles all their objectives from various psychological angles.  But the mainstream coverage of both these two are evidence enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would ask anyone to take this wikileaks stuff with a fistful of salt.  Wikileaks has been around for a long time and has effected the establishment 0%.  0.000000% effect on their plans.
Just remember all the good old conspiracy posts about illuminati and NWO.  Then ask if Trump will really save you.  He is one of those grandchildren i was referring to earlier......
      </p>
      <p>
       George Soros.  This should be the target of everyone.  Old Georgy boy was hired by the British Royal family.  He is funded directly be them.  And he is the highest level Mason any of us will get anywhere close to revealing to the public.  Every day spent pouring over DNC or wikileaks is another day George carries on the despicable order of the crown... unchallenged.

       I am agreeing with you more and more. For a split second I got caught in the momentum however I have a feeling this part of the chess game. When Clinton wins, tptb wants pro-trump people to rebel violently, they win. Or no one rebels and they have deepened our complacency, they win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I get stuck is what are the actionable steps to foil this agenda? I keep coming back to just hammering away at sharing information with each other and promoting pro-human values in every way possible. Eat well, be kind, be conscientious, speak truth as often as possible. Hold the flame of integrity and creative problem solving rather than lies and manipulation. Live as transparently in our private time as we do in public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck to all of us, I really do think at minimum this election cycle has opened some eyes for a new generation.

       I have this horrible thought than in the future i will be having a conversation with loved ones or co workers about whether or not we should accept this NWO deceleration in parliament / congress.  And i will be trying to convince them that its bad and evil but and they will be calling me crazy.

       Wikileaks and the FBI anons are doing a pretty good job at the moment exposing their true nature - satanic pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       All is not lost. Countless people are being exposed to this information as we speak and they can't dismiss it as "crazy tin-foil-hattery" no longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last ace up their sleeve is a nuclear war. And the only hope to stop that is that there are enough sane people in the military to not go along with it. Fortunately, the military (in most countries except Germany) is made up of some of the best people around.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice to you is to build up your credibility with those around you. I've "redpilled"/"opened the eyes of" some of the most conservative people around me by building up my credibility as a really informed, intelligent and reasonable person throughout the years. My friends/family know that they don't have the time to research all of this, so at first I had to point out that it is important to analyze all angles of an event, then they tried it for themselves a few times (coming up to the same conclusions as me), then they started truly trusting me on such matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to take it slow, never back down and always admit when you are wrong (but show them why and how you were wrong).
      </p>
      <p>
       Never, ever make it a personal issue. Never make people feel like they are stupid or inferior or fools for trusting the MSM. They know they are being played, but nobody wants to admit that. Give them time, feed them good info, and you'll have them on your side in a reasonable amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't go overboard and don't shame anyone, ever, for not trusting you.

       the other good thing is that the nuclear ace up the sleave is actually not even an option, or if would have been played long ago, and indeed they have tried. There are several (hundreds actually) of NASA whistleblowers who have gone on record and related their personal experiences of witnessing "positive" ETs in action, the most telling of which describes a nuclear bomb literally being disarmed in midair by a "ship" which was really more like an orb or sorts. I believe the positive ETs are almost ready to come in and help the people on the ground (us, anon, good military and intelligence personnel, etc) finish the corruption and satanic/masonic/vatican/elite bloodline rule once and for all. Indeed, all is not lost, actually the only real ace up their sleeve is to induce despair, hopelessness, apathy in all of us by making it seem like the game is already over. The game is far from over, really it has just begun, and we're just about to get to the fun part

       Positive ETs only act when it's absolutely necessary, they must have some kind of Prime Directive shit going on, because they seem very OK with letting countless millions die of starvation or war.  But Evil ETs have no such restraints. They have been manipulating or collaborating with the ruling class (the real ruling class) for God knows how long.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we do get to live really interesting times. The kind of times that prophets have talked about and will go down in the history books. Our fight will determine if we shall be remembered as heroes or "evil-nazi-shitlordian" villains.

       They have also been blocked...many of them have apologized to me in energetic forms and explained that They have been blocked but Will be able to help this year, the planet is also too low frequency for them and they would be harmed by entering our sphere physically. ..I feel your frustration, really, I used to get so mad at them, truth is the battle for truth has hurt a lot of them too and there has been so much deception to them as well to think we don't need help, that we chose this, etc...but yeah this year its all over for the (false) powers that be

       You are aware that the most dangerous animal is a trapped and cornered one. These bastards will have absolutely no problem in taking down the entire human civilization down with them if they'd ever lose power. Nuclear is just one option, but they have so many end-world weapons at their disposal I think we can't really survive without outside help. Do you think these bastards will not try to release every single virus they have, close down the internet and all non-radio communications, crash all the world markets at the same time, etc. if they were convinced they are losing ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hope you're on point with this one. We will need A LOT of help if we are ever going to shake this cabal off of our species. The parasites have infested us for ... what is it now 4500 years or so , right ? They want and are very close to complete control over us. If they think they are losing we'll see hell raised like never before. We will need help.

       They would have played the nuke card long ago..stay positive, one of their biggest weapons is fear and despair, they want us to feel tired hopeless and powerless, help is here and coming, the positive vibrational energy is also increasing exponentially and will trigger "miracles", hillary literally deterioated phsycially because it is now becoming nearly impossible to lie on the world stage and not experience instant energetic karma, we're fine :) there are also tons I heroes working behind the scenes on earth as intelligence experts and military leaders, trey gowdy is one, best thing we can do I be positive and take care of our bodies to avoid their toxic chemicals products food and drugs in all forms

       But I do stay positive, that's why i never gave up on all of this in the face of nothing but laughter and contempt for a decade, only to be fully redeemed by $CURRENT_YEAR :D

      <p>
       I really, really hope you're legit . Because I am tired of wanting to believe. I want to see things with my own eyes during my lifetime. I never understood why all the secrecy. Why do we have to think that we are alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll stay positive. But I can't promise anything about keeping my body away from drugs. As the great poet M. Manson once said

       Yeah i feel ya, if you haven't tried kratom yet it's a much better alternative to alcohol, tobacco, xanax, coke, heroin, pills, and in my opinion, weed. For sure though we will see change in our lifetime. Check out kratom_reddit

       I feel that awakening like this is logarithmic rather than linear. There is a social consciousness/collective consciousness/collective agreement that everyone on the planet participates in. That's why what we believe and how we behave as individuals does have effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my view its just as important to act "as if" this shit was already cleaned up. How do we organize as a society? what are the underlying values we DO care about? how would you live your life if TPTB were not in the way? And start doing all that now as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't want to get caught in the trap of oh fuck it all, none of it matters anyway. because that is really when all is lost. eventually after hammering away the collective consciousness tide will swish over to another worldview. and it will be common knowledge that NWO was a massive manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       the biggest trick is that the answer is to somehow balance individual freedoms with collective global awareness. because that is what is already here: we are now all aware of each other and connected to each other. so how to achieve relative peace without becoming the borg? This is what the NWO wants to sell us. So to REALLY fight them we need to have a tenable alternative worldview already in the wings.

       I believed at first.  But no its too convenient.  And my main point, is that if it turns out to be bullshit, then it will have been an excellent distraction.  I cant even think of a better way to keep us busy.  alot lot lot of time will have been wasted

       It was an excellent distraction and the people fell for it hook line and sinker. On one hand I blame the people. They need to start thinking, they need to be open minded, etc. Then on the other hand I don't. Most people just want a fair shake in life, are just trying to make it and get by and don't expect people in leadership roles to fuck them over. I get it.

       I don't agree with you on Wikileaks. I genuinely think Assange is being persecuted, and they have put some dent into the establishment. First with the Afghan-Iraq War files, and now with the Clinton-Podesta emails. If anything more hasn't been done 'bout it, that's the media and public at fault. They fallen to a state of acquiescence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private Bradley was the one who allegedly leaked those War files + Cablegate, and look where he is? In a dungeon, facing a mental crisis. Reports say he isn't even allowed to sleep for 4 hours without being woken up (i.e., sleep deprivation). Assange could face the same fate. He knows its very real, and I guess some people will keep calling him a psyop/limited-hangout up until the point he's dead. Would you feel guilty then? Or write it off some other way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was a psyop of the US-Western establishment, he wouldn't have had the show on RT, asylum by Ecuador, or the interview he did with Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah, or even
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Kt8yjNrokUI?t=20m40s">
        praised Ron Paul
       </a>
       (back in 2013), and later appeared on
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheWikiLeaksChannel/search?query=ron+paul">
        his show
       </a>
       (Ron Paul Channel). Putin is ex KGB, im sure he can tell if someone is a spy or not, as can Nasrallah.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can argue all day long that his work doesn't make a difference, he isn't telling us what we don't know. But you can easily make that argument about anyone, including everything here. Everything is an open secret. Assange and Manning simply gave us the first person accounts, when we've been relying on third-person accounts for so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Alex Jones. I used to be a fan of his work, while also recognizing where he was clearly doing a hackjob in respect to certain things. But then I stopped. This life-long enemy of the CFR, started backing Ted Cruz (whose wife is CFR) when it became apparent Rand Paul wasn't going anywhere. Then after that he jumped ship to Donald Trump. Now his channel is basically Rush Limbaugh lite. Blame Muslims and immigrants for everything, without tackling the core issues that cause those crises. Which he used to do. The change happened overnight it seemed.

       In retrospect, AJ always did more disservice than good if you think about it. He always downplayed Israel meddling in US politics, the role of Zionists in US foreign policy, and never touched on reasonable theories in favor of extravagant ones. He even made the gun-control crisis into a joke, remember when he got on Piers Morgan n acted a fool? (He only got on because that whitehouse petition blew up which Kurt Nimmo posted on there to begin with)
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know that Kurt Nimmo,

        the webmaster/editor for Infowars

       who basically made the site/channel into what it is tody after he got on aboard, left the site earlier this year? He went on to right a book ''Donald Trump &amp; the War on Islam" and
       <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/about-us/">
        now he works for Newsbud
       </a>
       and Blacklisted News. You can see why he left. Guess his bullshit monitor couldn't take it anymore.
      </p>

       There's a lot of guys who've jumped ship over the years (Aaron Dykes, Melisa Melton, and now Jakari Jackson), but they can't talk about it due to non-disclosure contracts (see

       I tend to think there is a possibility that those previous leaks such as manning and Snowden were planned and executed by those who wish to expose to us the corruption in our leadership. Otherwise we would not know about the spying etc leaked by those 2.   don't get my wrong, it is real, that guy is in prison being tortured, but tptb won't really care about that will they

       My only issue with this argument is the assumption that "tptb would never allow a truly independent outsider to gain power" because from my perspective they did, in fact, throw literally everything they have at him, and have simply come up short.
I'd sooner believe that tptb are as fallible as you described them and simply underestimated him/his appeal.

       If they actually threw everything they had at him he'd be dead.  Truth is that he goes way back with the Clinton's and was also a friend of Epstein's.

       Alex Jones is another Glen Beck,  another self promoting manipulator who targeted truth as an opportunity.    Which is unfortunate,  especially since so many people in the past felt that his channel was the go to place.   I think more and more people though are finding other channels like RT which are less obnoxious and toxic,  and also,  since even Democracy Now has discredited itself in so many ways,  we as a community are growing up and realizing its not the messenger,  but the issue that carries the day.   Maybe if we remember to focus on the issues and not the messengers,  we might even stop wanting to join parties,  and might get wise to just how dangerous the corporate channels have been.   No channel deserves that level of loyalty.   The real experts will be covered by more than one channel anyway.    The messenger has never been the expert.

       Meh.   Ever wonder why "meh" is the defining meme for the generations of intelligent people that have followed the time of Reagan here in America?    It goes along with the shit eating smile of people who keep their head in a hole most of the time.    Can't really blame them.   All the toys in the world can't make up for the devastating poverty of vision that we are surrounded by,  the desolate landscape of self delusion.   Its no different than sleeping well in a house bordering the German concentration camps.   What is the choice,  "not to sleep well"?

       Ah that's what I figured. Do you have information regarding sandy hook being a false flag? I think the Orlando attacks looked very much like a false flag myself

       The only false flags I have studied in detail were 9/11 and JFK,  followed by Oklahoma City.    After that,  London, and Spain.   After that Charlie Hebdo and the French theatre attacks.   After that Boston,  and  a bit of Orlando.    Sandy Hook is strange as hell,  but its too hard to get any handle at all on that one.    I sure would not lead off with it,  when there are others so much easier to look at.

       Which ones do you think are the most clear of being a false flag? I essentially believe that the government had a role in 9/11, but I think that is even controversial. It's just so against the modern manufactured consensus

       The order in which I listed them is the same order that I would share with a newcomer,  the same order that I have confidence that the evidence is clearly pointing to a false flag.   In other words,  9/11 was a false flag in great clearness.    Kevin Ryan,   Jon Cole,  David Chandler,  David Ray Griffin and many others have been extremely professional and incontrovertible in the aspects they looked into and specialized in.   In addition,  the anthrax attacks and the political record of George Bush,  Tony Blair,  Dick Cheney,  and many others,  and recorded in the 9/11 timeline indicates early level coordination and points to motives that were linked to the execution of the following wars in Afghanistan,  Iraq,  Libya,  Syria,  and the relations with Lebanon,  and Iran.    The 19 so called hijackers were clearly patsies.    The narrative on 9/11 , the day itself,  is interesting to compare to the narrative of the following day,  the role of the corporate media in distorting the events witnessed by so many that were in contradiction to the official story,  there are so many levels from which to view the cover up and the planted myth.

       Of course,  since then the US has incurred the blood of millions of dead and wounded,  millions more dislocated as a result of the incredible desolation visited upon huge swaths of formerly functional human infrastructure.    And the ongoing issues with the failed and nearly failed states.   Incredible.    And this election is a referendum on much of this,  partly.    Too late.

       Russell Brand has never been a pop star, he was a comedian / tv presenter. He was married to Katy Perry for a while. He was a junkie before he was famous in the UK.

        The reason i bring up Alex Jones is because he is a huge part of their long term plan. Alex was probably a genuine skeptic at one point, until he was propositioned / threatened etc. Now he is part of the game. (although i think a relative of his was CIA but still...) Alex Jones is the puppet showing how corrupt everything is because they want us to see everything is corrupt. They are smart.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       That's not a good conclusion: that he's part of the plan because he's keeping you aware of it.  In fact, i could argue that the reason Alex Jones is not control grid because he's doing the same: in other words, panopticism is not his fault--it's yours.  And mine.  For continuing to give tacit consent to their system of control.  Every time you buy anything, you consent.  Every time you use an ATM, you consent.  Every time you sign an EULA, you consent.  Every time you google search you consent.  Every interaction is consent, every time you 'go along with the 9/11 official story' because you don't want to get 'verbally beat up' or 'put in outgroup by your peers' or 'get ridiculed' then you've consented.  Every time you watch history channel and get brainwashed you consent.  Every time you don't study your history but instead parrot along silly facebook tropes you consent.  Every time you use facebook you consent.  Every time you repeat jokes that are stupid mind control programming you consent.  Every time you play into party politics and become beligerent against dems or repubs, you consent.  Every time you drink bottled water you consent--after all the shit falls free from the sky, shame on you for not filtering that shit and drinking it like a champ.  Every time you watch stuporbowl, you consent.  Every time you go to church you consent.  Every time you watch the news you consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       They control everything but then again, you make it easy for them to do so.  You choose to some degree to let them control you.  They did all this terrible stuff with drugs and electronics to mind control people during MKULTRA, their findings?  Nothing works better than television.  Take out a shotgun and blow a hole in it.  Mind control over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones is not control grid, he's been waking people up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The litmus test for someone being control grid is whether or not what they say damages the status quo or supports it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My assessment is that AJ is wholly
       <em>
        disruptive
       </em>
       to the status quo, not supportive of it.  He's told you who killed JFK, shame on you that you didn't listen.  He's told you who did 9/11 and why.  You didn't listen.  He's told you who is behind ISIS, you didn't listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones is NOT control grid.  Neither is Assange. Neither is Snowden or 20 other intelligence whistleblowers.  You should be thankful there are people like this out there, in alternative media, helping you understand what's actually real.  It's good to be critical, so long as you still see the bigger picture.

       I never for a second trusted Jones because he called my personal hero, Bill Cooper a drunken fraud. This is the man that
       <a href="http://remnantradio.org/Archives/articles/William%20Cooper/Mystery%20Babylon/MB1.htm">
        truly exposed the NWO for what it really is
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones is controlled opposition that had to be put in place after the Patriot Movement that Cooper started was gaining too much ground. That's why he was allowed to do the Bohemian Grove "insertion" - to prove his credibility as an anti-system rebel.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's never, EVER brought up the Zionist connection to all of it. He also steers away from the Jesuit connection to the NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he's doing something good, which is to get Average Joe interested in this kind of ideas. Once you start digging deeper, it's obvious he's nothing but a shill.
