        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s be clear. This isn&#39;t a call to violence. </p>

<p>Things need to change. Throughout this election, and even long before, we have all questioned the legitimacy of the current political system by which we are governed.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem to matter how many false flags are uncovered. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference how many conspiracies are proven as facts.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how many documents wiki leaks releases to shed light on the dark corners of the world order. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how many Bradley Mannings, or Snowdens, or Assanges, put their lives and freedom on the line for us to get a tiny glimpse of the truth. </p>

<p>We could have a video released today showing the clintons and all the leaders of the free world taking part in some ridiculous bohemian grove ritual sacrifice, and the media would still be talking about Melania Trump modeling without a visa in between cat videos from YouTube. </p>

<p>The elections have been a farce, and they have been for as long as I&#39;ve been alive. Quite possibly much longer than that. The difference now is that it&#39;s become much more obvious.  </p>

<p>You can see it in the desperation of the mainstream media. </p>

<p>You can see it in the manner in which Reddit has been taken over.  We&#39;ve all been witnesses to the frightening change happening in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as well.</p>

<p>I used to come here to enjoy casual bantering with other like minded conspiracy theorists about far flung theories of aliens and big foot and all sorts of funny and interesting stuff. Now I come here because it&#39;s the only place on this site where I can see real news.</p>

<p>This is a call for revolution. I&#39;m drastically running out of hope, not just for America, but for humanity as a whole. No amount of arm chair investigators have been able to put a dent in the corruption. The media has turned against us, the system which had been created to protect us, has become our enemy.  The police which are sworn to protect us now seem to be against us. Our military has been turned from a tool of defense, into a corporate tool for enforcing our political ideals on the world. </p>

<p>We are at a turning point in the history of mankind. We can either lay down and die, or stand up and do something. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not ready to give up. I hope you aren&#39;t either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really want to mess with the system?  Give shit away for free.  Barter.  Start a community garden.  Teach people how to live off the grid.  Organize in your community to get money out of the hands of large corporations.  Get teens to volunteer at a food bank.  Disrupt the consumer chain. Compost. Grow your own food, give away the surplus.  Ride a bike instead of driving.  In today&#39;s America, the slavery is to pull you into a standard of living that you have to sell your soul to maintain, and you would have to shit on generations of your family&#39;s hard-earned progress to leave.   Live far below your means and spend surplus money freeing others from bondage (build houses, buy medical debt, plant vegetables in food deserts, fund battered women&#39;s shelters). Be your own revolution.</p>
