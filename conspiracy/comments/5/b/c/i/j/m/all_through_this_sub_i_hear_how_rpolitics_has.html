       And it's a REAL shame when the two "side runners" aren't fit presidential material either...
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing/no one being promulgated to the American people who is fit to run the most powerful country on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm thinking Lewis Black may have the best idea -  that we should choose a president by dropping a monkey in a parachute over a random part of the country and swearing in whoever's hand the monkey takes first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anymore, no one has an ideological reason to be president - you know - one that benefits the citizenry (who they're supposed to be working for). No, anymore it should be mandated that anyone who WANTS to be president should be permanently disqualified from being president.

       Certainly. Gary “I don’t think that was aleppo we smoked” Johnson is not only not a libertarian (like that would be a good thing…), he endorses Black Lives Matter, George Soros’ domestic terrorist organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the oligarchy that owns both parties, that’s real. But voting for a third party will do 1. absolutely nothing to positively change the country, as the number of parties has nothing to do with efficacy of the republic, 2. the electoral college being winner take all inherently prevents more than two parties from existing, and 3. federal funding for parties is not only nonsensically illegal, it is the reason that more than two parties do not exist.

       Your claims overlook some key facts and influencing factors. Firstly, it's widely documented that
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       was compromised long ago and that CTR is real and substantially funded. Secondly, there's far more conspiracy and unpublished controversy surrounding Hillary, and
       <strong>
        this is a conspiracy sub.

      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       hasn't been "taken over". You'd see a significant shift in content/analysis if you posted a few thousand unpublished leaked documents about Trump being in bed with the media, invested in military for profit, taking mass campaign funding from foreign third parties, lying under oath, currently in the middle of an FBI investigation, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because people are analysing Hillary's corruption/leaks doesn't mean they're praising Trump, or that the sub has been taken over.

       Your claim was that this sub had been taken over based on the content and ratio of posts in a comparison to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . I was highlighting that you failed to acknowledge the significance of this being a conspiracy sub and that there is currently vastly more available conspiracy surrounding Hillary. Thereby it is only natural that users of this sub would increasingly post about Hillary, particularly as more controversy comes to light.

      <p>
       I offered additional insight, hypothesis, and discussion points. You immediately attack back with insults, just because somebody didn't praise you for your unsubstantiated claims, logic, or numbers? k

       The last seven are/were controllable. You'll notice also that Bush got appointed, twice, by the supreme court in spite of apparently losing the election - how much more obvious does it get? And now we have an indecisive court in the event this one goes to the wire - even more interesting.

       You've got nothing but answers, guesses actually, that are copypasta to my points.

       You didn't understand a word I said, did you? It's okay - you're in a really large group...

      <p>
       "dominated by democrats" isn't really what you're observing - what you're observing is that the American public would rather vote for Rin-Tin-Tin than some lying sack of shit casino owner. Not saying the other one isn't a lying sack of shit - they both are.

       I wouldn't trust either to babysit my dogs much less run a country.

      <p>
       Reddit is merely pointing out, it its usual goofy way, the most likely outcome of this election - which is what I said way back at the top of all this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to be about an 70-30 split with Clinton (who in no way, shape or form should be considered presidential material) taking the lead because she's "lethal injection" as opposed to "being pulled apart by pliers" - one is going to hurt a bit less than the other but BOTH will make us dead.  We, the citizenry of this fine nation, are fucked either way... do you want to be ass-raped to death immediately or do you want to be overrun by sycophants and torn apart over a longer period of time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither outcome is good. Matter of fact, either outcome is the absolute worse that can happen to this country at this time.

       not removing people's content based upon their opinion.  As long as people follow the behavior based rules, they can post about any topic they wish.

       Do you realize that the very nature of conspiracy, in the meaning of this board, is that there's no proof or documentation to allow people to check these things off as "truth"?

       You do understand that, don't you?

       We've seen clearly that our information gatekeepers have decided that fact is whatever they get paid to parrot.

       There's more subs than just conspiracy and politics. Just go an r/all and you will see that there's way more higher voted subs than politics discussing  the Shit storm that's unfolding more and more each day.

       Very sad shit post.  Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.  Sure you're full of piss and vinegar, and a cup full of hubris, right now. but once she gets in then you'll have to live with it.  That one world government sounds just so grand doesn't it Mr. Shillmeister?  You're so smart, so funny, posting in Conspiracy.  Thinking you'll show us.  So here's a nice full cup of piping hot Fuck You.  Let's see how it all works out.  Her and her pedo chronies.  Better get a backbone and be ready to fight to the death for truth liberty and the American way,  It's coming motherfucker, so get ready you babyface piece of shit.  Guess what, in a year or two, maybe sooner, you'll be on our team Mr. FunnyHaHa. Just sayin'.

       Your claim was that this sub had been taken over based on the content and ratio of posts in a comparison to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . I was highlighting that you failed to acknowledge the significance of this being a conspiracy sub and that there is currently vastly more available conspiracy surrounding Hillary. Thereby it is only natural that users of this sub would increasingly post about Hillary, particularly as more controversy comes to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       I offered additional insight, hypothesis, and discussion points. You immediately attack back with insults, just because somebody didn't praise you for your unsubstantiated claims, logic, or numbers? k
