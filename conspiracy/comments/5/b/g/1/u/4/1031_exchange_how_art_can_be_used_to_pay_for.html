       I think it's pretty obvious to anyone who has taken the red pill that a certain Foundation has been used as a financial intermediary for foreign powers to purchase influence. Example: if you want a politician to take a particular stance on a policy matter, make a donation to their foundation to buy their influence, and get yourself a tax deductible receipt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The beauty of this scam is that when faced with accusations of bribery, you can defend it as charity.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can apply that same transaction principle to Art, using the 1031 Exchange Loophole. For those that want a deeper understanding:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All that should tell you is that Art can be used to muddy the waters of financial transactions. Art is money in that it is a store of value, medium of exchange, while being a rudimentary unit of account.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who want a TLDR version:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So the reasonable deduction from all of this rampant and unfounded hypothesizing I found myself engaging in was this: people are using this "art" to evade the tax man. It's simple: I sell you this bag of dog waste that Damien Koons scooped up from the gutter in the Bowery which is so relevant and your insurance agent assesses it at $1,000,000 and you have an instant non-taxable commodity. Okay - maybe it's taxable - but it's "art" so it falls through all kinds of loop holes. Then you turn around two years later and pass it onto your "friend" who happens to have an apartment in TriBeCa you want to buy. You two strike a deal in which you transfer the now famous bag of dog excrement to your friend for three million dollars and he sells you the apartment at a steep discount for one million. He saves on capital gains, you get a $4,000,000 apartment for $1,000,000; he owns the perceived value of the dogshit container, and your apartment is still worth four million on the books.
       </p>

       Art has become a financial intermediary for deferring capital gains taxes. While I don't know all the ins and outs, it's pretty clear that this type of transaction can be used to "muddy the waters" for the IRS.
      </p>

       If you want to understand this, consider that Tony Podesta is a patron of Biljana Djurdjevic:
      </p>

        http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you’ve ever dreamed of strolling through a museum with a slice of pizza and glass of wine in hand, you need to befriend superlobbyist Tony Podesta. Known about town as a legendary political “fix-it” man, Podesta has turned his Kalorama home into a shrine to contemporary art, ranging from relatively under-the-radar artists such as Serbian painter
        <strong>
         Biljana Djurdjevic
        </strong>
        to those who are much better known (like French sculptor Louise Bourgeois).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We also know the Clinton Foundation has made donations to Abromavic's art foundation.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'll leave it up to you to do your own google image searches for Biljana Djurdjevic's works, and while you do that, look up her 1998 Dentist Society series and recall the Dentist Chair in Epstein's house.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also consider that Epstein has a steady stream of Manhattan It Girls visiting him. Maybe they are former passengers of the Lolita Express, or maybe he is cultivating more artists to secure models who are willing to be exploited Eyes Wide Shut style in exchange for fame and fortune.

       Tying it all together, here's how to use art to pay for a spirit cooking party:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Recruit your handlers from the art world by nurturing artists and becoming their patron. Buy their dog shit at inflated values, then have that art assessed. You now have a tin of dog shit valued at $1 Million.
       </li>
       <li>
        Donate said tin of dog shit to a gallery. This helps cultivate your sponsored artist and increases the value of their work.
       </li>
       <li>
        Contact one of the artists you have been cultivating and commission a painting series of the victims you have recruited through modeling agencies, adoption networks or human trafficking rings.
       </li>
       <li>
        After the victims have become a subject of your art work, you do whatever it is you do to them. Pay the artist for the painting and keep it as a memento so you can re-live the experience.
       </li>
       <li>
        If you are supplying the victims to a buyer, put the painting up at an auction and invite the buyer to attend. If the buyer is successful in buying the artwork, they get their delivery (Translation: art auctions, in some cases are actually child auctions to those in the know).
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       While I have no smoking gun proof of anything, that's not what this sub is about. It's about pattern recognition and dot connecting. I hope this helps some of you understand what's going on here.
