        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you have never heard of this man I would suggest you take time to read his book Behold a Pale Horse, and listen to his radio broadcast &quot;The Hour of the Time&quot;.  Most of the radio broadcasts you can listen to for free here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hourofthetime.com/wordpresstest/milton-william-bill-cooper-mp3-collection/">http://www.hourofthetime.com/wordpresstest/milton-william-bill-cooper-mp3-collection/</a></p>

<p>His &quot;Mystery Babylon&quot; 40 episode radio series is the best piece of documented research into the history, the current and the future of civilization.  If you are interested into the mystery schools this is the place to start.  </p>

<p>To this day, on a weekly basis I will listen to old HOTT broadcasts and it still amazes me how much truth and honesty went into every show.</p>

<p>&quot;Listen to everyone, read everything, believe nothing unless you can prove it in your own research.&quot;</p>

<p>RIP William (Bill) Cooper, a real American Patriot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I get that. I see it almost as though he was told/used to put out such info. As if there are rules the elite must follow and giving notice of intent is one of them...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, nobody used him to put the info out there. His awakening came when he was on a submarine and witnessed a USO rising from the ocean. He reported it as he should&#39;ve because he was worried it was a security concern. They told him to keep his mouth shut. He started copying documents from that point on throughout his career. While I don&#39;t believe he was given real documents, I don&#39;t doubt that they were giving him fake documents to cause him misdirection, but they failed. Read &#39;Behold a Pale Horse&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I&#39;d met him! But, no. I&#39;ve watched all of his lectures and after reading his book, it&#39;s quite obvious that he was obtaining some very important information, but some of it, I believe, is false and was given to him to misdirect him. He knew they were coming for him and had sent his family somewhere safe before the government/LE/alphabet agency shot him on his own doorstep two months after 9/11, and left his body there for 11 hours. The 11 is very symbolic if you understand the elite&#39;s occult numeric codes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, do look into it. I don&#39;t know how he knew they were coming for him, but he made the right choice to get his family to a safe location. It&#39;s said that the FBI/LE agents were in a vehicle on a road adjacent to his property and they were acting like drunk college students, and when Cooper came out to tell them to leave, they opened fire on him. It&#39;s stated that his body was left there for that many hours because they believed he had land mines all over his property and they had to make sure the area was clean. So much for providing medical assistance... They sure did a hell of a job making sure a great patriot was never able to talk again.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, this is just a hypothetical, but couldn&#39;t that have all been exactly what &#39;they&#39; wanted you to see?

    <div class="md"><p>Could be, but in order for me to discuss this with you, you would&#39;ve had to have read &#39;Behold a Pale Horse&#39;. I&#39;m not trying to sound snooty, but it would be the only way to talk about the 5-10% of possible disinformation he was fed and why it doesn&#39;t fit the narrative. I truly believe they caught on to what he was doing very late in his career and their only recourse was to provide him with some disinfo, so it would look like all of his info was bunk. </p>
