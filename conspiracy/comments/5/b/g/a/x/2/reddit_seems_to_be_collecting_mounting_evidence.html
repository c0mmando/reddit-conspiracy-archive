       FBI can only gather evidence, which they present to the DOJ.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the DOJ may be implicated in this and are blocking it.

       interesting.  But still the that Post article mentions favors and financial corruption.  At this point, the only people claiming a sex ring are people on here and 4 chan.  While I believe a sex ring seems to be a horrific possibility based on everyones research on here, its odd to me, that financial corruption being the focus of the FBI's probe of the foundation could leak out but that a sex ring would not leak out.

       Man I don't know, this whole sex ring seems kinda "Lizard People" talk. Meanwhile, there's enough evidence to indict Clinton &amp; co at least for perjury in the already-published emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't doubt that the Clintons are into some really dark shit, but I really doubt we'd be so lucky for that particular "whopper" to be dropping right now.

       The key here is "the city of London."
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not talking about the city we know that's called London. Rather, it's The City of London, which is a fully autonomous city within a city.  Think Vatican City but without the religion.

       It's simple. The FBI cannot make a move, regardless of how much evidence they have, because in order to make any arrests they need warrants. To get a warrant, they need the cooperation of DoJ, which Lynch is getting in the way of.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a special prosecutor. For that, Lynch has to get out of the way, which she won't.

       It takes a lot of time to build a solid case. Bad guys with this kind of capital can afford ARMIES of expensive sleazy lawyers who will get everyone of these guys off the hook if the FBI makes one simple filing error.  Not only that but because this case involves children the feds are going to want to make sure they catch and nail every single person involved. Top to bottom. Give them time and don't put too much pressure on them.  The feds want Blood way more then we do.

       This sex trafficking is not just coming to light now. It's resurfaced every couple of years with different people discovering it for the first time. Each time it comes to light, it's shut down by the MSM and the public. Partially because every day people can't handle the truth of this matter, and because there are too many people that have important positions in our society that would be implicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all cover for each other because if one goes down, they all go down.
      </p>
      <p>
       A while ago PBS tried to do a documentary on the pedophile ring in the Vatican and it was shut down the day it was meant to air. Very rarely will MSM networks even mention it in passing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of people who have seen these things first hand. A lot of them are celebrities and they come forward all the time with news about it. Unfortunately a lot of it is so outlandish the average person will just think they're making up crazy stories to get media attention. How many former child actors/actresses have come forward making claims about these pedophile rings? The satanic sexual rituals they were forced to partake in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you guys remember what the MSM called "Satanic Panic" in the 80s? All those kids remembering childhood sexual abuse that had elements of satanism in them? Each case was shut down as false memory. This was a huge injustice to the victims, many of whom were placed in the same daycare centers as children. They came forward as adults and still no case would be brought against their abusers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of terrible pedophilia media on the internet -- and it's only a small snapshot of a much larger disturbing picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're ever going to combat this as a society, we can't shy away form hard topics. Yes its uncomfortable to imagine and talk about, but we have to or else it'll stay in the shadows and more children will be subjected to inhumane treatment.

       It's there, but you must suspend your disbelief. It's tough to absorb all of this as being real, but it is. Research Operation Ore and Operation Avalanche. Both involved arrests, but were terminated before anyone of any importance could be taken down. Why do you think that is?

       What do they have to make an arrest? Any pictures? Any videos? Any witnesses that can place them? Any phone conversations? Any emails specifically stating the crime? Any DNA? Any hard drives with child content? Any testimony from someone who has broken rank?

       It's there, and it would take me all day to outline and link every piece of evidence. There is collusion with terrorists, using the Clinton Foundation for money laundering, etc., etc. And I'm eagerly awaiting more solid evidence of child trafficking and abuse. Please take your blinders off. The evidence is there. If they start arrested lower level elites, they will hopefully start squealing on those above them.

       You say it's there but where is it? Show me the evidence. If there was evidence it would be posted by now. At best you have circumstantial evidence cobbled from this place and 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the tangible evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now disregarding the fact that even if true, you run the risk of a fruit of the poisonous tree, and the "evidence" being tossed, who is going to arrest and who is going to be the trier of fact and, if found guilty, how do we know they won't be let out the back door?

      <p>
       So no, it's not that I have blinders on. I don't. It's that I'm using logic and reason to form my thoughts. Again, do I believe they are pedos? Absolutely. Is the "evidence" presented evidence enough to get an indictment
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       a conviction? No.

      <p>
       I saw the e-mail for example, where that lady says she's going to bring her pre-teen children to a party with a heated pool and that they'd be "entertainment." Do I think that sounds like something fucked up? Absolutely. But if that were enough to convict someone of child rape, then we'd live in an incredibly fucked up system. Considering these peoples connections and ability to weasel out of shit, this kind of stuff doesn't even come close to being a smoking gun for fucking anything. How do you not understand this?

       I'm not a legal expert, but I believe that there is enough reasonable suspicion with what the FBI already knows about pedos and their symbols to get a judge to sign warrants and raid their homes. I'd start with Podesta's home. Alas, the longer they wait for warrants that include finding anything involving treason to child trafficking and abuse, the more likely it will be that the evidence at these locations will be flushed into the sewer systems. Please check out the following site for more information about what exactly is going on, why nobody wants to believe, and why evidence is so difficult to obtain.

      <p>
       *7. Why don’t we hear more about conviction of ritualized abuse crime?
      </p>
      <p>
       A. During trial once testimony is introduced about religious or ideology intolerance, or that the case encompasses a conspiracy theory, all evidence can be discounted.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. It is difficult to prosecute a case when there is no body (destroyed during the ceremony), no evidence (repressed memories of the crime often come back 20 or so years after the fact) or the murder victim cannot be identified.
      </p>
      <p>
       C. Credibility of witnesses is at risk when they are children or have fractured psyches (multiple personalities).
      </p>
      <p>
       D. Disinformation tactics are used to make people believe that there have been no convictions for abuse involving rituals or convictions have been based on hysteria and “witch hunt mentality.”*

       I'm into a lot of conspiracy stuff and find a lot of it very interesting. But the one thing that annoys me so much about the vast majority of "conspiracy theorists" is that they dramatize the hell out of everything. You can find endless clips on youtube of Alex Jones making predictions that didn't even come close to being true. And that's what conspiracy theorists constantly do; make erroneous and dramatic predictions that don't come true. Everything is monumental. Everything is the second coming. The biggest most intense cataclysmic "happening" is on its way, just you wait! "These psycho pedos and their satanic reptilian shit will come crumbling down, just you wait!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is much more subtle and grounded than that. These people won't be arrested, at least not for this. We'd be lucky if merely their reputations were harmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to calm down their stupid predictions if they want to be taken serious. Focus on the facts. And the facts are very obviously not in favor of having these people ever paying for this shit. Sad reality.

       See, you sound like a critical thinker and reader. The average Joe who is suckered by the likes of Jones and everyone else has itchy ears and can't think straight. There are multiple reasons for this (that go both ways) but critical thought and evaluation are being tossed out the window and sensationalism is embraced.
      </p>
      <p>
       And look at the vague shit they post. FBIanon, for example, was posting shit that was common knowledge, vague as fuck and called for the deportation of black people. Yet people ate his shit up. One guy told me he said that about blacks because of deniable plausibility. I then had to educate the guy on what that means and how it wasn't applicable.

       The downvote came as soon as I made the post. You did it. Doesn't matter as I have a lot to spare, just wanted to point that out to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "evidence" meaning everything that has been posted, is not enough to secure an arrest, indictment or conviction as it relates to the sexual exploitation and rape of children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at case precedent. Do you see anyone being convicted because some idiot said cheeseburger = blowjobs? No. What do you see when the pedo rings are busted? Video, pics, someone breaking ranks, DNA evidence, direct statements from those involved and other tangible evidence. If you don't have this you don't have evidence.
And let me be clear, YES, I believe they (trump included) are guilty of this.

       I have no reason to lie about down voting. What I see now is someone going on about jumping to conclusions when you're perfectly fine with doing it yourself. Show me the proof that I down voted you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, you just want to talk in circles and distract me some seeing more of the other stuff that's coming out. Please do your own research about Operation Ore (UK) and Operation Avalanche (US). Why do you think David Cameron called off Operation Ore before the authorities could arrest high ranking pedophiles?

       The proof is circumstantial. You and I are having a discussion, we disagree, we are replying in very close fashion and the downvotes are coming in between replies in a very fast fashion.

       As for distracting you, take your ass on to where you need to be. I'm not distracting you from doing a goddamn thing, lol. Go uncover more "evidence" about French fries and Snickers, whatever floats your boat.

       In regards to Op Ore and Op Av, I'm already read up on those. Guess what type of evidence they have?

       I suggest that you read this famous thread about how pedophile rings are actively protected by the highest levels of government:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/?st=iv72tvoc&amp;amp;sh=49121c50">
        [ORIGINAL RESEARCH] The Mountain of Evidence for a Massive International Pedophile Ring Protected by Police and Intelligence Agencies
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then,
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5beuza/not_a_drill_pedo_ring_busted_right_the_fuck_open/?st=iv7313vk&amp;amp;sh=85498699">
        read this thread
       </a>
       about how one of the pedo pizza places is connected to an official that works for the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit of the Department of Justice
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: The high-level people in a position to "do something about it" are most likely compromised. This is by design. The elite put pedophiles in high-levels positions because pedophiles are easily controlled through blackmail.

       interesting.  But still the that Post article mentions favors and financial corruption.  At this point, the only people claiming a sex ring are people on here and 4 chan.  While I believe a sex ring seems to be a horrific possibility based on everyones research on here, its odd to me, that financial corruption being the focus of the FBI's probe of the foundation could leak out but that a sex ring would not leak out.

       It's there, but you must suspend your disbelief. It's tough to absorb all of this as being real, but it is. Research Operation Ore and Operation Avalanche. Both involved arrests, but were terminated before anyone of any importance could be taken down. Why do you think that is?

       I'm into a lot of conspiracy stuff and find a lot of it very interesting. But the one thing that annoys me so much about the vast majority of "conspiracy theorists" is that they dramatize the hell out of everything. You can find endless clips on youtube of Alex Jones making predictions that didn't even come close to being true. And that's what conspiracy theorists constantly do; make erroneous and dramatic predictions that don't come true. Everything is monumental. Everything is the second coming. The biggest most intense cataclysmic "happening" is on its way, just you wait! "These psycho pedos and their satanic reptilian shit will come crumbling down, just you wait!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is much more subtle and grounded than that. These people won't be arrested, at least not for this. We'd be lucky if merely their reputations were harmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to calm down their stupid predictions if they want to be taken serious. Focus on the facts. And the facts are very obviously not in favor of having these people ever paying for this shit. Sad reality.
