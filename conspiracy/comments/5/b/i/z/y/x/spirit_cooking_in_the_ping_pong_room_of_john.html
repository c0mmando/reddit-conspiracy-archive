<p>SATANIC MUSIC AT COMET PING PONG</p>

<p>Amanda Kleinman deleted video evidence of herself performing in the ping pong room of Comet Ping Pong from her personal Youtube channel 3 days ago. Her performance was reuploaded by another Redditor: <a href="https://vimeo.com/190144149">https://vimeo.com/190144149</a></p>

<p>There are very disturbing, satanic music videos on her Youtube channel (NSFL):</p>

<p>Heavy Breathing addresses the faithful: <a href="https://youtu.be/og8okrj7otY">https://youtu.be/og8okrj7otY</a></p>

<p>Heavy Breathing &quot;Airtight&quot; album Indiegogo pitch: <a href="https://youtu.be/N_gGhrIO6ps">https://youtu.be/N_gGhrIO6ps</a></p>

<p>In the &quot;Airtight&quot; video, there&#39;s a collage of another pizza parlour + a photo of boys sitting at a table guarding their crotch + a bouncy castle @3.22. The background audio is: &quot;For 1,000 dollars we will play a show at the location of your choice up to an hour away from Washington DC.&quot; The music videos also include massive dildos &quot;penetrating&quot; cuddly toys etc. Sick stuff. </p>

<p>SATANIC ARTWORK AT COMET PING PONG</p>

<p>Arrington de Dionyso, the artist whose painting can be seen on the wall of the ping pong room exclusively paints occult artwork. A lot of paintings depict orgies and snakes. </p>

<p>His artwork in the &quot;ping pong room&quot; of Comet Ping Pong can be seen in this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/4GOluiqWYHU">https://youtu.be/4GOluiqWYHU</a> </p>

<p>Arrington de Dionyso on Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arringtondedionyso/">https://www.instagram.com/arringtondedionyso/</a> </p>

<p>Includes paintings of the devil with a decapitated child&#39;s head with the hashtag #RNC and other Spirit Cooking shit. He has a book of his paintings titled &quot;Swimming in the spirit world&quot;. </p>

<p>His paintings also depict the Ouroboros a lot, which is the snake in the Seal of Solomon. The Wikipedia page on Solomon speaks of masonic rituals in freemasonry: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon#Freemasonry">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon#Freemasonry</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK.  Thanks for that.  I was just reading some Freemasonry material and they mention the star and crescent.  I will keep reading to figure out the significance of it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating stuff, these people seem to deal in symbology and codes a lot since being too overt about it all would make it too obvious. What I still don&#39;t understand is how none of the regular visitors to Comet Ping Pong ever stopped to think about how the paintings on the walls were creepy and really not fitting of a room children play in. Then again, a lot of people don&#39;t tend to pay attention to their surroundings I suppose. Did you see the walk-in freezer post? Their comments are suspicious: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/86mWlT.png">https://i.sli.mg/86mWlT.png</a> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s more archived Instagram posts by James Alefantis referencing pedophelia, he set his account to private after we caught on, for good reason: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b1qtf/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/d9pb8j4/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b1qtf/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/d9pb8j4/?context=3</a></p>

<p>Another user has investigated Comet Ping Pong further and written a very thorough post yesterday: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bpa7c/breaking_from_the_anon_who_brought_you_the_laura/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bpa7c/breaking_from_the_anon_who_brought_you_the_laura/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rock videos are always weird, they&#39;re vague and abstract and you project your own shit onto them. That&#39;s the point of abstract, transgressive art like rock music. </p>

<p>I mean, that&#39;s like saying David Lynch is a satanic pedophile just because his movies are weird. Is Trent Reznor a crazy satanist because of the Closer video? No, he&#39;s just a successful creative and sober dude with a family and kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean internationally famous performance artist Marina Abromovic? Has the alt-right decided she&#39;s a satanist pedophile, lol? Is Laurie Anderson one too?</p>

<p>&quot;“I’m outraged, because this is taken completely out of my context,” Abramovic told me by phone this afternoon. She was at Sean Kelly Gallery, her rep in New York. The dinner, she explained, was a reward for donors to a Kickstarter campaign she had run. Tony Podesta has collected her work since the 1990s, and he attended, but John couldn’t make it. In fact, she has never met John Podesta.</p>

<p>“It was just a normal dinner,” Abramovic said, adding that about 10 people attended. “It was actually just a normal menu, which I call spirit cooking. There was no blood, no anything else. We just call things funny names, that’s all.” (The Kickstarter page advertised “traditional soups.”)</p>

<p>Spirit Cooking, Abramovic explained, was a performance she staged at a number of museums around the world in the ‘90s, painting graffiti with pigs’ blood. She also made a limited-edition book, which contains various recipes. That book is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, among other places.</p>

<p>And the Satanism charge? “Anybody who wants can read my memoirs and find out that [my work] is far away from Satanism,” she said. (The book was just released this week, she noted, and it’s doing well on Amazon.) </p>

<p>“My work is really more about spirituality and not anything else,” she continued. “I’ve been doing my work for so long, and this is a misunderstanding.” She said of the right-wing attacks, “It’s absolutely outrageous and ridiculous.”&quot;</p>
