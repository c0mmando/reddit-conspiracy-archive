       SATANIC MUSIC AT COMET PING PONG
      </p>
      <p>
       Amanda Kleinman deleted video evidence of herself performing in the ping pong room of Comet Ping Pong from her personal Youtube channel 3 days ago. Her performance was reuploaded by another Redditor:
       <a href="https://vimeo.com/190144149">
        https://vimeo.com/190144149
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are very disturbing, satanic music videos on her Youtube channel (NSFL):

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the "Airtight" video, there's a collage of another pizza parlour + a photo of boys sitting at a table guarding their crotch + a bouncy castle @3.22. The background audio is: "For 1,000 dollars we will play a show at the location of your choice up to an hour away from Washington DC." The music videos also include massive dildos "penetrating" cuddly toys etc. Sick stuff.

       SATANIC ARTWORK AT COMET PING PONG
      </p>
      <p>
       Arrington de Dionyso, the artist whose painting can be seen on the wall of the ping pong room exclusively paints occult artwork. A lot of paintings depict orgies and snakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       His artwork in the "ping pong room" of Comet Ping Pong can be seen in this video:

      <p>
       Includes paintings of the devil with a decapitated child's head with the hashtag #RNC and other Spirit Cooking shit. He has a book of his paintings titled "Swimming in the spirit world".
      </p>
      <p>
       His paintings also depict the Ouroboros a lot, which is the snake in the Seal of Solomon. The Wikipedia page on Solomon speaks of masonic rituals in freemasonry:

       I saw some symbols on the Comet Ping Pong sign and I was wondering what they are for.  I think they are the star and crescent, which have meaning in Freemasonry.  Anybody else know more about this?

       Not sure about freemasonry but it's also the symbol of Islam. Considering Mohammed married a 6yr old and consumated the marriage at 9 it would be fitting.

       OK.  Thanks for that.  I was just reading some Freemasonry material and they mention the star and crescent.  I will keep reading to figure out the significance of it.

       It seems to be a lot of ritual, secrecy, and code words.  There is a lot of underlying meaning to things, like words and symbols.

       Fascinating stuff, these people seem to deal in symbology and codes a lot since being too overt about it all would make it too obvious. What I still don't understand is how none of the regular visitors to Comet Ping Pong ever stopped to think about how the paintings on the walls were creepy and really not fitting of a room children play in. Then again, a lot of people don't tend to pay attention to their surroundings I suppose. Did you see the walk-in freezer post? Their comments are suspicious:

       Here's more archived Instagram posts by James Alefantis referencing pedophelia, he set his account to private after we caught on, for good reason:

       Another user has investigated Comet Ping Pong further and written a very thorough post yesterday:

       I could've asked you the same thing, haha. Google says the hashtag can mean "What would Donald Judd do?". It appears he's an artist known for minimalism:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Judd">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Judd
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So that comment would make sense in the context of the photo and looks to be an innocent art reference I'd say.

       Did you see the music video filmed at Comet Ping Pong?  Someone is wearing the Shriner fez hat.

       Rock videos are always weird, they're vague and abstract and you project your own shit onto them. That's the point of abstract, transgressive art like rock music.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, that's like saying David Lynch is a satanic pedophile just because his movies are weird. Is Trent Reznor a crazy satanist because of the Closer video? No, he's just a successful creative and sober dude with a family and kids.

       You cannot tie Trent Reznor in with any of this because he has nothing to do with it. These fucking creeps are connected to all of this. If you haven't been reading any of the investigative threads on the chans then you probably don't get it, but this shit is fucking insanity, and it is what it looks like. This isn't some "Trendy hipster" bull shit trying to be provocative and it just makes me mad when people are trying to defend this shit.

       No, L'Enfant means "The child" in french. Another comment mentions "It must be a reference to the L'Enfant Cafe and Bar:
       <a href="http://www.lenfantcafe.com/">
        http://www.lenfantcafe.com/
       </a>
       (and also the Insta is geo'ed there) meaning the photo was taken outside of that cafe. So that's the most reasonable interpretation."

       If you're going to discredit all the other information in that post based on that, you either have an agenda or you just don't want to hear it.

       Seriously? L'enfant simply means "the child" in french language. Let that guy wear a t-shirt with the cafes logo if he pleases, let the café be named after an architect, who cares. That's still not a reason to ignore all the other info in that post.

       L'enfant and L'Enfant are different in French. The capital E means a proper noun like a name.

       Yes, the guy is simply wearing a t-shirt with the café’s logo on it. Even the OP replied "Thanks for the context, I was wondering what the picture really referenced." when another commenter figured out the t-shirt was about that bar (because there was initially a confusion about "J'adore l'enfant" and "J'adore les enfants" (plural).

       I listen to a lot of music, used to listen to a lot of doom and black metal in the past and I've honestly never seen music videos on that level of fucked-upness before.

       EDIT: I'm not saying the artists themselves are satanic pedophiles. I'm saying this is the kind of stuff that goes down in the ping pong room (where children play) of John Podesta's favorite pizza restaurant. Don't you think that's even just a little bit weird?

       I disagree, those videos are a lot weirder than anything Bowie ever come up with. Watch the live performance that the artist deleted from her channel as soon as the spirit cooking thing broke. Doesn't remind of of Manson or Bowie in the slightest.

       The evidence in this particular case is that there's occult artwork on the walls of a ping pong room in a pizza restaurant, they have occult bands play there in the evening, and this place is referenced in a lot of Wikileaks emails. Considering the other spirit cooking evidence, I think this is noteworthy.

       You mean internationally famous performance artist Marina Abromovic? Has the alt-right decided she's a satanist pedophile, lol? Is Laurie Anderson one too?
      </p>
      <p>
       "“I’m outraged, because this is taken completely out of my context,” Abramovic told me by phone this afternoon. She was at Sean Kelly Gallery, her rep in New York. The dinner, she explained, was a reward for donors to a Kickstarter campaign she had run. Tony Podesta has collected her work since the 1990s, and he attended, but John couldn’t make it. In fact, she has never met John Podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       “It was just a normal dinner,” Abramovic said, adding that about 10 people attended. “It was actually just a normal menu, which I call spirit cooking. There was no blood, no anything else. We just call things funny names, that’s all.” (The Kickstarter page advertised “traditional soups.”)
      </p>
      <p>
       Spirit Cooking, Abramovic explained, was a performance she staged at a number of museums around the world in the ‘90s, painting graffiti with pigs’ blood. She also made a limited-edition book, which contains various recipes. That book is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, among other places.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Satanism charge? “Anybody who wants can read my memoirs and find out that [my work] is far away from Satanism,” she said. (The book was just released this week, she noted, and it’s doing well on Amazon.)
      </p>
      <p>
       “My work is really more about spirituality and not anything else,” she continued. “I’ve been doing my work for so long, and this is a misunderstanding.” She said of the right-wing attacks, “It’s absolutely outrageous and ridiculous.”"

       The artists themselves probably just like occult stuff, that doesn't mean they're involved in satanic rituals. It's just art after all. The connection is that claims which were previously totally outrageous, such as the one of Cathy O'Brien saying Hillary raped her in a satanic ritual (would've never believed it before) suddenly have a lot more merit since we now know about "spirit cooking" and that they're obviously into weird occult stuff. Which we would've never found out without Wikileaks.

       Between that and yournewswire, a site whose purpose is to satirically troll conspiracy theorists... your answer is you've lost the plot.

       It's about piecing together the puzzle and seeing the big picture. If Hillary hadn't been so careless about her email server we wouldn't even know about Comet Ping Pong in the first place.

       The evidence in this particular case is that there's occult artwork on the walls of a ping pong room in a pizza restaurant, they have occult bands play there in the evening, and this place is referenced in a lot of Wikileaks emails. Considering the other spirit cooking evidence, I think this is noteworthy.

       Seriously? L'enfant simply means "the child" in french language. Let that guy wear a t-shirt with the cafes logo if he pleases, let the café be named after an architect, who cares. That's still not a reason to ignore all the other info in that post.
