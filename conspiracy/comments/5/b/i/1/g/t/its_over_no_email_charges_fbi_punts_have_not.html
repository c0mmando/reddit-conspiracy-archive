       If we

       "charged those cannons" then we wouldn't be worried about whether Comey said this or that.  Wouldn't matter cuz WE'RE on it.  However, we didn't "charge" shit.  We've kept sitting on our asses waiting for others to do shit we should be coming together as one citizenry and doing ourselves.  But no.  Therefore, so long as we're not doing what's necessary, we should neither get too surprised or discouraged when shit doesn't go well for the 99% and TPTB continue manipulating the public.

       Wrong fucking answer, man.  That’s the best you can do?  Try to come back with a statement like that?  How exactly is that changing the fact that neither you nor I nor anyone else - like I already said - is coming together and DOING SOMETHING against this shit system?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does saying something like that somehow make your ego feel better?  Well, good.  Unfortunately, however, it doesn’t do shit to the fact that, as I said above, there are exactly ZERO “cannons getting charged”, as you said above.  My point is don’t say those things because we haven’t charged ANY cannons as a population yet.  You haven’t done so as an individual, and we haven’t done so as a citizenry.  So that’s just
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       empty talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don’t give a fuck
       <em>
        who’s
       </em>
       “laughing at the Anti-hilary [sic] community”.  The Clinton, the Trump, the Obama, the GOVERNMENT community is fucked and corrupt…and literally
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       can “laugh” at me if they want for saying that.  It’s still the truth.  Doesn’t matter how anyone reacts to it.

       What?  What the fuck are you talking about with this horrendously bad straw man that you just so shabbily built?  Wow.  It's like you didn't even try to be accurate with your false characterization.  Really sad actually.

       You're trying WAY too hard, little one.  And it makes you look

       bad.

       I agree 100%.  All it takes tho is ONE GUY in the FBI with a decent position and of course perspective to decide he will sacrifice his career (and of course, possibly his future and safety....) to contact the press and say, "Listen, we ALL know xyz and pushed for abc but were refused...." ... I doubt it will happen but, hey, who thought 8 days ago we'd have the initial re-open announcement.

       Im not sure- but I'll answer when you expand on "give them time to build a case" ... are you or are you not aware in 48 hours, maybe 50-52 hrs really, the election will be over?  Do you suggest "a case" will "be built" in that time, or you're suggesting, AFTER Hilary becomes president, something will happen ?  Both are fantasy, I'm just trying to understand the source of your delusions.

       If we
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       "charged those cannons" then we wouldn't be worried about whether Comey said this or that.  Wouldn't matter cuz WE'RE on it.  However, we didn't "charge" shit.  We've kept sitting on our asses waiting for others to do shit we should be coming together as one citizenry and doing ourselves.  But no.  Therefore, so long as we're not doing what's necessary, we should neither get too surprised or discouraged when shit doesn't go well for the 99% and TPTB continue manipulating the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what's gonna CONTINUE to happen, and we're dumb fucks if we don't come together and move forward but expect positive results to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit ain't gonna fix itself in this country.  We have to come together and do it.  Together.
