    <div class="md"><p>The FBI clearly serves the elite now, not the people nor the Constitution. They will gleefully grind us under the heel of the law for small infractions while the elite get away with anything. I used to have great respect for the FBI. I met several during a class on handling mass casualties. I hate thinking they are now bowing to the wishes of the rich and corrupt. A sad day for the world. I hold on to a thin hope they are playing some long-game and will soon do the right thing. But that hope is rapidly fading. :-/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think anytime there is a pyramid hierarchy, the few at the top are the weak links. They give the orders to the masses that depend on their jobs, so they only need to threaten or intimidate 1 or 2 at the top. I think it&#39;ll be worse now that technology is out there to create fake video evidence that is indistinguishable from the real thing.  </p>

<p>Not sure if there&#39;s an easy solution to that given human characteristics.  The only thing I can think of is a parliament or senate type setup with no single veto voices and very short term limits, like 2 years, and have 24/7 knowledge of everything they do for that 2 years. Get rid of presidents, prime ministers, kings and queens. The only people willing to do it would be good honest people who care. But I think it&#39;s too late now. Maybe the next empire will learn from our mistakes.</p>
