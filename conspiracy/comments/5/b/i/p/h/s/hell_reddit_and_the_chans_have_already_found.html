       Or maybe their little game is "it's not FBI jurisdiction". So maybe the election commission or the IRS? What happened to this story?

       They can't investigate TPTB. Expect just smoke signals and a few token heads to roll then the organization starts right back where it left off.

       I have no faith any of the other FBI investigations will turn out any different than the email investigation. The will find she didn't MEAN to spend millions on Chelsi's wedding. She didn't MEAN to not report millions in gifts from foreign governments. She didn't MEAN to violate election law.

       I wish we could get the lefties upset about Clinton privilege like they are about white and male privilege. But too many are like my uncle and his family - as long as she doesn't kill the Pope they'll vote for her.

       Perhaps some state law enforcement agencies could try to go after the portion of the crimes that fall in their jurisdiction. I hate "asset forfeiture" laws, but I would love to see them applied to the Clinton criminal enterprise. Then again, I'm sure the state politicians would fear the repercussions and stop any such inventions.

       The FBI clearly serves the elite now, not the people nor the Constitution. They will gleefully grind us under the heel of the law for small infractions while the elite get away with anything. I used to have great respect for the FBI. I met several during a class on handling mass casualties. I hate thinking they are now bowing to the wishes of the rich and corrupt. A sad day for the world. I hold on to a thin hope they are playing some long-game and will soon do the right thing. But that hope is rapidly fading. :-/

       I think anytime there is a pyramid hierarchy, the few at the top are the weak links. They give the orders to the masses that depend on their jobs, so they only need to threaten or intimidate 1 or 2 at the top. I think it'll be worse now that technology is out there to create fake video evidence that is indistinguishable from the real thing.

       Not sure if there's an easy solution to that given human characteristics.  The only thing I can think of is a parliament or senate type setup with no single veto voices and very short term limits, like 2 years, and have 24/7 knowledge of everything they do for that 2 years. Get rid of presidents, prime ministers, kings and queens. The only people willing to do it would be good honest people who care. But I think it's too late now. Maybe the next empire will learn from our mistakes.
