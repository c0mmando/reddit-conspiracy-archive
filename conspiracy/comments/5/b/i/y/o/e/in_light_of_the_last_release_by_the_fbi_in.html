       This country is dead and full of nothing but brainwashed cowards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I wish someone would nuke this shithole and end every living being in the US as the citizens are not even willing to oppose the criminals currently attempting to enslave the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am beyond disgusted.  I cant even put it into words.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I love all the people who are crying here about this not being the answer.  I am not speaking in any way of going out looting and destroying.   That does nothing but harm.   I am talking about about a UNIFIED group of millions that cannot be destroyed, ignored, dismembered, fragmented or broken apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       It works for other countries, but the fact remains in the united states,  We are either too comfortable to care, or too broke to be able to take the time to do something like this when it would destroy any thing we have in life.   We are divided just as they want us to be so something like THIS cannot happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If even 5 percent of the country decided to take a stand and march on Washington calling for the dismemberment and destruction of the corrupt regime in place.  CHANGE WOULD BE FORCED TO HAPPEN.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this will not occur,   1/4th of the people are too comfortable.  The others are in a position where this would destroy them.   And on top of that most correctly believe the government in place would happily destroy them for no other reason then attempting to change it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would happily throw the shit life I have away to end this perversion of justice, but let's break something down quick..... This goes out to all the people who are asking why i'm not doing anything and instead complaining on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say I had the funds and time to actually attempt to organize this...    Of the first 50 people I get,   1 or 2 would be members of the government here for no other reason to end what i'm doing.    Someone with no political clout attempting this would be branded a terrorist and wind up in a prison no one has heard of in a foreign country within a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       So keep yapping bitches,  at least i'm enraged beyond more then a simple,   Well fuck.....there goes another piece of America,   like most everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had to edit.   Rage turns my sentence structure into a hellish miasma of incoherency.

       Refreshing this post constantly is hilarious, the upvotes and downvotes come so fast its amazing.

       On surreality scale, Iraq II was greater. Folks watching entry into WWI might have been equally wtf'd. Sherman's march might have been the test or maybe the Inquisition.

       Riots are meaningless if what you mean is vandalising other citizens' property and setting things on fire. If someone wants to get rowdy, do it on the white house lawn. They're the ones who have screwed you over.

       Furthermore, how will any form of protest, that may have worked in the 20th century, going to work in the 21st? We have evidence in the case, right now, about dropping an agent to incite violence, as a call to action for the police. Weren't they doing this in the Occupy Movement as well?

       How many important things in life are done perfectly or successfully the very first time they're attempted?  Almost none.  Ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because a movement didn't work once, it doesn't mean it's not worth continuing to work and doing it again and again and again - better and better.  Until you succeed and your goal is achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
       OWS was definitely a step in the right direction.  Doesn't matter that it didn't go "perfectly" the first time.

       The new form of protest has to be information and economic warfare. Hit them where it hurts. Unfortunately none of us can do it effectively when the government has several intelligence agencies and the backing of corporations.

       I'm afraid I must disagree. Burn down ten houses and what happens? That's ten families who won't suck the system's dick to live there any more. Burn down one business and guess what? That's a whole roster of unemployed workers who can flip shit now because they have 40 more hours of free time and no job to lose. Is it fair? Fuck no! None of this shit is fair! But is it necessary? You tell me, buddy.

       Are you kidding me right now? You want to burn some family's home because they "suck the system's dick" and what exactly do you think they'll do after losing their homes, all their possessions and maybe a few family members? You're speaking the enemy's language right now. Anyone can see that. If you don't love the people of this country, you're as useless as the monsters who we're trying to fight in the first place.

       If you do not mind. I want to post this here for visibility. Found on OP's history. " Im willing to pretty much do anything that will keep a roof over me and my cat" Is what sticks out. He asks about riots then replies to 0 comments.

       "Greetings! I'm a 38 year old white male, with a Bengal cat, 5k in high end mmj grow gear, lots of skills and heart of gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life has fallen apart. im soon to be homeless, My story is a cautionary tale about the downsides of helping others . I have 20 years experience in search and rescue, backpacking, spelunking, high end landscape work, Carpentry, Operating heavy equipment, Demolition, PC repair, networking, maintenance, growing top of the line MMJ, Warehouse work, manufacturing, property caretaking, I can do it all. There is pretty much no occupation i do not have experience in.
      </p>
      <p>
       My life in WA has been hell. And I need a change. Im willing to pretty much do anything that will keep a roof over me and my cat, I dont care what. At this point anything would be better then what im currently in. I had to rent a room from methheads who are going to jail, im sick of the filth, theft, drugs, and the rest of the things im forced to live around. I need to be away from the people that put me into this position.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are looking for a positive, upbeat person with skills, no drug or alcohol issues and no bad habits, that can preform any task well, Im your man.

       I have a pretty unique life and story, if you are interested give me a holler."

An as nottheoretical stated, it is not other peoples property that should be damaged because it is not their fault.

       Exactly, it's idiotic to attack your own community when (supposedly) you're fighting For them. I can't imagine this happens as an organic response to establishment injustice nearly as often as we're led to believe.

       Well, to be sure, there absolutely SHOULDN'T be any riots whatsoever regardless of the situation in this country.  Riots won't help.  What you should have instead said is that you can't believe how there hasn't been a REVOLT.
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       should most definitely have long happened by now.  And it doesn't have to be a violent revolt either.  It can be very effective and non violent if enough people come together.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why hasn't there been a citizen revolt?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well...because we've allowed ourselves to have our intelligence, our power, our togetherness, and our solidarity taken from us.  We've become disorganized, united, dumbed-down sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why.

       You haven't proven anything false.  Trump is controlled opposition and a long time friend of the clintons who donated money to them and considered himself a democrat.  But yeah whatever, I'm sure all those things magically changed over the course of 2 years when he decided to run, after bill clinton told him to.

       If you haven't noticed the most recent riots have been lawless groups counter productively rioting and destroying their own neighborhoods against a system they voted for. Even though riots seem to be fairly common now, the Hillary decision doesn't stir this same group. You can trust your law and order citizens to take a smarter approach which may or may not stop at peaceful protests.

       Well yea, but so what?  Its pretty much always been that way.  I mean, there's a reason they call the masses 'sheep' - they like to conform for the sake of security, to keep their egos safe.  It takes a lot of guts and self-respect to really stand up for yourself and work for a better life.  People love and revere people like Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Abraham Lincoln; but what happened to them?  Each was considered controversial during their time, vehemently opposed, and eventually shot and killed.  People's egos don't forget that last part, in particular, very easily.

       But just because the world keeps its eyes shut, doesn't mean you have to.  Look at men like Albert Einstein, who devoted himself to his passion of science even while his country floundered under Nazi rule in the 30s.  Or Andrew Carnegie, who came to America dirt poor after his family has literally starved in Scotland, to become one of the richest industrialists in the 19th century.   Or Condoleeza Rice, who broke pretty much every racial and gender stereotype by becoming a concert pianist, going to great schools and later gaining presidential influence.  All of these people lived their destinies and fulfilled themselves, even when the rest of the world stayed stagnant.  So why let the world and foolish people hold you back? That's not to say you should be selfish - those people may have even wanted to help the world, but if the world refuses to be helped, you can impersonally leave it behind and move on in your own life, and only help those who want to be helped.  Who's to say that life is about saving the world anyway?  Maybe the worlds not meant to be perfect; maybe life is a testing ground for each person to rise up into their own destiny.  I think the sooner we can accept this and steer our own lives, helping others but not depending on results, things work out for the best.

       That's what the elections are all about. If its a landslide for trump then they no longer have the people divided against each other. And that also means they know we have united and are coming for their heads next.

       How to tell if you're a Brainwashed Dem Zombie....
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask them "Are you really ok with Obama Care Premiums as high as your Mortgage?"
      </p>
      <p>
       If they answer: "OH yeah Obama's got our backs!" You're talking to a Dem Zombie.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they answer: "Fuck no, our government is made up of crooks" you're talking to a normal intelligent human being that's awake.
