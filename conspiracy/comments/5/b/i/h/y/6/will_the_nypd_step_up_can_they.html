    <div class="md"><p>Only the highest level people would have ever been in a position to see or copy this stuff. And guess how people get to high level positions. You already know how much money and lead the Clintons are willing to throw around to get what they want.</p>

<p>Suppose by chance a low-level guy was able to get close enough to this stuff to copy it. How many times do you think the faces of his children flashed in front of his eyes as he logged in to copy it to his computer and send it to someone, as he composed the message he was sending with it, as it slowly uploaded.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how conspiracies stay hidden for decades. And most of them forever.</p>

<p>waaaaaaaaaaaaa machines therefore impossible</p>

<p>YOU CANNOT CONTROL AN ENTIRE COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE WITH TANKS, JETS, BATTLESHIPS OR ANY OF THAT.</p>

<p>A fighter jet cannot stand on street corners and enforce no assembly edicts. A fighter jet cannot kick down your door at 3 AM to search your house for contraband material or antisocial propaganda. A fighter jet is useless for maintaining a police state. Police are needed to maintain a police state. And no matter how many police you have, they are always outnumbered by the people, which is why it’s important for your police to have automatic weapons and your people to have nothing but their limp dicks.</p>

<p>But when every random pedestrian might have a Glock jammed in his waistband, kicking down those doors becomes a lot fucking riskier, lest you catch a bullet on your way in.</p>

<p>America has a small standing professional army. (I’m using the term “army” to refer to the entirety of the Department of Defense) of 1,456,862 personnel and 1,458,500 reserve. They are probably the best-funded, best-trained, and best-equipped fighting force in the world today and the best which has ever existed in raw technological killing power.</p>

<p>There are 311,591,917 people in the US, of which 73,270,043 are males age 18-49. There are also 90 guns every 100 persons in the US. Now, even assuming every one of those million and a half active members of the armed forces are trained infantry grunts (pro tip: they aren’t), how well do you think they will do against 73 FUCKING TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER?</p>

<p>Even assuming there would be no defection or desertion among the armed forces, they are still massively outnumbered and outgunned by an enemy they can’t tell apart from their supporters. We’re getting good at it, but not good enough.</p>

<p>Al-Qaida and the Taliban ran us ragged for more than a decade with muskets used by illiterate goat herders and a few well-connected, college-educated fanatics in their leadership. Why? Because they hid among people we were told NOT to kill, and so were allowed to win. The only way to win against them is to slaughter them all, and while that should be done there, it couldn’t be done here in a civil war scenario. The US is a technologically advanced society completely saturated with the Internet and the advances of modern manufacturing. Nearly military grade weapons are the most common rifle here.</p>

<p>Go ahead and try to stop an armed insurrection.</p>
