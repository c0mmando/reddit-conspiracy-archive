I can&#39;t wait for all the millions of Trumpettes to know what it felt like to have the primary stolen, because maybe then we will get off our asses (I include myself) and take to the streets over this shit.</p>

<p>Do you know even 10 people who plan to vote Clinton?  So how&#39;s she plan to win?  Exactly as she did in the primaries.  Her bankers will buy it for her.</p>
