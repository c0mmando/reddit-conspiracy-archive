       For years I believed that presidents were selected and not elected. I haven't voted based on this for 12 years. This time around, for some reason, I actually thought that democracy and justice would prevail. Boy was I ever wrong.

       Clinton will be selected president. We are all doomed.

       It was dead at least in 2000.  Trump people will hopefully not take this lying down.  I can't wait for all the millions of Trumpettes to know what it felt like to have the primary stolen, because maybe then we will get off our asses (I include myself) and take to the streets over this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know even 10 people who plan to vote Clinton?  So how's she plan to win?  Exactly as she did in the primaries.  Her bankers will buy it for her.

       Definitely give that up.  If they cared about facts, they'd  have been looking that up long before now. If they're still under the spell of the media, don't be mad at them for it. It's really no more their fault than it was yours when you still were.

       I just can't break through to these people. And when I see they are catching on or seeing the light, they slip right back under the spell and I'm made out to be the bad guy wearing a tin foil hat. I just can't do it anymore. Ive done what I can and now its up to higher powers to sort this all out. Ive voted and I am happy with that decision, however I really dont think that it will matter. The recent FBI hocus pocus has proven they are all bought and paid for.

       It's okay, it's not your job to break through to them. Nobody broke through to me but one day I began to look at the evidence that is laid out before all of us differently. For most people it has to happen on a personal level. And you can bet that with all the buzzing right now it is happening to several people. Don't stop buzzing now.

       Dude, look at it as a vindication. You were right all along, you just temporarily allowed yourself to hope. Nothing wrong with that, you're only human. I've been expecting Hilary for the next president since before she stepped down at state. I'm looking at Tuesday as a test to see whether my model of how this all works is accurate or not. I'd been doubting myself a bit the last week or so, but not for long. For the record, I'd vote Stein if I could vote.
The election isn't the end of the road. Who knows what will turn up?

       Trump is going to win the popular vote.  The polls will not agree, and HRC will be president.  You will be madder than you've ever been.  That's my prediction.

       I'm not saying this with glee, I'm saying it because it is fact.

       But a lot of you (us, I'm still undecided between trump and Stein) Trump people have guns!!  So let's get out there and get mad!

       The last day of America was December 22, 1913.  It was corrupted, off and on, in the century before that day, but that is when America was truly lost.

       I think we will completely fall once Hillary allows all the refugees to come here. Not all refugees are bad obviously but enough to spread out and cause collateral damage with better calculated terror attacks. Once we are infiltrated, we will completely lose the democratic process, mass terror attacks all around the country, and the only way to "protect" freedom and safety of Americans will be martial law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope I'm wrong though.

       Dude, look at it as a vindication. You were right all along, you just temporarily allowed yourself to hope. Nothing wrong with that, you're only human. I've been expecting Hilary for the next president since before she stepped down at state. I'm looking at Tuesday as a test to see whether my model of how this all works is accurate or not. I'd been doubting myself a bit the last week or so, but not for long. For the record, I'd vote Stein if I could vote.
The election isn't the end of the road. Who knows what will turn up?

       It's okay, it's not your job to break through to them. Nobody broke through to me but one day I began to look at the evidence that is laid out before all of us differently. For most people it has to happen on a personal level. And you can bet that with all the buzzing right now it is happening to several people. Don't stop buzzing now.
