        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are a ton of new truth seekers out there. That&#39;s great, people get it, they know something is deeply rotten about this world. But so many are still, more-or-less, buying into the legitimacy of the system. Even though these scandals are erupting people are cognitively shutting down and going into a protective fear stance. We&#39;re conditioned to respond in this way. We instinctively long for a parental figure like Daddy Trump to keep the bad men away. If you only understand one thing, let it be this: there are no protectors, no father figures,  no saviours, no Jesus coming down to dry your tears, no aliens to rescue you. There is only you. You are the last line of defense. Only you stand between tyranny and freedom. And it doesn&#39;t matter if you win or lose as long as you do what you know in your heart.</p>

<p>Now get up and promise yourself that you will never let your choices be co-opted by anyone. Never let anyone convince you to trade in your sovereignty, your birthright for any temporary material arrangement be especially wary of conditional love. Love doesn&#39;t have strings attached, it just is. Let this idea be your island in the storm. Remember &#39;ideas are bulletproof&#39;.</p>

<p>This is how we move forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The primary reason why the individual citizens of a country create a political structure is a subconscious wish or desire to perpetuate their own dependency relationship of childhood. Simply put, they want a human god to eliminate all risk from their life, pat them on the head, kiss their bruises, put a chicken on every dinner table, clothe their bodies, tuck them into bed at night, and tell them that everything will be alright when they wake up in the morning.</p>

<p>This public demand is incredible, so the human god, the politician, meets incredibility with incredibility by promising the world and delivering nothing. So who is the bigger liar? the public? or the &quot;godfather&quot;?</p>

<p>This public behavior is surrender born of fear, laziness, and expediency. It is the basis of the welfare state as a strategic weapon, useful against a disgusting public. </p>
