<p><strong>1. Derivation and Definition of a Linear Aircraft Model&#39; -Published August 1988, by the Ames Research Center.</strong>

<p><em>&quot;This report derives and defines a set of linearized system matrices for a rigid aircraft of constant mass, flying in a stationary atmosphere over a flat, nonrotating earth.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>2. The Engineering Analysis and Design of the Aircraft Dynamics Model For the FAA Target Generation Facility</strong>

<p><em>&quot;The observant reader will notice that the aircraft equations of motion were calculated assuming a flat Earth and that we here assume the development frame was the North-East-Down frame. This implies necessarily that earth rotation and the variation of the
gravity vector with position over the earth were ignored in developing the aircraft equations of motion. This simplification limits our mathematical model to the flight of aircraft only. The model will not properly handle the flight of sub-orbital craft and
spacecraft such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, satellites, or the space shuttle. The model is adequate for all vehicles traveling under Mach 3.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s still as stupid as everyone thinks.</p>

<p>The paragraph after the summary explains exactly what this is... If you would have bothered to read it, it states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The need for linear models of aircraft for the analysis of vehicle dynamics and control law design is well known. These models are widely used, not only for computer applications but also for quick approximations and desk calculations. Whereas the use of these models is well understood and well documented, their derivation is not. The lack of documentation and, occasionally, understanding of the derivation of linear models is a hindrance to communication, training, and application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s basically a simple white paper on how to construct a model. A model, if you don&#39;t know what it is, is a simplified description, especially a mathematical one, of a system or process, to assist calculations and predictions. Key word here is simplified. Sure, you could build a really complicated model that takes everything into account, but for a lot of calculations a simple one that ignores negligible effects is good enough. </p>

<p>This document shows you how to construct a simple model for aircraft flight. Simple models are used all the time, such as the ones that assume masses are just points with no volume or models that ignore the effects of atmospheric resistance. That doesn&#39;t mean objects have no volume or there is no such thing as air resistance. It also doesn&#39;t mean that the fucking earth is flat. </p>

<p>The second is the exact same thing. A white paper for a simple model that ignores a lot of the more complex variables of the problem. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you arrived at those == flat earth, as simple reading and english comprehension makes both of your sources extremely easy to read and understand. Nowhere does it even suggest flat earth. All it says is that the curvature of the earth and air resistance of a moving atmosphere are not calculated or represented in this particular model. A lot of the times, the effects are simply negligible, thus no need to include them in the model. It&#39;s still important to outline everything that you include in the model and what is not included in your calculations, thus citing the parameters used.</p>

<p>edit: Have you ever seen a Lunar Eclipse? How would you explain this using your Flat Earth model theory? Do you own a telescope? Why would nearly every other celestial body be observably spherical and rotate, and Earth is some magical exception?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct, and what is the reason there is &quot;wind&quot; coming in? The stationary air drags along the car. Space is almost a vacuum, meaning this wouldn&#39;t happen to earth when leaving the surface of a rotating sphere. Your argument about the plane having to fly against 1000mph winds makes no sense. </p>

<p>Also,take a plane on a clear day and you can see it for yourself.</p>

<p>VS</p>

<p>Earth (otherwise known as the world,[n 5] in Greek: Γαῖα Gaia,[n 6] or in Latin: Terra[26]) is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System&#39;s four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.</p>

<p>According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago.[27][28][29] Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon. During one orbit around the Sun, Earth rotates about its axis 366.26 times, creating 365.26 solar days or one sidereal year.[n 7] Earth&#39;s axis of rotation is tilted 23.4° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane, producing seasonal variations on the planet&#39;s surface within a period of one tropical year (365.24 solar days).[30] The Moon is the Earth&#39;s only permanent natural satellite; their gravitational interaction causes ocean tides, stabilizes the orientation of Earth&#39;s rotational axis, and gradually slows Earth&#39;s rotational rate.[31]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a relevant part of the wiki that explains why you&#39;re wrong about the thermosphere requiring special materials.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The highly diluted gas in this layer can reach 2,500 °C (4,530 °F) during the day. Even though the temperature is so high, one would not feel warm in the thermosphere, because it is so near vacuum that there is not enough contact with the few atoms of gas to transfer much heat. A normal thermometer might be significantly below 0 °C (32 °F), at least at night, because the energy lost by thermal radiation would exceed the energy acquired from the atmospheric gas by direct contact. In the anacoustic zone above 160 kilometres (99 mi), the density is so low that molecular interactions are too infrequent to permit the transmission of sound.</p>

<li><p>The astronauts and ISS are insulated, that&#39;s what the space suits and such are for. They trap the heat next to them, but since they also cannot radiate heat as easily, there are cooling systems to keep them comfortable.</p></li>
<li><p>They communicate via radio, laser, and other electronic means when not inside a pressurized vehicle like the ISS or Soyuz.</p></li>
<li><p>Space is not really a set line. Think of our atmosphere like a cloud or fog. It&#39;s really thick in the middle, but as you move towards the edges it just slowly becomes thinner until it might as well not be there. We have set points that some consider &quot;space&quot; and &quot;not space&quot;, but those are debatable and vary wildly by source.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The question of how we coexist with a positive pressure system right next to a zero pressure system (space is not a negative pressure, but the absence of it), with no physical barrier in between them, is a bit harder. We keep our atmosphere thanks to a combination of gravity, magnetic fields, and sheer luck that something hasn&#39;t blown it away. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum">Recent theories suggest we may live in a false vacuum.</a> This would mean that space does have pressure, but so little that we can&#39;t measure it. And that our atmosphere, and every other atmosphere, are bubbles that could equalize at any moment, annihilating the universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Recent theories suggest we may live in a false vacuum.</em></p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why there would have to be a theory for the vacuum. False or otherwise. They are already in space. Surely an astronaut can go outside and simply do an experiment with a barometer of some sort? He will get either a negative, 0, or a positive reading. Problem solved?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind the speed of the ISS is a theoretical calculation based the circumference of it&#39;s orbit around earth and not an actual scientific measurement. For example the speed of the spin of the earth. The earth has a circumference  of 24,874 miles at the equator, one rotation takes 24 hours, so 24,874 / 24 = 1036.42Mph.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point but even if we assume that these things are flying at ground level which would be insane, that would be a speed of (24,874 miles/92.65min) or 16,000 MPH so 32x the fastest U2 speed possible. I suppose we could go against rotation of earth and knock it all the way down to 30x Max U2 speed. It just doesn&#39;t make sense. For reference this speed is about 20 times the speed of sound.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be a fraud but something is up there that we can all see. It cannot however be a plane, the response before has the math but let&#39;s not let that get in the way. High altitude, 20x speed of sound, surveillance plane in the sky every single hour of every single day? Really? Let&#39;s forget about fuel and maintenance and just hit on speed yet again. If something could go this fast in the lower atmosphere it would create quite a bit of heat but I think the 20x speed of sound shockwave would be far more damaging. How do we not hear the sonic boom (like when the shuttle re-enters) of the mach 20 plane overhead? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so obviously you didn&#39;t read my response or either document you posted and you really love defying basic logic and jumping to conclusions. Let me spell it out for you again... THESE ARE NOT BLUEPRINTS FOR AN AIRCRAFT, THESE ARE ALSO NOT SUPPOSED TO BE AN EXACT MODEL OF REALISTIC FLIGHT CONDITIONS. THIS DOCUMENT TEACHES YOU HOW TO MAKE A BASIC/SIMPLE MODEL TO TEST VEHICLE DYNAMICS AND CONTROL LAW DESIGN, NEITHER OF WHICH FOR THE CONTENTS OF THIS PAPER ARE REQUIRED TO USE THE CORIOLIS EFFECT OR ANY OTHER EXTREMELY HIGH LEVEL CALCULATIONS. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s just skip over the fact that you&#39;ve not read or understood anything you&#39;ve read thus far and get to the point: So every model has to calculate all possible scenarios otherwise it&#39;s moot? With this logic there should just simply be one working theory/formula that explains precisely everything. That shit is not reality and if you believe that, you&#39;ve clearly never had any sort of real world experience with any engineering or science discipline. There&#39;s thousands of white papers citing the curvature of the earth and air resistance and other very high level concepts that are very quantitative. I&#39;d imagine the audience for this white paper aren&#39;t aerospace engineers but it&#39;s written in a way that suggests it&#39;s more beneficial to be readable than account for the .01 % difference in the end result as it&#39;s abstract on top of fairly complex topics that nonspecialized engineers wouldn&#39;t necessarily understand. </p>

<p>You really must not know how the atmosphere or earth rotation works if you&#39;re seriously asking this. </p>

<p>Read up on the Coriolis Effect and Jet Streams. </p>

<p>You&#39;re the one making the flat earth claims, the burden of proof on is on you, yet you show none, then ask questions proving your ignorance. Ignorance doesn&#39;t prove your flat earth theory. Do your research, it really isn&#39;t hard. If you don&#39;t understand something, Google it. Don&#39;t just make up some random fucking idea that makes sense in your head and attribute it to flat earth theory because it sounds good.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why any real scientist doesn&#39;t believe the flat earth theory, simply because there is 0 proof of flat earth, only speculation and extreme lapses in logic that attempt to justify speculation. 
Do you want to explain how GPS works in a flat earth scenario? What holds anything to the surface of the earth?  Probably the same thing that holds objects in orbit, also probably the same thing that makes every other planet in the solar system spherical and also makes it rotate on axes. How do plate tectonics work on a flat earth? What&#39;s on the edges of the earth? What&#39;s on &quot;the other side&quot; or the side we don&#39;t see? Is there an atmosphere surrounding it as well?  What do you think holds our atmosphere together? I&#39;m actually convinced you&#39;re just a high level troll because I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re sincere in this belief.</p>

<p>I could literally go on for days with these ridiculous questions that have already been verified by hundreds of years of basic science. If you really think you&#39;re somehow outsmarting every scientist in any discipline related to geology, astronomy, physics, etc that has ever researched all of this, then you&#39;re even more tinfoil than I imagined. It&#39;s one thing to question someone, that&#39;s fine. To completely and utterly refute any information that disproves your belief is completely ridiculous. If you&#39;re mind is too small to imagine the big picture of how things operate, I don&#39;t know what to say to you. Your logic is purely that of someone ignorant of simple physics or that if someone who only believes what they can see (i.e. I CANT SEE THE CURVATURE OF THE EARTH, SO IT MUST NOT EXIST, END OF STORY.) You&#39;re being ridiculously cynical due to your ignorance. Just because you can&#39;t understand the complex theories underpinning the basis of physics doesn&#39;t mean everything that you don&#39;t understand is false.</p>

<p>P.S. You never answered either of my initial questions. You&#39;re the one claiming this shit, you&#39;re the one with the burden of proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scientific method it is then. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you (using the scientific method of course), take a model (under laboratory conditions) of ball earth, make some water stick to it and then start spinning it. Then please document your results.
Please then also let us know how your accomplished this magnificent feat, as the experiment has to be repeatable.</p>

<p>Then, again using the scientific method in a lab, see if you can get one object to be attracted to another object by sheer virtue of its mass alone.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re still feeling all scientific after that science, you can use <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/newtlaws/Lesson-1/Newton-s-First-Law">Newtons First Law</a> to try and work out how a Cessna 182 can take off or land safely on a runway that is
orientated North/South, while this runway is moving West to East at 1000mph.</p>

<p>But let me guess, all I&#39;ll get from you is either:
1. An answer from the cheat sheet (posted at the top
2. &quot; I&#39;m not going to spend my entire day linking you shit just to make you feel better. &quot;

<p>slow to .25 speed and watch the video...start pausing that video around the 2:30 mark. The footage shows that nearly the entire face of the earth, with the exception of lakes and rivers, is land, but you can account for the visual edges of the supposed globe shape by the blackness of &quot;space&quot; around it. Last time I checked, the globe model shows the earth covered in mostly oceans. And there is no continent large enough to cover an entire side of the globe earth.<br/>
Go pros use fish eye lenses, which add curvature...and you can even see the &quot;curvature bend straight and even all the way opposite direction of curve, so the blackness is a globe shape, as the camera changes orientation. That video is obviously edited and manipulated. The earth is flat, and YES, all those &quot;random&quot; people are part of a conspiracy to hide the flat earth.</p>

<p>So if you go east west like our flight paths you can go around in a circle but if you go north you hit the center and if you go south you hit antarctica.</p>

<p>The fact there was an Antarctic treaty where going there is only allowed based on permission and how every country makes claim for land makes sense since the arctic encompasses the whole planet.</p>

<p>Its very interesting and a rather plausible theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll ask this question that to date no flat earth believer has been able to explain. I lived in South Africa for about twenty-five years. I have also spent some time in Australia (I got there with a direct flight, BTW). I also spent many years in the Scouts. One of the first things that we learned is how to find South using the <a href="http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/diagram/7486/navigating-by-the-southern-cross">Southern Cross</a>.</p>

<p>The South celestial pole (Sigma Octantis) is always visible directly due South from any point in the Southern hemisphere, regardless of the local time or season. Please explain how that is possible on a flat earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup I acknowledge that the direct flights between SA and AUS are real.</p>

<p>Let me see if I can get my thoughts straight on this one.
Sailors and explorers have been navigating by the stars since the beginning of time.  There are two &quot;sets&quot; of stars: 
1. The Wandering Stars (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus , Mars , Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Pluto)
These stars are not fixed in their positions relative to each other or the fixed stars.
2. Fixed Stars
These stars are fixed in their positions relative to each other, and includes all stars except for the wandering stars. No parallax has ever been detected between them. Year on year, you can mark the position of a fixed star and one year later it will be in exactly the same place. That is what makes it such an extraordinaraly accurate navigation aid.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s consider the alleged motions of the ball earth.
Earth spins on its axis at 1000 mph, orbits the sun at around 67 000 mph, orbits the milky at 450 000 mph, all the while hurtling though space at more than a million miles an hour. (Almost all web sites cite different speeds).</p>

<p>I would suggest that if that were true, we would see completely new and different sets of stars every night and it would be impossible to see the same stars day after day and year after year for thousands of years. Mapping them would be impossible.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is possible on a flat earth because the earth does not move and the stars revolve around us, just as we observe and experience every day, and as they always have done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll add you to the list of flat earthers who haven&#39;t been able to answer this question. Since you&#39;re clearly not getting this, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5PIhxAt.png">here</a> is a diagram. On our planet, here in the real world, you can see Octantis from any point in the Southern hemisphere <em>at any time during the night</em> by looking due South. In other words, if you look exactly due South from Cape Town, while your buddy looks exactly due South from Sydney at the same time, you will both be able to see Sigma Octantis. Now look at the linked diagram. You will quickly see that this is impossible on a flat earth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only possible to navigate using the stars in the Southern sky <em>because</em> the earth is spherical and rotating. This means that the stars along the axis of rotation, Octantis in the South and Polaris in the North, will always appear stationary. Flat earth theory has absolutely no way to explain this phenomenon. It is just one more in a very long list of easily observable phenomena that FE theory is utterly unable to account for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would suggest that if that were true, we would see completely new and different sets of stars every night</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you would be completely wrong (again). The solar system is rotating around the galactic center <em>along with all the other stars in the galaxy</em>. That means that they all maintain approximately the same position relative to each other. Now, that doesn&#39;t mean that the night sky is unchanging. The stars do have very small deviations in orbital velocity with respect to each other, meaning that the sky will change very slowly over the course of thousands of years. But a single human will not see any measurable change over the course of one lifetime.</p>

<p>You love to make claims that are easily disproved, don&#39;t you? One of the easiest ways to disprove this claim is to look at observations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard%27s_Star">Bernard&#39;s Star</a>. This is a star that <em>has</em> visibly moved in relation to other stars in the sky over just the last few decades. Other stars have moved over centuries, but Bernard&#39;s star is the quickest moving star in the sky outside of the planets themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well ill attempt to explain, though I admit im not a scientist. The same force which is pulling the atmosphere at 1000 mph is pulling the plane at 1000 mph in the exact same direction at all times and that the vector is added to whatever independent movement the plane is making, and the force is active at all times no matter the position of the plane. Its not applicable to call the 1000 mph rotation a &quot;wind&quot;, because its not shearing against anything.  It&#39;s more like a fly in a jar of honey.

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li>The Moon<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Now that humanity knows quite positively that the Moon is not a piece of cheese or a playful god, the phenomena that accompany it (from its monthly cycles to lunar eclipses) are well-explained. It was quite a mystery to the ancient Greeks, though, and in their quest for knowledge, they came up with a few insightful observations that helped humanity figure out the shape of our planet.
Aristotle (who made quite a lot of observations about the spherical nature of the Earth) noticed that during lunar eclipses (when the Earth’s orbit places it directly between the Sun and the Moon, creating a shadow in the process), the shadow on the Moon’s surface is round. This shadow is the Earth’s, and it’s a great clue on the spherical shape of the Earth.</p>

<p>Since the earth is rotating (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum">“Foucault Pendulum”</a> experiment for a definite proof, if you are doubtful), the consistent oval-shadow it produces in each and every lunar eclipse proves that the earth is not only round but spherical – absolutely, utterly, beyond a shadow of a doubt not flat.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ships and the Horizon<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve been next to a port lately, or just strolled down a beach and stared off vacantly into the horizon, you might have, perhaps, noticed a very interesting phenomenon: approaching ships do not just “appear” out of the horizon (like they should have if the world was flat), but rather emerge from beneath the sea.
But – you say – ships do not submerge and rise up again as they approach our view (except in “Pirates of the Caribbean”, but we are hereby assuming that was a fictitious movie). The reason ships appear as if they “emerge from the waves” is because the world is not flat: it’s round.</p>

<p>Imagine an ant walking along the surface of an orange, into your field of view. If you look at the orange “head on”, you will see the ant’s body slowly rising up from the “horizon”, because of the curvature of the Orange. If you would do that experiment with a long road, the effect would have changed: The ant would have slowly ‘materialized’ into view, depending on how sharp your vision is.</p>

<ul>
<li>Varying Star Constellations<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>This observation was originally made by Aristotle (384-322 BCE), who declared the Earth was round judging from the different constellations one sees while moving away from the equator.</p>

<p>After returning from a trip to Egypt, Aristotle noted that “there are stars seen in Egypt and…Cyprus which are not seen in the northerly regions.” This phenomenon can only be explained if humans were viewing the stars from a round surface. Aristotle continued and claimed that the sphere of the Earth is “of no great size, for otherwise the effect of so slight a change of place would not be quickly apparent.” (De caelo, 298a2-10)
The farther you go from the equator, the farther the ‘known’ constellations go towards the horizon, and are replaced by different stars. This would not have happened if the world was flat.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deducing the shape of the earth from the the shape of the moon (or any other heavenly body) is not scientific at all. It&#39;s like saying the shape of the surface of a pool table can be deduced from observing the shape of the balls on the table. It can&#39;t. Moot point.</p>

<p>Foucault&#39;s Pendulum
Someone has to apply a force to the pendulum to make it swing. If you leave it, it will become completely still, proving the exact opposite of what it supposedly proves. Take a small pendulum and place it on a kids merry-go-round at a park. Spin the merry-go-round at a constant speed, and see if you can make the pendulum stay perfectly still.</p>

<p>Ships and the Horizon
Here&#39;s a great video proving that ships do not &quot;disappear over the horizon&quot;, they vanish because of a combination of distance, air density and perspective.</p>

<p>In this clip, the ship is not visible to the naked eye at all, and has now &quot;disappeared over the curvature of the earth&quot;.
That is until you zoom in with binoculars, a telescope or any good zoom lens. The entire ship, hull and all, comes back into view. (Wait for the zoom out at the end).

<p>The point about the stars is also not valid, as Polaris (the pole star), can be seen as far as 23.5 degrees south, which is impossible if we lived on a ball. Also on the ball model, Mercury is very small and very close to the sun. It sits between the sun and the earth, therefore would be IMPOSSIBLE to see at night, because you would have to be in the sunlight to see it. I can go on about the idiocy of the ball model for days lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, how do we know for a fact that it&#39;s the shadow of the earth? There is a lot of questions to be asked. When you observe a half-moon at daytime, shouldn&#39;t the part that is in shadow be black, instead of exactly the same blue as the sky next to it? The moon is not what we think it is.</p>

<p>In the flat earth model, the moon is self illuminating. I know you are probably laughing your ass off right now. :-)</p>

<p>But here is a moon experiment you or anyone else can do at home.
You will need two identical metallic objects, (tin plates?) and a thermometer or even better a temperature gun.</p>

<p>Place one plate in direct moonlight, and one plate in moon-shadow (under a dense tree or behind a wall).
Try to be as scientific as possible, and start measuring the temperature of the plates every 10 minutes for an hour or two, noting the temperatures.</p>

<p>Now, if moonlight is just reflected sunlight, the plate in direct moonlight MUST be warmer than the plate in the moon-shadow right?</p>

<p>Come back and tell me what you find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can respect that you do have a bit of a scientific approach to your appeal for the flat earth model, and that what I&#39;ve seen in this post so far has me curious to see more, but for your own sake and skeptics of the skeptical, choose your phrasing carefully as not to damage your own credibility. You&#39;re walking on thin ice when discussing something that would have to go against many many many of the things that are accepted as common fact. The Flat Earth Model may be one of the largest theories on that list.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about moonlight (without researching into it) to understand how it should or should not be behaving, but it sounds like you&#39;re making an unsubstantiated claim about how it should work. With that said however, that is also how I would assume it would work without looking into the actual science of it. I&#39;ll gladly investigate into your challenge when I can, although it&#39;s unlikely I will report back on my findings, but I can say what I&#39;ve seen here definitely has me wondering!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pendulum on a flat merrigoround does not disprove a spherical earth. If anything it supports it. The rotational forces on the merrigoround  produce an outward pull, which would keep the pendulum bent toward the outer edge, unless it was precisely on the true center of the surface (we all can&#39;t be precisely at the very center of a flat world) </p>

<p>The pendulum on a spherical surface would eventually return to center and stop, if there were a magnetic force pull downward on it (gravity.) 
After the force of gravity overcomes the rotational force of the pendulum, the pendulum comes to rest. Physics 101.</p>

<p><em>&quot;The pendulum on a spherical surface would eventually return to center and stop&quot;</em>
How does &#39;n pendulum start moving in the first place? You have to push it, It needs an outside force - no pendulum starts moving by itself.</p>
