       Just wondering how Hillary supporters think.  Do you think sending state secrets over a personal email account is not a big deal? Or do you believe Hillary is innocent?

       They don't read the scandals and buy whole heartedly in to the "Russian Propaganda" line.  Hillary could eat a baby on live video, and they'd be certain to notice some green screen like effects the same way some people see them here at any Hillary meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point they believe: wikileaks is Russian propaganda, Comey is a witting Russian dupe, Trump is a witting or unwitting Russian dupe, the Podesta emails are a combination of fake, unimportant, or business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, they don't force themselves to look at their candidate very closely.  But they don't look at Trump closely either, so it may just be their thing.

       Man, they plastered that half quote far and wide, it takes time to track down the rest of it and put it back together.
      </p>
      <p>
       ""You know what else they say about my people? The polls, they say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that? Where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters, okay? It’s like incredible," Trump said."

       Also Trump = Hitler has been drilled into their head 24/7 to the point of fear.

       In the current season Kyle's dad is an internet troll who gets all the women in the world riled up. The girls think it's one of the boys and they all break up with their boyfriends. So in response the boys start whipping out their dicks to protest the girls protest lol.

       It's frustrating so many people are like that. I totally understand. Degrees don't matter at all. In fact, I would say that educated females are more likely to deny than any other demographic. Crazy, but I'm experiencing the exact same thing.

       I think she's crooked as fuck, but I think that all politicians are to some degree. I do like the idea of a SCOTUS that will support abortion rights and gay marriage, and she is the path to that. But I also like guns and privacy, neither of which she is the right candidate for.

       I've pretty much decided not to vote (largely because I think it's scripted, and the gesture will be meaningless), though I might write Bernie Sanders in. I don't care if he was a plant, I still like him.

       First me you're going to be more specific. From what I remember none of the emails were marked classified, they just had (C) indicating that parts were classified. I might be mistaken. A lot of the emails I believe are just normal normal political talk. If we might be losing if we do this it might give us a better chance of winning, and so on. Having a public stance and a private stance, or saying derogatory things about a person or group, not a big deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'm going to be downvoted on this but I don't care. If it was up to me neither of the major candidates should be elected.

       And it's supposed to be marked as such, but not just with a (C). You know like with the classification along like the top of the page, etc. You do know or that C or confidential is also the lowest level.

       Man, they plastered that half quote far and wide, it takes time to track down the rest of it and put it back together.

       ""You know what else they say about my people? The polls, they say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that? Where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters, okay? It’s like incredible," Trump said."
