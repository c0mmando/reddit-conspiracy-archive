Hillary could eat a baby on live video, and they&#39;d be certain to notice some green screen like effects the same way some people see them here at any Hillary meeting.</p>

<p>At this point they believe: wikileaks is Russian propaganda, Comey is a witting Russian dupe, Trump is a witting or unwitting Russian dupe, the Podesta emails are a combination of fake, unimportant, or business as usual.</p>

<p>Essentially, they don&#39;t force themselves to look at their candidate very closely.  But they don&#39;t look at Trump closely either, so it may just be their thing.</p>

I might be mistaken. A lot of the emails I believe are just normal normal political talk. If we might be losing if we do this it might give us a better chance of winning, and so on.
