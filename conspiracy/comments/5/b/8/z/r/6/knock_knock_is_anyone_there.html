        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Are there real people still left out there reading this subreddit? I feel like the comments on this subreddit have become a shadow of how it was, there&#39;s just a few big personalities but I don&#39;t see as many diverse people commenting as before. The last few months have shown a pretty serious decline in user participation, maybe people are just waiting for the election.</p>

<p>I really wonder if after the election is over if reddit will return to normal, or if it&#39;s just broken forever. Probably somewhere in the middle. I have to admit reddit has done an excellent job in making the collapse slow, as compared to digg.com when people migrated to reddit. Nowadays, there&#39;s nothing to migrate to. Voat got overrun by the far-right and racists, because of when reddit banned a couple racist and fat-people hating subreddits, which caused an overflow to voat. If only there were some third alternative...</p>

<p>It&#39;s so upsetting to see what was once a vital communication tool be forced in to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and then forced in to silence by drowning it in bullshit. Our golden window to wake up the public may have passed, they realize the power of the internet and are now doing everything they can to censor it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intelligent, open discussion on the Internet is more or less dead. Whenever any big controversy breaks out (gamergate, this election, fucking literally anything else), people have become eerily accustomed to automatically dividing themselves into two neat tribes and then immediately waging large-scale ideological war with each other, instead of talking about it like adults, comparing anecdotes, debating facts, and eventually reaching some sort of consensus (even if that consensus is &quot;agree to disagree&quot;).</p>

<p>Opinions about facts are core parts of our identities these days.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to question things anymore. Everyone has preconceived notions of how the world works, and the Internet makes it easy for them to seek out information to support their conclusions. Why bother living in the &quot;real world&quot; when we can just ignore facts and live in the idealistic dreamworlds that advertisers and political candidates are more than willing to sell us?</p>

<p>When you hear about some new video game that has a cool hook, or is a sequel to a video game you liked playing in the past, don&#39;t stop and realize, hey, maybe that $60 game won&#39;t turn out to be Literally Jesus in Video Game Form, because of <em>course</em> it will, preorder that shit now!! All your friends already did, what are you waiting for?!</p>

<p>I am very concerned about worldwide mental health in this Internet age. Constant access to the Internet has provided us with overwhelming amounts of data at our fingertips at all times, and yet we actively choose to ignore anything that doesn&#39;t validate our opinions.</p>

<p>Sometimes you&#39;ll <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/5asvm4/til_that_the_husband_of_a_us_president_would_be/">make a reddit post on a popular subreddit</a>, (<em>for example</em>), and it&#39;ll get filtered out of the /new/ queue. You won&#39;t know if it was automatically filtered or not, but when your account is eight fucking years old, you&#39;d think that wouldn&#39;t happen anymore. Yet, here you sit mashing F5 on <a href="/r/todayilearned/new">/r/todayilearned/new</a>, thirty minutes after posting, and your post isn&#39;t there among the other new posts, and your submission&#39;s score remains at a single upvote (your own).</p>

<p>You message the subreddit mods and never hear back. You begin to question how the content of your post &quot;would have looked&quot;, in This Political Climate. Even though your post contained nothing but factual information, it&#39;s probably a bit inconvenient to point out that Michelle Obama has literally no official title or role in our government, aside from being the spouse of our President — after all, she&#39;s campaigning for another Presidential candidate at the moment. You suppose that, in some roundabout way, this information you wished to present to a community, having just learned it (<em>literally the stated purpose of the subreddit</em>) could be interpreted as being, as someone once put it, an inconvenient truth. Super <em>mildly</em> inconvenient, but inconvenient nonetheless.</p>

<p>Thus, it makes <em>sense</em>, when you think about it, that your post didn&#39;t even have a <em>chance</em> of being seen by anyone but you and that subreddit&#39;s moderators, because have you been paying attention you fucking moron, it&#39;s been like this for awhile now, why the fuck did you expect anything different? You were a fool to have submitted that post to begin with, of <em>course</em> this is how things were going to turn out. This is the Way Things Are Now.</p>

<p>You think back to the people who unfollowed you on Twitter for questioning things in the modern political sphere. Not even for supporting candidates or anything; even <em>questioning the narrative</em> every now and then, here and there, completely respectfully, is enough to make people uncomfortable enough to cut you off completely.</p>

<p>We live in crazy times. Like, a century ago, we only conveyed ideas to each other in a handful of ways: in-person conversation, books, art, maybe a telegraph or whatever. Now we&#39;re being bombarded by information <em>constantly</em>, from <em>all directions</em>... it makes <em>sense</em> that a human&#39;s natural reaction is to filter out anything that is too &quot;crazy&quot; to fit their mental model of the world — their mind is only barely holding together as is!</p>

<p>Honestly, at this point, I&#39;m with Cypher. I want that goddamned blue pill and I want it now. I want nothing more than to just willfully ignore the tangled web of complex, interconnected systems that I&#39;ve come to discover underpins everything. I want to ignore all of these greater societal problems that have been festering for generations (willfully misrepresented by politicians as needed), and just live a normal fucking life, consume entertainment like a normal person, get outraged at Those Evil Right-Wingers like a normal person (right in line with everyone on my twitter feed)... but I can&#39;t do it. I just can&#39;t lie to myself, and I fucking hate it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even pretend to know how it all works... I just know that I <em>don&#39;t know</em> how it all works, and neither does anyone else. Humans are naturally curious creatures, yet we&#39;ve been conditioned as a society to accept everything at face value and just roll with it. Everything will work out okay! And if some kind of terrorist attack happens, don&#39;t worry, just change your Facebook profile picture in solidarity right along with everyone else. See? We even coded this button specifically for that, just to make it easy for you. Don&#39;t think too hard!</p>

<hr/>

<p>...I didn&#39;t mean mean to write that much; I guess your post just kinda struck a chord with me OP. I spent a large portion of this evening reading various angles on the <em>latest</em> bullshit surrounding the US Presidential election, and it got to the point where I realized I literally could not discern fact from fiction anymore. My mechanism for filtering out garbage data on the basis of &quot;being too ridiculous&quot; is completely shot after the events of the past couple of years.</p>

<p>On one hand, I could totally believe that the United States federal government is built on layer upon layer of corruption, with a horrifying child molestation and/or human trafficking scandal at the center of it all.</p>

<p>On the other hand... that&#39;s fucking ridiculous, there&#39;s no way that could be true, that defies all common sense.</p>

<p>I can feel the cognitive dissonance and it hurts.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to believe anymore.</p>

<p>I really, truly don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a great post, posts like this are why I stay around this site even as it falls apart. This is exactly how I feel, and exactly where I&#39;m at. </p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s not a bad thing though. &quot;The wise man knows that he knows nothing.&quot; means more after reading your post than it did before. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s true anymore either. I am almost done watching media because there&#39;s literally no way to tell how much of it is lies and how much is truth. It feels like a waste of time, staring in to this information blender that may or may not have some relationship with reality, but is definitely trying to manipulate you in to thinking certain ideologies. </p>

<p>It does hurt to see the game at large instead of &quot;sides&quot;. But this hurt is exactly why people blind themselves to the reality. They&#39;re not pretending, they&#39;re disallowing mental discovery. You&#39;ve already seen it, and you can&#39;t un-see it. They haven&#39;t seen it yet, but they have inklings that it&#39;s there. That&#39;s the reason we can&#39;t pretend along with everyone else, because they&#39;re <em>not</em> pretending. They honestly believe what they believe. </p>

<p>The idea that our ideologies are just group packages of ideas that are sold to us like anything else, well in some ways it&#39;s the last ideology you need to ever have because it renders all the others obsolete. However you can&#39;t just be ideology-free, because some things are true, but this begins the purge of long-held ideas, and moving toward that direction. This is a painful process, and the tighter we hold to our ideas the more painful it is when they&#39;re proven untrue. Some people are good at being in denial, I am not. You are not. This is a blessing and a curse, and I&#39;m plenty familiar with the curse aspects of it as are you. So let&#39;s dwell instead on the good parts, because for the duration of this lifetime we will continue to be in this mental position that somewhat alienates us from a chunk of the population who are literally afraid of the truth and literally cannot handle it. It&#39;s just the way it is.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to believe either, but I believe that human beings (including myself obviously) know a lot less than they pretend to. So I guess that&#39;s something, but even this belief can be false. So it&#39;s not stable either. There&#39;s nothing to rest your drink on. That&#39;s the real upset. People love outsourcing their thinking to a pre-existing ideology, and to say that this action in itself is wrong and lazy is very upsetting or &quot;ridiculous&quot; to many many people. </p>

<p>The plus side to not knowing the truth of anything is that you can&#39;t even justify anxiety or depression anymore and the mental scaffolding for them falls apart on close examination, just like every other idea. You are then free to add in your own emotion of your choosing, since it&#39;s arbitrary anyways, and create a fresh emotional-mental environment of your choosing instead of being forced in to whatever you happened to fall in to as you grew up. Thoughts and emotions can become a medium with which you can work, rather the thoughts and emotions owning your mind and sweeping  you away with whatever they happen to produce. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe everything you think. This is why the wise man knows he knows nothing, and that is in fact what makes him wise. Freedom and transcendence from the things that mentally sweep everyone away. </p>

<p>Yes that will cause some rejection from the mainstream culture, but it&#39;s no measure of good health to be well-adjusted to a sick society. </p>

<p>Sorry I ended up writing more than I intended, your post really struck a chord with me as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has happened to anyone who got enough attention. What is the real shame is how hard it is to separate out who is trolls from who is not, because trolling <em>is</em> a real problem that does fuck up entire forums, and there <em>are</em> people paid to do it. But I understand your frustration, I&#39;ve been there. I have you at +5 net upvotes on RES, we&#39;re probably on the same team. I think the trolls often accuse others of being trolls to hide themselves, which is classic psychological projection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, I guess by &quot;normal&quot; I mean reddit as it was 2006-2009, before Aaron Swartz was killed by the government and the spirit of reddit died with him.

    <div class="md"><p>The chans are just as fucked up though. What we really need is a website where users can be tagged with the ideologies they&#39;ve been seen expressing, and can be weeded out if they&#39;re pushing misinformation. It&#39;s a very tight line to walk though, but trolls (paid or otherwise) have absolutely ruined most popular forums, and I think there needs to be more of a user test to enter and also community policing to keep the place nice for regular people. Reddit sort of had this, but the mods of various subreddits have all been infiltrated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is about the election and which puppet gets to play - look at me, aren&#39;t l great and l&#39;ve got the biggest dick. Whatever, all the same to me.</p>

<p>Fucken distract us all with one hand and while we all watch, something else is going on. Every single time.</p>

<p>The same BS happened down under a few months ago, Aus went to the polling booth and the great illusion perpetuated. </p>

<p>Gotta be someone, some thing playing with us. Fucked if l know who or what and personally l couldn&#39;t give a single fuck. </p>

<p>For me it&#39;s the dichotomy of life and the balance of good/evil (call it what you will) that makes MY life worth living. Not sure about trying to wake anyone out of their self imposed slumber anymore. I used to have that drive but as l become closer to the end stage of this grand game of life, l find myself closer to most other lifeforms than humans. It&#39;s always about us isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Reddit is merely a medium for mass paradigm creation as is the WWW and if we can get to the core of our consciousness, our spirit, our soul we won&#39;t even need any of this. We are greater than this illusion IMO.</p>

<p>Sorry for the ramble, but yes there are still some of us here who believe :)</p>
