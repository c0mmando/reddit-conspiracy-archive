<p><em>Remarks of Hillary Rodham Clinton</em> Town Hall on College Affordability and Student Debt Exeter, N.H. Monday, August 10, 2015 Right now, 40 million Americans have student loans. They add up to more than a trillion dollars. That’s more than our country’s total credit card debt. It’s a huge number. And you know, New Hampshire’s students are carrying the highest debt in the country. The average college graduate with debt in this state owes nearly <strong><em>$33,000</em></strong>.

The private sector has added 10.6 million jobs over 56 straight months of job growth, extending the longest streak on record. Today we learned that total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 214,000 in October, mainly reflecting a 209,000 increase in private employment. Private-sector job growth was revised up for August and September by a combined <strong><em>33,000</em></strong>, so that over the past twelve months, private employment has increased by 2.6 million. Private employment has risen by at least 200,000 for nine consecutive months, the first time that has happened since the 1990s.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical Likelihoods</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s be generous and say politicians can only count by the 1000s, so 33,000 means effectively &#39;33&#39; or 33 thousands.  So the chance of 33,000 again is 1 (ie: picking any number).  Assuming only 2 digit numbers (if you go into six and seven figures, you reduce the likelihood even more, so this errs on generous, if inaccurate), the chance of 2 33s is 1/99 x 1/99 is 0.00010203 or .01023%.  That&#39;s just 2 33,000s.  So the statistical likelihood of 5 is</p>

<ul>
<li>5 == 0.00010203 x 0.00010203 x 0.00010203 x 0.00010203 x 0.00010203 == 1.1057054e-20</li>
<li>10 is 1.1057054e-20 x 1.1057054e-20</li>
<li>20 is 1.4947126e-80</li>
<li>30 is 1.652712e-100</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very small number, probably something like winning the lottery multiple times.  I&#39;m showing that repeated uses of this 33,000 is more unlikely than winning the lottery multiple times.   This is obviously a very simplified napkin math example and only useful as a simple adumbration of the ridiculousness of 33,000 showing up all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any thought on what this means? Some are saying numerology (which I initially ruled out, however after all the weird Spirit Cooking stuff it would make sense.)</p>

<p>My other thought is yet another coded reference: something as simple as using 33,000 when the number is a made up stat, or as complicated as referring to a motive behind the data (the agenda the data serves) I.e &quot;33,000 inmates need to be released to reduce spending&quot; means &quot;the shadow government wants inmates to be released&quot;</p>

<p>Great work on the math btw. Harder for people to call us kooks when we use math and science to prove our points :)</p>

<p>I dismissed a lot of numerology for years, but now that I&#39;m becoming more aware of occult symbology I&#39;ve been seeing 33 everywhere in media as well. I thought I was imagining the significance, seeing false patterns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>33 is the signature move of Masonic  spies</p>

<p>33rd degree is master mason, rotate 33 counterclockwise 90 degrees and you get &quot;m m&quot; for master mason</p>

<p>Also everything dwillcha said</p>

<p>You see the masons accept only good people .... And then incrementally corrupt them.  They are a mafia of kabbalists and alchemists, gnostics.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The alchemical symbol of the Maltese cross in some literature is VINEGAR, </p>

<p>Which was the final insult to Jesus on the cross</p>

<p>He asked for water and larry--pontious pilate&#39;s cohort--they gave him a sponge full of vinegar.  WhenI discovered this, everything made sense:  assholes in history use the Maltese cross from rat pope, Jesuits, knights of Malta, Harley riders, pedo nobles in england like saville, the swiss, the political elite, transnational bankers </p>

<p>(BTW i don&#39;t remember which roman gave him vinegar sorry, so he&#39;s Larry for now.)</p>

<p>You are correct in pointing out that something is being communicated here, but it&#39;s difficult to say what it is and who it&#39;s being communicated to. Especially since 33 has extremely broad connotations. </p>
