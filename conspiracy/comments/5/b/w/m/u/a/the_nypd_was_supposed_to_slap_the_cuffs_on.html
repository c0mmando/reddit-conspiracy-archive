       I wish people would fucking listen.  This board makes me so mad sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many of us told you that the whole NYPD story had no sources?  That it was a bullshit fake story?  How many? and we got downvoted and told "no you're wrong"...
      </p>
      <p>
       That if they did have that info, it'd already be online.  People gossip, it's what they fucking do.  If it was something huge, and they knew about it, they would be on various boards posting about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe if some of you used some fucking logic, you wouldn't be so disappointed.

       Disinformation is not a crime.  Is it annoying when somebody jumps on the sub and says, "I just thought of something crazy â€“ what if Donald Trump is a plant!"?  Sure.  But people need to come to their understandings in their own time. You did, right?

       You're right, my anger is not meant to say "don't do something", although sometimes I mispeak/type.
      </p>
      <p>
       My problem is, they act so sure of themselves, and downvote and belittle those that disagree, that I really feel a need to rub it in their face, like a dog when it shits on the carpet.  I just..I don't know how else to teach people logic.  You can give them all the information, you can discredit false information, you can write out a logical synopsis, but in the end, they shit on the carpet, and now it's fucking shit covered, and mom's gonna blame me, because last time I did it, and now here comes all these anons, shitting on my fucking carpet.  and it pisses me off, and now I'm sweating.

       Lol, I get it.  And I sincerely appreciate your truly genuine response.  But unfortunately (or fortunately, at least they're HERE), there's a million dogs shitting RIGHT THE FUCK NOW.  And it's only us who can patiently show them, or they'll just keep doing it again (much like rubbing a dog's face in his shit, he's like, wtf?  We understand, but he just...doesn't, and he's not going to with that kind of training).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's patience, and conversation, and reasoning, and it's IRRITATING as FUCK but it's our job bc these people are our friends, our neighbors, the perfectly normal Americans that we see every day who don't fucking understand yet, but they will if you help them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because we've been through all the reasoning and know it's stupid, doesn't mean they have, and we have the unique opportunity to be leaders!  Is it bullshit omg "get a fucking brain moran" frustrating?  You betcha.  But they're our peeps.  We gotta do it.

       Heard rumors on twitter that DOJ &amp; Comey slammed the lid on everything and forced NYPD to cease and desist their pesky attempts at justice. Further rumors of forced retirements for the peskiest FBI agents.  Take these fourth-hand rumors with a ton of salt, obviously, but clearly something happened.

       I don't know how they can get that cat to get back in the bag and stay there forever, though.
