       I can't believe people supporting either of the two major candidates. You'd think the democrats would've learned their lesson after "Hope and Change" of 2008, and you'd think the republicans would've learned their lesson after Trumps AIPAC speech. Outsiders are not allowed. The military-industrial complex owns our government. Wake the fuck up, America.

       That is what they want to rob you of. I'm not sure of your heritage (not sure if you told me). Women are strong, and met some bad ass women in my time. We complete each other. Stop cutting yourself down. Don't cut men down, but don't cut yourself down, and get a damn map, Chicky.

       That's right. My apologies, Chicky. I'm blasting off (told you I brought the good shit out).  I'm bouncing off the walls (me and my dog just made leaf angels - lame, but I love her dearly), and I already have ADD. You have a son? That's wonderful! One of these days, I hope for one, as well!

       I hope so, just need to find that one. Mind you, I come from a family of 8 boys (I'm the youngest - go figure). Boys run in my family, I'm hoping for 2 boys and 1 girl, to protect her. Still not there in their in life though. Crazy times, and maybe its just me. Not saying I haven't had opportunities, but I have high standards. A part of me (my blood) tells me to move to Eastern Europe, where my soul belongs... Been there a few times. Tis' magical. I love Poland (my heritage). Just something about us Poles and nature...

       this sounds like a very good plan [ i think you will have your three your way .... when the world settles down to it and more peace is allowed to flow that would be a wonderful time for you to go back  it does make sense your kindred spirit is waitng for you there ....and it is important to have high standards putes its the mixin of the dna that moves forward you have to honor yourself and your ancestors in the choices you make like that

       Uh yeah he does. He said he's willing to work with his Zionist backers as much as possible, and they want war in Syria. He is also a sellout, so they simply have to wave enough money in his face to get him to agree to it. If he doesn't (which he will, because selling out is what he does) then he'd get the JFK treatment.

       He has the military behind him (imo). I'm not saying here or there. But, this is the support that I think JFK lacked. Now, what that means? No idea. Is it good? No idea. You know my thoughts on the US and "government" in general. Just following my gut. It's kept me alive so far. Trump will win. I'm calling it.

       I think he does. I also do not think he wants war, nor do the majority of Americans. We are sick of it. We've known peace for about ~3-5 years of our existence. We should make peace with Russia and the world. Russian women are hot, can't comment on their guys, lol. But us Polish guys are ;). lol...

       He is in line with the Zionist agenda, his AIPAC speech shows he is fully compliant. Thus he will go to war in Syria. From his AIPAC speech:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My number-one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it because already, you know, as you know, it has, the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        When I’m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran’s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        When I’m president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable.

       He's a total Zionist sellout, and a warmonger, and WILL attack Syria if it is massively profitable for him. Which is easy to do since the Rothschilds Zionists possess legal money-creation abilities through the central banks.

       Once again, words. I'm still saying I'm a unicorn. Do you believe me yet? Actions speak louder than words. We shall see. Unless you have evidence (which you don't), all the shit you are spouting is just assumptions and your opinion. I suggest you look up the difference between those, and facts/evidence. KTHXBYE.

       It seems like the perfect time for an opportunistic nationalistic entity to try to overthrow the government.  It would be busy waging war all over the globe and would be left more or less defenseless at home.

       I wouldn't say this is a foregone conclusion, personally. But I do think America is being set up as the fall-guy for WW3 similarly to how Germany was for WW2. Very few countries in the world really like the US right now, it seems like. And our government has done plenty to piss off tons of people around the world, in an effort to control more, which is often driven by a need to repay central bank debts. So the Rothschild Zionists drive us to war in the end, to overthrow the countries they want. If only 7 billion people realized this, it would end overnight

       The idea it all hinges on people understanding it gives me hope, it's not like we have to distribute 7 billion computers or anything, it's just an idea that has to spread an take root, then our enemy will be defeated, I find that encouraging. But it is a dire situation, and we are just individuals caught in a storm much bigger than ourselves. But maybe we wake up 1000 people in our lifetimes, and they each wake up 100... It's one of those things that goes exponential very quickly now that the cat is out of the bag.

       This are AIPAC Trump speech quotes. He's going to go to war with Syria and Iran, because Israel wants him to. He is a warmonger. He is absolutely not against foreign intervention, at all.

       There is one with a vigana...I havent heard. Obviously just vote for the vigana, because it's a vigina. Closed logic loop brought to you by a vigana driven campaign.

       The Trump-lovers and Clinton-lovers really both hate posts  like this. Which really shows they're on the same team, the pro-authority team.

       The idea it all hinges on people understanding it gives me hope, it's not like we have to distribute 7 billion computers or anything, it's just an idea that has to spread an take root, then our enemy will be defeated, I find that encouraging. But it is a dire situation, and we are just individuals caught in a storm much bigger than ourselves. But maybe we wake up 1000 people in our lifetimes, and they each wake up 100... It's one of those things that goes exponential very quickly now that the cat is out of the bag.
