<p>I am not here to debate, but YouTube has tons of info on the subject as more and more people in past years have come to realize what they have been taught in school does not adhere to common sense. </p>

<p>Here is one that answers your question: </p>

<p>How do you explain,  someone at the equator on a summer night sees the same night sky as someone on the equator in winter?  They are facing entirely opposite directions,  yet see the same view. </p>

<p>Draw it out on paper if need be,  you will see it is impossible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some questions to ask yourselves in regards to FE:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When you look through a telescope at any of the other planets for long enough, why are you able to see them and their moons clearly as round, with a shadow cast as a ball has a shadow, right in front of your eyes?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you able to see their moons orbit them if they are not round?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you able to see Saturn&#39;s rings encircle its globe if it&#39;s not round?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you able to see their poles change angle toward you in three dimensions if not round?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you able to see the large planets like Jupiter and Saturn clearly spin about their axes if not round?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you able to see them pass behind the Sun if not orbiting it?</p></li>
<li><p>These are all things that you, personally, can go and look at plainly through common telescopes. So:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>IF we can all at least agree that the OTHER planets and moons we look at are round, (since each of you can look at them yourselves and clearly see that they are with your own eyes), is it more likely or less likely that Earth would be an exception among all of them, and be the only planet that behaves differently?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Or does FE claim that Earth is not a planet, but something else entirely???</p></li>
<li><p>If the earth is flat, why is it that Euclidean Geometry does not work to obtain the shortest path over long distances (such as those traveled by airplanes)?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>9a. To further that question, how can it be that a parabola actually produces the shorter route, if the surface is not curved? Why does only non-Euclidean geometry work for determining shortest travel distances over long paths? Are you claiming such is not the case?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why must GPS satellites calculate positions based on a sphere in order to perform accurately?</p></li>
<li><p>What is Sunset on a flat earth? How could it occur geometrically and still explain how half of the earth is night and half day?</p></li>
<li><p>Please describe the ice wall that you&#39;re saying exists instead of the south pole. How high is it? Can one fly over it? When one does fly over it, does one fly off into space?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you then claiming that we can launch ourselves into space by flying perpendicular to the &quot;earth&#39;s upward acceleration?&quot; merely by flying off over this ice wall?</p></li>
<li><p>How far does the ice wall extend? Has anyone ever walked upon it? Is there evidence of that walk?</p></li>
<li><p>Has the FE ice wall ever been documented as observed in any way? Anything? Even one photo or report from the field somehow?</p></li>
<li><p>Please describe your competence in what lens distortion is and how it works, especially to varying degrees of severity.</p></li>
<li><p>Also then describe how it&#39;s possible that so many photos could be so SEVERELY distorted by a regular lens so as to make a flat object look round, with parts of it fully behind other parts of it and not exposed to the camera, while objects adjacent to it are hardly distorted at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you saying that literally ALL photographs ever taken of the earth have been faked or subject to extreme lens distortion?</p></li>
<li><p>If we are not accepting photographic evidence of RE, do you believe ANY photos of ANYthing whatsoever? Ever?</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re willing to accept even one photo of anything ever at all (that you didn&#39;t take yourself), why are photos of the round earth excluded?</p></li>
<li><p>If we&#39;re not accepting photographs, please at least explain the most likely reason why there have been NONE of a flat earth, EVER, and ONLY photos of a round one.</p></li>
<li><p>How do seasons occur if we are not on a ball, axially tilted toward a central light and heat source?</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the phases of the moon, and what causes them, if not orbit and rotation.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the tides, and what causes them, if not gravity and orbit.</p></li>
<li><p>If the earth is not round, and planets not round, then why is it that we must use calculations based on orbits of round objects in order to place satellites into space adequately?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is it that we can see those satellites orbit us with a common telescope, and how do they lose direct line of sight if not dropping behind the curve of a round earth?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is it that we must calculate based on those orbits and related signal loss to make our phones work?</p></li>
<li><p>If the earth is not round, and planets not round, then why have we had to use spherical/orbital calculations in order to successfully land rovers on other planets? Are you claiming that we have not done such?</p></li>
<li><p>If the earth is not round and gravity does not exist, then what keeps us from losing our atmosphere and ocean?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the seas supposedly contained by this ice wall?</p></li>
<li><p>Since the atmosphere would surely be above such ice wall, what prevents it from spilling off over the sides of the earth, into space, as the earth accelerates up toward the atmosphere? </p></li>
<li><p>If the earth is flat, then how is it that if I fly in any direction along a straight line from any point and don&#39;t stop, I will eventually return to exactly where I started from? Do you claim that this will not occur?</p></li>
<li><p>Astronauts have been to space and claimed to have looked at an unmistakably round earth. If you reject their photographic evidence, do you also claim they are lying or delusional about what they have seen??</p></li>
