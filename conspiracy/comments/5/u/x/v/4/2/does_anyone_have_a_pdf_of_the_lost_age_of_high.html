    <div class="md"><p>Good luck! I would help pay. I&#39;m taking a class in college right now about the ancient world in archeology. I read and listen to a lot of Hancock and my professor is a world class Egyptian archeologist who has been in many documentaries. So as you can imagine, we are constantly arguing about the official narrative of human civilization. The argument changed when I showed her Gobekli Tepe </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, none of that is terribly surprising now that I&#39;m thinking about it.  My undergrad degree is Anth./I do remember being disappointed when I&#39;d be having a conversation with a professor, and they showed a surprising lack of knowledge about anything other than their own specialty..sad and common.  Also sad is the mentality of &quot;we already know what happened, so it couldn&#39;t have happened any other way.&quot;  </p>

<p>Anth is so up in the air as far as what&#39;s true.  There is general consensus on some theories, but there are always a ton of competing theories which also hold a plurality among researchers.  As far as what ACTUALLY happened, it&#39;s fairly un-provable, even with written records.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well so the whole class is about &quot;pseudoArcheology&quot; so her goal is to explain to us students why these people are wrong. And her problem is exactly how you laid it out &quot;we already know what happened, so it couldn&#39;t have happened any other way.&quot; -- When Gobekli Tepe came up she did say &quot;This changes the way we think about some things because we thought that people would build structures after agriculture, and this discovery changes that.&quot; -- But then she said, &quot;You see class, guys like Hancock try to use this as evidence that Archeologists are not looking at the whole picture, yet here we are talking about it... (Next slide).&quot; --- Its a Huge class over 200 ppl, but I have raised my hand a few times. The reason that she hates Hancock is because he brings in the idea of Aliens to Archeology and I guess that is a big no no. --- As far as I am concerned, as a student, I just want a timeline and explanation based on archeology. And she is afraid to put that up in-front of the class. -- I think that Gobekli Tepe, among many other, perhaps underwater sites, are evidence of a past civilization and there is no reason for it to be completely ignored in an archeology class. </p>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-5" data-depth="5" data-id="ddybv88">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">n/a</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/JwPATX.html">JwPATX</a> 2017-02-19</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I mean, we can&#39;t even really agree on whether humans have been around for 50k or 200k years...if the 200k answer is the right one, then how can anyone say that there is absolutely NO chance that there was civilization/agriculture at some time prior to 12kya?  I mean, there have been several massive climate shifts in that time (look at the amount of knowledge humanity lost for over 1000 years just b/c Rome fell), and ice sheets sitting on top of things for a few thousand years tend to destroy all archaeological evidence. If a miles-thick ice sheet were to park itself on top of NYC for that long, I don&#39;t even think there&#39;d be any evidence that there was a city there except for maybe some bits of plastic and a high number of steel pebbles found in the moraine.  I mean, if you&#39;ve ever seen what&#39;s left under a receding glacier, it&#39;s just pebbles that used to be parts of mountains.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that it&#39;s definite there was widespread advancement, but there is a possibility.  I&#39;ve just always hated the idea that humans were stupid until relatively recently.  Our ability to think and reason has always been present, and just because we don&#39;t have evidence of things prior to the last ice age doesn&#39;t mean that those things couldn&#39;t have existed.  Our iteration society has only been here about 1% of the total time, and look how far we&#39;ve come...</p>

<p>Also, you don&#39;t have to come down on the side of aliens or whatever else in order to acknowledge the possibility, however improbable, but many scholars refuse to even entertain possibility as a hypothetical :\</p>

<p>On the other hand, I did have several professors in the upper level courses who I could tell we&#39;re trying to plant seeds on things like that and giants in North America (all specimens sent in were destroyed by the Smithsonian b/c it upset the historical/human superiority narrative at the time, and in their minds, would validate biblical history based on the Nephilim).  The feeling I got from those profs was that they knew THEY could never study something like that and get away with it, but they want future generations to at least be open to the ideas.  That was refreshing, but sad that they couldn&#39;t study it themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You, like many of the people who are interested in this topic that I have replied to, will most likely completely ignore my post, not reply to it, and dive head first into the other posts that are either references to things based on various amounts of silliness, or are themselves self-written posts based on various amounts of silliness. </p>

<p>Hancock, and all of the other authors, mean well and are interested in the right things, but are plagued, like essentially the rest of humanity, by beliefs, which means conjecture. Conjecture is conclusions formed from incomplete and inaccurate information. To save space so that you will actually read this, I won&#39;t go into any of it here, as I already have in other posts that I will link you.</p>

<p>The advanced civilization, the one that all other &quot;advanced&quot; ancient civilizations like Egypt, the Yucatan, Peru/Bolivia, etc. stem from is one that has been kept secret and fictionalized by the elite for millennia, and it is the most important topic <strong>anyone</strong> <em>anywhere</em>, especially on this sub, could be talking about. </p>

<p>That civilization was Atlantis.</p>

<p>Atlantis was <strong><em>Very</em></strong> real, and there is obvious evidence everywhere for it.</p>

<p>It is the key to destroying the global system of control, domination, and oppression of the elite and it <strong>will</strong> be rediscovered.</p>

<p>I have made many posts about this, and I will not stop until this sub is changed completely and Atlantis&#39; rediscovery is disseminated to every single part of the globe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">This</a> is my original thread going into detail about Atlantis and its connection/paramount importance to defeating the elite and their global control system,  well as how advanced Atlantis was, and why and how it was so advanced, and the thread continues in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixn93/">this</a> comment, and in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbixo60/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">this</a> comment that continues the first comment. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ph62z/is_there_a_lost_city_under_antarctica/dcsf1xr/">This</a> comment goes into Antarctica and simply clarifies why it wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t be Atlantis, and piggy backs off of these other links. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/dbkbysz/">This</a> comment goes into Atlantis, the elite, secret societies, and spiritual initiates, all things that are important to understand Atlantis, and how there is a lie that the elite are somehow &quot;spiritually&quot; minded. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nmxg4/mysterious_10000_year_old_underwater_ruins_in/dcdga4q/">This</a> comment explains why the &quot;comet&quot; theory of Atlantis&#39; destruction is false and it explains how Atlantis absolutely would have been destroyed, and it also goes into why cyclical rising and lowering of human consciousness is false as well. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pf4ep/there_is_a_hidden_knowledge_that_has_been_kept/dcr0nde/">This</a> comment goes into evidence and the insanity of using subjectivity and beliefs to determine reality. Finally, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pvb5z/the_musical_conspiracy_to_separate_mankind_from/dcveaxm/">this</a> comment is seemingly unrelated (its about music and the elite), but it goes into detail about God, and why negativity exists, and true spirituality, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pvb5z/the_musical_conspiracy_to_separate_mankind_from/dcveq1h/">this</a> comment continues that first one.</p>
