       Where is any actual proof of anything wikileaks releases? Sure videos of the military fucking up is true, but thats war and part of the military industrial complex that everyone has known about. Instead of random ass internet people creating their own dots where is the proof? When has one source been enough to please everybody? It really makes no sense and they really dont release much that holds any value. If you have common sense and have studied history and world politics nothing is really new that they claim.

       Most of what they have posted seems to have been verified. The problem for me is with things that they haven't posted but might have. The only proof we have that they don't have things like trumps tax records or embarrassing things on others is their word. You'll have to decide about that.

       Heres my position.  Sure they have released video and some alphabet soup documents but what real proof of criminal activity have they shown? Most of it is shit people have speculated on and created their own narrative.  Propaganda and the military fucking up is just that. Besides basic information that anyone with a mind knows that has been going on since atleast the romans, whats new to hold this one source of information in such high regards? Everyone wants multiple sources for Information besides when it comes to wikileaks. Everything they say is held as scripture in most peoples minds. People have been pushing this lets think scientifically and when it comes to wikileaks everything is forgotten because wikileaks and 4chan says so. That makes absolutely no sense to me and wikileaks falls short on most of their huge leaks ,false dates and what have you.

       In my opinion most of what they release is not proof of criminal activity. It may not be the most ethical or moral thing but a lot of it is more embarrassing than illegal. Other parts are more like 2 + 2 = 5 or this has to mean this because there are no other possibilities is none they want to consider.

       Coming from the Internet one source should never be enough and what most people do is take wikileaks as absolute proof. Thats not really resonable and i see no one ever disagree with them and as much proof as we all demand for everything else they should be held to the same stanard. On a side not was the 2+2=5 a radiohead drop?

       As far as I know nothing they have released have been proven as being false, I might be wrong. My issue is that we have no way of knowing what they have but hasn't been released. Another issue is that when they say they didn't receive the info from someone they provide no proof. They may or may not have an agenda so do we take their word for it, I think not.

       Im not trying to say this or that is exactly false but its not what people create it to be and its taking over the community. If anything leading people farther from the truth what ever that might be.

       Wikileaks appeared after the Bush Administration, offered nothing damaging about the Bush Administration, and sought to be a magnet for leakers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus they were a "filter" for information getting out:  A better vehicle the CIA/FBI/NSA couldn't have invented.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now we have "Deep State Rebels" allegedly coming forward and "leaking" on 4Chan as "FBIAnon" and "HighLevelAnon" and "BullshitAnon."  Yet somehow these Deep State Rebels never rebelled or leaked after 9/11.  Or after the Bush Administration was "safely" allegedly gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks was the perfect project to be a magnet for real leakers, filter real information, claim honestly that all info released was in fact 100% accurate, except omit dishonestly that all info was not released.  Wikileaks has been criticized for its lack of transparency while it demands transparency of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the little matter, ignored by pedo-hunters, of Assange's childhood links to an Australian CIA-associated child-sex mind control cult.  If Hillary was linked to a CIA-associated child-sex mind control cult, it would be bigger than Pizzagate.  But it's Assange, so we must ignore it.

       I agree that at some time it might of been. But what they have failed on and how they over hype nonsense is my biggest problem.  Most people dont seem to see it or dont want to and how we have crucified people and sources in the past they seem to get a free pass these days . When have we let our stanards fall of actual good information and let people just play with the minds of our peers?

       Seems like it was all leading to this, though.  Build the brand, bury the real leaks, then unleash the tabloid garbage &amp; hide in seclusion to generate mystery, hype upcoming leaks with cryptic nonsense to generate more mystery, "OMG THEY KILLED ASSANGE" bullshit.

       What source are you expecting or waiting on?  Your “trusty” MSM?  Your “trusty” scientific journals that are all for the most part bought out by multinational corporations who tell them what to print to the masses and say is or is not the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s nowadays the case that “random ass internet people” are the very ones where you’ll find your most accurate amount of real information.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just have to learn how to sift the wheat from the chaff and navigate through all the crazy commentary in order to find the valid pieces of citizen investigation and independent journalism.

      <p>
       Don’t depend on some “trusted source” for truth.

       You think Wikileaks has released nothing “that holds any value”?  Seriously?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey, man.  I was one the biggest people on here letting it be known that Julian Assange and Wikileaks was a limited hangout…and that still may very well be the case as far as I know.  However, what Wikileaks has been able to make happen with regard to doing away with the facade that was the Hillary Clinton campaign, and what they’ve been able to do in uncovering the Podesta emails and all the absolutely ongoing shit that’s come out of that?  Yeah.  That’s been enough to cause me to give Wikileaks some SERIOUS cred and benefit of the doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand what you're saying in terms of digging deep into Wikileaks and even questioning THEM.  Yes.  I agree.  However, it seems that they have provided some pretty serious information that's helped put some serious dents in the armor of TPTB thus far - more so than almost anything else that's we've seen really.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that reason, I think people should indeed be cautious of Wikileaks, but I don't think they should disregard them offhand or go too far in attempting to delegitimize them at this point.

       Your point of no trusted sources is what im getting at. Look what actually happens to people who get close to the truth of things. Hastings, holistic drs, ect ect. Theres no way if they didnt want info out that itd get out. The Democrats demise was that of there own and thats assuming we have an actual 2 party system. Over the years hilary obama and the team dug a big enough grave for themselves where people who never heard of wikileaks recognized that. To put all the credit in wikileaks is just ignorant to me.

      <p>
       Heck, at the end of the day, people need to use their brains - logic, rational, critical thinking - and not simply believe something just because it comes form a “trusted source”.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Look what actually happens to people who get close to the truth of things. Hastings, holistic drs, ect ect.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well that right there - i.e. what happened to people like Hastings, etc - gives you a pretty good idea that what they were saying was likely true; was likely something that
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       in fact be “trusted”.  Otherwise they likely wouldn’t have gotten fucking murdered for the information they let out.  It’s that kind of “putting two and two together” logic that people should use - not so much
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       the source alone is, but a combination of things surrounding the source and information, including the consequences involved in their releasing the information they did.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Theres no way if they didnt want info out that itd get out.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Okay.  The information Hastings let out was not done on accident, however.  He did it very deliberately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I’m not understanding exactly what you’re saying in this statement…
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       A:  We most definitely
       <em>
        don’t
       </em>
       have a two party system.  Not sure we ever did.
      </p>
      <p>
       B:  The Democrats’ demise might have been of their own doing, but it certainly wasn’t anything they
       <em>
        wanted
       </em>
       to happen.  They were trying to keep everything
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       hidden.  It just got out - and ultimately, it got out because of Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Their corruption would have just continued on and on like normal, however.  That’s how politics has worked for…for forever practically.  Corruption just continues on and on and foibles just get covered up by a complicit MSM that the majority of the population was brainwashed into believing “tells the whole truth and nothing but the truth!”.  Wikileaks busted a hole in the MSM narrative so God damn big, however, that TPTB simply haven’t been able to do enough damage control to keep everyone believing their shit narrative anymore.  This is a fact.  Maybe a lot of people were on the fence in trusting the MSM before, but now?  Pretty much NO ONE trusts them - and it’s not ambiguous.  It’s not like a “maybe, maybe not” at the point.  More people distrust the MSM than literally ever before - and the fact is that this is in large part because of the damming information that Wikileaks has released.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To put all the credit in wikileaks is just ignorant to me.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wikileaks isn’t getting “all the credit”.  However, they seem to be the ones that pushed the snowball down the mountain when no one else was doing it, and even though perhaps “anyone” could have tipped that little snowball over, it seems it was in fact Wikileaks that did it, and the fact of the matter is that that little snowball is now turning into a big ass avalanche.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn’t really matter whether it was Wikileaks or whoever or whatever other source at this point.  Doesn’t matter.  The point is that the damning information is
       <em>
        out there
       </em>
       now - and as far as the Podestas, the Clintons, and elite, heinous pedophilia and child abuse go? all the information is turning out to be in point of fact very true.  Therefore, the
       <em>
        source
       </em>
       that released that damning information about he Podestas and the Clintons and the elite and pedophiles, etc, etc, has to be looked upon as having at least a decent amount of credibility because they’ve in point of fact released information that thus far has seemed to out to be very true.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it’s true that believing everything that a certain person is saying is ignorant, it’s also just as if not even more ignorant still to not believe in
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       that person is stating if that person’s already proven themselves to be very accurate and truthful person up to this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, the proof is in the pudding, and thus far, Wikileaks has shown that various things it’s reported on
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed true and valid.

       In a lot of people's mind wikileaks word is higher than ever right now and they release bare minimum information.  A lot if not most of this pedo shit is wikileaks doing and to me it could be smoke and mirrors to hide mire sinister shit. The vatican almist has a free pass right now and they were the largest group of sick fucks out there before this. Hypothetically if this all has been brought to light to take the light off other people with them already knowing there was noway to connect the people now involved that would make sense to me. Especially with the high standing wikileaks was set up to have. At this point they could easily be a puppet on the string as well. If we both agree 2 party system is false then either way they win and we still lose so its easy for me to assume most of this recent stuff is absolutely bullshit.  The common thing is we all are still losing. Just for example look how this vault 7 shit was blown up to be virtually nothing and they pretty much got away with it again.

       Seriously?  What on Earth could possibly be more sinister and evil for the human species than fucking and molesting and destroying its children?  Apparently you don’t understand that children are the absolute, number one most important, most valuable asset that the human species can produce - for without them, there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       no human species.  As such, any system that systematically abuses them is about the worst that there can possibly ever be for humanity.  If you don’t have a healthy population of children and can’t protect them, then you simply won’t continue for too long as an organism.  Period.

       Yeah.  Big difference there though because a lot of it was just a SHIT ton of hearsay and an occasional MSM blip about some obscure priest that got caught, but then was quickly carted away and hidden behind vatican walls and never covered again by the MSM.  Pizzagate is a

       Correct.  However, the “game” isn’t over yet and we (the people) haven’t yet actually lost.  We’re currently losing - yes - but we shouldn’t give up and give in and just let TPTB do whatever the fuck they want to us.  We shouldn’t think we have “no chance against them ever” because that simply isn’t true.

       Do you think I'm saying things somehow "stop" with Pizzagate?  I KNOW you're not saying that...right?  If you are, then you are

       much misinterpreting what I've been getting at.

       Nobody's even implying that Pizzagate is "the top of the order".  Not even a little bit.  It
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       seem that they're hiding a lot of powerful people that are into pedophilia, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking them down won't take down ALL pedophilia on the planet.  Of course not.  Who's saying that?
      </p>
      <p>
       However, taking down who they're tied to seems like it would indeed deal a significant blow to the pedophilia operations going on in at least the U.S.

       We should never trust any source 100%, but there has been valuable information leaked through wikileaks. Yes, most was already guessed at, and a lot was already known, but even in these cases the leaks still have evidentiary value. Also, leaks like cablegate and the Stratfor files (among others) really did fill in blanks and add specific information to our knowledge of how our governments really work in contrast to the facade they show us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think there is still important data yet to be discovered in what has already been released.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, my biggest problem with wikileaks is that it would be very easy for a third party to use wikileaks to selectively release information that would benefit their own interest under the guise of a leak. Either way, I wish Julian Assange and everyone with the organization long, healthy and free lives, they have certainly provided a needed service in the face of the greatest of personal risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we need now are more organizations like wikileaks to make it harder for gov't's and corporations to stifle.
