Despite a very vocal opposition of redditors eager to defend pedophiles I&#39;m seeing alot of arrests being made. I can&#39;t say for sure whether it&#39;s related to pizzagate directly but there is definitely an uptick in awareness to the issue and real children are being saved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I was lurking in a thread over on /pol/ when this first started to break. I remember everyone being like shocked at what was unrolling in front of our eyes.</p>

<p>And to think, had Podesta just come up with a reasonable explanation for those coded emails this could have likely put out the fire. Instead, we got a media push on the term fake news which backfired in a huge way on them. </p>

<p>The last couple days, especially after watching Trumps media lambasting, it&#39;s starting to feel like the pendulum is swinging in the just direction.</p>

Basically, if they can&#39;t fight the truth with lies head-on, then they&#39;ll make the truth look ridiculous by associating it with something crazy. <em>That&#39;s</em> what you have to worry about.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s only so much manpower among them to be effective. How many &quot;keyboard warriors&quot; can they put towards the effort?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could be on to something</p>

<p>Found this on urban dictionary so take it with some salt</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comet. kom-it Noun.
1. A person that passes through your life repeatedly who is intense and awesome, and when gone you are still in contact with that person in some way but they are not a continuous partner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have found there is a hole in the poly lexicon. The term &quot;play partner&quot; doesn&#39;t fit non-casual partners. Play sounds trite. Some of these relationships can span years and even decades. Some are very deep, with a combination of intimacy, friendship, admiration, and shared history. Poly circles use the term &quot;play and pause&quot; which also doesn&#39;t fit many of my &quot;comets&quot; as I don&#39;t pause. Many I stay in touch with daily or weekly.</p>

<p>Some comets come by every 18 months when the schedules line up or, to continue the metaphor, when the stars align. I have even heard some use the term partner-partner. As in, &quot;they are a partner but not like a partner-partner.&quot; This is an example of that awkward lack of a term for someone who is somewhere between fully in your life at all times and a casual play play partner, that you like, but don’t have an ongoing connection with.
Ana is excited to have her comet Fredrico visit because they have hot sex and a deep connection. This is despite him living in Granada Spain and focusing on his poetry, while Ana lives in Seattle with her primary. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;ping pong&quot; is code for the act of hooking up with the opposite gender.
Hey. do you wanna play ping pong with me in the basement? </p>

<p>They&#39;re not, people just attach pizzagate to any arrest now, even if it happens in fucking Sweden.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me sir, some people online accuse you of being a pedophile because they think you&#39;re creepy. You are now under investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>You are all not only pushing a police state, but literally frothing at the mouth to do it because THERE ARE CHILDREN BEING HARMED RIGHT NOW!! The fact that there isn&#39;t any evidence of that is secondary. </p>

<p>Think about why pizzagate is pushed so hard reposted information is on the front page every day. For fucks sake it was stickied on the day Flynn resigned! When has this sub ever pushed something that hard. </p>

<p>It was a pool, but it&#39;s always mentioned as a hot tub because that makes it creeper. </p>

<p>And what are you supposed to do when literally half the posts in this sub are about pizzagate but there is still no accuser, no victim, no witness, no parents of victims, no former employees collaborating anything or any evidence of any illegal activity. </p>

<p>Everything about pizzagate is just &quot;look how creepy this is! Clearly a pedo.&quot; Is a witch hunt. </p>

<p>I mean you literally just went through five years of my posting history rather than refute anything I said. </p>

<p>Holy shit it&#39;s insanity. It&#39;s a political witch hunt, a moral panic and Boston bomber type Internet detective shenanigans all wrapped up in the biggest ball of bullshit I&#39;ve ever seen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly the real witch hunt is the persecution of anyone who even mentions pizzagate, and that&#39;s what has me thinking that there is a truth to this matter. </p>

<p>Ben Swann? What happened to him after the segment? If it&#39;s such nonsense, why did the segment need to be taken down?</p>

<p>Why did the fakenews term pop up immediately after pizzagate? It backfired spectacularly, but the timing of it is exceptional. </p>

<p>Why did Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast 911 not show up immediately in Podcasts app, was not on most popular podcasts, etc.? </p>

<p>Why did pizzagate subreddit get shut down and have to move to voat? There&#39;s still no evidence of doxxing being posted, even if you claim that there was. </p>

<p>Why did the child porn on twitter incident get completely ignored? It was child pornography found to be rampant on one of the largest social media platforms today?</p>

<p>The real test here is to do a thought experiment of - if you were a reporter, would you report on this? I definitely would. If it were so easily disproven I would blast it on the news 24/7, invite pizzagaters and embarrass them on my show. This simply has not happened because pizzagate is being hushed. The last reasonable attempt just to cover pizzagate on the media was deleted off the channel entirely and the reporter had to remove all his social media. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the real witch hunt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about this perspective then. Pizzagate potentially is a red herring but based in lots of facts but with some of the wrong targets. Also what if it is just a small part of a much larger picture and this is actually still the &quot;small part&quot; that can be afforded to be the false positive, especially with the election being over and winner and losers decided. I am not pro trump nor Russia, I am pro skepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite...Gematria is a real system of applying numerical values to letters to find the sum total to see if the number has significance. These numerical values per letter are pre determined and are not up to a person to decide on the stop. If they make up their own than sure they could be &quot;looking for coincidence&quot; but for pizzagate to add up to 666 in English gematria, that truly is an astonishing coincidence.</p>

<p>Try it for yourself...I did and it&#39;s true. I did not set the values for regular (not simple) Gematria letters. I assume that happened many years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the point is you why gematria? There are endless ways to apply numerical values to words. As well, why &#39;pizzagate&#39; specifically?

    <div class="md"><p>But none of those (that I&#39;m aware of) equal 666. Sure you could make up your own type of system to derive that number from words you want but not all words can equal that in any of the forms of the established forms of gematria. I don&#39;t even use it. Just saw the coincidence and pointed it out.</p>

<p>As for why &quot;pizzagate&quot; I can only speculate but if someone chose that word specifically to equal that value I would guess it&#39;s because it is an intangible movement of &quot;forces&quot; not a specific object. Manipulation of energy and forces is the point of &#39;magik&#39; and gematria is a form of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand it isn&#39;t the original type, but the values set for English gematria were set years ago. Even if it &quot;doesn&#39;t work&quot; in some spiritual sense, could it not be used as a simple sort of code? The fact is that if you take the pre determined values in English gematria and add up pizzagate it equals 666. So that is certainly a strange coincidence at the least, no? Not sure what it means though just pointing out the coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is indeed weird, but consider that English uses numerals to represent the numbers, and I think it always has.  Hebrew does not, and never has.  The letters and the numbers are the same thing, in a sort of superposition state, and they have been that way since the the language emerged.  There is a foundational, integral interrelationship of letter and number in Hebrew that simply isn&#39;t present in English.  That&#39;s why Gematria works in its original language.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we can encode the letters of English however we want, without affecting the meaning of the words themselves, because the English language doesn&#39;t have that same fundamental interrelationship between letter and number.  It&#39;s a contrived system, not one that evolved with the language itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, makes sense, thanks. So a word could possibly be chosen to represent a desired number you wish to encode in English gematria. In Hebrew Gematria it adds up to 1183. I am not aware of any significance of that number but would be interested in hearing from someone who might understand this form of Gematria better, that could explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yeah, but what I&#39;m saying is that English (and any language that uses numerals to represent numbers) isn&#39;t particularly well-adapted to the use of gematria in the first place.

<p>Okay.  I listened to Trump make speeches and statements and that&#39;s how I formed my opinion of the man.  It&#39;s obvious that, by his own statements, that he is the antithesis of Sanders (save two stances).  I really don&#39;t care who you voted for, believe it or not.  What I&#39;m interested in is if you really supported Sanders&#39; policies, how do you rationalize support for Trump.  I had a pretty in depth discussion with another poster here about this and it fascinates me.</p>

<p>That Pizzagate hinges on a code from 4chan. That people believe those involved to be brilliant and nefarious masterminds while simultaneously posting supposed incriminating information via social media.  That no one has come forward, that there are no victims or witnesses, that there is no proof of an actual crime being committed by those involved.

I would venture to say that 3 FBI agents and 2 days would deliver some of the most shocking news the world has ever heard.

<p>You rationalize choice based on the unfurling of personal awareness and/or information. It&#39;s basic humanity. You do not seek to prove what you think, rather what is real.</p>

<p>Pizzagate hinges on codes and symbols. The FBI identified the symbols, and I, myself, have confirmed the code on the dark web.

<p>I&#39;m objective in my research.  There is no evidence a crime took place.  Now, here&#39;s the part where you have no argument so you attack my character.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve spent all of your time in an echo chamber, accustomed to not having your ideas challenged.  Your critical thinking and reading comprehension are muscles that you&#39;re going to lose if you don&#39;t start using them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to have an earnest discussion with you, but all you do is deflect and attack my character for looking at information objectively.  It&#39;s apparent that you&#39;re not reading, let alone comprehending what I&#39;m saying.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your effort on a message board proves to me you like to fuck kids. I don&#39;t have the energy for this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This hyperbolic bullshit proves to me that you&#39;re no lawyer.  Every time you make a weak statement and you&#39;re called on it, you attack someone&#39;s character instead of the argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is your sticking point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve addressed this... five times?  You can go back and try and read.  You&#39;ve yet to respond to a single point and that you&#39;ve ignored it is telling.  You really need to leave your echo chamber more often and if I were you, I&#39;d spend a bit of time doing some introspection.  I&#39;m well aware of my faults and I try hard to keep myself honest in discussions of a political nature, but you&#39;re close to being a full blown demagogue.</p>

<p>This makes me think that this is a hyper-partisan witch hunt fueled by confirmation and selection bias.  Do you really believe that you could convict Podesta of pedophilia and child trafficking in court?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Learn law. It&#39;s easier than you might think.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right!  Clearly, you&#39;ve just got me completely outclassed!  That you&#39;ve had to resort to ad homonem and other logical fallacies in this discussion casts a large shadow of doubt that you&#39;re actually a lawyer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you do all those weird quotes. Secondly, what possesses you to rail so hard against something that has more evidence than anything you have or will see on this sub? What is your sticking point, pedobear?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your arguments are weak as fuck. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t think a childless homosexual posting pictures like that is evidence of criminal activity, you are not even close to understanding the world around you. Go outside. Make a friend. Get a girlfriend you love. Make a child. Then come talk to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that I&#39;ll avoid life lessons coming from a confused teenager.</p>

<p>Says the guy who can&#39;t argue without copious amounts of logical fallacies.  That you speak so confidently of who I am when you know so little is hilarious.</p>

<p>45 seconds to type out a post.  Discover what, by the way?  That, from your post history, you&#39;re a demagogue?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve done a piss poor job of it.</p>

<p>I have a pointed interest in the truth, not some hyper partisan witch hunt led by intellectually dishonest sheep.  After looking at your post history one could say that this is an exercise in confirmation bias for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are barking up the wrong tree, bub.</p>

<p>You&#39;re just salty that this isn&#39;t some echo chamber that will lap up all your bullshit.  </p>

<p>Your weak asa arguments and logical fallacies have already shown everyone that reads this thread just how much you care about the truth.</p>

I honestly can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re trolling me or not at this point.  I&#39;ve given you some specific reasons that I cannot just accept the ideas espoused by &quot;investigators&quot;.

<li><p>I&#39;ll quote myself and point out that you&#39;ll attack me again and commit yet another logical fallacy.</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;ll commit said fallacy and ask me to link the reasons that I don&#39;t buy into Pizzagate.</p></li>

Your verbiage made it transparent for me, but the rest will have irrefutable proof that you&#39;re just a demagogue with no real argument. </p>

<p>Antinous is the symbol of pederasty. I would track down the children and the pictures and use law enforcement to extract information. Are you jealous that I have a real job, a real wife, and real kids?</p>

<p>How long have you lived with your mother after you graduated high school? He did not stand for gay. He stood for fucking kids. I am waiting, too. Someone who has no idea how the process works is talking to me about probable cause to an investigation. What a fuck cock. I could slay him for indecency with a child based on IG pics alone. All I need is names and depos of said deponents. HAHAHAHAHA. Jesus Christ son, do you even know what discovery is?</p>

<p>HAHAHAHHASHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</p>

<p>How long have you been with your mommy?</p>

<p>If you do not even know who Antinous is, you do not have a fucking clue what is even going on. I suspect something different. I suspect you are a pedo as well. I could find these kids names in 24 hours, bud. Too easy. Do you have a job? </p>

<p>And Antinous is indeed a gay icon. Read the Wikipedia article. I&#39;ve looked at it before. He was the young lover of Hadrian. However,  the symbol of Antinous is not known to be used by pedophiles. Maybe you can show me a pedophile who has used that symbol and prove me wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following this conspiracy theory since day 1, and have continued following it on here, 4chan, and voat whenever new &quot;evidence&quot; emerges that I see pizzagate people going crazy over. Not a single piece of that &quot;evidence&quot; has EVER been anything that actually points to the guilt of the accused parties involved.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve also been following conspiracies in general for over a decade now, and I&#39;m well aware of previous pedophile rings and even pedophiles among the &quot;elites&quot; working in government. I&#39;m not denying that any of that stuff exists...I&#39;m solely talking about whether or not Alefantis is running a child sex trafficking ring out of comet pizza/ping pong. And I don&#39;t believe he is. It&#39;s fine if you want to disagree, but I think we BOTH need to acknowledge the fact that NEITHER of us can know the truth yet. He COULD be innocent or he COULD be guilty...I just happen to think it&#39;s much more likely that he&#39;s innocent of raping/torturing/eating children and selling them to others for those same purposes.</p>

<p>My main problem is with the people who aren&#39;t even willing to acknowledge the POSSIBILITY that he could be innocent. The people who have already convinced themselves 100% of his guilt. Those are potentially dangerous people. Once you&#39;re 100% convinced that someone is DEFINITELY guilty of raping/torturing/killing/eating children, and you see that law enforcement won&#39;t step in to do something about it...that&#39;s when shit gets dangerous. I know if I were 100% convinced of something like that, I&#39;d have trouble sleeping every night knowing that I KNOW where this guy lives/works and what he does for a living and I wasn&#39;t doing anything about it. And I&#39;m not even mentally unstable...so THAT is why it&#39;s dangerous.</p>

<p>Btw, I wasn&#39;t surprised at all when I first heard about Cosby. I always kinda thought that dude was a bit off and kinda creepy even when I was a kid. Maybe I just have a good sense for that kinda thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that remains the CRUX of pizzagate, is it not? Pedesta and Alefantis, with an entire ring/organization of other &quot;highly suspicious&quot; people surrounding them. If it weren&#39;t for the fact that MANY people accepted the original &quot;evidence&quot; against them as very legitimate, then it wouldn&#39;t have spawned a whole community of &quot;investigators&quot; in the first place. I&#39;ve been voicing my disagreement here since day 1, and the weeks following.

I don&#39;t blindly trust MSM in the slightest, and I gather my information from a wide variety of sources. I always question the various biases of ANY individual source when gathering information.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just really funny that you people believe that anyone who comes to different conclusions than you regarding the legitimacy of &quot;evidence&quot; put forth so far surrounding pizzagate must either be a shill or part of the &quot;brainwashed masses&quot;. That is so incredibly fucking closed-minded and ignorant in itself. I could say the same thing about the echo chamber within r/conspiracy or r/the_donald or r/politics or any other online community or source of information. Anyone who blindly follows the majority opinion of ANY of these places isn&#39;t very intelligent, imo. Confirmation bias runs rampant in the information age. Everyone is guilty of it to some extent, including myself...but at least I actually acknowledge that fact and actively attempt to counter it within my own independent research techniques by carefully analyzing all sides of the argument and never becoming dogmatic in my beliefs one way or the other. I ALWAYS leave open the possibility that I might be wrong. And that&#39;s more than I can say for most people around here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS. PizzaGate hasn&#39;t lead to one child being saved or one trafficker being put in jail.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there are actual anti human trafficking organizations like THORN doing great work. PG likes to take credit for all the pedo takedowns but it&#39;s actually Ashton Kutcher&#39;s THORN organization that&#39;s been responsible for the identification of 2000 child victims in just the last year.</p>

<p>And PizzaGate people actually ATTACK the REAL people and law enforcement taking down pedos. It&#39;s disgusting. Look how they downvoted this post just because it through a wrench into their stupid narrative:</p>

Read somewhere that the Isralies bugged the hell outta Lolita Express and Epsteins Island to extort U.S. people with power.  It&#39;s insanity.  This is either going to make, or break the world man.

    <div class="md"><p>This time last year, I was blowin&#39; up the tubes about how Donald Trump managed to summon an <em>egrigoros</em>, essentially a semi-sentient memetic golem, and had commanded it to make him President.  This, it turns out, is exactly what happened, but it&#39;s more likely that it was his <em>supporters</em> did the summoning, because they learned <em>just</em> enough about ritual magick to be dangerous.</p>

<p>Think about the amount of power fucking /pol/ was able to manifest in this world, and then consider that there may be a driving force a few layers inside PG that predates Donald Trump by <em>thousands of years</em> and is now getting sunshine pointed at it.</p>

<p>To call what&#39;s about to happen &quot;nuclear&quot; is like calling an actual nuclear weapon a &quot;firecracker&quot;.</p>

<p>They come out swinging and just completely on the offensive over the issue.</p>

<p>If theres a 1% chance this pizza gate thing is true we need to put 100% effort into finding the truth out. Not make jokes and dismiss it as easily as we do to those who believe we live on a flat earth.</p>

<p>Do more research and understand PizzaG8 is more than just a story about a pizza place it&#39;s about shutting down the trafficking and rape of children </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No its not. It tried to change into that because Tyner pizza place was nothing and rather than say &quot;well guess I was wrong about that&quot; supports said it&#39;s about ALL child trafficking, so they can now never be wrong about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? It&#39;s all related. CP, kids getting abused, sold, traded... It&#39;s all in the same realm. What I&#39;m saying is if enough &quot;normal&quot; people get arrested for all this type of stuff, it detracts from the real elites who are also guilty. I don&#39;t want them to be forgotten by mainstream because of the other progress being made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most effective method for them would be &quot;poisoning the well&quot;. Basically, if they can&#39;t fight the truth with lies head-on, then they&#39;ll make the truth look ridiculous by associating it with something crazy. <em>That&#39;s</em> what you have to worry about.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s only so much manpower among them to be effective. How many &quot;keyboard warriors&quot; can they put towards the effort?</p>

<p>That&#39;s why they loved the legacy media. It was a centralized and easy to control. The Internet? Not so much.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is real. Podesta is a satanic abuser of children. CPP, Buck&#39;s, Besta, Pegasus, et. al are major players in the DC field. If this truth is not self-evident, man, please tell me what is your sticking point. I am about making believers or being proved wrong. I don&#39;t want enemies or fracture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But none of those (that I&#39;m aware of) equal 666. Sure you could make up your own type of system to derive that number from words you want but not all words can equal that in any of the forms of the established forms of gematria. I don&#39;t even use it. Just saw the coincidence and pointed it out.</p>

<p>As for why &quot;pizzagate&quot; I can only speculate but if someone chose that word specifically to equal that value I would guess it&#39;s because it is an intangible movement of &quot;forces&quot; not a specific object. Manipulation of energy and forces is the point of &#39;magik&#39; and gematria is a form of that.</p>
