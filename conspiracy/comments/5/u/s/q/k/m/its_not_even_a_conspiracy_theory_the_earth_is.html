       so provoke it with facts.  show us where we are wrong.  If you want to discuss, discuss.  and don't get mad at me pointing out your account age.  Ive seen accounts that were just made that posted amazing posts supported by data and thought.  What did you put into yours?

      <p>
       Here are some questions to ask yourselves in regards to FE:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         When you look through a telescope at any of the other planets for long enough, why are you able to see them and their moons clearly as round, with a shadow cast as a ball has a shadow, right in front of your eyes?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How are you able to see their moons orbit them if they are not round?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How are you able to see Saturn's rings encircle its globe if it's not round?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How are you able to see their poles change angle toward you in three dimensions if not round?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How are you able to see the large planets like Jupiter and Saturn clearly spin about their axes if not round?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How are you able to see them pass behind the Sun if not orbiting it?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         These are all things that you, personally, can go and look at plainly through common telescopes. So:
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       IF we can all at least agree that the OTHER planets and moons we look at are round, (since each of you can look at them yourselves and clearly see that they are with your own eyes), is it more likely or less likely that Earth would be an exception among all of them, and be the only planet that behaves differently?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Or does FE claim that Earth is not a planet, but something else entirely???
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the earth is flat, why is it that Euclidean Geometry does not work to obtain the shortest path over long distances (such as those traveled by airplanes)?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       9a. To further that question, how can it be that a parabola actually produces the shorter route, if the surface is not curved? Why does only non-Euclidean geometry work for determining shortest travel distances over long paths? Are you claiming such is not the case?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why must GPS satellites calculate positions based on a sphere in order to perform accurately?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What is Sunset on a flat earth? How could it occur geometrically and still explain how half of the earth is night and half day?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Please describe the ice wall that you're saying exists instead of the south pole. How high is it? Can one fly over it? When one does fly over it, does one fly off into space?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Are you then claiming that we can launch ourselves into space by flying perpendicular to the "earth's upward acceleration?" merely by flying off over this ice wall?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

        <p>
         Has the FE ice wall ever been documented as observed in any way? Anything? Even one photo or report from the field somehow?

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Also then describe how it's possible that so many photos could be so SEVERELY distorted by a regular lens so as to make a flat object look round, with parts of it fully behind other parts of it and not exposed to the camera, while objects adjacent to it are hardly distorted at all.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

         Are you saying that literally ALL photographs ever taken of the earth have been faked or subject to extreme lens distortion?

       <li>
        <p>
         If you're willing to accept even one photo of anything ever at all (that you didn't take yourself), why are photos of the round earth excluded?

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If we're not accepting photographs, please at least explain the most likely reason why there have been NONE of a flat earth, EVER, and ONLY photos of a round one.

         If the earth is not round, and planets not round, then why is it that we must use calculations based on orbits of round objects in order to place satellites into space adequately?

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why is it that we can see those satellites orbit us with a common telescope, and how do they lose direct line of sight if not dropping behind the curve of a round earth?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why is it that we must calculate based on those orbits and related signal loss to make our phones work?

       <li>
        <p>
         If the earth is not round, and planets not round, then why have we had to use spherical/orbital calculations in order to successfully land rovers on other planets? Are you claiming that we have not done such?

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the earth is not round and gravity does not exist, then what keeps us from losing our atmosphere and ocean?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Are the seas supposedly contained by this ice wall?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Since the atmosphere would surely be above such ice wall, what prevents it from spilling off over the sides of the earth, into space, as the earth accelerates up toward the atmosphere?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the earth is flat, then how is it that if I fly in any direction along a straight line from any point and don't stop, I will eventually return to exactly where I started from? Do you claim that this will not occur?

         Astronauts have been to space and claimed to have looked at an unmistakably round earth. If you reject their photographic evidence, do you also claim they are lying or delusional about what they have seen??

      <p>
       Gravity always pulls matter to the center of mass. So a disc shaped world would simply collapse. If the earth was made out of indestructible materials that somehow can resist gravity, you would still have the problem that the further you get to the edge of the world, the more it would feel like walking upwards, as the gravity pulls everything to the discs center. You could even easily stand
       <em>
        on
       </em>
       pizza earths outer edge and walk along with it all the way around.

       Serious question.  Why don't we have actual footage or photos of the earth in whole?  You indicate we can see the others spin.  We can do pretty amazing things. Its just been suspect to me that there are no actual pics or vids of earth doing the stuff we say it does.  Unless I'm completely off base and there are tons of these that I just haven't seen.  I resisted even reading flat earth stuff until recently. There actually are some really good questions.  And there are some simple things that would prove fe wrong but we dont have that. Just feels like something is off.

       I could do this all day. The way flat earthers like to discuss is to either ignore 99% of the points you make or simply calling everything by NASA etc. fake. There's really no point in discussing with them as I'm  sure that almost all of them are trolls. A few of them are lost though Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
