       Ok, so we've all seen this link, right?

       I believe this was spread on social media intentionally to acclimate us to this new "war on human trafficking" we are going to see. Also, remember the DHS public service announcement regarding trafficking?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PNkl4B7rvHY">
        https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PNkl4B7rvHY
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we are being primed for something, it seems like they are acclimating us to human trafficking and putting the spotlight on it for a reason. The establishment, in a desperate fit, needs to somehow shift the attention from them and their involvement in child abuse, and instead, find a way to brand them as part of the solution to this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been seeing arrests all week for low level scumbags, and this Kutcher video will only add more publicity and attention to the topic. So, as we see more and more arrests regarding human trafficking happen, the media will report them. They want the masses to
       <strong>
        trust
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        believe
       </strong>
       that the system largely works in busting these people, and that they are on our side. The higher ups could NEVER be implicated in this, right? They want the people to see examples of traffickers being busted, so they can say,
      </p>
      <p>
       "Whew, ok, I'm glad the problem is being taken care of, the system DOES care about me and the children".
      </p>
      <p>
       They are trying to get that reaction out of people ^
      </p>
      <p>
       It will divert our attention from exposing the pedophilia that is rampant within DC right under our noses. If they give the impression that they are on the offensive to stop pedophilia/trafficking, and sincerely are trying to raise awareness, then nobody will suspect THEM of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as you see people on social media sharing that video, copy the Pizzagate hashtag in there or share the Ben Swann video. Red pill as many people as you can. We need to associate this viral video, with our findings regarding Pizzagate and our investigation.

       I agree with you, as there are people zealously posting this past week stories about people arrested for 'Sexual trafficking' when they were simple one offs, one was a statutory rape of a 15 year old by a 24 year old guy.  Seems a lot of over-reaction with the term.  it is unclear to my why.

       These operations busted 474, 178, 160, 168, 108, 42, 22, and hundreds of children all in the past three weeks. Why are you lying about this to minimize it?

       Focus on my point, which was that TPTB may be trying to desensitize us to the term 'trafficking' by making it a common term that is overused and ergo, ignored by public.

       Of course we are.  There are busts, large busts happening everywhere.  Do you feel when I point out that there are people using 'human trafficking' to describe small arrests, that it means the large ones aren't happening?

       I am not lying or minimizing anything.  You are so frustrating.  Have you not seen the other posts that mention the one offs?  Why are you so defensive?  Did you not see my mention about the post about the 1 girl with the 1 guy?

       Relax.  No one is trying to crap on your thread, you are doing a super job, albeit a bit touchy.

       Your previous comment:

        I agree with you, as there are people zealously posting this past week stories about people arrested for 'Sexual trafficking' when they were simple one offs, one was a statutory rape of a 15 year old by a 24 year old guy.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When describing the posts about busts made in here the past week, did you include the posts where dozens and hundreds were busted in yes, sexual trafficking (why did you put that in quotes?), or did you just mention two small individual incidents? Why did you only talk about those two small non stories when there have been huge busts happening in this past week?

       I put it in quotes because people were posting about arrests for 'sexual trafficking' for small busts and one offs, including an instance of a 24 year old statutorially raping his 15 year old girlfriend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally do not consider small cases like that, especially when it's a guy and his girlfriend 'sexual trafficking'.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were a lot of posts about the large busts too!  I do not want anyone to think I am saying there were not.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my point that you missed ages ago was that I was saying there are people here that are trying to dilute the use of the term 'sexual trafficking' by using it for small busts.  You should be dogging them and not me.  I am the guy really trying to work with you.

       they do get upvotes.  Why do you say they don't get upvotes?  Seems any post with 'human trafficking' in it gets upvoted, even the non trafficking ones.  They were using it during superbowl to describe hooker busts too.  Just another example.

       No, trump is the plucky, innocent "good guy" who is facing down the evil faceless organization that is the United States government. Until he took office, pedophile rings were able to operate freely and in the open.

       Exactly. And weren't there underage girls in the changing room when he did that?

       I dunno if the guy buys his stuff from the same pizza parlours as Podesta and all them, but I'd be shocked if the guy isn't a big fan of pizza just the same.

       Nah, there's more than a few blind Trump supporters here. Still others who don't like him but believe he's not involved in that stuff too. I think people like you and me are a minority even here. There was a woman who accused Trump of raping her when she was 13 years old and I'm willing to believe it. Not sure if he's directly in the same circles as the pizza lovers we've been looking at, but I think he's probably done horrible things of a similar nature.

       Trump supporters will tell you that Trump hates Epstein. They love telling an anecdote about Trump catching Epstein creeping on a young girl and they say Trump kicked the guy out of his establishment. I'm not so sure about all that. That said, it is worth noticing that although Bill Clinton shows up literally dozens of times on the flight logs for Epstein's "Lolita Express", Trump isn't on any such list. At the very least, I think it's safe to say that Trump isn't deep into the same exact social circles even the guy likes pizza just as much the rest of those sick freaks.

       Right that's what I'm saying. He may not be part of the DC ring, but I'm always thinking big picture, I wish the shills would understand that sometimes (not that it really matters, they're going to attack me regardless).  But, he is a wealthy and powerful guy, who clearly has a sexual appetite, and there is no doubt in my mind that he is not only aware of child abuse, trafficking, and sex with underage girls, but I'd be willing to bet Trump has definitely at LEAST had sex with underage girls 12-15 on Epsteins Jet. Remember, he's in the black book. This needs to be talked about more.

       Yeah it's fucking annoying, but it's a nessecary precaution now. I remember a few years back when this sub almost got banned for "brigading" because people would post normal links and then vote on the link (which shouldn't be against the rules, that's how reddit works ffs, but whatever). #ChairmanPao

       The "he is being used" angle seems most likely - especially because of his project called
       <a href="https://www.wearethorn.org">
        thorn

       . It has two less than desirable board members named Ray Chambers and Ernie Hall (both deep state).

       (Just sharing a comment from a post on TIL that got locked)
      </p>
      <p>
       Ashton Kutcher once hosted a 3 day hackathon in San Francisco to develop software to aid the fight against human trafficking a couple years ago, which I went to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought people would be star struck, asking for autographs, and Ashton would leave after delivering some opening remarks and posing for photos. Since it was a Friday evening, maybe he'd have some fun in the city before flying back to Hollywood and Mila I thought. To be honest, I went partially because I've never seen a celebrity before.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no. His opening speech was full of emotion and passion, and everyone listened intently. He stayed the ENTIRE fucking weekend, sitting all day(s) long right in the middle of the devs, ate with them, talking with them and basically being a bro. And we're talking about a diverse crowd filled with people with backgrounds from all over the world. I kid you not he almost didn't seem to leave the building except to sleep for those 3 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a single person asked for an autograph to the best of my knowledge. I didn't see him pose for any photos. Not a single off topic question was asked. Ashton effing Kutcher set the tone that he was here to get down to business, to help the victims of the sex trade, and everyone followed his lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when time came to judge the projects, he didn't pay attention to the abstract, flashy ones, but awarded prizes to 'boring' yet really helpful software that would actually help police. First prize was software that could track bitcoin payments made by sex traffickers. Second prize was a simple service that aggregated terminology and slangs sex traffickers and pedos would use.
      </p>
      <p>
       And at the end, he was so amazed by how quickly people made progress, that he announced on the spot, 3 grants worth a 100K each for a year, for 3 people to come work with him on this project, funded by him. A line of people signed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day I still remember the emotion in his opening talk, and his heartfelt gratitude in his closing one. Pretty sure there were some tears. No matter what anyone says, Ashton Kutcher completely changed my perception of him that weekend.

       Don't forget he was also behind the series punk'd.  Kunis was also married to Culkin previously who was likely a victim of childhood abuse in Hollywood.  But she is also heavily linked to degenarate Seth McFarlane who thinks that this kind of abuse should be normalized through comedy.  Don't quite know what to make of those links but I do know that cyber security firms often have similar hack invites to strengthen their systems.

       I had the same thought. When I initially watched it, I thought it was a really good speech and he was being sincere. But then I remembered he's an actor and has been for quite sometime. That being said, I still feel like he's being sincere and that he is one of the good guys.

       Yeah, we were all surprised at how little tools there were for law enforcement. Ashton said we'd made more useful tools the past 3 days than his organization had done the past 2 years. Mainly because they didn't have dedicated software engineers. Which prompted the 100k grants.

       I just find it very hard to believe the NSA does not have these tools available to the enforcement agencies. 
I hope that these tools are intended for stopping human trafficking and not just the government running a americas got talent for finding tracking  software

       Yeah, but this was 2~3 years ago, and the first prize team was simply reading the open bitcoin transaction records that everyone else could see. I'm sure theres better tools now?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the second one, the slang/term aggregator was useful cause criminals change their terminology all the time. With the tool, law enforcement could easily add new terms that popped up. Honestly I'm not sure how exactly it helped. It seemed like the tool was just complex enough that you needed a software engineer to develop, but not ground breakingly useful to get the government to spend budget and build it themselves.

       Ah I meant the actual words being aggregated. I think there were words that pedos used for sex or child and some other really nasty stuff that they didn't feel comfortable putting it up on the screen.

       But yeah come to think of it we were all adults, should have shown.

      <p>
       And I'm not even sure if the winners created companies. Was wondering how do you monetize those projects. Only thing I remember is that first prize were some young asian american students or engineers. Second prize was a guy from India, and a two Americans.

       Honestly, its all true. I'd forgotten about this until I was reminded of it today. I was fired up after the hackathon, but it kinda died away as I got busy with real life. There were almost 100 people there, so maybe somebody else will corroborate.

       maybe he got excited because you and 99 other hackers just invented the dark net Facebook for him? Sorry I kind of believe you but the whole thing seems plannted quickly implemented out into the news cycle quickly in my dumb opinion , or I'm seeing patterbs when it's actually random disconnected events, hard to say which one is real. I think I'll go with your version because it's a positive story

       It's so hard to trust celebrities and their causes. Ashton is very much part of the Hollywood in ground. From your experience, it sounds like he has his heart in the right place -- so Kudos to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But honestly, if he really wanted to make an impact, he'd go after some of the people in that room. Or perhaps Pedowood. (That sesspool needs to be burnt the ground imho)

       Haha yeah I'd thought you'd say that. Its all true, but you prob won't believe me. I recommend going to any Thorn events, even better if Ashton is there, to judge for yourself whether he's sincere or not. Even I was surprised to see him still going strong with Thorn, and in front of the Senate.

       Ashton Kutcher is a member of the illuminati.  At a minimum, he would have seen a lot of shit he can't talk about.  (Possibly done worse, possibly also been used himself.)  On the public stage Hillary Clinton, all politicians, celebs etc bang on about helping children.  It's a deception.  Doesn't mean anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people--mostly non-entities--who do the trafficking (ie. the procurers of children) are one component, the customers who pony up the big bucks to use the children are another.  Celebs with all their money and "illuminati tastes" are members of this second club.  Don't be naive.  Don't let them reframe the issue of the existence of powerful paedophile networks as being only about muh "people trafficking".  Focus as much or more on the end customers, the pay-to-play child abusers.

       I want everyone to carefully consider the public mood that got Trump elected against any and all odds and how it was that every conceivable effort that was made to prevent that from ever happening had just the very opposite effect in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how long does anyone here suppose it will be before those at the very top of this human trafficking and pedophile network that exists within the government, mass media, and among the corporate and old money elites who all play their part in this multi-billion dollar criminal activity can last by trying to throw their minions and street level customers to the lions in order to deflect attention away from themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps I should ask how long it will be before some of their minions and customers who actually have some solid evidence against them get desperate enough to trade that information to escape having them do the same thing to them or else get caught in the ever expanding network of people that are all now hunting high and low for them and leaving no stone unturned as they go about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it apparent that the more that are arrested the larger and more prevalent both the problem and the public outrage and determination to see all these creatures hunted down and brought to justice wherever they may be is simply going to grow rather than be comforted or placated in any way by any of it? What are a few hundred arrests when we not only know there are thousands involved but at every conceivable level right up to the very top of this gigantic globalist pyramid scheme? Is it really separate and distinct from any of their others, or is it the true evil that all the others rest on and holds them together?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it obvious that P-gate has hit a nerve that these arrogant and nervy bastards never expected after having gotten away with so much of this for so long and profited so handsomely off of it in countless ways that they thought they were invincible and could continue to do it with absolute impunity?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what are we to make of the divine irony of the man whose middle name is "Achilles" of all things being in the very eye of this out of control firestorm that can consume them all if they can't manage to stop it? And they can't, you know. The hit on Achilles is a mortal wound. A stray arrow or perhaps something more that they and their whole criminal enterprise have been struck by and are already falling off the chariot that is going to flatten and finish them as they just as unexpectedly hit the ground... and at the very moment they were in the midst of celebrating their victory lap around all those they thought could never possibly touch them.

       Although it is always in round-about ways or held out at arms length so we can see it and ourselves more objectively, art always imitates life. Within the vast complexity of human nature with all of it's competing and conflicting motives there are only seven actual narratives at play and it's worthwhile to both know as well as see them at play in our own everyday life as well as in the world around you. If that possibility interests you enough a good place to get started is here...

       There is no way Ashton has become as successful, popular and wealthy as he has in Hollywood (how many Teen Choice Awards/MTV Awards has he gotten even into his 30s?) AND ALSO been a genuine, vocal advocate for anti-child trafficking. If he was sincere about his desire to help police track and arrest pedophiles his career would be DONE.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he is illuminati all the way and this cause of his is just controlled distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       He started his career in male modeling for Calvin Klein (which has long used its advertising to normalize child pornography)
      </p>
      <p>
       He then started his acting career on That 70s Show. He is currently married to Mila Kunis who was his costar and love interest. She "lied about her age" in order to get the job and was only 14 and playing Ashton's love interest (who was 20 at the time).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mila Kunis got into the industry very young and she dated Macaulay Culkin for 8 years. Macaulay Culkin has long been rumored to have been abused as a child actor and he currently has a band called Pizza Underground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ashton's co-star Wilmer Vladerrama and his co-investor in Dolce restaurant has always dated young celebs, including demi levato when she was 17 and he was 30. He also dated Mila Kunis while they were costars on That 70s Show. Oh, and he also dated Mandy Moore when she was 17 and he bragged about taking her virginity on Howard Stern.He also dated Lindsay Lohan before her 18th birthday. It's pretty clear that Ashton's close friend and business partner likes to sleep with underage girls and isn't shy about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, add the fact that Ashton took over for Charlie Sheen on Two And A Half Men (Sheen is a psychotic degenerate and has long been accused of raping Cory Haim). The fact that Ashton took over the role doesn't mean anything really. But since the show focused on two men and a kid living together, and Charlie is a murderous, raping pedo, I am highly suspect of anyone involved in that show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the fact that he was into Kabbalah, the weird stuff between him and Demi Moore's daughters and the fact that he is also connected to Silicon Valley pedos - it all starts to seem a little fishy to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, there is also this from his Wiki:
On April 16, 2009, Kutcher became the first Twitter user to reach more than 1 million followers, beating CNN in the site's "Million followers contest". However, there have been several reports that Twitter manipulated the contest's results by preventing users from "unfollowing" Kutcher or CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       In November 2011, Kutcher received much criticism for his tweet in response to the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal, calling the firing of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno "in poor taste".[70]

       I agree with everything in your post and you know, I hadn't thought of this earlier, but it'd be interesting to know what happens to those kids after they were "rescued" by Ashton.

       Of course we are.  There are busts, large busts happening everywhere.  Do you feel when I point out that there are people using 'human trafficking' to describe small arrests, that it means the large ones aren't happening?

       Yeah it's fucking annoying, but it's a nessecary precaution now. I remember a few years back when this sub almost got banned for "brigading" because people would post normal links and then vote on the link (which shouldn't be against the rules, that's how reddit works ffs, but whatever). #ChairmanPao

       I hear what you're saying, but how do we know the same people at the top aren't just taking out their low level competition?  I want to be as hopeful as you but I have a nagging suspicion that these things don't change.

       Ah I meant the actual words being aggregated. I think there were words that pedos used for sex or child and some other really nasty stuff that they didn't feel comfortable putting it up on the screen.

       But yeah come to think of it we were all adults, should have shown.

       And I'm not even sure if the winners created companies. Was wondering how do you monetize those projects. Only thing I remember is that first prize were some young asian american students or engineers. Second prize was a guy from India, and a two Americans.
