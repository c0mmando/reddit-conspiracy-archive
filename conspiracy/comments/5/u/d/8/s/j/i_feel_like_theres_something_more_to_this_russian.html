       Not just Trump aides talking to Russian officer, but also in the 11th hour Hillary's radical shift to condemn Russia. Now Russia is flexing their muscles militarily. Could we be on the verge of something big going on behind the scenes that nobody knows about?

       so many unknowns.  Got to admit that Russia's been more patient and quiet than I'd expect they would be with all the Russia hating from Hillary and misc others.  The weird ship off eastern seaboard is odd, but not unheard of.

       Hillary's big shift against Russia was to deflect on her email problems..

       By blaming the Russians it lays the narrative that If the Russians don't like Hillary, then she must be good....

      <p>
       If Russia is working with the Trump administration to work in concert to destroy terrorist organisations and they are reducing tensions, and then the Intelligence community goes and blows that up so they can reignite the cold war, why wouldn't Russia be threatened by that? Why would Russia not be threatened by a friendly government being replaced in a coup? And why shouldn't the US try to get along with Russia?

       well its either one of two things, its always happens and is completely normal but fits the narrative they are pushing so they report on it, or there's something bigger going on and these are just small clues.

       One trick I've learned since the narrative is switching so rapidly is to utilize the date range tool on Google.  Right now, the media is in a full court press with the propaganda.  They are pumping out articles so fast it is pushing old stuff on like page 3 or 4 of the search results (Google is also helping).  They also don't refer back to old articles that the same news outlet reported on previously (like you do see in in-depth investigative pieces).  Use the date filter and you can also google search in different countries which may give you another view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google has tried to remove the date range function twice (users backlashed).  I would not be surprised if they tried to do it again.

        &gt; The Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline plan was a "direct slap in the face" to Qatar's plans.

      <p>
       Maybe the Saudis are giving up on their threats now that the war looks to be going Assad's way. So now they get a leveraged deal for 19% the company with 25% down but they won't say this publicly or maybe ISIS turns back on their funders. They also aren't on the best of terms with Qatar publicly.

       I have no idea how Trump and team fit into all of this as it appears a lot of this was in motion before the election. Doesn't mean turn a blind eye to the rest of the Russian connections - maybe they are adjunctly related as a Plan B.

       One easy way to identify propaganda is when there is a major story like this energy deal (regardless of Trump), that doesn't even link back to it's

       I think the hidden Rosneft share probably went to Russian insiders.  A consortium of existing oligarchs with close ties to the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the current shit level of oil prices, I don't think Russia would sell off Rosneft unless there was a giant payoff for somebody on the inside.  When the price of oil rebounds, they will make an enormous profit.

       AS to Trump and Russia, I think they plan on overthrowing the central banking system by utilitizing American coal mines with the new process developed in Russia to turn coal in to gold, allowing them to eliminate our dependency on the banking cartel, and Middle eastern oil, and allowing us to return to the gold standard.

       I think you are pretty spot on but the motivations go a little deeper.  I've got a few sources in my other post in this thread.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         US wants petrodollar-friendly states controlling oil (Saudis, new-Iraq, new-Syria). Hillary/CGI wants the construction contracts to rebuild what the State Dept tears down. New regimes also need loans ($$).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Any bank not tied to the petrodollar is a threat to establishment (also think Libya).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Russia is a threat to the petrodollar because of oil/natural gas.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Saudis were also very pissed when Assad said no to the Qatar/SA/Turkey pipeline because Assad is aligned with the Russians.  They basically said they would fund ISIS and invade Syria because they said no.  (aside - interesting that Qatar is now in the Russian 19.5% sale deal... they aren't exactly besties with SA)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yep. And we fuel this so the State Dept can sell them weapons to perpetuate the above cycle.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Their actions are fairly reactionary until lately and would suggest self-preservation. Putin has to appear strong to his people.  But I'm not sure vastly expanding their influence and actively meddling like the US does is the goal.  Could be.  All the above has been very costly to them.  An argument could be made that the US tried to do the above in Ukraine.  If Africa had oil we sure would focus on the atrocities that are happening there.

       We should research the timeline of Russian relations.

       If I recall, when Obama was elected, he wanted to "reset" relations with Russia.  Syria happened but we were still cool on other things.  Then Snowden.  Then Ukraine.  Then this current shitshow where nobody knows which way is up and everyone has two right hands.
