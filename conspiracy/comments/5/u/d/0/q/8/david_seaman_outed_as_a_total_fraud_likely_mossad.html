       You really put a lot of effort towards discrediting Seaman.  It's weird how hard people push on him.  Why do you spend so much time working against him?
      </p>
      <p>
       My office took up a collection for the guy and we've collected nearly $1500.  He is a good guy, and want to support him.  When people like you push so hard, it makes me want to donate more.  Weird, hey?

       You'd be better off using that $1500 as toilet paper, at least then it wouldn't be completely wasted.

       nah.  He was the first to really talk about Hillary's health issues on MSM, so for that reason alone he is a good guy worth investing in.  He isn't perfect, but he certainly isn't worth all the effort you put in to discredit him.  What's your motivation?

       far from mosad. That would be an insult to that organization. Its obvious that David Seaman is a young man who lost his shit along the way. He is just trying to get clicks and cash which is running low, he liquidated a big portion of his crypto holdings before the rise too. dude is fucked...

       Well done OP, thank you for a good write-up. I don't watch Seaman's videos because they don't teach me anything, he doesn't even summarize the latest pizzagate findings. I can watch a 10 min video of him speaking, and right afterwards you can ask me "what did he just talk about?", I would have a hard time telling you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what's up with this chick at the end of his videos, making a little announcement/ad? You should have mentionned her. Who is she? I guess paying her is the production expense he has.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was another girl with him at one point in the videos, absolutely gorgeous. Do you know who she is?

       The thing that made me go "nope, that's it, time to forget this guy" is when I recently noticed he's followed on Twitter by Ana and Cenk from the Young Turks (who despise Trump and laugh at conspiracy theories and have had violent arguments with Alex Jones), while posting pro-Trump stuff on Gab like a T_D member, stuff like "magamaga!".
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit that I'm very liberal and like TYT, but not so much that I'm ignoring other viewpoints. That's the reason I followed them (but not David, just occasionally follow links to his Twitter).
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people who like him or follow him have NO way of seeing if Ana Kasparian or Cenk Uygur follow him because they themselves don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would a very pro-Trump "journalist" talking about conspiracy theories be followed by violently anti-Trump journalists who make fun of conspiracy theories, unless it was all a joke to him? His Twitter bio even says "Head of Programming" (Head = Brain, Programming = Manipulation/washing).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Fightforthefuture.org seems to be following him also! Their highlighted Tweet is about "Trump not killing the TPP" but "the people", talking about fake news etc. Essentially they are saying Trump didn't even do the ONE good thing that even Bernie Sanders applauded him for. So very Anti-Trump.

       Yes, his actual viewpoints on the theories doesn't matter. The fact that one of the most well known pizzagaters is going on a crazed rant about fringe conspiracy theories is all that matters. People will subconsciously lump pizzagate in with them.

       What? In the video I'm talking about he discussed the possibility of maybe having paid shills coming and ruining the credibility of pizzagate by lumping it with flat-earthers. And then his comments blew UP saying, "What kind of pos journalist are you?! You won't even LOOK into flat earth!" and it had a surprisingly high amount of thumbs up. But those types of opinions were nonexistent on his videos until recently, and he addressed them and said that those people are crazy as fuck, and he will never ever consider a flat Earth.

       The first time I saw it on this subreddit a while back that's instantly what I thought. They need to take an astronomy class (or two) and then try to explain how mathematically everything adds up to how a theory was invented that involves the Earth being round, along with our understanding of atoms, elements and how temperature change influences all of that. Then
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       I might give it a few minutes of consideration, but that won't happen. That would be basically saying everything we understand to be true thus far is all just one big elaborate lie. There's no way in hell even a group of like 100 people could figure out how to weave the web of what our senses understand of reality into a big, testable and provable fabrication. I'm glad to see it's fading though.

       Ben Swann did play a small role as well, and I haven't tried my hand at Voat yet. I've been watching Seaman randomly off and on over the years, what he's covering now was surprising and unexpected.

       I think all the naysayers are just disappointed that Podesta and Alefantis have yet to be charged with pedo crimes.

       yeah, you are right.  Many of the first complaints about the evil David Seamon was that his predictions weren't coming true.  Then Sandusky's son was arrested, Seamon took credit for it (weird).  Now we have people like OP writing huge essays against him.

       I believe about 80% of this. Something is going on with pizza gate for sure. I've been observing the researchers since late October, and caught his first video about it . The self promotion is obvious, but the thing that get me the most is that he never does any research! Puts no work into finding the truth and evidence. It's like if I read voat everyday for an hour then went online and hot paid to read off what I read  there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also remember when Swan's channel went offline , Seaman's "suddenly" went offline too? Then Swann went dark on twitter and Seamans "suddenly" went down too? 
Next he's back online a day or two later after his stunt failed to gain traction.
Then he began to claim people are hunting him and he's close to the truth and knows all these insiders who only talk to him...and they're two squad out front to kill...or protect him. Of course nothing happened  there either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for supporting and sharing real researchers like George Webb or the crews on Voat and 4Chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can do what you want but think about what OP saying. David offers nothing of value besides his opinion and personality.
I feel like he's doing some kind of setup , like of something big happenshe hopes to write some book and hit the talk show circuit? Maybe the book will be how he manipulated paranoid conspiracy nutjobs to keep then from bothering politicians or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know whatever, he might be doing it on purpose, or misguided, trolling for fame.  Or he might really have some mental issue
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said I stick to Voat, /pol/ , George Webb, etc. they actually  do the work to research, uncover facts and link it all together. Seaman rants about it , created fake emergencies and stunts, and takes credit. I don't believe he has inside sources and I don't believe he's honest or trustworthy.

       Yep, he's constantly piggybacked off of other people like the Swann thing. After Alex Jones went on Joe Rogan's podcast, Seaman was suddenly saying all the things that Alex Jones just said in the podcast.
      </p>
      <p>
       He definitely has delusions of grandeur, he thinks he's going to be the next Woodward or Bernstein. Even though he's done none of the work or research and has done a terrible job at reporting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When/if pizzagate breaks, he wants to go on all the news channels and talk about it and be seen as a hero.

       Also I have a huge problem with "unnamed  sources" and "some experts claim" and "a study shows" He is constantly claiming super secret sources but never has had any legitimate break ever.

       I fail to see how David Seaman is discrediting pizzagate.  He has brought it more attention than probably any other YouTuber and has been consistent in his defense of it being real.  And nobody in their right mind would consider him the number one source for information on the subject either, he's just a guy talking about it with a sizable audience.

       him ranting and raving like a psycho, wrong predictions and misdirection isn't enough? he scared away as many people as he gained, how do we know he isn't the reason the DC police never looked into it? Seaman himself said he doesn't talk to or trust the real researchers working on this. He literally just reads vote and twitter, spouts off, pulls stunts and pretends hes in danger or PayPal won't play him. if you need videos to tell you the latest watch  George Webb instead , or even better just head to Voat

       search the sub history for seaman. this isn't new. Every now and then someone like me or OP attempts to show you that Seaman isn't the right "leader" First if we don't need a leader, second of claiming yourself as leader cause you felt like it,  another huge red flag
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways a few of us around try to show Seaman gets shady and questionable . This latest posts is the longest list I've seen if evidence showing Seaman is in it for himself.  Seriously. Read OP's list, almost all of it is backed up, linked or searchable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is Seaman made pizzagate his day job, a job where he doesn't do any work. a job that uses money people gave him because they're naive and being taken advantage of. Seaman is like a YouTube  Televangelist.  He literally said he refused to talk to the actual researchers, yet reads all their research and makes money off of it? How come no one sees this? He's playing 3 card monty here

       I watch George Webb's videos too, and already acknowledged that Seaman isn't an authority on PG or pedos, just one of the more visible supporters of the theory itself.  It's a lot more likely that he's pretty gullible when it comes to trusting his sources and not checking their veracity before shooting off at the mouth.

       I wrote about his shilling 7 years ago and he threatened to sue me. I've mentioned this several times but I don't think anybody noticed. He also overtly threatened me if I continued to tweet about him, openly using his google plus page to attack me because I was a "troll" for asking him to engage in thoughtful discourse with him. Some things never change, and some people don't either.
