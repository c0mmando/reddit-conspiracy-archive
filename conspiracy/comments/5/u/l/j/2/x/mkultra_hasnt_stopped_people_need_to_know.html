        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From another targeted individual:</p>

<p>The targeted individual program is no experiment. It is an illegal subjugation program, set out to destroy good people and democracy. It&#39;s difficult, and sickening, to believe that people in our own country would do such things, but it&#39;s the truth.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it doesn&#39;t matter if society calls the assault of everyday American citizens with electromagnetic weapons -- for purposes of neutralization; abuse; exploitation; sadistic torture; the fracturing and weakening of communities; the creation of mass shooters to terrorize the populace, and boost budgets; for corruption; extortion; murder; and treason -- an experiment or a crime. What matters is that society realizes this is happening. Once massive public awareness regarding these atrocities is raised, then the medical and law enforcement communities will be forced to respond and provide protection and detection services.</p>

<p>Once that happens, then all of the perpetrators&#39; sly and wicked tactics are undermined. The victims can get help, without being called delusional, and victimized a second time. People will realize that they could be next, and they will call for an end to to the pain and destruction these weapons are causing. Their scourge upon society will end.</p>

<p>These lawsuits will create this massive awareness. These human rights violations are happening to Americans by the thousands all across our nation, so we have jurisdiction in every court in the land. If we don&#39;t win the first lawsuit, we&#39;ll file a new lawsuit in another jurisdiction, if that one doesn&#39;t succeed, we&#39;ll file a new lawsuit in another jurisdiction, ad infinitum. Eventually the truth will come out. Furthermore, with each lawsuit, we&#39;ll get more and more organized; more whistleblowers will be emboldened to step forward; and increasingly widespread awareness of these experiments run amok, that have transformed into crimes in the past couple of decades, will be raised. New and fresh approaches, that are legal and peaceful, will eventually lead to certain victory.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are advancing and expanding until we will have these sick fucks everywhere, no they are putting them in police forces everywhere as well. So if you complain about police corruption or voice your opinion on politics in a non political correct way, these guys will show up and harrass you, try to split your family and then do what they can to drive you to suicide or kill you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  I believe it works in a way very similar to the movie &quot;Fight Club&quot;, were the cult eventually gains power over every aspect of society.  A real life example would be the Mexican drug cartels.  The police are mostly under their control, either by fear and intimation tactics, or by being blackmailed through accepting bribes or by other means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yesterday, I advised you that your post had nothing to do with CIA Project MK-ULTRA:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5sifkr/some_mkultra_and_alien_experiences/ddt2zdj/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5sifkr/some_mkultra_and_alien_experiences/ddt2zdj/</a></p>

<p>The next day, you submitted another post that has nothing to do with CIA Project MK-ULTRA. I am warning you, if you continue to submit misleading titles, I will report you to the mods.</p>

<p>CIA is in the United States. Your title included the word &quot;globally.&quot; CIA is not globally. Nor is the CIA responsive for deploying directed energy weapons on American citizens. Read the perps wiki in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>Its improper to plagiarize. You need to identify the author and the webpage you quoted from.</p>
