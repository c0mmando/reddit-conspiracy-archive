<p>Once I see high level individuals start getting imprisoned I will know for definite, and it&#39;s terrifying.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s all true, then the UK has been run by peadophiles for a very long time...and we&#39;re going to have to break british culture and do something.</p>

<p>I have already started looking into the UK peado rings but wondering if anyone knows where to start the rabbit hole?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea same here I been following this pizzagate thing from the start and I always think, Jesus how bad is this problem in the U.K. 
I started looking in the obvious places like Saville and his connection to prince Philip and the BBC. 
There was also the case of the whistleblower woman who was sentenced in a secret court and is being held indefinitely without trail.  She obviously has high profile names that they cant let get out.
Also the whole pedo football problem.</p>

<p>Anyone who thinks the U.S is bad, the brainwashing in the UK is so deeply and culturally engrained that people almost already know that this goes on but cant even wrap their brain around trying to stop it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that what we see in the US is most likely childs play compared to what is happening in the UK, we&#39;ve had years to perfect it.
As said, if this is all definitely true we&#39;re going to need a similar citizen investigation over here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be happy to collaborate if you are want to start digging.  I think the most interesting statistic that has come out of the pizzagate investigation is the staggering number of missing children per annum.</p>

<p>I like to find out what that number is in the U.K. as information like that is easier to digest for those without a shiny hat</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in, going to read the pedophocracy which apparently goes into a lot of it. 
Probably worth setting up a voat, I considered waiting till pizzagate was a definite but there&#39;s no time like the present.
Ideally we need to find a collection of individuals who got slap on the wrists for peadophile, like the du point heir, but british higher ups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About two years ago, I met a woman (not mentioning names for obvious reasons) in Wales whilst travelling.<br/>
She was a lovely woman but you could see in her eyes that she&#39;d seen some shit, as I got to know her, issues started showing more and more as we gained each others trust over time.<br/>
One night, we had were sat with a few people around a log fire pit, and all of a sudden, she just starts crying.<br/>
I took her aside and asked what was going on, she opened her heart out to me there and then.  </p>

<p>She had been in a various different children&#39;s homes during the late 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s, she told me that she was basically passed around like a fucking rag-doll, while these men had their way with her. This happened on numerous occasions, spanning over her whole childhood.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t just the children&#39;s home staff who were in to it! Many men travelled around the country for this, many rich and powerful men.
When she went to the police when she was 21.<br/>
She had attempts on her life, on numerous occasions. She was threatened to not bring the story public, so she never did... She kept it inside, to herself, while she silently suffered...</p>

It&#39;s absolutely terrifying how those trying to expose are easily silenced.
She names high level politicians and goes into great detail.
