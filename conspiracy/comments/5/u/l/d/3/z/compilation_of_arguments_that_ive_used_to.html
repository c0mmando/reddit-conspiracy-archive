       (Please feel free to add more information and arguments that can help widen our arguments for why we are potentially stumbling upon a trove of pedophile communities)
      </p>
      <p>
       Rhetoric used against the people who attempt to "research" into this pedo subculture:
       <strong>
        Who are Pizzagate "researchers"?LOL
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What exactly are you "researching"?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Argument used to counter:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        These Instagram and Tumblr profiles (that are being stumbled into by random voat &amp; reddit users) are trying to uncover a world of pedophilia that potentially exists in more corners of the world than we'd like to imagine. Of course it is stupid to label ourselves as "researchers" or that the work we are doing as "research," but it is the simplest label we have to explain why/how we are stumbling upon these creepy profiles.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rhetoric used against "Pizzagate"-truthers:
       <strong>
        They are clearly dark humor artists.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Where is the physical proof?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The images on those people's Instagram accounts are nothing serious
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Argument I've used to counter:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If I showed you profiles of Aryan Brotherhood and other white supremacist groups on Instagram, what would you think about them? If they were doing a Hitler salute would that be funny? If you saw them posting comments like 14 88 all over the place would you think that was a stretch (that they are all just regular people being misinterpreted)?
       </p>
       <p>
        If I had you view profiles of KKK supporters, Nazis, white nationalists, and white racists (who share a common lingo and set of innuendos) and commented on eachother's profiles with terminology that explicitly implied ties to racist rhetoric what would you think? Would you think they were white nationalists, or would you say that's just "guilt by association" and that they clearly "aren't actually racist" because there is no physical "proof". (Even though those accounts clearly exist and the common subculture is painfully obvious)
       </p>
       <p>
        What you are looking at when going through these dozens of Instagram and Tumblr accounts is a subculture that revels in talking about children &amp; babies. They use FBI terminology and symbology that is obviously regarded as symbols of pedophilia (just like a swastika with the numbers "1488" is a sign for white nationalism.)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rhetoric used against "Pizzagate"-truthers:
       <strong>
        But there is no proof
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This is all conjecture
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Where is the actual evidence
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguments I've used to counter:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I am not killing anyone, nor am I accusing anyone. But these public social media profiles are communicating on Instagram/Tumblr using the innuendos and terminologies of pedophiles. It is rampant across the various accounts that are being stumbled into. From James Alefantis(of Comet Ping Pong) to Jason Kreher &amp; co. They don't exactly know eachother, BUT they all communicate and leave comments the same way. It seems to be universal what they are discussing and what their hints/innuendos are referring to. No, you don't see them actually having sex on their respective IG accounts/Tumblr profiles. But to deny that they are regular folks just posting photos of kids as a "dark humor" art piece is legitimizing a subculture that probably has a much more sinister narrative. We (pedophilia "researchers") are just uncovering profiles and people's that happen to use the same pedophilia code words and symbology that are neatly outline in the FBI's own reports on pedophilia culture.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rhetorical question:
       <strong>
        Can someone ELI5 what pizzagate is?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Can someone ELI5 what I am looking at?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguments for those questions:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's obvious that fetishes exist across the planet, and due to the Internet people with weird fetishes &amp; interests are capable of connecting. When you are looking at pizzagate archived posts, you are stumbling upon a network of sexual deviants who are openly talking about not only abusing babies &amp; children (but also reveling in their mutual love of children). Look at the comments on the Instagram photos, look at the linked tumblr accounts, look at their symbology(the same shit the FBI uses as a guideline to crack into these circles). It is real and it's disgusting and most regular people can't fathom the thought, thus they dismiss it entirely.

       One of James Alefantis employees brothers saying "pedo" in one instagram post isn't very good evidence, it's several steps removed from JA.

       The evidence used against James Alefantis is the same evidence used against every other IG profile that the "truthers" have stumbled upon. It is a consistent stream of photos and innuendos that imply provocative actions and emotions felt towards babies &amp; children.
      </p>

       The victims in the hot tub email don't have to turn up dead, either. A lot of children are raised in

       Right, most kids are abused by someone they know.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Alefantis instagram posts seem pretty mixed and benign to me, he's a flamboyant dude and he likes his friends and their kids, it doesn't strike me as creepy.

       James Alefantis uses the same innuendos to communicate with other pedophiles that the rest of the community seems to use. As for Podesta, I have never mentioned him in my post. I really don't know why you are talking about his emails. I think we need more hard evidence for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Alefantis seems to be doing the same shit the rest of the pedo community does. Here is a compilation of the recent "findings" (I am not going to post their whole profile since I know you probably won't care, but here are some of the archived photos):  An
       <a href="http://archive.is/N0WQj">
        image from James K's tumblr
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://archive.is/BNkmZ">
        pizza-related image on his Instagram
       </a>
       as well as
       <a href="http://archive.is/jqXaI">
        this other photo
       </a>
       on his Tumblr page. Now, clearly the man has a weird obsession with sexual innuendos and possibly children. If you went through more of his posts, you'd see that he clearly has some sort of affinity for kids. Then, you see his friends on instagram posting photos like
       <a href="http://archive.is/BxAT4">
        this
       </a>
       or
       <a href="http://archive.is/8PsQY">
        this
       </a>
       .  It's really bizarre and odd that someone would post photos of children in clearly uncomfortable poses (who look abused).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what does that have to do with Alefantis? The same weird
       <a href="http://archive.is/mKH6M">
        pizza
       </a>
       innuendo is found
       <a href="http://archive.is/0Az6u">
        all over
       </a>
       his instagram profile. It is clearly code for something, because you see it pop up time and again in the Podesta emails as well. It is used in all sorts of sexual contexts and constantly used with children/adults.
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10037">
        Here
       </a>
       is an email sent to Podesta (with a jpg attachment) showing two adults eating pizza with a little girl, talking about how John Podesta thinks "it doesn't get any better than this". Weird conversation. Weird discussion. Same weird discussion pedophiles are having with pizza.

       So this random James K guy has a couple of weird posts, more humorous than creepy I'd say, and certainly not evidence he's a child abuser. Twisted sense of humour perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       His instagram friends share a picture by a famous photographer (Frank W. Ockenfels III) that you say show abused children, but he's a renowned artist and doesn't abuse children.

       James Alefantis runs a pizza restaurant, wouldn't you expect him and his employees to talk about pizza?

       I am confused. Which photo (that I sent you above) is associated with Frank W. Ockenfels III? I understand that he is not a child abuser, but I don't believe I used any of his images as evidence.

      <p>
       I apologize. His name was Jason, not James K. There is no relationship between Jason K and James Alefantis other than the fact that they happen to use the same innuendos and lingo. They are independent of eachother, except for the fact that they seem to post images with random children, pedophilia symbology, and sexual intercourse.

       Please see the attached jpg. It is random. I don't understand if Huma knows the code words, or if the anyone else understands why the photo was sent. Either way, the pizza innuendo is pervasive across the board.

        Anyway, the vagueness of the connections and allegations are the reason you have trouble convincing people who look at this that there's more to it than casual email conversation.

      <p>
       Ignore the Podesta emails like they don't exist. There is no reason to even search through them. Instead, go through the countless saved archives of people like James Alefantis, Jason K, their mutual friends, and internet communities. You will see a consistent pattern of sexual innuendo, pizza, and

       What do you mean when you "put it in context"? Do you mean make these random people fit into this preconceived notion you have of a pedo ring?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is this Jason guy and why do you think he is a pedophile? And what symbology is he using? He looks like an artist and his tumblr is still viewable.

       We know pedophile rings exist and operate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is this obsession with connecting every pedophile bust to John Podesta and James Alefantis.

       It is about understanding the common terminology and symbology to prove that James Alefantis is within the same circle. John Podesta and Tony Podesta definitely need more evidence as well (since they are far larger public figures and it is difficult to malign them without evidence.)

       Because it is blatantly obvious that it is code language when used in a context where pizza makes no sense. James Alefantis (Comet Ping Pong guy) uses the same innuendos to communicate with other alleged pedophiles that the rest of the community seems to use.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Alefantis seems to be doing the same shit the rest of the pedo community does. Here is a compilation of the recent "findings" (I am not going to post their whole profile since I know you probably won't care, but here are some of the archived photos):  An
       <a href="http://archive.is/N0WQj">
        image from James K's tumblr
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://archive.is/BNkmZ">
        a pizza-related image on his Instagram
       </a>
       as well as
       <a href="http://archive.is/jqXaI">
        this other photo
       </a>
       on James's Tumblr page. Now, clearly the man has a weird obsession with sexual innuendos and possibly children. If you went through more of his posts, you'd see that he clearly has some sort of affinity for kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, you see James K's friends on instagram posting photos like
       <a href="http://archive.is/BxAT4">
        this
       </a>
       or
       <a href="http://archive.is/8PsQY">
        this
       </a>
       .  It's really bizarre and odd that someone would post photos of children in clearly uncomfortable poses (who look abused). Now, if that was one friend and two random profiles, it would seem pretty innocuous. BUT it's not! It's fucking everywhere between their mutual friends (each of which posts provocative innuendos that have to do with children).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what does that have to do with Alefantis? The same weird
       <a href="http://archive.is/mKH6M">
        pizza
       </a>
       innuendo is found
       <a href="http://archive.is/0Az6u">
        all over
       </a>
       his instagram profile. It is clearly code for something, because you see it pop up time and again in the Podesta emails as well. It is used in all sorts of sexual contexts (on Instagram) and seems to be randomly inserted into his emails (out of context).
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10037">
        Here
       </a>
       is an out-of-the-blue email sent to Podesta (with a jpg attachment) showing two adults eating pizza with a little girl, talking about how John Podesta thinks "it doesn't get any better than this". Weird conversation. Weird discussion. Same weird pizza innuendo child enthusiasts seem to be using on social media to communicate with eachother.

       So this random James K guy has a couple of weird posts, more humorous than creepy I'd say, and certainly not evidence he's a child abuser. Twisted sense of humour perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       His instagram friends share a picture by a famous photographer (Frank W. Ockenfels III) that you say show abused children, but he's a renowned artist and doesn't abuse children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that the extent of James Ks relationship with James Alefantis?
      </p>
      <p>
       James Alefantis runs a pizza restaurant, wouldn't you expect him and his employees to talk about pizza?

       The weird pizza discussion you refer to was sent by

       and recipients include podesta and Huma. I don't know what you think this email implies, I havent seen the attached jpg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the vagueness of the connections and allegations are the reason you have trouble convincing people who look at this that there's more to it than casual email conversation.

       I apologize. His name was Jason, not James K. There is no relationship between Jason K and James Alefantis other than the fact that they happen to use the same innuendos and lingo. They are independent of eachother, except for the fact that they seem to post images with random children, pedophilia symbology, and sexual intercourse.

       Please see the attached jpg. It is random. I don't understand if Huma(formerly married to a man that sexted unerage girls) knows the code words, or if anyone else understands why the photo was sent. Either way, the pizza innuendo is pervasive across the board.

       Ignore the Podesta emails like they don't exist. There is no reason to even search through them. Instead, go through the countless saved archives of people like James Alefantis, Jason K, their mutual friends, and internet communities. You will see a consistent pattern of sexual innuendo, pizza, and

       It's art, it's supposed to be challenging. The artist in question grew up in Serbia during the war and her paintings are designed to make the viewer uncomfortable.

       All this 'its challenging art' argument is BS. Combined with all the other tells, you'd have to be in a complete state of denial not to be deeply suspicious.

       it doesn't have to though. who the fuck said it related to pizzagate? the thread specifically says pedophilia at large. it implicates our government at the state and federal level in being complicit in covering up such catastrophes.

       Pizzagate is mentioned in the title and the body of the post is entirely about explaining instagram posts and so on so I assumed this was trying to connect these past scandals to the pizzagate theory.

       I don't think it's so simple you can say the "us government" is complicit. You can say previous people I'm positions of authority covered up abuse but how does that implicate comet ping pong?

       Who the Hell wants to post links to child porn or host images of child pornography? We are finding people (and their mutual friends) that consistently post images like

       The images of "child abuse" in your first two links are artistic photographs by Frank Ockenfels and Jeffrey Stockbridge. They are both quite renowned photographers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The images appear one instagram page, we.are.industry and they appear to be a photographers support community which shares lots of photos.
