       Whether or not you believe in PG, the amount of shills in the top post (now) and older posts is a little scary. I'm curious who is doing that or buying those accounts. All are very obvious to point out. Either new account or old account with an absurd amount of karma. All very strange in my opinion.

       Every time a post hits all people start complaint about shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you see so many shills is because the post is bull and people coming from /all can easily debunk it.

       I'm indifferent about the conspiracy but to play devils advocate, has anyone proven with solid evidence that the conspiracy is debunked? Or proven that its real? It's a conspiracy after all.

        So far the stuff I saw was all benign junk that was obviously out of context. The life like baby cake picture from a baby shower, that has been circling around the Internet for like a decade.

       Just want everyone to stop for a moment and really think about how much work we have done and how much progress we have truly made as a community.... despite what it feels like sometimes when we can't get a Wiki or television to confirm what we already all know now to be true. I've been getting slightly bothered or agitated lately by how much deflection and ignorance is flying around across all the social networks due to pedos, and paid shills infiltrating all the pizzagate groups to try to defend themselves. However the more I started thinking about it the more it made me feel really good actually. I mean take a second and imagine what these sick bastards are thinking right now, and how they have to feel sitting here watching us break down everything, their code, their fronts, their whole plan, we have new leads everyday. They have to sit here and try to argue against the truth, while we break apart their false sense of security and their power trip. They fucked up, they got cocky... started advertising, heck they even took it worldwide. But they got lazy, and sloppy, and their web got too large to hide with the way the internet has evolved, so... I guess what I'm saying is be patient, YES its been too long already but we are finally making real progress, tons of arrests happening every day and I really truly feel like we the people are a massive reason why. There has always been pedophilia but covering it up has always been no problem because people just simply don't want to talk about this stuff because its hard. What happens when we all crowdsource our information educate ourselves on topics and share that information together? You simply can't stop the truth especially when we are united for a cause like stopping pedos, strength in numbers guys all we gotta do is stand up and their little game is over. YES there are a very large % of D.C. and Hollywood that are pedophiles however even in the hundreds of thousands we still outnumber them by hundreds of MILLIONS, the only difference being we were not UNITED before this. PIzzagate actually brought us together and helped people cross lines that would normally divide us, race, age, class all of peoples normal everyday biased just got tossed aside for the greater good of saving childrens lives which is just fucking incredible btw guys, dont sell yourself short on spreading awareness. We all deserve a pat on the back, its far from over but remember to use the frustration as motivation and fuel to continue in our quest to save our children.

       I assumed everyone in the comments were saying Gj or that it was twisted.

       Just looked, had no idea people were actually defending these finds. Nobody normal or "artistic" talks like that about children. It's fucking weird. If I posted shit like this on my FB, people would think I am a fucking freak and would not talk to me.

       If you were to come to this subreddit a year ago, you would not see people responding like this. They would engage and dig about the information. Not quickly dismiss it.

       Yeah. The amount of fake accounts i'm seeing is a little scary. For a site that I enjoy visiting, it's getting worse by the day. Shills on either side aren't fun to have.

       I trust that genuine free thinkers do not have a very hard time at all seeing through the propaganda.  It truly does lack a certain authenticity.  I think they created a beast with Reddit and didn't quite account for how acclimated users become to their communities.  It's very obvious when something is up IMO.  Downvotes, combative posts, user names you haven't seen....All if it leads to a sudden change in tone among a community and I believe it sticks out like a sore thumb. People see through the brigades and that's why the brigades continue, what choice do tptb have left?

       I've done that before and they just respond "Because you're witch hunting" or "There's no proof when you do look into it".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like, okay then show the proof there is no proof instead of just saying there is no proof? Again, this subreddit used to not be like that. I think it's a combination of new users from T_D and CTR/ShareBlue.

       Remember how many orcs there were once Frodo got to Mordor? To look at the sheer numbers is frightening, but the caliber of individual is so lacking. The more nonsense they post, the more evidence exists that they're posting nonsense.

       Just want everyone to stop for a moment and really think about how much work we have done and how much progress we have truly made as a community.... despite what it feels like sometimes when we can't get a Wiki or television to confirm what we already all know now to be true. I've been getting slightly bothered or agitated lately by how much deflection and ignorance is flying around across all the social networks due to pedos, and paid shills infiltrating all the pizzagate groups to try to defend themselves. However the more I started thinking about it the more it made me feel really good actually. I mean take a second and imagine what these sick bastards are thinking right now, and how they have to feel sitting here watching us break down everything, their code, their fronts, their whole plan, we have new leads everyday. They have to sit here and try to argue against the truth, while we break apart their false sense of security and their power trip. They fucked up, they got cocky... started advertising, heck they even took it worldwide. But they got lazy, and sloppy, and their web got too large to hide with the way the internet has evolved, so... I guess what I'm saying is be patient, YES its been too long already but we are finally making real progress, tons of arrests happening every day and I really truly feel like we the people are a massive reason why. There has always been pedophilia but covering it up has always been no problem because people just simply don't want to talk about this stuff because its hard. What happens when we all crowdsource our information educate ourselves on topics and share that information together? You simply can't stop the truth especially when we are united for a cause like stopping pedos, strength in numbers guys all we gotta do is stand up and their little game is over. YES there are a very large % of D.C. and Hollywood that are pedophiles however even in the hundreds of thousands we still outnumber them by hundreds of MILLIONS, the only difference being we were not UNITED before this. PIzzagate actually brought us together and helped people cross lines that would normally divide us, race, age, class all of peoples normal everyday biased just got tossed aside for the greater good of saving childrens lives which is just fucking incredible btw guys, dont sell yourself short on spreading awareness. We all deserve a pat on the back, its far from over but remember to use the frustration as motivation and fuel to continue in our quest to save our children. @Diablism
