        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The last 48 hours on r/conspiracy have been epic. With this Trump/Putin/Flynn blitz going on, and the details of the Podesta/Skippy torture video being uncovered, the brigading was so grotesque it became comical. I could tell most regular users were laying back and watching it unfold. </p>

<p>Personally I was happy to spend karma capital to post embarrassing truths for the hordes to see. I did my small part to help tourists realize Pizzagate is real.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5u1m6y/notice_how_all_the_top_comments_in_the_top_post/ddqtn3p/">advertising my position</a>. We should retaliate when such brigading happens. Post variations of the most embarrassing truths, and upvote them when you see them. They brigade real humans out of their pastures to come here and trample on our sub; let them be exposed to the most blatant and flagrant truths. We can easily shatter their illusions, for they are based on increasingly feeble lies. </p>

<p>The mods did the right thing yesterday. In retaliation for the brigading, and because the 3-month anniversary of the r/pizzagate ban is coming up, they stickied the most obvious and eloquent truth about the most sordid conspiracy: institutionalized systemic child trafficking and abuse.</p>

<p>This is how you turn the brigading against the brigadiers. Tell the truth, shame the devil.</p>

<p>Thank you Mods, I salute you.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right. If they come to the sub and read things then they&#39;ll be informed at the very least. I just don&#39;t understand their desire to just shit on PG posts tangentially. </p>

<p>Just look at the top comment in this post. Clearly the use of &quot;their&quot; is not intended to be partisan at all, right? Because human trafficing and child molestation is clearly only a red v blue issue. And people that want to poke holes in pizzagate are the enemy right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do care about Trump&#39;s foreign entanglements, especially his ties to the Israeli far-right, and to Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm5Je73bYOY">in particular</a>. His backer Sheldon Adelson&#39;s view on Iran also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sCW4IasWXc">worry me</a>. If his foreign policy goals turn out to be aligned with that of the Likud, we should all be worried.</p>

<p>I see the Trump-Putin connection mutually exclusive from the Trump-Netanyahu connection (especially in regards to the Middle East), so it is less likely in my mind. The credibility of mythomaniacal war criminals is also in question.</p>

<p>And even if a Trump-Putin relationship did exist, it would be preferable to relationships with leaders of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Israel and other rogue states that are other/previous statesmen have openly admitted to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a compulsive truth-seeker, and I want to investigate all leads that come up. Hence I suspended disbelief on both Pizzagate and Flynn-Russia until I looked at the evidence. There was enough to convince me that both are worth further investigation.</p>

The past few days though people just keep running in here saying: &quot;the dossier is true. biggest conspiracy in american history! you guys are all fucking dumb. you believe pg and not this?! The CIA and NYT said Trump is Putin&#39;s puppet!!&quot; Yea, no. I personally think its a convenient narrative and haven&#39;t seen any evidence to back up their clearly political motivations (don&#39;t mean L/R). I also think people would be more willing to consider it if I didn&#39;t have to accept it as a foregone conclusion like every r/politics person does. Their continuous brigade of shitting on r/conspiracy and telling everyone what is truth was annoying and counter productive. They make it harder to look at Trump critically because they keep pushing the MSM narrative too hard. </p>

<p>He&#39;s got links to Rybolovlev but he&#39;s no longer with Putin (doesn&#39;t even have any holdings in Russia and it looks like he was pushed out by Putins oligarchs).</p>

<p>There&#39;s the allegation of ties to Alfa bank whom Putin despises.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s a shit ton of connections between the Kremlin and the Clintons. Sberbank is effectively an arm of the Russian state and it was involved in the Uranium one deal, There&#39;s Pinchuk whose been funding heavily the Ukrainian war along with Soros. There&#39;s Kerimovs pockets in the banks that fund Hillary. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a war amongst the oligarchy and I can&#39;t even tell who is on which side.</p>

<p>This is a huge oversimplification of the situation, and though it&#39;s not necessarily incorrect, presenting it as a &quot;straightforward&quot; quid pro quo is disingenuous.</p>

<p>The reality is that what you&#39;re told about how to feel towards Russia changes regularly based on whatever the current empire-building campaign is underway. The U.S. is destabilizing/installing friendlies in the middle east to secure oil. This is to Russia&#39;s strategic detriment for a ton of reasons. Russia starts to push back a little, US rallies the UN, hits Russia with economic sanctions, Russia starts talking about how the US is essentially an imperial hegemony, US revives cold war rhetoric, Russia revives cold war rhetoric, chaos reigns.</p>

<p>Every politician leverages their office for power and wealth, if you know of an exception please tell me because they&#39;ll get my vote. The reason people may not be as outraged about Flynn talking to Russian officials before the election is because though he may have explicitly said, &quot;We&#39;ll reverse the sanctions,&quot; the <em>implication</em> is &quot;Let&#39;s cool it on the cold war hate, let&#39;s work together,&quot; and I think, personally, that any sane individual should be relieved to hear about potential concord between the two biggest nuclear powers on the planet. Both governments are still fundamentally evil, but I&#39;d rather not have them poised to destroy each other and the planet, which seems to be the sentiment held by the loudest opponents of the new administration.</p>

<p>Amen to that brother. We agree on this, at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sensible response. I can agree that Putin is better than the Saudis by a long shot--the US-Saudi relationship has to end. We&#39;re supporting one of the most brutal regimes on Earth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a compulsive truth-seeker, and I want to investigate all leads that come up. Hence I suspended disbelief on both Pizzagate and Flynn-Russia until I looked at the evidence. There was enough to convince me that both are worth further investigation.</p>
