    <div class="md"><p>This is a poor storyline,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flynn was also, apparently, illegally recorded in phone conversations by FBI/NSA. 
There is a shadow government. Even respected politicians, and people within government(Flynn included) have expressed in the past of a shadow government, so it is not something to be ignored.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could you explain why Gen. Flynn would not know that all telephone calls to and from the U.S. Russian Embassy have not been  now?</p>

<p>And this &quot;shadow government,&quot;  it was all the talk durin the W years,  but Obama, the great dictator didn&#39;t have one, he was so powerful he didn&#39;t submit to them or what???????</p>

<p>Now, once again a Republican government, and the MSM and pundits, blame all the problems, </p>

<p>On the invisible, shadow government.</p>

<p>McCain, an elected Senator as an establishment mole, does that even make sense?</p>

<p>Are you promoting the same thing the Trump campaign promoted?
Dumping NATO and the EU and realigning the U.S. with Russia?</p>

<p>Will there be headlines that positively link Brexit leaders with Russia as well?</p>

<p>no, both sides work for the same evil. The bitch along party lines, but what do they agree on? More war, more debt, and more stripping of our rights.</p>

<p>Lastly, McCain is a traitor. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgLj5s0Xk8A">Even admitted to knowing the leaders of ISIS intimately,</a> and has <a href="https://anarchodutch.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/mccain-isis.jpg">met with ISIS more than once.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can answer that with anything more than my anecdotal opinion. </p>

<p>Putting in Goldman-Sachs or successful businessmen/women doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they are automatically corrupted or don&#39;t have Americas interest. Trump could have very well put those people in those positions because of their managerial skills. CEOs don&#39;t know how to build a phone/car/make the actual product, but they sure know how to manage those who do know. I could be wrong, but it&#39;s too early to tell for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I agree there is some reliable information on wikipedia, there is an inherent problem. Anyone can create a page on anything about something completely made-up as if it was real or edit information on anyone&#39;s page. I do like how Wikipedia has been getting bigger on sourcing the information the last few years, too.</p>

<p>And when 9/11 did happen, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt-ldMj9y9w">he was one of the very few people to suggest bombs where used before anyone else</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m picking up what you are putting down. Personal opinion about Osama is he didn&#39;t have anything to do with 9/11 he was a scapegoat but that&#39;s my opinion and another topic. Its funny how trump thought his word was going to be law and has met such a huge resistance. Not saying either side is correct but interesting non the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, but interestingly enough he made that statement about 9/11 very vaguely, and knew bin Laden was public enemy #1 at the time. </p>

<p>This was also said around the time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">Operation Northwoods</a> was declassified which was essentially a 9/11 like plot to get into war with Cuba and Russia in the 60s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They really put some effort into whitewashing Pence towards the end of the campaign there, but he is roughly equivalent to Bill Clinton in corruption. Look at all of the scandals when he was Governor. Obviously, there can be a certain amount of exaggeration applied as he had concerted political opposition in his home state, but some of what he was accused of is bound to be substantially true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few days ago an &quot;anon&quot; on 4chan (who said they were a staffer) said that this VP was bought and paid for.  I was very sad to read that.  Apparently, Flynn has something on one of the VP best friends (I think it is Flake) and this was part of the discussion that was withheld from the VP.  Once the full transcript was given to the President and VP, it was discovered that that part of the conversation was withheld, thus Flynn was asked to resign.  Flynn is a good man.  I am concerned about this VP and the chief of staff...been reading some posts that makes you wonder. </p>
