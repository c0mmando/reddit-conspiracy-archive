        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One of the biggest new conspiracy theories involves the &#39;mystery&#39; sale of a 19.5% stake in Russia&#39;s oil company Rosneft (<a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/3935723/donald-trump-russia-golden-shower-pee-tape-vladimir-putin-rosneft-oil-steele-dossier-bribe/">example</a>). According to the Steele dossier, the 19.5% stake was offered as a bribe to Donald Trump in a carrot-and-stick arrangement to get him to cooperate, with the aid of abundant blackmail material such as a tape of Trump partecipating in watersports. I think there&#39;s a better explanation.</p>

<h1>TL:DR:</h1>

<p><strong>My theory is that Russia sold Rosneft back to itself (technically, to its state-owned banks) via shell companies, in order to hide that it&#39;s resorting to borrowing from its state-owned banks to prop up its cash-strapped budget.</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s dig in.</p>

<p>The sale isn&#39;t <em>actually</em> that mysterious: Reuters wrote a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight-idUSKBN1582OH">very comprehensive breakdown of what is known of it</a>. I suggest anyone who wants to look deep into it read the full article, but here&#39;s a summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>officially, the stake in Rosneft was bought by a 50/50 Singapore-based joint venture between the Qatari sovereign wealth fund and Swiss commodity trading and mining company Glencore</p></li>
<li><p>in reality though, of the $10.2 billion put for the stake, Glencore put in 300 million, the Qatari&#39;s 2.5 billion, and 5.2 billion were lent to the Singaporean joint venture by Italian bank Intesa San Paolo (which is Italy&#39;s largest banking group)</p></li>
<li><p>it doesn&#39;t take advanced math to figure out that 0.3+2.5+5.2 =8 billion, not 10.2, so 1/4 of the purchase price is unaccounted for. Who put up that money?</p></li>
<li><p>Reuters followed the trail of shell companies involved in the deal and discovered that the rest of it ultimately hidden behind a Cayman islands company which, due to secrecy laws in that jurisdiction, doesn&#39;t need to reveal who its owners are</p></li>
<li><p>Said Cayman Islands firm is <strong>also</strong> the guarantor for Intesa&#39;s 5.2 billion loan, which means that in reality it isn&#39;t just responsible for the &quot;missing&quot; $2.2 billion, but for a whopping $7.4 billion of the total $10.2 sale</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ug5ZhaU.png">Here</a> is a graphic summarizing the ownership structure in this deal</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So, the actual mystery question is who is the real owner of the Cayman firm, i.e. the entity that bought a $7.4 billion stake in Rosneft.</strong> Keep in mind that this was done via a $5.2 billion loan from Intesa, which was under the purview of Italian banking regulators, so it&#39;s unlikely that this was some scam trade (unless the conspiracy goes high enough as to involve the Italian regulators too, but I think there&#39;s a simpler expalanation).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a key piece of the puzzle: Qatar says that the $2.2 billion &quot;officially&quot; missing come from various other banks, <strong>including Russian banks</strong>. Now, the sale of Rosneft was ostensibly to bring foreign cash in to prop up the Russian state budget, which has suffered under decreased oil prices and Western sanctions. For this reason, Putin has technically prohibited Russian state-owned banks to buy any of the stake. However, Russian state-owned banks were openly involved in at least another role:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But public records in Singapore show that Russia&#39;s second-largest bank, state-controlled VTB, loaned the Singapore vehicle QHG Shares the full 10.2 billion euros that it paid to the Russian state last month to buy the stake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two sources in the Russian government said the deal was also a surprise there: it had been agreed between Sechin and Putin&#39;s Kremlin, above the cabinet.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>So, these are the piece of the puzzle. Here&#39;s how I think they are put together:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Russia needs cash, quick. Last year it announced <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/806400be-9e94-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2">enormous budget cuts of 27%</a>, the result of low oil prices and Western sanctions.</p></li>
<li><p>It wanted to sell a large stake in Rosneft to make up part of that cash, but essentially all of its potential buyers (i.e. Western, Arab and Chinese oil firms) are currently in a strategic deadlock with Moscow, and their governments are not going to sign off on them injecting all that money into Russian state coffers.</p></li>
<li><p>So, to make up for the money it lacks, Russia resorts to the oldest trick in the book: borrowing from its state-owned companies, using the Rosneft sale to hide this.</p></li>
<li><p>To do this, Russian state-owned banks set up shell companies ultimately appearing as an anonymous Cayman island entity. They use it to buy up Rosneft, with help from Qatar (with which Russia is trying to ease relations) to make it look legit.</p></li>
<li><p>On paper, Rosneft&#39;s stake was bought by Qatar and Glencore (but Qatar is Glencore&#39;s main stakeholder). In reality, Qatar only bought $2.8 billion in Rosneft, with the remaining $7.4 billion being paid by Russian state-owned banks through shell companies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thus, the trade ends up being a minor sale of Rosneft stock to Qatar for $2.8 billion, and a large loan from Russian state banks to the Russian state of $7.4 billion</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>The current alternative theory is that the ultimate beneficiary is actually Donald Trump: the Steele dossier said that he was promised a 19.5% stake in Rosneft, and sure enough 19.5% ended up being sold to a mystery buyer. I think, in light of what we know, that this theory presents several difficulties:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the Russians really are strapped for cash, so it&#39;s hard to imagine that they&#39;d gift him $7.4 billion worth of stock: but maybe bribing the US President is worth that kind of money to Russia, so that&#39;s ok</p></li>
<li><p>the Qatar sovereign wealth fund, Swedish-based Glencore and Italian Intesa San Paolo were also majorly involved, which means they must have been roped in too</p></li>
<li><p>that also means that both Swiss and Italian regulators signed off on the sham deal, extending the conspiracy considerably</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If the Trump bribe theory is false, then how did the Steele dossier get the size of the stake dead-on at 19.5%? easy enough: <a href="https://rbth.com/business/2014/12/09/kremlin_to_sell_off_195_stake_in_rosneft_in_bid_to_raise_funds_42095.html">that exact stake has been up for sale since 2014</a>, and publicly so. The Steele dossier didn&#39;t need any insider sources to get the number right, which leaves its allegation without any compelling detail to corroborate it.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the theory that Russia sold $7.4 billion worth of Rosneft to its state-owned banks (essentially borrowing $7.4 billion from them) fits with the known structure of the trade. It doesn&#39;t require the Russians to involve multiple foreign entities (in at least 4 different jurisdictions) into the most scandalous bribe in modern history, which I think is a big plus. And it makes perfect sense considering the Russian need to prop up the budget.</p>

<p>Very refreshing since all I see in here about the latest Trump/Russia news is either:  </p>

<p>19.5%!!! it was exactly that so that 100% means Trump is with Russia<br/>
vs:<br/>
it&#39;s the MSM, so it&#39;s 100% false. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the fact that the 19.5% figure was out in open in 2014 AND there being a logical explanation for it (bringing down ownership from 69.5% to 50%+1 share) completely blows the whole dossier thing out of the water.</p>

<p>you have single-handedly destroyed <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> narrative. they made it sound that the credibility was established by the 19.5% bit. </p>

<p>i cant believe this hasnt been brought up earlier.</p>

<p>the only thing id like to mention is that this all seems like a lot of effort just for 7.4b euros. Russian budget is about 200b + 30b deficit...youd think that if the main issue was the low oil prices and sanctions.....AND you had an operative as US president who was going to remove them...Youd have the foresight to keep ownership since oil prices will go up etc. </p>

<p>Infact, getting onboard foreign open investors would have been the only beneficial thing to do as that would inspire confidence in economy.</p>

<p>As a bribe...this is too big and open a deal (and obvs 2014 story BTFOs it) for scrutiny...and in Russia many simpler more discreet ways of bribing.</p>

<p>I think ultimately you are 100% correct in your analysis, just imo seems like quite a lot of effort for the amount. If Putin was serious hed easily get that 7.5b by cutting corruption and graft and instituting reforms.</p>

<p>The purpose of Russia&#39;s privatization program is to attract overseas money to cover a budgetary shortfall caused by low oil prices and Western sanctions.

<p><strong>Of course</strong> they&#39;re not hiding an ownership stake in Rosneft, they openly owned it before. What they&#39;re hiding is the transfer of money from Russian state-owned banks to the Russian state budget. Which is the entire point of this theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your theory is pretty much based on motive. Russia&#39;s motive being to hide 7.4 B worth of borrowing and call it financing. Do you really think 7.4 B will make a difference in Russia&#39;s budget?

<p>No, that&#39;s the direction <strong>you</strong> have decided to focus on, after making a failed attempt at attacking this theory by saying that it relies on the Russians wanting to hide their stake in Rosneft. To be honest dude, it looks like you&#39;re simply looking for reasons to shoot this down rather than making any kind of coherent counter-analysis.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t discuss Russia&#39;s motive to remove sanctions. The only mention of sancions you had was in relation to Russia&#39;s budget deficit DUE to the sanctions. Yet instead of use removal of sanctions as your main motive,  you know like any logical person looking at the situation would deduce, you go into some fake lending converup to instead deal with the budget deficit (which doesn&#39;t actually deal with the budget deficit)</p>

<p>No, to borrow an extra undisclosed $7.4 billion over the official $21.6 billion of borrowing in 2016.

    <div class="md"><p>What if Qatar actually decided to invest in Rosneft when it became clear Assad wouldn&#39;t get ousted, meaning Qatar&#39;s pipeline through Syria wouldn&#39;t get built. Qatar invested a lot of money in that pipeline and in Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign. They were banking on that investment to give them greater access to the European oil market, because Hillary Clinton was supposed to win and she was expected to continue to put more pressure on Assad to step down. The US government supported the Saudi / Qatari pipeline through Syria because they wanted to further squeeze Russia out of the European oil market.</p>

<p>Once Clinton lost, it became obvious that Trump would stop arming &quot;rebels&quot; and he&#39;d allow Assad to stay in power. Thus, the logical oil beneficiary of Assad staying in power is Russia, and the logical losers are Saudi Arabia and Qatar (both of which have been funding ISIS to fight Assad). Both of those countries also donated a lot of money to the Clinton Foundation, and Clinton wanted to set up a no fly zone to prevent Russia from being able to bomb the &quot;rebels.&quot; The no fly zone would&#39;ve given the &quot;rebels&quot; a greater chance of defeating Assad and installing a government supportive of the Qatari / Saudi pipeline through Syria.</p>

<p>Again, once Trump wins, that pipeline is effectively dead. Qatar needs to recoup some of its sunken costs and Russia needs the money, so Qatar buys the stake. The privatization closes a month after the election, which is the exact amount of time required to close a private placement like that. Russia doesn&#39;t care if the dossier is lying about Trump&#39;s ties to the deal because it still undermines the United States. Clinton, the Neocons and the deep state want to frame Trump as getting a cut of the deal because it ties his hands, forces him to be be less cozy towards Russia and lessens the chances he lifts the sanctions. And if he does lift the sanctions, now it looks like he&#39;s getting paid to do so...</p>
