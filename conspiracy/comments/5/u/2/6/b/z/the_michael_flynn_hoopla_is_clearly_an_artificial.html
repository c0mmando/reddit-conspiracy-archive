       He's being accused of having a conversation with the Russian ambassador, the exact details of which are not know at this time. As idiotic as that sounds, that's literally what's going on. There is no article that makes a compelling case for why anyone should give a shit about this. It's all rather vague stuff like "it's not the conversation but the fact that he lied about it" - it's a joke. That's a non-news story if ever there was one. Massive upvoted comments supporting this - shit people here NEVER say. Who do these people think they're fooling?

       Flynn is the third guy in the Trump team to resign over allegations with Russia (Manafort &amp; Carter Page being the other two). There is no leftist agenda in the government attempting to go after Trump. It is blatantly obvious there is corruption and regular, bipartisan patriots in the government are exposing it.

       Memes? Buzzwords? Like Flynn being the third guy associated with Trump to resign over allegations and connections to Russia, and how he lied to Mike Pence about it? What do you say about his nomination of Ajit Pai to the head of the FCC (openly going after net neutrality)? Is that a meme or a buzzword that's worth being critical about?

       politician (Tom Price) as head of health and human services. Is that a meme I missed on r/Clinton (a subreddit I was banned from)?
      </p>
      <p>
       His economic team is filled with

       Honest question: are you among Trump's voter base and if so, how do you feel let down? I am waiting to see how things play out before forming an opinion. Personally, I don't like the guy and didn't vote for him but since the election I've come across information that has me really questioning everything.

       Become President and snatch the victory away from Hillary. This has revitalized our distrust of the Executive Branch, and will allow all voters to be critical of the President. Obama put everyone to sleep. He is the reason why Trump has so much power. He's accelerated the Bush/"Wolfowitz" Doctrine. Trump is now at the helm and we can all start seeing the system for what it really is. The American people are waking up to corruption on all sides, and I hope that leads to us fight the corporate oligarchy in Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's election proved that you don't need more money than your opponent to win an election. You don't need the media to be your friend to win an election. You don't need to be a politician to win an election. The American people are waking up and realizing that we can beat back the corporate lobbyists, the oligarchy, and the political elites in Washington D.C. to enact actual change we probably all agree on.

       no I love hearing opinions that differ from my own actually; every time I come across one, I get to put it in a cage match with my own opinion, where the two conflicting opinions battle it out with logic and reason to the best of my mind's ability. whichever one better fits reality with the least number of contradictions wins in the end, and I adjust my worldview accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I nearly never completely reverse my opinion on an issue from reading or hearing just one alternative viewpoint, but I'm open to exploring avenues of thought that I previously hadn't considered, because I do everything in my power to consciously detach my understanding of the world from my identity. when I'm proven wrong about something, it doesn't hurt my feelings; I'm grateful that I've been provided with deeper insight into how the world works and a better understanding of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       that said, when I notice that a certain user keeps popping up thread after thread, regurgitating the same buzzwords that stick out like sore thumbs, like "God Emperor" (as much as people want to say that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has been "overrun" by
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       , I haven't seen anyone unironically refer to him as such here), I RES-tag them with a pink "maybe shill" tag.
      </p>
      <p>
       if I continue to see the same user continue the same pattern of behavior, which will often include shaming people for not subscribing to the mainstream media's "conspiracy theories", then I change the tag to a fuschia "shill", so I can safely ignore anything they have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's a pretty good system that helps me separate the wheat from the chaff. this subreddit is far from perfect and, in fact, its quality is rapidly going downhill, but there are still a few users who post quality content here, and I continue to subscribe because of such content.

       I don't like seeing people stick their heads in the sand, and I see way too much of that here, where no one should fear ideas and question everything. To ME, that's the real meaning of this sub. Think for yourself, question authority. Engage in new ideas and build a better future.

       While I do fully believe there are shills for many agendas, I don't think all Donald supporters are shills, but many are exhibiting what I consider to be cultish/faith based behaviors. Turning on their own for daring to question AT ALL just drives it deeper. Running on a campaign against corruption, yet demanding that they not be questioned or held accountable.

       if you truly voted for Trump, then you must've done a noble job of ignoring everything negative the mainstream mass media kept shoving down our throats nonstop leading up to the election.
      </p>

       if that's the case, why do you suddenly believe everything bad they have to say about him now that he's been elected?

       I don't suddenly believe everything bad about him. I'm being objective dude. I seriously was a Trump voter, supporter, and r/T_D shitposter. I don't mind his travel ban, nor his stance on reducing tensions with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying that he has also made ALOT of mistakes than no one else seems to want to talk about. I can't talk on r/politics about it, because that sub hates Trump without reason, and I was banned from r/the_donald once I stepped out of line. At the end of the day he's the President, and I hold the Constitution and anti-corruption above all politicians

       I didn't say you were a shill. I'm just ignoring your posts because you keep beating the same drum about 3 people resigning over Russian ties. And I see it as a tactical game between two deep state entities and on the one side they have weaponized Russian connections.

       Flynn resigned for some other reason other than Russian ambassador talks and I'm trying to figure out what. But you keep on keeping on with your "It's the Russkies!!!" And I'll just keep  ingnoring you.

       lol I am trying to open some eyes. I don't think it's the "Russkies". I just don't think it's a bad idea for Congress to push for an investigation (along with Session's Justice Department &amp; the FBI). If the administration has nothing to hide, then we're good. I also have a nightshift tonight, and have some free time. Nice to see some objective posts on this subreddit discussing flaws in the administration. That's all dude

       Give me a fucking break. What about the war mongers in Trump's administration who have their eyes on Iran, and won't fall out of line with Wahabbist Islamist states like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain? The left is fucked, but be objective of what's happened to Trump. He rode the wave of populist anger and took advantage of the Infowars audience to propel himself into power. He's appointed

       I want peace with Russia too. It's a damn shame the sabers keep rattling and both parties seem to be anti-Russian. But don't ignore the fact that Flynn is now the third person in the Trump team to resign over connections to Russia (Manafort and Carter Page being the other two). Congress needs to investigate with full force and if Trump has nothing to hide then let the "MAGA" continue

       The question is how does one make peace with Russia without looking like a Russian agent to America's new war party? If Trump tries to ease sanctions or pull back the troops on the Russian boarder he is accused of being a stooge of Russian blackmail. They have effectively make peace a crime. Even discussing these things with the Russian ambassador is a crime now. We truly live in the world of opposites. Cursed are the peace makers. The war mongers shall inherit the earth.

       Yea, might as well listen to the President at all cost and not think critically. It helps that everything is classified and FOIA-proof. No need to see tax returns, no need to fully investigate his Cabinet picks, no need to look deeper into Flynn/Manafort/Carter Page... No need to hold the executive branch accountable. It's best to just sit back, MAGA, and follow the news that jives with our emotions :)

       I will explain how the Obama administration has almost brought us to the brink of WW3. Firstly, we must understand the Russian mindset before Obama's presidency, and why (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE6rSljTwdU">
        geopolitically
       </a>
       ) Russia has always pushed its influence westward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we must look at initial sources from the very beginning of the Obama administration and the Obama foreign policy doctrine with Russia. Ever since the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlDlzP6fDMs">
        first two years
       </a>
       of his administration, Obama (and NATO) have worked hard to
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNCkfhc7mWQ">
        encircle
       </a>
       Russia and stir unrest in countries that border the Russian Federation, like

       and our

        war games held in the Caucasus during
       </a>
       the start of Obama's presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       It didn't help that we fomented civil strife in Ukraine against Yanukovych (once he
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93NATO_relations#cite_ref-48">
        declared

       his nation non-aligned with Europe). Yanukovych was later ousted from power and Western

       Russia has survived the Napoleonic invasion, WW1, and nearly collapsed in WW2 when Hitler's war machine

       Then why would this be the third person associated with the Trump administration to resign over connections to Russia (Manafort, Carter Page, and now Flynn)?
      </p>
      <p>
       All during the election campaign &amp; during these last 4 weeks, Infowars (and a vast majority of my fellow conspiracy guys) were talking about how the patriots within the government were actively working against Hillary and the Dems to bring down the globalists/Islamists within the government. Trump purged hundreds of high level staff and put a trusted GOP, former Marine at the helm of the CIA (Pompeo), and is fighting against the pedo's. Yet, now (all of a sudden), all of these people are creating an artificial scandal? Really? Artificial?

       Ahhhh yes. Then why don't you advocate for Jeff Sessions &amp; the Justice department, the FBI, and a Congressional inquiry investigate the President and his team. I mean, he has nothing to hide. No reason why we all can't publicly know about it. It would probably improve his ratings as well. Let's agree to investigate the President between three different agencies. I mean, there is nothing to hide, right? It's all a Hillary and Obama ploy, right?

       So a top member of the Trump administration resigns because he got caught conspiring with a foreign goverment. The same foreign goverment that Trump is already alleged to have close ties to. So why am I not surprised that the sub whose mods marked the initial allegations of collaboration as "unverified" is now trying it's best to paint this as false. Oh yeah because any conspiracy involving Trump is downvoted/marked by mods/ declared fake instantly.

With the onset the of modern social media, coupled with radio and TV, the current situation on both sides play out perfectly for a massive event used to get the desired effect they are looking for, this is no accident, calculated all the way till the objective and goal of their plan is put in place, shudder to think of what that end result is.

       You can say that again, I see far more people talking about Flynn over Pizzagate.

       Reposting my comment from another thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I don't understand. First, let's assume the following is true:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) The DNC leaks were insider leaks and not a Russian hack
      </p>
      <p>
       B) The Podesta leaks were a result of a fishing campaign that was not Russian sponsored
      </p>
      <p>
       C) The Steele Dossier was based on unverified claims
      </p>
      <p>
       D) The Democratic party and the MSM blitz-pumped the Russian narrative (both hacking and dossier) as a smear campaign post-election
      </p>
      <p>
       E) Part of the smear campaign was to increase sanctions as a result of hacking (that for the purpose of this argument, we are assuming is not true)
      </p>
      <p>
       F) Steele and Russia both know the above is true so they had a conversation to the extent of OPs post
      </p>
      <p>
       So, assuming that the Trump admin and supporters would be comfortable in the above being true, why on earth would:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Flynn lie to Pence about it
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The Trump admin not make the above rationalization public long ago
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Why resign given the above rationalization
      </p>

       can Flynn stay as an advisor to the Pres in a new diff role some point down the line? understandable that he wont have same SC but id assume he already has a pretty high one that hasnt expired.
      </p>
      <p>
       how much contact / advise can Pres have with Flynn as a private individual over issues that his current non NSA / WH SC allows? would this be a massive scandal? it seems loads of private individuals come see Pres either way (as seen with Obama) so maybe not even that discreetly but via official visits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats preventing Flynns/Trumps foreign policy vision continuing to be in place with Flynn recommending his replacement? Is this Kellog guy a globalist? Or seemingly same view of world as Flynn?

       Ahhhh yes. Then why don't you advocate for Jeff Sessions &amp; the Justice department, the FBI, and a Congressional inquiry investigate the President and his team. I mean, he has nothing to hide. No reason why we all can't publicly know about it. It would probably improve his ratings as well. Let's agree to investigate the President between three different agencies. I mean, there is nothing to hide, right? It's all a Hillary and Obama ploy, right?
