How do you think they would&#39;ve handled it if Flynn had e-mails talking in code with Russia, or anybody for that matter?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason Trump is &quot;targeted&quot; this way is because many, many people really enjoy reading very short, uninformed opinions on the internet. </p>

What has trump done that was currupted that you can define? </p>

<p>Also, it seems as if everyone forgot the events that went down before the election which it seems like majority of reddit has, our government and our media coverage are two different entities that have two different goals in mind. It&#39;s amazing how many people suddenly changed and put trust in a media system that has systemically caused the immoral advancement of the communistic/socialistic tendencies of americans. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the government is not to be trusted blindly, but neither is the media. Take from all information inputs and piece together your own opinions knowing that you&#39;re not correct but are rather ignorant. None of us have a full understanding. It&#39;s the people who pretend like they do that hurt the cause of truth. </p>

<p>by whom? the media outlets that were doing everything they could to tell you to vote for her, and not Trump, because he was a sexist racist misogynistic bigoted transphobic Islamophobic serial rapist and once child rapist, with a bad temperament, unfit for office, not to be trusted with nuclear codes, &quot;dark&quot;, only wanted to be President to get rich (because he&#39;s not as rich as he says he is)?</p>

<p>yeah I&#39;ll bet they would&#39;ve been REAL critical of her every action.</p>
