<p>It isn&#39;t a coincidence that opium production has skyrocketed in the mid east, our country is being flooded with heroin, and private for-profit prisons are continuing to fill at an alarming rate.</p>

<p>They make money off addicts, giving the addicts treatment, and jailing the addicts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that probably isn&#39;t true.  the reason why your local junkies aren&#39;t housed between the arrest and the conviction is probably a space issue in your prisons.  Because of all the beds taken up by convicted junkies.  Additionally, jail time doesn&#39;t help junkies.  There&#39;s drugs in prison.  Forced treatment usually doesn&#39;t work either.</p>

<p>As an ex-aholic of just about every mind altering substance, it is really impossible to talk someone into changing their life. I did a total of 3yrs in drug related offenses and did not get sober until 10yrs after that. And I lay about 90% of what I ended up getting into at the feet of the criminal justice system. I highly doubt little dumb hippy pothead me as a kid would have turned into the synthetic chemistry madman I became, if not for exposure to other influences while incarcerated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya, but something needs to give. If you are on long term pain management, you will have an addiction and your tolerance will go through the roof. It&#39;s not a long term solution. 
Your body gets used to the feeling of the opiates so you feel like you are pain without them. When in fact, your opiate receptors are just reacting to not having them and creating the pain. 
If you can research Kratom. It has gotten many people off of long term opiate use. All natural, non habit forming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kratom is being turned into something you can&#39;t get.</p>

<p>I know the opiate dance, I&#39;ve been in pain management for 5 years.  I&#39;ve been on high doses and voluntarily went off of them for a couple years and have found a dosage at a low amount that handles my pain, so much so that I don&#39;t need to fill my IR meds every 30 days, I end up with about 1.5-2 months out of a 1 month script.  I have addiction concerns and my pain management doctor is aware of my request for less is more.  I&#39;m well aware of what life can look like.  I also know that when I&#39;ve not filled my opiates because they are super expensive I&#39;m not fidgety for the missed Extended release meds.  I don&#39;t over compensate with my immediate release, I just deal with it.  It is possible for doctors to be responsible with their prescribing, it is possible for people in pain management to not become abusers of the drugs.  It&#39;s unfortunate that both doctors and patients can&#39;t be because those that can be suffer.  My quality of life when my arthritis medication and my opiates are in harmony is much better than when either of them are out of whack.  Opiates in addition to my other meds to manage my arthritis allows me to lead a mostly normal life in comparison to other people my age.  Without one or the other, my ability to do that greatly diminishes and is terrible for my mental health.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because everybody is distracted with fake pizza bullshit. </p>

<p>But if you want more information it starts with the manufacturer of Oxycotin, a strong opiate based painkiller which was heavily marketed when developed as NON HABIT FORMING! which everybody knows is total bullshit. It wasn&#39;t long before it was the most widely used painkiller in the US with a skyrocketing abuse rate.</p>

<p>Around the same time this is happening the US invaded Afghanistan, where previously the Taliban had almost completely stamped out poppy production. After they are toppled poppy production skyrockets because it&#39;s a cash crop and the US didn&#39;t give a shit about enforcing drug laws as long as they weren&#39;t funding terrorists. So the world drug market is flooded with cheap opiates. </p>

<p>So you have all these opiate addicts from Oxys being pushed on them suddenly saying &quot;hey why am I paying $80 for a pill for my opiate fix when I could just get a $10 bag of  heroin?&quot;. And unlike pills, heroin isn&#39;t a set dosage every time but can be wildly variable leading to a huge increase in overdoses. </p>

<p>So the conspiracy is why aren&#39;t the producers of Oxy&#39;s being prosecuted for misleading the public on the addictive nature of their product? Why did the army/Marines/CIA look the other way when it came to poppy production in Afghanistan, and did they(particularly the CIA) assist in getting it out of the country? And why is the problem getting worse despite filling our prisons with drug dealers and addicts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The poppy fields were the whole reason we were over there, that&#39;s why. Rockefeller family runs the nation and their cash flow is cocain and opium. The military was sent over there to protect the CIAs cash crop. They did the same thing in south and Central America to protect and set up infrastructure to protect the Cocoa farms, too. We arm people to protect the drug trade that the CIA runs.</p>

<p>Everyone has been scared into thinking the Feds are here to protect them. They are here to exploit you and they are winning. They have all of the money and it comes from drugs.
