       As a kid, I really believed thr world was run by secret societies such as the Illuminati, the Freemasons, the Bilderberg group, the Jesuits, the Catholic Chruch, the Bohemian Grove, Skull &amp; Bones and such other groups. But as I grew up, I realised that it was dirty politics all along, that the real people running the show weren't really secretive much, just relied on the people's stupidity to continue existing. They're US government agencies, politicians, Hollywood people and such. The Illuminati and suchh theories don't have much credit in my mind anymore. It's what got me in conspiracy theories in the first place. I guess the truth is a bit boring. Anybody else like me?

       To join the big leagues, you have to have as much power as the big leagues, and I don't see how joining a fraternity like freemasonry can give me political or financial power.

       I imagine the tops of some freemasonry lodges keep an eye out for ppl within the lodge community that might be useful in developing.  I doubt most ppl have the power to force themselves into these groups, rather they are groomed

       But I imagine they still want to choose who inherits their power, rather than the most qualified person getting the "job" (let's use president as an example) the person who has been groomed for the job will get it.  Look at the relationships between all the presidents since JFK.  Besides Carter and Obama they have all pretty much been in the same social circles

       How could joining a global society sworn to protect and empower their brothers possibly give someone any political leverage. I mean, there's no way a mason would show preferences to other masons, no way could someone climb the ladder with the help of insidious insides.

       if you wan't evidence the sky is blue all you have to do is look up. All secret societies have occult knowledge, hence the "secret" in "secret societies". There's mountains of evidence showing royal and plenty of celebrity relations with freemasonry. As another user mentioned Bohemian grove, where the rich and powerful watch a mock occult practice of a human sacrifice.  Watch any popular music video and occult symbolism will be present throughout. Look up spirit cooking. Look at the occult symbolism associated with frats. Look at the occult symbolism in city planning, on the dollar bill, in company logos ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, someone in conspiracy saying the rich and powerful don't have a connection to the occult is pretty suspect.

       I pledged a frat in college, the hazing included a TON of occult ritual abuse stuff.  And this was at a state run school with less than 20,000 ppl
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only imagine what the real frats are doing.  Skull n bones especially. But I would guess any NE Ivy League club or SE University frat (SEC and ACC schools) would be doing some occult shit on their brothers nights.

       They could do occult stuff, but there's no proof that it's what drives them to do what they do. I think it's only normal human greed, corruption and power hunger.

       Watched the video in the past. Definetly did influence my views. There's no demying that there's a plan to control the world to some degree. The US planned to turn the whole Middle-East into states and are constantly looking for ways to put in place a compliant regime in Iran. I don't know if it's NWO degree, though.

       The issue I have with calling them Illuminati is that, first of all, I doubt they call themselves that. And second of all, the stories we hear about the Illuminati makes you feal their whole plan is based on some mysterious religious occult plan of theirs, when in reality it's really just greed and power. They could do some occult stuff, but it isn't what drives them, at least that's what I think.

       I saw once that people wrote numbers in a square in a specific way, and that way determined what would happen to the one who touched the square, or something like that. It would call a demon to do the job. It would be like ruining marriages and such. Is it like this or is it totally inaccurate?

       it can definitely fall into that category! lots of specific rituals and spells that call on either positive entities / gods / goddesses (white magick) whereas black magick calls on demons and evil spirits.

       Do you believe any positive entities can be called through white magick? Because I believe either the entity is either evil but pretending to be good or straightforwardly evil.

       hmm, I see that definitely...they could be tricky. I prefer 'praying' to the god &amp; goddess than asking them for favors. thanking them &amp; staying more neutral seems safer to me. I used a ouija board once and talked to an evil spirit &amp; that fucked with me. it's a thin line!

       IMHO: Think world wide. Think control. Who controls the money? Who controls the major international corporations? Bankers on the board of major corporations are the main suspects. Bankers and corporate execs advise governments. People in very high positions in the international banks belong to organizations some of which are secret. It is more a phenomenon than a conspiracy. The Bank of International settlements may be the top tier but who knows. This forms a very tightly knit group who make decisions that they hope to keep the whole thing from collapsing. The decisions they make and the general direction of things governmental and economic form the policies of governments. Through various secret societies and organizations enforcement and control is managed. People at the top are billionaires, and got that way because they either agreed to the plan or were coerced. If it all falls apart, chaos and anarchy would result and would probably bring down the big kids so any trick or device they use to keep it running is fair game.

       Yes they do. If they need to take someone out, the person may get a promotion and/or a pile of cash. Think about it. The puppet masters have an agenda. A journalist is against it, and writes a piece. Somebody high up calls the owner of the newspaper and the guy gets fired. He threatens. Suddenly he dies in an accident or has a heart attack, or is shot in the back while leaving a bar (Seth Rich). There are a million ways and a lot of people available to enforce the laws for the puppet masters.

       This is a matter of perspective, as with pretty much anything in this reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe that there is nothing beyond what you can see, touch, taste and feel, then sure your position is agreeable.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, (and it's a big BUT), the real powers of this earth can't be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Including the ones that pull the strings of the figureheads we all love to point fingers at and focus our attention on for this scandal or that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secret societies have existed for thousands, not hundreds, but thousands of years. Read some more OP, the truth is out there for you to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not believe money, greed, and power are the true motives of the real ones in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are tools, to acheive their goals. They are the exact opposite of peace, love and equality.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is GREAT power in love. Just as there is in Fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real secrets that have been hidden from us, are rooted in that simple concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       I urge you to try, just try, to view the world from that perspective, trying to identify if the motive behind the message is given to you based in fear or love.
      </p>
      <p>
       The occult societies know something, and worship an idea. That idea is rooted in something we cannot see, touch, taste or feel, in this reality.

       I pledged a frat in college, the hazing included a TON of occult ritual abuse stuff.  And this was at a state run school with less than 20,000 ppl

      <p>
       I can only imagine what the real frats are doing.  Skull n bones especially. But I would guess any NE Ivy League club or SE University frat (SEC and ACC schools) would be doing some occult shit on their brothers nights.

       Watched the video in the past. Definetly did influence my views. There's no demying that there's a plan to control the world to some degree. The US planned to turn the whole Middle-East into states and are constantly looking for ways to put in place a compliant regime in Iran. I don't know if it's NWO degree, though.

       if you wan't evidence the sky is blue all you have to do is look up. All secret societies have occult knowledge, hence the "secret" in "secret societies". There's mountains of evidence showing royal and plenty of celebrity relations with freemasonry. As another user mentioned Bohemian grove, where the rich and powerful watch a mock occult practice of a human sacrifice.  Watch any popular music video and occult symbolism will be present throughout. Look up spirit cooking. Look at the occult symbolism associated with frats. Look at the occult symbolism in city planning, on the dollar bill, in company logos ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, someone in conspiracy saying the rich and powerful don't have a connection to the occult is pretty suspect.
