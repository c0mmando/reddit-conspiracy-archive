        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As a kid, I really believed thr world was run by secret societies such as the Illuminati, the Freemasons, the Bilderberg group, the Jesuits, the Catholic Chruch, the Bohemian Grove, Skull &amp; Bones and such other groups. But as I grew up, I realised that it was dirty politics all along, that the real people running the show weren&#39;t really secretive much, just relied on the people&#39;s stupidity to continue existing. They&#39;re US government agencies, politicians, Hollywood people and such. The Illuminati and suchh theories don&#39;t have much credit in my mind anymore. It&#39;s what got me in conspiracy theories in the first place. I guess the truth is a bit boring. Anybody else like me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you wan&#39;t evidence the sky is blue all you have to do is look up. All secret societies have occult knowledge, hence the &quot;secret&quot; in &quot;secret societies&quot;. There&#39;s mountains of evidence showing royal and plenty of celebrity relations with freemasonry. As another user mentioned Bohemian grove, where the rich and powerful watch a mock occult practice of a human sacrifice.  Watch any popular music video and occult symbolism will be present throughout. Look up spirit cooking. Look at the occult symbolism associated with frats. Look at the occult symbolism in city planning, on the dollar bill, in company logos ect. </p>

<p>Honestly, someone in conspiracy saying the rich and powerful don&#39;t have a connection to the occult is pretty suspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO: Think world wide. Think control. Who controls the money? Who controls the major international corporations? Bankers on the board of major corporations are the main suspects. Bankers and corporate execs advise governments. People in very high positions in the international banks belong to organizations some of which are secret. It is more a phenomenon than a conspiracy. The Bank of International settlements may be the top tier but who knows. This forms a very tightly knit group who make decisions that they hope to keep the whole thing from collapsing. The decisions they make and the general direction of things governmental and economic form the policies of governments. Through various secret societies and organizations enforcement and control is managed. People at the top are billionaires, and got that way because they either agreed to the plan or were coerced. If it all falls apart, chaos and anarchy would result and would probably bring down the big kids so any trick or device they use to keep it running is fair game.</p>

<p>But in the end, who knows.  This post will self distruct in 10 down votes. :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they do. If they need to take someone out, the person may get a promotion and/or a pile of cash. Think about it. The puppet masters have an agenda. A journalist is against it, and writes a piece. Somebody high up calls the owner of the newspaper and the guy gets fired. He threatens. Suddenly he dies in an accident or has a heart attack, or is shot in the back while leaving a bar (Seth Rich). There are a million ways and a lot of people available to enforce the laws for the puppet masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a matter of perspective, as with pretty much anything in this reality.</p>

<p>If you believe that there is nothing beyond what you can see, touch, taste and feel, then sure your position is agreeable.</p>

<p>But, (and it&#39;s a big BUT), the real powers of this earth can&#39;t be seen.</p>

<p>Including the ones that pull the strings of the figureheads we all love to point fingers at and focus our attention on for this scandal or that. </p>

<p>Secret societies have existed for thousands, not hundreds, but thousands of years. Read some more OP, the truth is out there for you to find.</p>

<p>I do not believe money, greed, and power are the true motives of the real ones in power. </p>

<p>They are tools, to acheive their goals. They are the exact opposite of peace, love and equality.</p>

<p>There is GREAT power in love. Just as there is in Fear. </p>

<p>The real secrets that have been hidden from us, are rooted in that simple concept. </p>

<p>I urge you to try, just try, to view the world from that perspective, trying to identify if the motive behind the message is given to you based in fear or love.</p>

<p>The occult societies know something, and worship an idea. That idea is rooted in something we cannot see, touch, taste or feel, in this reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you wan&#39;t evidence the sky is blue all you have to do is look up. All secret societies have occult knowledge, hence the &quot;secret&quot; in &quot;secret societies&quot;. There&#39;s mountains of evidence showing royal and plenty of celebrity relations with freemasonry. As another user mentioned Bohemian grove, where the rich and powerful watch a mock occult practice of a human sacrifice.  Watch any popular music video and occult symbolism will be present throughout. Look up spirit cooking. Look at the occult symbolism associated with frats. Look at the occult symbolism in city planning, on the dollar bill, in company logos ect. </p>

<p>Honestly, someone in conspiracy saying the rich and powerful don&#39;t have a connection to the occult is pretty suspect. </p>
