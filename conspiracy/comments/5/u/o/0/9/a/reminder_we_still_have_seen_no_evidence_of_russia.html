<p>It relied on the report by third party Crowdstrike, and the report put out by CrowdStrike has been debunked</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/12/russia-malware-ip-hack">https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/12/russia-malware-ip-hack</a></p>

<p>as it didn&#39;t prove any Russian involvement.  In addition CrowdStrike is run by a gentlemen who also sits on an Anti Russian Think Tank called the Atlantic Council and has contracts with Google and the FBI.  Podesta gave away his password.  Weiner was sexting a 15 year old.  None of these had anything to do with Russians. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the &quot;contacts&quot; between Russians and Manafort were routine, he&#39;s done decades of business in Russia, same for Carter Page.  The FBI looked at it all months ago and said there was nothing there. </p>

<p><a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html">https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html</a></p>

<p>Trump is even getting tough on Russia in policy.  He&#39;s said they have to give back Crimea which they were shocked and upset by.  He hasn&#39;t even lifted the hacking sanctions even though he knows like I know they didn&#39;t even hack. But after the Flynn fiasco he&#39;s got to be seen as tough, so this isn&#39;t even helping the Russians.  </p>

<p>The whole thing is a sham.  The Russians didn&#39;t hack. Trump isn&#39;t working for the Russians.  The Steele Dossier is a fraud and people are suing 
over their names being included. </p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/03/media/trump-dossier-buzzfeed-lawsuit/">http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/03/media/trump-dossier-buzzfeed-lawsuit/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s simply a conspiracy theory that started out as a an excuse to deflect from the fixing of the Dem Primaries to now being a way to undermine Trump.  The entire thing rests on the CrowdStrike and the Steele Dossier. </p>

<p>&quot;The forensic evidence that links network breaches to known groups is solid: used and reused tools, methods, infrastructure, even unique encryption keys. For example: in late March the attackers registered a domain with a typo—misdepatrment[.]com—to look suspiciously like the company hired by the DNC to manage its network, MIS Department. They then linked this deceptive domain to a long-known APT 28 so-called X-Tunnel command-and-control IP address, 45.32.129[.]185.</p>

<p>One of the strongest pieces of evidence linking GRU to the DNC hack is the equivalent of identical fingerprints found in two burglarized buildings: a reused command-and-control address—176.31.112[.]10—that was hard coded in a piece of malware found both in the German parliament as well as on the DNC’s servers.</p>

<p>Russian military intelligence was identified by the German domestic security agency BfV as the actor responsible for the Bundestag breach. The infrastructure behind the fake MIS Department domain was also linked to the Berlin intrusion through at least one other element, a shared SSL certificate.&quot; (

)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The evidence that state-directed Russian hacking is responsible for the DNC breach is, in other words, more than circumstantial.</p>

<p>An important part of the hack was a so-called &#39;spear-phishing&#39; campaign that attempted to emulate legitimate websites to pilfer credentials and even maintain a persistent connection to a secure session:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim&#39;s full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim&#39;s account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.&quot;</p>

<p>The forensic evidence left by the hacks (C&amp;C IP addresses, spoofed certificates, encryption codes) point to Russian sources due to similarities between these intrusions and previous ones in Germany, Georgia, Latvia and other confirmed breaches.</p>

<p>Again, <em>this has been out since July,</em> including evidence that &quot;Guccifer 2.0&quot; is a smokescreen persona:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;ThreatConnect is the first to identify and detail analysis of Guccifer 2.0’s operational infrastructure. In our original hypothesis, we suspected Guccifer 2.0 might be leveraging French infrastructure to communicate with the global media, and we have validated this finding with the help of the media. As more details continue to surface surrounding Guccifer 2.0, we continue to identify heavy traces of Russian activity, from the specific Russian-based VPN service provider, domain registrants, and registrars as well as various discrete events that have circumstantial marks of Russian origins.</p>

<p>As we pointed out in our previous analysis, we conclude Guccifer 2.0 is an apparition created under a hasty Russian D&amp;D campaign, which has clearly evolved into an Active Measures Campaign. Those who are operating under the Guccifer 2.0 Twitter, WordPress and Email communications are likely made up a cadre of non-technical politruk attempting to establish “Guccifer 2.0” as a static fixture on the world stage along the likes of Manning, Assange or Snowden. Their use of Russian VPN services with French infrastructure may shed light on a method Russian intelligence operatives use — domestic services coupled with foreign infrastructure — to help hide their hand and deter any potential attribution to Russia.&quot;</p>

<p>There is plenty of forensic evidence to parse through. Yes, sure, it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that DNC networks were compromised by APT28 / APT29 (Cozy Bear and Lazy Bear) <em>and</em> that the leak did originate from another, third (possibly internal?) source. </p>

<p>After all, it&#39;s a very bold and risky play to deliberately use cyberwarfare capabilities to leak internal documents in lieu of traditional espionage: it compromises quiet ongoing surveillance in favor of a ploy that may or may not work, and could even spectacularly backfire. But it&#39;s also compatible with an emboldened Russian foreign policy. </p>

<p>And certainly it&#39;s also possible that the leak had far more wide-ranging influences that anyone intended, and all the players are caught off guard here and just improvising. (In fact that&#39;s more likely: only in movies does the villain &#39;foresee&#39; events 12 steps in advance).</p>

<p>And the evidence is more than circumstantial. Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear left significant fingerprints over the crime scene, from the command and control IP addresses, to the specific code and exploits used, to the Cyrillic settings on leaked documents; again, read the third-party security analyses for yourself. We don&#39;t have to just take someone&#39;s word for it, even though the American intelligence community is unanimous in its assessment here.</p>

<p>So: there is evidence; it&#39;s <em>not</em> a slam dunk, but pretty close; and there are many unanswered questions still.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely not a slam dunk. In fact, it is best characterized as one investigator relying on other investigators in a big circle jerk of a self reinforcing echo chamber. The truth is all they have is some code that could have been used by anyone, some circumstantial tidbits that could just as easily be evidence of a frame job to throw off the scent, and a bunch of ip addresses that are tor nodes used by thousands of hackers. There is no proof in the sense that the term proof is usually used.  There is even less proof of any connection between Russia and Trump. In short, it&#39;s bullshit. And we&#39;ve been here before: Iraq WMD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys are acting like these people are seriously worried about getting caught. It worked before, worked again. Our government has been hit by state-sponsored cyber attacks multiple times, and we know most of the sources. Trump was finally convinced it was them, but he won&#39;t do anything about it. DNC just tried to make a bigger deal about this than people usually do, by the basis that the leaked info compromised our election (whether you believe it did or not). </p>

<p>S&#39;okay, reading&#39;s hard.</p>

<p>The point that Trump lied is more important than the degree of connections.   For comparison; President Carter had to sell his family peanut farm and the Republican Congress ordered a full investigation of its finances anyway.  That&#39;s the degree of honesty that was expected in the past.</p>

<p>You did lie about Russia Hacking in your headline.   You can debate whether or not you believe the evidence, but you said &quot;We have seen No evidence&quot; and that&#39;s not true at all.  I don&#39;t know why you lied, but it&#39;s simply not true.</p>

<p>I&#39;d give you pass on Trump Collusion, because his encouragement was public rather than private.  Public encouragement is technically collusion, but I&#39;m not going to call you a liar on a technicality.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen anyone say they are solely relying on the forensic analysis, even though it is a good indicator. We factually know there is other classified information, which probably includes things like intercepted communications (mentioned by unidentified officials in the Reuters piece). This is pretty standard stuff for how they operate, and Trump was likely given this information which led to his conclusion that the Russians were behind the hacking. </p>

The example I gave wasn&#39;t about tracing IPs, it was pointing out how fucking meaningless it is to say &quot;completely unique methods&quot; without any attribution as to what they may be <strong>in a system</strong> that is defined by an agreed-upon protocol.</p>

<p>As someone who is saying &quot;they can do unique things that haven&#39;t been conceived of yet or are otherwise entirely unknown at large&quot;, it is your burden to establish such a thing to be a possibility and how that unique method would obfuscate detection. Otherwise you aren&#39;t actually saying anything, and I&#39;m entirely justified in being incredulous at your suggestion.

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest flaw with this analysis is that it attributes various things (APT28 for example) to Russia without actually having proof that it was Russia. </p>

<p>It literally assumes that these high-tier Russian hackers wouldn&#39;t have known to use a different IP to do this. Wow. Marketers on Reddit know that if you use the same IP to spam stuff, you get caught by the spam filter. How would these guys not know this?</p>

<p>The rest of the analysis weighs heavily on this, which completely undermines it. Seriously, go through the links, there are <em>loads</em> of assumptions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they&#39;re analysis is that they are &quot;moderately confident&quot;, in the sense that this whole thing is plausible. I agree with that at least, a government hacking another government is definitely plausible. But moderate confidence isn&#39;t enough for me, and shouldn&#39;t be for anyone, especially after the CIA had &quot;high confidence&quot; that Iraq had WMDs.</p>

<p>exactly what I&#39;m thinking. If they are at that level of sophistication, then its bullshit that they would leave traces. On the other hand, someone else doing it and making it look like it was Russia is more logical</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, it wasn&#39;t that sophisticated.  Stuxnet (the US operation) was sophisticated.  The DNC hacks are less sophisticated, but the difference is about what you&#39;d expect from a country with Russia&#39;s resources.</p>

<p>Second, the individuals responsible for the hack did not implicate themselves, they only revealed their long-term agenda.</p>

<p>They have a long history of attacking critics and economic rivals of the Russian government.  </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t prove the Russian government did it, but there are no other suspects who meet the profile.  Nobody with the resources to do that operation would have benefited from the false flag.  </p>

<p>Everybody on Hillary&#39;s side would have benefited from the leaks not happening at all.  Everybody  on Trump&#39;s side would have benefited from it looking like an insider job.</p>

<p>The independent actors wouldn&#39;t have had the resources to pull off a false flag on that scale</p>

<p>That being said, there was more than one set of DNC leaks.  I believe that Guccifer2.0 was an insider pretending to be a Russian disinfo operation, and that they used the Russian hacks as cover to get away with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one strange thing i find about a lot of the pizzagaters is this belief that Trump will be the one to save us from all the high level pedophiles. The same Trump who said he knew the pedophile Epstein for 15 years and called him a &quot;terrific guy&quot; in 2002, the same Trump who is named in Epsteins black book, the same Trump who just picked Alexander Acosta for labor secretary. </p>

<p>Acosta was the guy who oversaw the sweet deal that Epstein got in secret which Acosta allowed to happen. So Trumps pick for labor secretary is a guy who helped protect a fucking pedophile and gave a big fuck you to the victims. Also why is hilary still free? Anyways to think Trump will be catching high level pedophiles is a joke because he is most likely implicated in such crimes too given his connections and previous comments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah. Well my understanding is that Manafort was let go due to a campaign shake up, which clearly was a good move. Page doesn&#39;t appear to have played much of a role in the campaign, in fact he&#39;s never met Trump. Flynn has been covered to death but here&#39;s my take: The Russians were being sanctioned for having that they didn&#39;t even do.  Flynn told them to sit tight but he was vague surely understanding the sensitivity of the subject. Even though he was vague and really didn&#39;t cross any lines, he lied to Pence the media and the fbi because he didn&#39;t want to admit to even being vague. Trump found out and didn&#39;t have a problem Smith what he did or his fudging the truth. But once it became a media shitstorm he canned him just to move on. No one looks good but nothing happened that was really unethical. The sanctions are baloney and should be removed.</p>

<p>The sanctions are baloney and should be removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sanctions were put in place because Russia invaded their neighbor Ukraine. Tanks and soldiers marched across the border <del>for vacation</del> to take other people&#39;s shit.</p>

<p>Ukraine, was in dire financial straits, and it&#39;s only gotten worse since the invasion. Prior to the Maiden Revolution, Ukraine had been petitioning for EU membership. Access to the EU would&#39;ve granted membership to a way more robust and successful economy than the shitshow Russia can offer within their own trading block. </p>

<p>Russia (Putin), said fuck that, and sent his troops to <del>have a holiday</del> seize the region of Crimea. Crimea is also the home of Russia&#39;s only port in the Black Sea, in Syria.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your beef with the sanctions? Should the invasions of sovereign nations be rewarded or punished? Do you want to play with someone that steals, lies and murders? I don&#39;t see the benefit of oustrizing the rest of the world and partnering up with a authoritarian nation whose only valuable export/resource is gas. We have a &quot;friend&quot; like that already and Saudi Arabia <em>sucks</em>.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need more shitty friends. Especially not ones like Putin, that guy poisons way too many fucking people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The author of that article is a long-time Russian-Putin apologist whose been described as a sensationalist argument starter.</p>

<p>Yes. Opening Ukraine to the EU weakens Russia&#39;s trade, military and political standing....But...How does Russia&#39;s advancement help anyone besides Putin and his cronies?</p>

<p>Under Putin, Russia has become more authoritarian, more dangerous for the press and much more aggressive. He nationalized multiple productive industries and now holds more wealth personally than many nations.</p>

<p>Putin has also been funding many of the nationalist movements throughout the western world. Rampant nationalist movements are responsible for many of the worst atrocities of hr last 100 years. The prevailing strategy of all of these backed movements is hatred of <strong>the other</strong> and strongarm tactics.</p>

<p>But...None of this is new information. Putin has been ruling Russia for nearly 20 years, and for 20 years he&#39;s been poisoning, jailing and straight up robbing his opposition. Shit. That&#39;s the kind of man you want standing with you?</p>

<p>From a realpolitik perspective, they&#39;re only value is as an energy producing state with militaristic tendencies. The former is good, but gas is a finite resource and the use of it as an energy source is detrimental to our environment. The latter is terrible for both business and general life. War can be profitable for a few, but tends to beggar the majority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of this post is to <strong>deny</strong> collusion between my man Trump and Putin, not to defend and stand with him. The point is, we haven&#39;t seen evidence that proves he hacked anything nor that he&#39;s got a backroom deal with Trump. I completely agree that he&#39;s a mafia don. No one could argue with that. I don&#39;t want anything to do with him. Just tried of this phoney conspiracy theory being used to tarnish the populist uprising here and around the world. It&#39;s so silly I think Trump just laughed it off, but it&#39;s getting dangerous now and those on his side need to start debunking it aggressively</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, since we stand at odds, I&#39;m not sure I care what you think the purpose of your post is.</p>

<p>This is propaganda, poorly made propaganda at that. </p>

<p>Once Trump&#39;s actual finances are revealed and the depths of the corruption shown everyone is going to wonder why they wasted so much on pizza related bullshit.</p>

<p>Your man, is a traitor, he stands ready to sell everything to the highest bidder and those that stand with him, whether it be due to being gormless zombies, racist hatemongers or just general stand grade idiots...You&#39;re at fault for enabling him lunacy, but it&#39;s not too late to take a step back from the edge.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a literally, actual conspiracy unfolding before us and most T_Ds are still wetting their pants over <em>librul tears</em>. Three different people involved with Trump resigned in the last year and all had contact with Russians.</p>

<p>More disappointing, even users of this sub have been too focused on...Pizza? And Clinton&#39;s emails? I read everything there was on it, and it&#39;s all a bunch of unsubstantiated bullshit. Hell, Trump is literally doing even more unethical record keeping now, but there&#39;s still more of her email bullshit on conspiracy frontpage.</p>

<p>There are good things that come can of this though. It&#39;ll just take a good bit of work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly - I agree with you, I think this is largely a distraction, but not in the way you might think. 
Has it ever occurred to you that Trump &quot;getting tough on Russia&quot; is just a ploy to look like he is playing the part? I mean there are clear and undeniable links between Russia and the Trump administration. </p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s a very easy one: Rosneft &amp; Tillerson</strong> Cui Bono? It doesn&#39;t take much of a leap to see what&#39;s happening here.</p>

<p>So lets assume Russia make a bold move regarding the Ukraine (it&#39;s actually happening right now). Do you think that NATO will take action? Military action? The same alliance that Trump decried during his campaign basically being none of America&#39;s business. He&#39;s not necessarily wrong, nobody wants war, it&#39;s bad for business for a start. </p>

<p>I&#39;m extremely surpirsed that you could be so trusting, geopolitics is a shady game, nothing is what it seems and the media can&#39;t be trusted, you know this. There is only ONE guiding principal <strong>follow the money</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess is that it&#39;s being pushed for a number of reasons, </p>

<ol>
<li>It makes great news. </li>
<li>There are a lot of powerful people out there who don&#39;t like the status quo. </li>
<li>Legitimate criticism of what appears to be a 2-dimensional reality TV version of a Presidency. </li>
</ol>

<p>Trumps biggest mistake by far has been the destruction of his relationship with the media. There WILL be criticism,  no government in the world (save North Korea!) gets away without being asked tough questions, scrutinized, and judged by the media, sometimes this can be unfair and legitimately untrue! But breaking that relationship in the way he has means that he has made enemies that have far more power over public opinion that he could ever hope to have. A fatal misstep in my opinion.</p>

<p>Reince Priebus, Donald Trump’s incoming chief of staff, said Sunday that he thinks the president-elect “accepts the findings” of the recently released U.S. intelligence report that ties Russian President Vladimir Putin to meddling in the 2016 White House race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me claiming Russia colluded with Trump is as credible as the pizzagate: if the mainstream media puts so much credibility in these Russian hacking claims, they have no right to label pizza gate as &#39;fake news&#39;. People who believe in pizzagate never claimed that the pedo rings are 100% real, but only asked for the mainstream media to take the circumstantial evidence more seriously and carry out more serious investigations on the matter, but what did we get? We got laughter, harassment and even embarrassment, dismissing all potentially important evidence that could unearth the biggest yet most serious scandals to date. Since pizza gate, to me the mainstream media has gone haywire, working in unison yet in chaos to bring the mass population to blindness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a new theory on this:</p>

<p>A cyber security company found evidence of Russian and Ukrainian botnets promoting Trump memes. This is the primary evidence cited by the Obama admin that Russia hacked the election. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve since found out Trump was using Cambridge Analytica, a machine learning marketing automation system to persuade people to vote for Trump. Including suppressing targeting and surprising Clinton voters into not voting. Google Cambridge Analytica, and read the trumps1stmember AMA. </p>

<p>Meanwhile hacking groups were using their botnets to spread Trump memes on Twitter. It&#39;s possible they either did this to prevent Clinton from taking office, or they were paid by the Trump campaign to amplify their memes. Either way, the Russians were just hacker botnets. Not actual people necessarily and there&#39;s two logical explanations for why these botnets were promoting Trump that have nothing to do with the Russian government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since before I was born, Russia (and the now former Soviet Union), has been the United States&#39; mortal enemy.  Even today, there are Soviet era nuclear missiles targeted at every major city and production center in the US and Europe.  The cold war never ended, it simply morphed into a capitalist detente.  </p>

<p>As the US flexed its muscle throughout the world, the Russians have been working against us, by forming partnerships with our enemies abroad, ie. Syria, Iran, etc.  We are still fundamentally opposed to one another politically.  Russia is a de facto dictatorship under Putin, and we&#39;re supposed to be a Democracy.  </p>

<p>In any other era, any candidate that refuses to denounce Russia, stood no chance of getting votes.  Yet somehow Trump has gotten a pass from the very people that a decade ago would have called for his head.  From the rural rust belt voters to the Republican controlled Congress, somehow, now accept the reality of our Commander in Chief having direct ties to Russia.  This is the real &quot;sham&quot; here.  That Patriotic Americans have been somehow convinced that this is ok under the Trump administration.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, anyone that does not see this whole debacle as a direct threat to our sovereignty, is just as guilty of treason as the perpetrators of this attack on our Democracy.  At the very least, we need an independent investigation, free from any interference by the Trump administration.  </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about left or right, liberal or conservative, this is about the United States of America.  In case you haven&#39;t noticed, we&#39;re in a lot of trouble right now, and we need to find a way to get to the truth.  Not by screaming &quot;Fake News&quot; and tweeting &quot;the Press is the enemy of the American People&quot;.  We know who our enemies are, and Russia is Number 1 on that list.  If Putin gave Trump any assistance in gaining power, we are no longer a sovereign nation, we&#39;re a Vassal State to Russia.</p>
