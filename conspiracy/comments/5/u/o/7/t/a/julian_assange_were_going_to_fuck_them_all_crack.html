       If you haven't seen We Steal Secrets yet, it's definitely worth watching. Whistleblowers are heroes of the people and the enemy of governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I think I should have clarified by saying that this quote is from We Steal Secrets which came out in 2013. This isn't a new Assange statement so don't be disappointed if they don't drop anything... but if I remember correctly Feb 19 might be the day we get the info on Vault 7... not getting my hopes up but that would be prettttty sweet.

       Setting deadlines then dropping disappointing info which lacks the gravity that was built up for it. Withholding info as deadman security switch under encrypted key.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, those are CLEAR ways of withholding info. They don't need the build up spanning weeks of hint drops. Their audience is large enough to where they can drop info and get it trending and spreading IMMEDIATELY.

       So he can do one of two things:
      </p>

       Call up Trump and say this info will lock away bad people let's work something out, which looks like he's fucked either way.
      </p>

       Or he releases the info and let's people know the truth about who is after him and why.

       Its a game of strategy. For example he leaked DNC stuff slow to ruin Hillary cause if she won it would have been another vicious globalist puppet screwing the country. And now, there are other factors going on: deepstate/mossad/Saudi's/MSM Propagnada/PedoGate and all sorts of stuff, he has to pick his releases wisely

       I hate HRC with a passion. She is a criminal and a liar and possibly a murderer, who has no convictions (moral nor legal[unfortunately]). She is as greedy and corrupt as any of them. And yet....and I can't believe I'm saying this... I would feel so much safer with that lying cunt as our President. Not even a month in, and this administration has proven its utter incompetence beyond all expectations.

       My point exactly...
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary might be shady as fuck, but she can comport herself in the manner befitting the POTUS. Instead, we get twitter rants, a white supremacist as an adviser, along with a cabinet full of so much conflicted interests its gone way beyond irony. He tweets like a petulant child, willing to be drawn into the most childish disagreements. He still has the Spice Worm arguing that his inauguration crown "was like, wayyyyy bigger than anyone elses. Also Hillary rigged the election."
      </p>
      <p>
       Political viewpoints aside, what we've seen of trump thusfar are not the actions of someone who has a clean bill of mental health. Listen, I was admitedly happy when I heard he won, hoping against hope that he would drop his '
campaign persona' and do a great job running the country. It became immediately apparent however, that what many mistook for a persona was, in reality how he is. He clearly suffers from Narcissistic PD. He became addicted to holding his rallies and hearing people cheering his name. In fact, he's holding another one in the upcoming week! I wish it were different man, I really do, but he is so far out of his depth, and it's becoming increasingly more obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't even touch upon Russia, Flynn, lies lies and more lies, as well as the debacle at the airports, trying to deny entry to people with greencards. But according to God Emperor Cheeto II, it was flawless. A well oiled machine.... And the SCARIEST PART, anyone who says otherwise is spreading 'FAKE NEWS' trying to make him look bad. All those polls about 55% of the country strongly disapproving of his actions thus far? FAKE NEWS. I honestly believe that's the only way his fragile ego can remain intact.

       We didnt know the US is arming ISIS. What if you knew in real time that bin Laden was attacking US citizens and planning attacks in the US
       <em>

       we were arming the Mujahideen? That is far from underwhelming. If Trump did it he would be drawn and quartered already.

       Reagan armed them. We have been arming them. We've been arming "Guerrilla" groups and Cartels in the Americas for many decades. Anyone that doesn't see the US fingerprints in stuff like this without wikileaks doesn't care enough want something to change.

       Youre right its absolutely nothing. No biggie. Thanks for pointing that out. ISIS is just an arm of the US military and even though they kill US citizens. Not a problem and literally everyone knows this is happening. And everyone approves. Youre right.

       If people cared they would be working together to stoo this. Electing one guy and posting haahtags don't change the situation we are in. Getting involved is the only way to stop it. Idk why you're getting an attitude about this. People don't care. Go talk to people about this, they'll go, "Oh, ok cool" and go on about their day.

       Ok, but if anyone needs a dead mans switch it's him/Wikileaks. In fact, I would say it would be impossible to pull off what they have without one. It is a pragmatic use of withholding info, nothing sinister about it.

       That's controlling it's dissemination not with-holding info. Granted he's got an agenda but the only "disappointing" one he did was one shameless self promotion. He releases it all eventually. He is human plus he's been on de facto house arrest for 4 years. He needs all the leverage he can get.

       What about all the kid's that are being eaten and disssolved in acid? People's lives are in danger? Bullshit. People are already DYING. Every single day. Drop the information.

       I have to imagine he has a VERY tough job.  He can't just release information without verifying it, or his credibility is ruined.  Trying to verify secret information with a limited amount of trusted individuals, while remaining secret has to be ridiculously tough.  I'm sure that I don't have the patience and tenacity to do that.

       Right? I mean imagine how much disinformation must get "leaked" to him to try to ruin him. If he just released every leak without verification he'd release some bullshit then what would he be? Reddit. Plus something's have got to be hard as fuck to verify at all. I have some completely confidential super secret leaked info that next to no one knows about who is going to say it is or isn't true?

       There is no God. 
Authority is an illusion.
Governments exist to make money off the people and keep them from uprising. 
Money is an illusion, a trick played on us all. 
Some agency, somewhere, has records of everything you've ever done or said on the phone or online. 
This is the only life we have, and we let soulless old rich men set policies that effect us but not them. 
The police exist as the strong arm of the government. 
The water we drink has unnatural additives that mess with out brain chemistry, much like our food.
We have been conditioned to think we are in competition with one another, but the elites have long known that when the people work together and take care of each other, we have no need for their version of authority. 
The wars that we fight in are really about population control, money, and resources.

       When you die you don't go to heaven and you don't go to hell and you don't go anywhere because you're fucking dead.

       We have "souls" as in we have sentience, but we don't have souls that exist separate from our physical bodies. So your soul doesn't go anywhere at death. It just doesn't exist anymore.

       There is absolutely no substantial proof that says there is or is not a soul or afterlife. Hell we don't even know if we are the only life in our own solar system, and our oceans remain vastly unexplored. Our depth of human knowledge is so small we may never answer questions like these.

       Of course there isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know what?
      </p>
      <p>
       Religions and ideologies that claim things such as the existence of souls were created by charlatans who didn't believe their own bullshit and sold it to everyone else who eagerly bought it because it justified their existence. It gave them meaning and saved them from nihilism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for the sake of pragmatism- is it better to believe in such things, or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well the people the people who don't believe- the nihilists- are the ones running the world. The people who do believe are their pets. And there IS PLENTY of evidence to support that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like gravity. You do realize that gravity is just a theory? We can't prove gravity does or doesn't exist, at least not at this point. But the functionally practical thing based on all evidence we do have is to work as though gravity
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       indeed exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't prove souls do or don't exist but what we can do is look at the people claiming to have proof to know that they exist and we can look at the evidence they. As you said, there is no evidence they do. And there is evidence that they people who want to claim they exist are charlatans.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this knowledge it's more pragmatic to go through life as if it's the only one you'll ever have. Waiting for a better existence after life is exactly what keeps people from making the biggest impact they can in
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       one.

       Many, many things wrong with what you just said.
      </p>
      <p>
       First and foremost, "Theory" in scientific contexts does not mean "hypothesis" like it does in layman usage.  A scientific theory is a rigorous model which aligns with experimental observations and makes accurate predictions.  Nothing in science gets the label "Theory of X" without a mountain of supporting data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, you're not even right in saying gravity is "just a theory".  Gravity is a natural law.  We directly observe the effects of gravity literally everywhere we look in the universe, from things falling out of our hands to the movements of heavenly bodies.  We have even correctly predicted that gravity affects the path of a beam of light, and a wealth of observation backs that prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a theory - and not "just" a theory, mind you - is the Theory of Gravitation, which is our explanatory model for how gravity works.  So far we have not been able to disprove this model.  There is still the matter of directly observing a force mediator for gravity, as all other known fundamental forces are mediated by some particle, but the current model is backed by so much experimental data that it is highly unlikely that it will ever be overturned, only modified.  Even still, the finite probability that the model may be overturned by some radical observation doesn't change the fact that the phenomenon of gravity itself is a natural law, not a theory.

       In any case, GR is so well-supported that even if that's what you meant (it wasn't), you'd still be wrong in the argument "it's

       Missed a big one: The true shape of the plane-t. Sounds fucking ridic but all you need to do is just a little research with an open mind. Forget the indoctrination, the mind control since birth. Globes are pushed on us even before we can read. Symbols are power and we are run by occultist who know this. I offer one proof and it should be enough evidence for YOU to do your own research. No matter how high you go on the plane, the horizon always stays flat and stays at eye level. This is it. This is the only evidence anyone should need. This is an impossibility on a sphere. If we believe the ancients had higher technology and a better understanding of our world then why not believe them on this? Egyptians, mayans, they all knew it. Before you call me retarded, stupid, imbecile, look for yourself. Search weather balloon flights on YouTube. Make sure that they are not using a fish eye lenses. Even if they do use a fish eye, the horizon with flex. It will go from concave, to flat, to convex and back again. This is only possible with a straight line. I never thought I'd say this publicly, but search it for yourself if you think I'm wrong. And again, remember that the globe symbol goes deep in you. All the way back to birth. Keep an eye out and check out how often you see it. It is pushed on us from everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there is a lot of misinformation out there to keep you off track. The flat earth society is just that. You find one piece that doesn't fit or isn't right and you say, see! This is bullshit! And you go back to your old way of thinking. This is a psy-op on a massive scale. Yes there are holes, no I have no clue what the model of our world really looks like. But I do know what I've researched. Operation high jump, operation fishbowl, Antarctica being off limits, multiple countries (including US &amp; Russia) signing a treaty to keep Antarctica off limits during the Cold War, Russia &amp; the US sending nuclear warheads straight up for something like 5 years.

       You do realise the cruising altitude of a passenger airliner is about 40000 feet and the circumference of the earth is 40000 kms right? There are 3280 feet in a kilometre. So when you're 40000 feet up in a passenger jet you are 1/3280th of the earth's circumference above sea level. What are you expecting to see big picture wise?

       I'm not talking about passenger airliners. Look at high altitude weather balloons. There are videos on YouTube where they get up to 121k feet. By simple geometry that should be enough height to see the curve. There isn't one. It's perfectly straight. Or, if you do see a curve it'll flex. Going from concave, to straight, to convex and back and forth. The only way that is possible is with a straight line. In fact, if you take the high altitude Red Bull jump video and compare it side by side with a weather balloon video at the same altitude you can clearly see manipulation. Fish eye lenses work wonders for creating curves

       I'm not trying to take a dig on you here, I'm genuinely curious why you think "they" would focus their attention on something that seems like such a mundane, unimportant thing.

       Who cares if the earth is round or flat? What would be the danger in the population realizing the earth is flat (if it actually were)? Or, perhaps a better question... what would be the benefit of convincing everyone that the earth is round?

       They have been releasing information slowly but surely and Assange even explained the purpose of this and it makes perfect sense. I'd say it's pretty ignorant to state that Wikileaks hasn't done anything big yet. Look at how far we have gotten thanks to them.

       It's a shame because this kind of thing will turn a lot of people off the important work that groups like wikileaks have done / are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these years locked up in the embassy, the exponential rise in fame/exposure while also being completely isolated from the rest of the world, almost literally living in the I
Internet and then being cut off for months. The threat of being ejected from the embassy after the Equador election...  I think it's getting to him and he's losing it a bit. Whoever is in control of the wikileaks twitter account isn't doing him any favours either.

       No. It really isn't. He sounds at times like an attention whore. It's just fact. He could just release stuff instead of pimping and promoting it for weeks first. But he loves that spotlight.

       He might like the attention (I would as well), but your wording comes across kinda disrespectful. I agree with u/ericcarver , he sacrifies so much still to this day, he deserves better.

       He could have, I guess he wanted fame for what he is doing. And in hindsight I bet you he would give ANYTHING for having stayed anonymous. Surely you would agree that giving up freedom, being shamed as a rapist and having fear for life is no substitute for fame.

       Yeah, but wouldn't you agree, regardless of him enjoying the spotlight and trying to maximise impact for wikileak's (or other agendas') benefits, his work did A LOT good for the world and he sacrifices a lot?
He doesn't deserved to be mocked imo.

       Sure, the wikileaks site shows
       <strong>
        58660 emails
       </strong>
       yet there is actually
       <strong>
        59258 emails
       </strong>
       on the system.. some of which don't appear in count.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wikileaks twitter tweeted on 8th october, at the beginning of their release that "We have published 1% of the #PodestaEmails so far. Additional publications will proceed throughout the election period."

       On 8th oct there was only 4146 emails released - if such is 1%, then 100% is

       Yeah it was good. Could've listened for many more hours. There was a certain opinion that sure the Podesta dunno that he was pro trump, I can assure you that is not the case. His organisations philosophy is very interesting. Would recommend one of the streamed talks to anyone.

       no, just weird attempts since October. There is a palatable difference now vs pre-internet-down-day.  I wish him the best and hope he is in that embassy.

       He could have dispelled these rumors with a random, 30 second visit to the balcony.  The fact that he hasn't, and instead went on Hannity of all shows, speaks to me of something untoward.

       It is indeed very strange. However knowing how big of a narracist he is I could see him not doing that just so people keep talking about him.

       He loves the limelight and with everything going on and the elections over most people have forgotten about him.

       There's just no way.  My DMS would have redundancy across Tor and I2P and I don't have enemies at the state level.  I'm not saying he's not dead, I'm just saying you're not stopping a DMS if it doesn't want to be stopped, much less by a DoS via DNS.  If we're entertaining the notion that Assange is dead, my guess is the DMS leaks keys to the blockchain.  That's what I'd do.

       You'd think he knows better but sometimes his arrogance gets the best of him. This is the same reason Hillary had a private server and how Flynn was caught on monitored phone lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Nixon recording his crimes. These are all people who should absolutely know better but still end up doing stupid things. I just hope he actually does have a off-site secure backup.

       There have been several prerecorded interviews and a live video AMA.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that proves he's alive, but they would honestly be pretty hard to fake.  The Morais interview in particular seems like it would be tough to fake.  That said, I personally believe he's alive, but suspect he's now working for the CIA.

       Which proves that somebody was alive at the time of that video.  I'm not willing to dismiss the possibility that the CIA has a body double or really good rendering software.

       I get that, but I was there. I was there when the mystery internet attack happened and all the weirdness surrounding the embassy that day, then I was still there when we were all clamoring for some shred of proof that the was ok, then I was still there watching as we were bombarded with bizarre attempts to offer that proof, and through it all, there's just been a noticeable change that's taken place in Wikileaks. I don't know if he's still alive or not, but I definitely feel like they got to him, somehow.

       I kinda feel like a veteran reading this. I was there too, and I'm pretty sure that anyone who witnessed this shitshow live is still skeptic. I just wish I could relate to people IRL about this.

       After all that's happened in between I now feel we're already experiencing the worst. But it's getting better, now people are becoming aware (or

       Pam pops iin for lunch. RT get threatened with having bank accounts frozen (or did, can't recall), city airport is evacuated briefly, Assange goes missing, the rest of the emails never came and Clinton has a chat with somebody important for a while in a plane on the tarmac.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah... What was in those other emails was probably enough to cause civil unrest in the US. I think somebody thought it was wiser to cover for Clinton &amp; Co  and bury whatever really damaging shit it was forever.

       I've gotta say something here. Are you suggesting that people can not be affected by world events that they have witnessed, either first hand or via news?  Think about it.  JFK, Pearl Harbor, 9/11, etc....FFS.

       Exactly the opposite actually, I'm suggesting you absolutely can be affected by things by experiencing them first-hand but that "first-hand" doesn't include behind a computer screen.

       I would disagree.  Events like the Arab Spring would be my first example, people all over the world were affected by videos and news received online.  Only a few hundred people witnessed JFK’s assassination, but hundreds of millions were affected just by the mere knowledge of the event.  On and on, endless examples throughout history show this.

       If that were true, why would everyone around him be keeping quiet.  The only answer I've been given is "they were threatened ".  I don't buy that. I don't believe all of those people would keep quiet. Pilger, his lawyer, his family,  wl staff?

       Assange has a dead mans switch. If he was captured or killed all his info would've dumped. It hasn't...........He's still alive
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA is great but they cant kill everyone ever connected to Assange that could possibly be the one holding his info ready to be leaked the minute he's dead. CIA would've also had to take out WikiLeaks staff to assume control of their site and Twitter

       Why would the CIA even kill Assange? Let's say the CIA hates leaks - seems reasonable enough - and hates leakers in particular. The last thing they'd want to do is kill Assange or do away with Wikileaks. Someone might replace it with some sort of transparent, anonymous, open-source solution. Instead, we've got Assange and Wikileaks - people subject to criticism, people with agendas, no transparency, one well-known organization to monitor diligently, etc. Assange and Wikileaks present an opportunity to governments around the world - leaks are going to happen, may as well know who is most likely to receive them.

       I have no doubt what so ever if the CIA could, they would have Assange in a torture chamber right now trying to get every last bit of information out of him
      </p>

       Plus ya know.............Theres the whole rumor Assange knows what really happened on 9/11 such as the CIA is involved. Something like that would obviously be enough reason for them to want him dead

       They could offer him a better life though.  Every man would sell out for security and bliss.  Would you risk your life for the people if the alternative was a life of wealth and luxury?  I like to think I would but then again...

       My opinion, which is just an opinion and is no more than that, is that there was a lot of activity behind the scenes involving the US government, Ecuador, and possibly/probably Russia. I don't think Assange was captured or killed. I just think that something got to him and he has to play his cards a bit differently now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, it makes a better Tom Clancy narrative if we believe he's been killed and the CIA is running Wikileaks now.

       may interest you if you haven't already heard of him. He worked with Clancy on a couple of his books and more interestingly had some things to say about Clinton and others before the election (when I discovered him). Check his videos around then, quite the rabbit hole given his history and career...

       Yeah but - consider the other highly likely possibility at the time:  all that mess was created in order to make Julian Assange seem less credible by making it seem like he was compromised/captured.  That was done so at a critical time when the integrity of wikileaks was hugely important.  As he puts it (and as was said at the time by other conspirators) it was a "black PR campaign", and one which he had no control over (no ability to definitively give proof that couldn't be countered by black-PR trolls that didn't involve him having an active internet connection for live-streaming).  There's a strong case for a group associated with the Clintons cutting his internet and causing all that mess in order to discredit him at a critical time - for little consequence (nothing illegal or dangerous PR e.g. killing him).  It was an easy win - all the discrediting, minus the martydom.  Once he's finally back, all people can whine about is how the poor guy didn't have internet for a few months.  Big human rights complaint, there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno.  With the livestream, I'm convinced he's alive and well.
       <em>
        Maybe
       </em>
       compromised still, but... eh, he always could have been.  He continues to say and do important things, that's all anyone can hope for.

       In the Hannity interview, when they are both in the same shot, you can see that Assange is actually STANDING, and has his hands on some sort of table, which actually looks like his legs if you dont pay attention. You can also pretty easily see that Hannity and JA are not looking at eachother. Something is definitely up.

       But disinformation is disinformation, and it's always harmful. Saying he was standing, saying there was a table. Wtf? And that post had UPVOTES. No wonder everyone talks about the Mandela effect, it's probably actually the effects of flouride, gmo, glyphosate destroying the brains memory functions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by the way, I get that you're excited, but attributing straw man arguments always makes you look bad to those with decent reading comprehension. Did I say a thing about the RT interview? Or, the overall validity of any interview?

       Okay, yes, your shot makes more sense than my table argument. Was that pic from the real interview, because i think what made it look like he is standing maybe is the big blue line at the bottom, that has other news on it etc. I stand corrected.

       Certainly a strange interview. I just hope assange is OK but naturally I am skeptical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose an explanation could be, that it's a small room, limited space in the embassy, and rather than have two of the same chairs in the study, it's better to have two different chairs. That's about all I can think of as far as why the interview was filmed like that.
      </p>

       BUT that's not even to mention all of the other questionable things around Julian. All of it, taken in the context that we have, certainly presents us with a very very odd body of evidence to draw conclusions from.

       Maybe they could make a mask, have someone wear it and create his voice convincingly in software but I work in production and the timeline to pull that off between when Hannity went to London and the interview would be tricky unless they made it well in advance so maybe someone can rewatch it and see what the most recent event he discussed was and extrapolate how much production time they would've had to pull something like that off.

       I'm skeptical for those reasons. By the was the first one was suspicious as all fuck I don't know what was going on there.

       It was nice of the Freemasons to leave convenient messages behind to help us expose them. Kind of a stupid plan for a secret organization, though.

       No joke. Lots of people (rich/famous and otherwise) are Masons, including the Queen of England's husband. Trump doesn't appear toone of them and the stuff you talk about in your article is not how one Mason lets another (or the world at large) know that he is one.

       Nothing looks more petty than what you're doing, and it's incredibly unmasonic. You give the entire Order a bad name and reputation, and frankly, you should be ashamed of yourself.

       Lodges are supposed to be places of acceptance for all races and creeds. You should honestly turn in your card, because you're tarnishing the entire order.

       I tend to think they put stuff aside for the file but have release some to stay relevant. Stuff from the early 2000s (hint) is what I always assumed was in that file. But in 20 years (if WikiLeaks is still around) it will look like old news.

       I thought the idea of the insurance files is it is constantly rotated. Some stuff gets leaked immediately, some is put in the insurance file. Then sometimes when the insurance file is still big enough thyey'll leak something out of it. That way it's not all just old news.

       it is within the realm of possibility that he was black bagged in October.  Be patient with him.  This is info that he knows, he's seen, he has to live with.  If he isn't able to release it, there is a reason.

He was presumed captured or dead for months and instead of just making a public statement he did nothing and allowed the people to think Wikileaks had been compromised. I have officially became a Assange skeptic.

       He hardly did nothing. For a time his internet was cut off. But even during that time, he done multiple interviews and friends of his made statements saying he was fine.

       Oh ya? internet being cut off also cuts off your phone? All it took was a simple phone call. People act like his internet being cut off meant he had zero ability to contact the outside world...fuck that. Assange is NSA imho and right now it is a battle between the intelligence communities.  NSA vs CIA vs FBI.

       He done a phone interview when his internet was cut off so I have no idea why you're saying that? And yes I agree his interviews did seem sketchy considering the circumstances. But his live AMA on Twitch was sufficient proof of life for me. And he said himself there was a Black PR campaign to discredit Wikileaks.

       That's fine not to trust him. I was only arguing your point when you said he did nothing. He had heavy restrictions imposed upon him so he couldn't further intervene with the election. It's entirely possibly he was only allowed to make calls to his family and close friends until they were over, and unable to do any interviews.

       Then why not say that? Why not get a wikileaks post out there stating all of his restrictions? He left it all up in the air. He left people doubting wikileaks as a legitimate source. I followed it all from start to now. He is not a prisoner. He is a free man within the confines of the embassy. He wouldnt even look out his freaking window at the embassy....And whats with Pamela Anderson bringing him lunches? Too much fishy shit for me to take Assange seriously anymore without even taking into account the plethora of false promises.

       He's not a prisoner but while he stays there, he stays there under the embassy's terms. He either follows them or they chuck him out. Pamela is involved in many activities (so was likely very interested in getting to know him), she was introduced to him via Vivian Westwood. I don't really see how that's fishy? If she wasn't involved in activism then I'd agree. He has many people visiting him, probably every single day. Compared to some other people she doesn't visit that regularly.

       You arent going to convince me anything. Sorry. There was NEVER a mention of his phone calls being cut off or restricted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like i said, all it took was him to shout out a freaking score from a sports game. Instead we got sketchy interviews without any real proof when they were recorded. I feel like im the only one that remembers this sub for the long time it was speculated he was dead or captured. Do we not remember #whereisassange? I mean we had an entire subreddit dedicated to trying to find the truth and there were no conclusions reached. And you are here trying to convince me it was obvious he was ok.

       You misunderstand. I did not say his phone was cut off or he had restrictions placed on his calls, I said it's entirely possible though, as we know he had some serious restrictions. I never defined what they were because I don't know. I'm also not trying to convince you he was obviously okay. I'm saying he is okay
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       . At the time I believed something was up, I followed r/WhereIsAssange from the start. It was only after his Live AMA that I was reassured he was okay. And then look back to see it now makes sense what was going on.

       literally nothing in the interviews he posted over the period of 30+ days made any mention of events that would confirm his well being. Why couldnt he just read a paragraph from a newspaper article or mention a few sports scores? The list goes on as to how he could have confirmed his own well being to the millions of people shitting their pants wondering if he had been killed. He did nothing that would make someone go "yup he is alive" it was all fishy fuckery bullshit

       Everyone talks about the "deep state" but right now i think there are 2 shadow powers at war. Im slowly being convinced that Trump is not a conventional establishment politician. They continue to attack him in the MSM which never happens after a president wins. To me this is a telling sign that he is in fact pissing some really high profile cunts off.

       By this logic, he's not at the embassy? Because he's been there for a while and I don't think his paycheck would cover the years of loss of freedom. You think he goes home in some suburb after a day's work at an undisclosed CIA headquarters?

       I am confused about Assange's personal security. The embassy is often bugged and he gets his internet shut off aonetimes, but that's kinda light. Do you think a straight up assassination attempt at the on Ecuadorian property, in central London would be too much of an international incident for the CIA, MI6, etc.?

       He might say they never sit on information but they kind of are, no? There's no way they've been tweeting out all those Vault 7 teasers without actually having the information they claim they're going to release.

       I guess that would make logical sense. Just seems like it's been hyped up for a while now with nothing to show for it except redditors trying to link all the pictures in the tweets together. I suppose that could be wikileaks' intended goal to gain awareness &amp; if so, has rightfully succeeded haha.

       Indeed. I do hope they release something substantial soon. I feel they're starting to drag it along a bit too much now. But you never know what's going on behind the scenes, there could well be circumstances they can't publicly talk about.

       Agreed. There is probably a lot going on behind the scenes that we don't know about, especially when having to consider all the possibilities of consequences after releasing it.

       Exactly. They have to play it smart and be extremely cautious not to fuck up too badly. If they discredit themselves, then leakers won't feel comfortable going to them and people won't trust whatever they release. Then their whole operation turns to shit.

       Does "friend" mean being blackmailed and controlled by Israel? It's pretty obvious when he said "911 was a distraction" he was a Mossad operative. 911 was a false flag attack by Israel.

       Traditional communism was a world of the people and not the elites, though the right (rather astutely in many cases) have always asserted its a big con, the ultimate con, in that it's a system in which all aspects of life are determined by the "new bourgeois," usually in dictatorial, monarch-like fashion, and the people must play entirely along or else be destroyed. Freedom = slavery, the dictatorship of the proletariat heavy on the first part. Judging by how Marxism was politically utilized for many years, its detractors had a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'm weary of a claim like Assange's because it could easily be another form of "control by the people," this time in the realm of intelligence. We just cannot know if Wikileaks' curation includes withholding or burying submitted information for Assange's own ends. It's not that hard to conjure-- a scenario in which one man essentially has the ability to topple governments or systems at will, depending on what he chooses to deploy. I hope I'm not right, that Assange doesn't view himself as some kind of savior or world-builder in this vein. His power and influence are unparalleled in human history, really. It's staggering to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's the monopoly of trust Wikileaks has gained over the years, the lack of competition? I don't know. The world needs whistleblowers more than ever, and it is great to consider a more transparent political planet, even if it has to happen by informational force. We'll see.

       Question for our CTR / ShariaBLUE folks: If you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       hate Trump, and you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       think he's an idiot and all the other things you call him,
       <em>
        why the hysteria
       </em>
       ? why the MILLIONS of dollars and man-hours and "protests", hashtags, tee shirts, slogans, death threats, slander, viciousness? Why not just let him do himself in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either you a) don't ACTUALLY, TRULY believe in your heart of hearts that he is the demon you keep apoplectically insisting he is, and you're just throwing a fit because you're FUCKING BRAINWASHED, OR, b) you DO believe he's a horrible, stupid monster and YOU aren't even smart enough to just let him self-destruct.

       The reaction to Trump doesn't even compare to the loud conservative wail during the Obama years.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        you really think he's an idiot and all the other things you call him, why the hysteria?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Believing that your leader is an idiot who may do harm to your country or to the things that you care about is the exact reason anyone would want to protest, create hashtags, T-shirts, etc. BTW, do you realize that conservatives have done all of these things?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        death threats, slander, viciousness?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those are the sort of things liberals have faced for years -- even more so today when right wingers are declaring liberals and leftists to be enemies of the state.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        don't ACTUALLY, TRULY believe in your heart of hearts that he is the demon you keep apoplectically insisting he is

      <p>
       Compared to right wingers actually calling Obama a Satan worshiper or an agent of Satan?
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, the problem here is that even disagreeing with Trump has become "hate" to people such as you.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        you're just throwing a fit because you're FUCKING BRAINWASHED,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You don't even seem to understand the Trump's opposition, so I don't see how you can fucking claim to be a "freed mind" or something if your beliefs are predicated upon cliches and tropes.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        WHICH IS IT, you fucking downvoting, LYING, RIOTING, pedo-defending, law-breaking, delusional HYSTERICAL jerkoffs?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yep, just as I thought -- you proved my point. If ANYONE sounds hysterical, sounds like they're demonizing others, it is YOU.

       Prior to Oct 16th 2016 everything Wikileaks released was signed with a PGP key.  After the 16th that is no longer the case.  Now it's just a honeypot to identify 'dissenters', like most of the internet is.

       That appears to be the case.  The Podesta emails were DCIM verified, and were auto released (scheduled before Oct) The Yemen emails OTOH had no DCIM verfied-- they couldn't even BE verified because parts are fake or redacted such as John Kerry's email address.

       I think Assange himself while alive, has been compromised by pressure on his family, by pressure from Ecuador, or some other way.

       Wikileaks claimed that the reason the PGP keys didn't match because they were signed for the files within the archive, not the archives themselves. That is possible, but it's not how they did it before. Some people have explained away no release of Phase 3, by saysing something they did release was that..sort of a moving target.
      </p>
      <p>
       The eye catcher to me though is the Yemen emails. Wikileaks has always said they would never edit the content of any documents, because there would then be no way to verify if ANY of it was real. (would not pass DCIM for one thing) But when they released those emails, they had email addresses like '
       <a href="mailto:sender@sender.com">
        sender@sender.com
       </a>
       ' or no recipient , which CANNOT be the real info. And they were cut in mid sentence many times as well (which could be explained somehow, I guess).

       There is a difference between corruption and a quest for global dominance intentionally and aggressively upsetting the global power structure and destabilizing countless sovreign nations across the globe staging violent regime changes all in the name of corporate greed.

       And if you're too lazy, 34 journalists who were critical of Putin were killed in Russia, not including journalists killed in other countries or journalists who didnt have sketchy deaths. For comparison two journalists have died in U.S in simular circumstance in the same time frame and three have died in China (EG: that one video where the reporter got shot by a stranger during an interview in public) Not to mention there are far less journalists in Russia than in America, and yet you're literally 3,000 percent more likely to be murdered as a journalist in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge from actual citizens who love Putin? I'm sorry can you link me a single interview? You'll also literally find the same thing in North Korea bro, I can link you hundreds of videos of North Koreans crying when their previous leader died and the people of North Korea absolutely "love" their current dictator, doesn't mean they are right or that they're just simply lying so they don't get put on a list.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also doesn't seem sketchy how Putin had blatantly overstayed his legal limit as leader? He literally changed the amount of terms you could be president as president and you don't think that's dictator like? Not to mention the fact that he blatantly rigs his own elections and murders his opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can defend Trump, Obama, Hillary or whoever, but the moment you defend Putin is when you cross the line. Please research the history of Putin and what he does before you defend him, interviews with random citizens only will prove my point TBH. You know when Putin came into power he arrested the guy who ran Russias central media companies and forced him to give up the entire company to the government?
      </p>
      <p>
       The people in Russia love Putin because any journalist who speaks against him is killed, thus discouraging any other person from doing the same. find me a Russian journalist who is critical of Putin, alive and lived in Russia and I'll legit delete my Reddit account.

       What are the journalists critical points that get them killed? You jump to conclusions. Could it be possible these journalists are American infiltrators? See America always talks about Russia infiltrating but it never even dawns on them that America infiltrates pretty much anywhere they please. I want to know about how Putin is a threat to the global power structure so much that we need to bring world war 3.  Every...single...time...I hear Putin speak about Western influence im like "yep, he's right, yep, America is trying to dominate the world, yep, you should problem defend your interests for the people of your country, yep"

       So if Russians came here and spouted Russian propaganda and Trump ordered them to be killed you would think that's perfectly fine? You think if Trump stayed as president for SIX terms that'd be fine?

       Anna Stepanovna Politkovskaya wrote many articles being very critical of Putin, she was assassinated in the elevator of the apartment a few days later. It doesn't help the fact that 24 other journalists who were MURDERED had extremely critical views and articles of Putin.

       Three of Trumps hires resigning in a single month after being exposed to having 'Legal' ties with Russia? Nope, can't possibly even be a possibility that Trump has ties with Russia, and the fact that he's lied about his relationship with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not advocating for either side, but I'm just saying people need to not be so close minded. It's not a fact, but it's not debunked in any way, and we as the public know far too little of what's actually happening in our government to make any claims.

       Russia is the world leader in traditional intelligence gathering, to say otherwise is foolish. Assange could have been Russian backed from the start in Australia.

       Good.  I like Assange and think he has been given a raw deal by TPTB.  It is time to allow him to leave the embassy.  This whole situation reflects the workings of a totalitarian elite.

       I feel like he may actually be back at the Embassy only because of his twitter being made at such a random time and with Vault 7 pissing off the French now, whoever took him may have prepped for him to potentially be publicly moved to wherever they move him to in some grandiose gesture.

       They just need to release everything they have and stop playing games. If there is corruption do not wait until you have a beneficial political situation to maybe release it. I admire what they do but dammit just release the information already.

       I don't even believe he's still in the embassy. I think he's been renditioned. Pammy turning up there to see him is just theatre and the next pres of Uruguay has said he'll kick him out. problem solved, the deep state can say it's got him and the Brits can stand down their police guard. I think we're all being played.

       He has sold out.  Every man has his price.  I love you all but if I was offered the world I would give up on my endeavors.  TPTB can silence anyone and it's not through violence.  I am a good person and I want to change the world but when I am given the choice between a good life and maybe changing the lives of others I will choose myself.  And you will too.  Assange is living in paradise with a ultimatum of helping himself or trying to help the layman.  You decide.

       How is this possible when wilileaks blatantly leaked info during the last electron in a biased manner? Every day something reported that the Democrats were doing, but not very much on trumps dealings... idk i find it hard to believe it will be "for the people" instead of just being another media outlet tool to manipulate the way we think...

       If the "wrong" candidate wins the presidency in Ecuador, Assange will have to leave the embassy and face sex assault charges in Sweden. He's has some heavy karma headed his way after all his collaboration with Russia and help to Trump in the last election. Enjoy the shackles Julian!

       in trumps post truth era who cares what dirty things are revealed? People are either incredibly jaded or have outrage exhaustion. "The powers that be are corrupt? What else is new"

       There is a lot of hare on wikileaks in this thread that I don't understand where is coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think releasing all the info at once will benefit the situation and the cause? There is a reason they release the information in a very systematic and timed way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange is the hero of our time and you guys can't even be grateful for what he's done because you don't like the rate at which he releases the information or accuse of of being an attention whore?
      </p>

       I don't know and I appreciate the civility. That is the biggest question cuz who really gives a shit what the shape of the planet it right? My thoughts are: maybe there is an abundance of land and resources beyond Antarctica. Like what admiral Byrd talked about. Or to hide our divinity? To worship science instead of realizing that we are "god." That we have more power then anyone could ever dream? To make us feel small, insignificant &amp; alone. To play god? Pillage the earth, change/splice DNA, create hybrids, to try to imitate the creator? I don't know. I am not a religious person by any right. If you search flat earth vids on YouTube you will come across a shit ton of people who believe in the Bible and Jesus. Nothing wrong with that but it just turns me off. Especially because the Bible/Jesus are just assimilated or stolen stories from generations upon generations before. Honestly I have no fucking idea why anyone would want to hide it. That is my biggest hang up with the whole thing. My guess? That the reason is a lot bigger than anything I could imaging

       Oh, you mean the same Assange that for six months threatened to release damning information that would have supposedly "stopped the DNC in it's tracks", or how about how he supposedly was going to release information that would "put Hillary behind bars
       <em>
        for sure

       !"

       Exactly. They have to play it smart and be extremely cautious not to fuck up too badly. If they discredit themselves, then leakers won't feel comfortable going to them and people won't trust whatever they release. Then their whole operation turns to shit.

       Oh ya? internet being cut off also cuts off your phone? All it took was a simple phone call. People act like his internet being cut off meant he had zero ability to contact the outside world...fuck that. Assange is NSA imho and right now it is a battle between the intelligence communities.  NSA vs CIA vs FBI.

       He done a phone interview when his internet was cut off so I have no idea why you're saying that? And yes I agree his interviews did seem sketchy considering the circumstances. But his live AMA on Twitch was sufficient proof of life for me. And he said himself there was a Black PR campaign to discredit Wikileaks.

       Does "friend" mean being blackmailed and controlled by Israel? It's pretty obvious when he said "911 was a distraction" he was a Mossad operative. 911 was a false flag attack by Israel.

       My opinion, which is just an opinion and is no more than that, is that there was a lot of activity behind the scenes involving the US government, Ecuador, and possibly/probably Russia. I don't think Assange was captured or killed. I just think that something got to him and he has to play his cards a bit differently now.

       Of course, it makes a better Tom Clancy narrative if we believe he's been killed and the CIA is running Wikileaks now.

       I have to imagine he has a VERY tough job.  He can't just release information without verifying it, or his credibility is ruined.  Trying to verify secret information with a limited amount of trusted individuals, while remaining secret has to be ridiculously tough.  I'm sure that I don't have the patience and tenacity to do that.

       Yeah but - consider the other highly likely possibility at the time:  all that mess was created in order to make Julian Assange seem less credible by making it seem like he was compromised/captured.  That was done so at a critical time when the integrity of wikileaks was hugely important.  As he puts it (and as was said at the time by other conspirators) it was a "black PR campaign", and one which he had no control over (no ability to definitively give proof that couldn't be countered by black-PR trolls that didn't involve him having an active internet connection for live-streaming).  There's a strong case for a group associated with the Clintons cutting his internet and causing all that mess in order to discredit him at a critical time - for little consequence (nothing illegal or dangerous PR e.g. killing him).  It was an easy win - all the discrediting, minus the martydom.  Once he's finally back, all people can whine about is how the poor guy didn't have internet for a few months.  Big human rights complaint, there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno.  With the livestream, I'm convinced he's alive and well.
       <em>
        Maybe
       </em>
       compromised still, but... eh, he always could have been.  He continues to say and do important things, that's all anyone can hope for.

       So if Russians came here and spouted Russian propaganda and Trump ordered them to be killed you would think that's perfectly fine? You think if Trump stayed as president for SIX terms that'd be fine?

       Anna Stepanovna Politkovskaya wrote many articles being very critical of Putin, she was assassinated in the elevator of the apartment a few days later. It doesn't help the fact that 24 other journalists who were MURDERED had extremely critical views and articles of Putin.

       I'm not talking about passenger airliners. Look at high altitude weather balloons. There are videos on YouTube where they get up to 121k feet. By simple geometry that should be enough height to see the curve. There isn't one. It's perfectly straight. Or, if you do see a curve it'll flex. Going from concave, to straight, to convex and back and forth. The only way that is possible is with a straight line. In fact, if you take the high altitude Red Bull jump video and compare it side by side with a weather balloon video at the same altitude you can clearly see manipulation. Fish eye lenses work wonders for creating curves
