       I don't know chigg.  I've never posted here in this sub.  I have however, been closely watching politics my whole long life and there is a widening divide between the realities of say someone like me and those in the Repug party.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to hear what others thought.  I don't engage much at my age w/people in my life so this sub seemed a great place to run this 'conspiracy' by.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really have never seen anything like this, ever, in politics.  Nixon came close but the Republicans (tea party religious zealots) have shown they will go to any lengths to achieve their ultimate goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that makes sense.  I think people are really concerned, don't you?

       The reason you have never seen anything like this is it was a rigged game since at least post Andrew Jackson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is the FIRST president since George Washington to not be owned by anyone. That is why it is so unique.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is going to save our country or die trying. And if they kill him, D.C. will run red with blood.

       yeah, and mostly based on 'entertainment'.  This is Tea Party crazy and I've watched interviews w/normal Republicans that they can't compete w/those crazies.  ie: The last run for Gov in Montana.  I forget the guys name but he was stunned by the ruthlessness and anything goes tactics used by these religious zealots.

       The liberal establishment would ever want a Pence in the WH. Trump at least has entertainment value (not to mention ad-revenue).
      </p>
      <p>
       TBH the GOP doesn't play 8D chess. Trump does. GOP likes to play it safe, this is why they tried to appeal to Latinos in 2016 elections (Guac, Rubot, Zodiac). Pence had no idea he'd win, and for Trump, he was just a pawn to bring in conservative voters, not to mention to scare the shit out of liberals in the case he would ever be ousted.

       Ah.  DJT had entertainment during the election.  Now?  Not so much.  Contrary to your opinion, which I respect, I do think the Tea Party zealots, the Koch bro's and all the other extreme crazies
       <em>

       would go to any lengths to achieve their goals.  Machiavellian is the word of the day.

       When was the last time a President was ever impeached? Nixon resigned before that happened, unless he resigns or gets Kennedy cursed, he's not going anywhere as much as you hate him based on your MSM brainwashing. No one up there is innocent and neither is he, focusing on just him is naive though. Both sides are friendly and this is all media bullshit, wake up.

       This post completely misses the big picture they've already admitted to with the shadow gov derp state.  It's past time to stop thinking in terms of Democrats and Republicans.

       Here let me repeat it for you sugar: you've spent how much time this am insulting me.........adding nothing to the topic.  If you didn't find my post appropriate, interesting or valid, you could of dropped a down vote and moved on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only assume you and most of those here are young.  In school?
      </p>
      <p>
       But no.  There has been very little opportunity for discussion.  Just insults, off topic comments and you guys are still going strong.  Most mature folks just don't even bother.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I decided to allow myself the luxury of sending you a PM and I did state:
      </p>
      <p>
       take a hike spammer (that's you incognito)  I also stated that you should get a job and then the icing on my PM?  You jerk off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go do something good for someone.  Go look for someone that maybe needs a helping hand.  Maybe you could find someone that you could compliment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just am encouraging you to stop trolling me....w/you unsolicited comments/insults/suppositions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen a posting w/(0) up votes and 48 comments.  You all are so bizarre.  You should have your cell phones taken away.

       Your loved ones have my sympathy.  peace and love bozos
