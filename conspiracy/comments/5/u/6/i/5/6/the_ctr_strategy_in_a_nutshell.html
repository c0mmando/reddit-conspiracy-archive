        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yes, there is a crossover of some Trump supporters who post here, and yes several of T_D posters frequent this sub (Pizzagate was talked about a lot on that sub).</p>

<p>But im seeing a synthetic campaign to make this place APPEAR to be a hardcore conservative based forum. They are working diligently to politicize Pizzagate&#39;s roots. It&#39;s beneficial to them, because once it&#39;s politicized and deemed an &quot;alt right trump&quot; standpoint, it will block us from being able to redpill democrat/liberals, who are also human beings, and will react the way anybody else would react to pedolhilia. They know we need to reach the masses, so by politicizing this forum/sub as a hardcore alt right based discussion forum, they cut in half the amount of people we can reach just like that. TPTB don&#39;t want unity under this issue, this is a big part of their strategy on this sub: Make us look like a bunch of salty racist and anti Semitic republicans who are   engaging in a witch hunt against the Democratic Party. And all the people who take the spectrum seriously are instantaneously divided on the issue. </p>

<p><strong>The truth is, most of us are non partisan!</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve also noticed a bunch of comments like,</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, so pedophilia only happens in the Democratic Party, huh?!?&quot;</p>

<p>To make us look like we don&#39;t pursue these crimes on the right. See how stupid the fucking two party system is? </p>

<p><strong>They are pushing this because they want it to look like we are a radical group persecuting and trying to bring down the democratic party with this wild accusatory witch hunt of &quot;pedolhilia&quot;, that&#39;s their narrative. The truth is, we need to unite with the left on this issue, to take the air out of their sails</strong> </p>

<p>If they deem this place pro trump, just call them out and remind them that the majority of us are non partisan. Don&#39;t let them muddy the waters by dragging politics into this very simple issue. People who fuck kids are wrong regardless of what party they come from, and both parties are implicated in this. </p>

<p>EDIT: The downvotes are strong with this post! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, rabid supporters from either side are counter productive. Lately though I&#39;ve been called a shill any time I suggest trump could be a Russian shill.

<blockquote>
<p>O&#39;Brien accuses a wide range of prominent individuals — from United States, Canadian, Mexican and Saudi Arabian government officials, to stars of the Country and Western music scene — of being part of a Project Monarch conspiracy to run sex slave rings and commit child abuse.[6] For example, O&#39;Brien claims that George H. W. Bush and Miguel de la Madrid used holograms to appear to her in altered forms, saying that <strong>&quot;Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like &quot;alien&quot; which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes. In retrospect, I understand that Bush had been painstakingly careful in positioning our seats in order that the hologram&#39;s effectiveness be maximized.&quot;</strong>[1]:167, 211</p>

Yeah, some of the art I saw Podesta owns is rough.  I think if the art is a reflection of its owner&#39;s mind, having such a collection is telling.  In googling for the examples for you, I found a quick good summary website.  You should check it out, shows some really fucked up art being showcased at Chez Podesta.</p>

<p>Biljana Djurdjevic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She grew up during the war in Serbia and her work reflects that horror in an expressive way. Indeed her style forces the viewer to become the abuser of the subject of her paintings. They&#39;re really quite powerful. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In her paintings, Biljana Djurdjevic refers to the victims of contemporary culture. Her portrait-like sketches are often completed in light color. The structured patterns of wallpaper or flagging refer to public environments like hotel rooms, shower rooms, or locker rooms. Even though they are dressed, the pale skin of the painted figures dominates the composition. The figures appear like the nudes in Lucien Freud’s paintings. The pure flesh becomes the target for injuries and violence. </p>

<p>The figure’s gaze directed at the viewer expresses desperation and fear. <strong>Fear of the approaching viewer who himself becomes the offender in front of Biljana Djurdjevic’s figurative paintings.</strong> Fighting dogs as well as clubs and even the cross are symbols used to indicate violence and torture, which become metaphors for all wars and distress. </p>

<p>Biljana Djurdjevic controls the view of the observer by limiting the spatial representation of the crime scene to the size of the figures. The desperate victims can no longer be abandoned to their fate. </p>

<p>In perfect adhesion to the tradition of her country of origin, Biljana Djurdjevic relates the myths of our time using the language of the manifesto and of socialistic propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an interesting pattern of &quot;66%&quot; upvoted when the post is about certain subjects I have been noticing today. Posts calling out CTR or posts challenging some of the false, astroturfed narrative that people are seeing being pushed on to the sub seem to have this certain &quot;66%&quot; upvoted pattern, as if to make sure certain subject matter never gets something like a clear consensus and majority, as if there is internal debate about what&#39;s going on in the sub.</p>

<p>I am not saying that there is not a certain, heavier percentage of people brigading in favor of CTR, or a percentage of peopl e in here that are just brigading upvotes to anti-Trump and downvotes to anything critical of CTR, the DNC and Hillary, but the &quot;66%&quot; number seems to be something I am seeing a lot. (Just a casual observation from Yours Truly......)</p>
