       While the title essentially speaks for itself, I think it's important to note that this is clearly part of their strategy on this discussion forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate has been branded as an "alt right" radical movement since its inception, and the CTR are attempting to brand this place as some kind of Donald Trump fuck fest republican hee-haw...We want to be able to reach people from ALL parts of the spectrum, and by them brigading and painting us as this conservative based echo chamber, we will not be able to be taken seriously by the left/liberals.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will be just as pissed and disgusted as you and I are regarding this stuff once they learn about it, but we need to expose the CTR strategy to try and nip it in the bud. Try to spread this along, just keep in mind, I'm extremely confident that this is their agenda. There is no doubt that they are convening and plotting to carry this out on any discussion platform talking about Pizzagate. They wanna make this look like some ficking Salem Withc Trials hunt type of shit against democrats. Don't let them do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        SPEZ: This Russia shit is being shoved down our throats here by the shills as well. They are trying to make it seem like this Flynn Russian connection is a "legit conspiracy" worth looking into and that Pizzagate is nonsense and that we are wasting our time and ruining the sub by discussing it. They want us To divert our attention into Flynn/Russia. Don't buy the horseshit. We all know the Russia narrative is a crock of BS...

       I'm sure you did Jeb but this community knows me, and I'm much more concerned with the community as a whole. This is the best sub on reddit and hate to see brothers argue over false idol politicians. We reject our government and hopefully new posters will see how truly accepting this community is despite outside entities compromising the discourse. Enjoy your day brother. Turn off the tv, read read read, and do not argue with your fellow man

       The entirety of reddit has turned into a shit show since about two months before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been here a long time, I up voted the Trump's plane on the tarmac the same as a Russian diplomat before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, taking a look at the sentiment outside of this sub right before the election and now, it is difficult for me to believe that their isn't an effort to push Trump supporters into doubting their vote and to make them feel embarrassed for voting for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should investigate Russian claims, but just like with Pizzagate we shouldn't take anything as a beacon of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigate everything equally.

       Because there has been a clear difference in this subs substance since
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       was banned and the election.  Dissenting opinions now result in calls of being a corporate shill rather than a real consideration of the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure youll probably look at my history and say the same.  But that could be because there are still people in this sub who believe any conspiracy should be discussed.  Not just ones that fit a certain group's agenda.

       For years in hear dissent or disagreement has often been followed by accusations of shilling. One thing this last election cycle taught us is that there is a documented army of shills out there and we know who's message they are pushing. That also happens to coincide with pizzagate but I don't really think that's the cause.

       I dont see anyone considering the real possibility though?

       Basically false flag shilling.  After tracking the ctr and brock efforts extensively during the election i noticed a shift towards the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       The initial ctr stuff was clearly clumsy but then became more advanced. Began with brand new accounts but then progressed to purchased and aged accounts that would collect karma by making highly agreeable posts in sports, sports team, music, band, etc subs. Subs that were smaller and more welcoming.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first i found was one that posted in an sub which provided support for homosexual males. The first comments for the account were "hi im new here" and "i just came out" which garnered a good bit of karma.  Then the account went dormant for two months, and then bam huge amounts of pro clinton activity all over the place with phrases and comments and daily arguments straight from the super-pac mailers combined with vociferous attacks. (I know about the mailers because i signed up for them as well on a hunch).
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it so unreasonable that the same group(s) havent just switched focus and now masquerade on reddit as trump supporters to sow dissension and divert discussion, all the while trying to portray trump supporters in a progressively worse light? And along the way they pick up actual supporters in their wake, because they have created accounts that display support for trump and so their concerted efforts are given more credence by actual followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a thought but it follows along with documented online propaganda efforts.

       The false flag shilling is being done to craft pizzagate as an alt-right fake news theory:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, one reason there are a lot of Trump supporters here is because we have been pushed out of other forums that were either removed r/pizzagate, or co-opted by an echo chamber operated by shills (v/pizzagate and the_donald)

       There also seem to be an inordinate amount of trump supporters who are using inflammatory language to attack or discredit different opinions. Then there are others who just participate like any other sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could be a number of things, could be good ole immaturity (as an interaction j had yesterday proved to be) or a concerted effort to discredit and hamper discussion.

       They learned what worked and what didn't before the election. They were here arguing with us, they had all the time in the world to collect, follow, and understand where our frustration comes from. When they created Shareblue they have had over three months to construct a plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are finally seeing what they were working on, I'm just afraid it is going to work this time.

       They are using companies though, theres tons of evidence that backs this up.  They just outsourced, its not the basement full of virgins that brock started away.  They made that shift before election was over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shareblue is just the organizing umbrella for money and direction.  The actual 'shills' are working for other companies.

       The thing that I've seen though, there are no Pro Hillary "members" posting in this sub. But a ridiculous amount of Pro Trump "members".
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen countless posts about "CTR Shills", but I haven't seen these actual posts making it to the top. All I see is Pro Trump submissions that are spammed by newly created accounts and most likely upvoted with alternate accounts or bots. And somewhere in the mix of all that, are some legit conspiracy submissions.

       Neither party does. Russia doesn't want sanctions lifted. Their response to sanctions was to restrict exports (sanctioned themselves).

       i am pretty sure they restricted grain exports to ensure they didn't have food stability problems (which they still did).

       I didn't realize they had restrictions on their energy or defense sectors. I don't think they do.

       The defense industry hasn't limited exports. Where do you get that from? They've increased exports since 2014.

       Sanctions only prevent the US and EU from exporting stuff to Russia, there's no way to prevent a country from exporting stuff without a blockade...

       Russia and freezing their assets.

       and that is all well and good. I've been frequenting this sub for about 2.5 years, i didn't mean to appear snarky, it is just that there are many of us, who have left the blue sidelines bc of everything that has come to light. when people insist that disliking hrc and believing in pizzagate are the equivalent to being a flag waving member of the donald, it is infuriating. there are more independents than blue or red when in actuality,  (

       tell is that you brought that diametric vibe to this post. And where his post was civil and calm, you brought insults and aggression. I think people can make their own minds as to what it means.

       Not sure where the anger accusations are coming from. But it is out of the blue to say someone can't be liberal and a fan of TD. So maybe youre just being extremely naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading and participating in TD does not mean you are conservative. Yes, there are HIGH ENERGY POSTS that seem stupid and pro-trump. But there is also a lot of discussion involving critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd suggest you keep an open mind about the 300k+ subscribers of a subreddit and not classify them into a single perspective like you are.

       critical thinking? people get banned all the time for having dissenting opinion. They say you are not allowed to endorse any other candidates (or it did) how is that an environment for critical thinking?

       Have you watched this last election? Have you seen how bad the media and even reddit is? The DNC is not good for anyone but themselves and it has been proven by how they interact with each other through emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because someone has posted in the donald, doesn't automatically make them a conservative or hard core donald supporter.

       Bingo, this battle of narratives has been going on since way before the election. I voted for Obama in his second term. I lean left on social issues, but I'm scared shitless of the propaganda that is being forced by the left right now.

       I've started comparing it with political ads. And ask them why political ads must disclose who it is paid for. Same with political signs. That seems to click a little bit even then, not much problem with it.

       They have followed through and forced their narrative to seem grassroots and from the common man, thus this massive online shill presence. Feels a bit propagandaesque, especially after Obama signed the "countering disinformation and propaganda" law into effect on Christmas.

       I agree. I'm admittedly a left leaning indepedent (not a Hillary supporter) and this sub has gone to hell since the election campaigning began last year. T_D really made a mess when they were allowed to push certain views continuously (which weren't false) while ignoring their great leaders flaws.

       Step back a second there.  Don't worry about people on r/conspiracy who are zealously pro-Trump, because there are tons of other people who see that the focus should be on establishment, corporate/government/MSM players.  Anyway, people are entitled to their opinions, and their hopes. The great thing about r/conspiracy is that people are (mostly) allowed to speak their minds.  Personally, although I disagree with many, probably most, of Trump's ideas and policy proposals, I

       You don't think Putin's control if Russia is wrong? His killing of political rivals? The military push for Crimea? I'd say being lax against that is sending a message to our government. Not someone I want as an ally.

       It's much easier to work with ally's than enemies. What Putin is doing is nothing compared to our "ally" Saudi Arabia, for example, or our own military interventions in the Middle East where we're currently bombing 7 countries.

       Look, I'm not saying Clinton was any good at all but saying "where's the outcry over SA so let's just ignore Russia" is a straight dumb idea.

       I also realize the left is hypocritical on a lot of things. I'm not one of those leftists who is, I know Obama's and Clinton's issues. If you really want to brush the Russian issue under the rug than that makes you just as ignorant as the Clinton supporters who ignored her problems.

       I agree but I didn't say that. I said the Russia hysteria is meant to distract you from real issues, and it's working. I don't condone what Russia is doing, but competitively speaking, it's way down on the list of issues.

       That's fair. I think SA should be on the front lines of things more. They're a bit better about laying low, unlike Russia lately though with the whole Crimea thing. I also saw a lot of people being up "why is Saudi Arabia on the Ban list since they had 19 highjackers"...which is an interesting questions I'd love an answer for.

       Well, SA is currently bombing the shit out of Yemen, which seems kind of similar to Crimea, although I guess they're not trying to annex it per se.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think the difference is? I think it comes down to money. We know SA buys a ton of weapons from the US, and they have also donated many millions to the Clintons, so it wouldn't be surprising if they were in the pockets of other politicians too.

       Russian interference narrative stemmed from the deep state and was pushed through the media. More often than not the media isn't trusted by a conspiracy theorist, why would they change now?

      <p>
       Nobody is brushing it under the rug, we are reading about it everyday because the media is shoving it down our throats.

       The Russian narrative was being pushed before the election, we saw the Dossier, we saw the conspiracy with the Trump plane being on tarmac when Russian diplomat was there.

       All eyes are on Russia, but it is strange how they jumped up to be the Boogeyman when we started accusing our government of arming terrorist and pedophilic rings.

       If the Russian narrative is false, then why did Flynn resign instead of fight it? That's my question. No doubt there is a lack of evidence presented to the public but if he was innocent then why not fight it? Trump even said "the leaking of info is what the real issue is" on Twitter which makes it seem that the leak is true. Does it not?

       Because he spoke with a diplomat before being in office. That's why he resigned/fired. I think he was called out and his resignation is justified, I'm not sure if it is evidence of corruption or Flynn jumping the gun on his job.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kinda lean towards the latter based on Flynn and his son, they are more outspoken and anyone months ago could have called that they were the strongest link to the Russian narrative. Trump having him resign is probably the best course of action if he was trying to keep the administration corruption free, but it also fits if they are trying to hide ties to Russia.

       My hope is that Flynn knew his goose was cooked and he messed up and took the resignation for the betterment of the administration.

       Of course, I'm probably being hopeful.

       Wait, when politics was wall to wall emailghazi stories (which all ended up being fake news) that's when it was like conspiracy? I agree.

       I just think you're confused as to when the shills took over means. The shills were purged from politics, the fake news ended, and now the same fake news is here.

       Well I'll have to disagree with you on that. I've noticed a trend of pro PG and pro Trump posts and comments with a huge push by the users to counter any opposing discussion as shilling. I've never seen the term
       <em>
        shill
       </em>
       thrown around as much as it has been in the past ~5 months.

       I don't deny it doesn't happen, it certainly does.  But to assert that any discussion that isn't pro PG or pro Trump as shilling?  Really?  I have a feeling I'm not the only guy that's not a shill that doesn't support either of those things, so I need proof to convince me that I am alone in a sea of shills.

       Who said that? Only you did. I'm not a Trump supporter but if you don't believe in pedogate then you haven't read/watched enough.

       At some point you need to get this information for yourself; you can't rely on others to give it to you. There's plenty of information about shilling on Reddit and social media. Read up on David Brock, Correct the Record, Media Matters, ShareBlue

       And I'm referring to Pizzagate, the investigation into alefantis, podesta, cpp, etc.  I don't like how they've sucked up every human trafficking or child molestation incident in the past and claim any in the future.

       i think you might be seeing an increase in people who frequent the donald here because you can actually get real news here and they are awake enough to realize that. Where as someone who is a hardcore far left leaning individual may not want to be here (except to stir the pot) because alot of the things discussed here cast members of their political elite in a very bad light.

       Oh I don't disagree with the bots. A study showed 22% of Clinton's online presence was due to bots. At the same time, Trump had just as much (actually a few percent more but he's a tad more active which I'm willing to bet pushes the bots to "react")

       There are many different angles involved in social media astroturfing.  These services are utilized on the right and the left in political campaigns, but they are also used in long term ideological power struggles.  There are services pushing movements that are anti-EU, anti-NATO, anti-US, anti-globalist anti-Russia, anti-China, anti-Islam, anti-ISIS.  There are also services just pushing pro-country propaganda (ex: bots posting pro-India spam).
      </p>
      <p>
       These services are not all equal, in quality, funding, or success.
      </p>
      <p>
       These services also do not make up a marge percentage of the social media conversation.  The most successful technique is seeding natural conversation and recruiting people close to the desired views.  Twitter bots are garbage, they have no real followers and just spam shit comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most successful services wouldn't utilize bots too often, maybe just stat pumping.  They also don't have 500,000 paid employees typing at keyboards.  They utilize data analytics for targeting strategies, and utilize multiple platforms to influence trending for propaganda aimed at a receptive audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider any honest political person who's trying to influence their local democratic party, via facebook/twitter/newspaper comments.  They are trying to get 50 people to see their view and begin pushing it alongside them.  This is the same for astroturfing operations, except the people behind it are doing it for dishonest reasons, and they have massive amounts of funding and capital.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this subreddit, it seems like people think 75% of "the other side" are paid shills.  In reality, it's more likely that 1-5% are.  The real shilling happens before the people are arguing here, when they've read 30-40 articles linked by people in the same group, supporting the same positions, and changing their opinions on the topic.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Since this post is in response to astroturfing services that are not the ones used by the left in the 2016 election, I'll post some solid sourcing and articles on different examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please take the time to read this article, it documents a very relevant trial run of this in 2015.

        Dozens of journalists, media outlets and politicians, from Louisiana to New York City, found their Twitter accounts inundated with messages about the disaster. “Heather, I’m sure that the explosion at the #ColumbianChemicals is really dangerous. Louisiana is really screwed now,” a user named @EricTraPPP tweeted at the New Orleans Times-Picayune reporter Heather Nolan. Another posted a screenshot of CNN’s home page, showing that the story had already made national news. ISIS had claimed credit for the attack, according to one YouTube video; in it, a man showed his TV screen, tuned to an Arabic news channel, on which masked ISIS fighters delivered a speech next to looping footage of an explosion. A woman named Anna McClaren (@zpokodon9) tweeted at Karl Rove: “Karl, Is this really ISIS who is responsible for #ColumbianChemicals? Tell @Obama that we should bomb Iraq!” But anyone who took the trouble to check CNN.com would have found no news of a spectacular Sept. 11 attack by ISIS. It was all fake: the screenshot, the videos, the photographs.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Cambridge Analytica (CA) is a privately held company that combines data mining and data analysis with strategic communication for the electoral process. It was created in 2013 as an offshoot of its British parent company SCL Group to participate in American politics.  In 2014, CA was involved in 44 U.S. political races.  The company is heavily funded by the family of Robert Mercer, an American hedge-fund billionaire.  In 2015 it became known as the data analysis company working initially for Ted Cruz's presidential campaign.  In 2016, after Cruz's campaign had faltered, Cambridge Analytica started to work for Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        SCL Group calls itself a "global election management agency" known for involvement "in military disinformation campaigns to social media branding and voter targeting". SCL’s involvement in the political world has been primarily in the developing world where it has been used by the military and politicians to study and manipulate public opinion and political will. SCL claims to have been successful to help foment coups.
       </p>
       <p>
        CA's involvement in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries became known in July 2015.[7] As of December 2015 CA prided itself to have collected up to 5,000 data points on over 220 million Americans. At that time Robert Mercer was a major supporter of Ted Cruz. The Mercer family funded CA directly and indirectly through several super-PACs as well as through payments via Cruz's campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        In September, the Trump campaign spent $5 million with CA to target potential voters.[24] Eventually, the Trump campaign spent about $15 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        After Trump's win of the presidential election on November 8, 2016, Matthew Oczkowski, Head of Product for CA, indicated that "(o)ur internal data showed the race tightening in the last few weeks of the election because of previously hidden trends within voter sampling and demographic abnormalities in absentee ballots and early voting (particularly in rural areas). These trends, in part, were responsible for the boost towards the president-elect in the industrial Midwest. Our models predicted most of the late movement correctly." Alexander Nix indicated that CA's involvement took an "instrumental part" in the win.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Tapping a network of Trump-friendly technologists in Silicon Valley, Kushner enlisted Brad Parscale, a San Antonio marketing strategist who sports Trump ties and Zegna suits, to run the campaign’s digital task force, dubbed “Project Alamo.” Parscale’s 100-person crack team reportedly spends $70 million a month to take people who are leaning toward Trump and turn them into the candidate’s most ardent fans. At the same time, Parscale’s San Antonio-based team is engaged in a wide-ranging effort to discourage Democrats from supporting Hillary Clinton. “We have three major voter suppression operations under way,” a senior official told Businessweek. Specifically, the campaign is aiming to turn off young women, African Americans, and millennials, using targeted campaigns designed to make them too disillusioned to vote.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the people who do support Trump, the team has figured out how to reach them on Facebook and keep them hooked, even after the election is over. It’s that upside that drew Stephen Bannon, the former Breitbart News executive who came up as the Trump campaign C.E.O. this summer, in. “I wouldn’t have come aboard, even for Trump, if I hadn’t known they were building this massive Facebook and data engine,” Bannon told the magazine. By November 8, Businessweek reports, the Trump campaign will have collected up to 14 million e-mail addresses and personal information—including credit cards—for some 2.5 million people.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        An automated army of pro-Donald J. Trump chatbots overwhelmed similar programs supporting Hillary Clinton five to one in the days leading up to the presidential election, according to a report published Thursday by researchers at Oxford University.
       </p>
       <p>
        “They’re yelling fools,” Dr. Howard said. “And a lot of what they pass around is false news.”
       </p>
       <p>
        In some cases, the bots would post embarrassing photos, make references to the Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into Mrs. Clinton’s private email server, or produce false statements, for instance, that Mrs. Clinton was about to go to jail or was already in jail.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Oxford researchers had previously reported that political chatbots had played a role in shaping the political landscape that led to Britain’s “Brexit” vote.
       </p>
       <p>
        The researchers have coined the term “computational propaganda” to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like Facebook and Twitter.

      </p>
      <p>
       Pointing out conspiracies from the emails is NOT Hillary bashing, that is a lie the media told you. Most of the regulars here are people who didn't support Bush, Clinton, Obama and only like Trump because for the first time ever the media who we believe is controlled (emails show this) has done nothing but attempt to a) stop his presidency and now b) create scandals and destroy ties with Russia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he controlled opposition? Maybe, and that's a valid argument, but don't let your hatred from Trump (created by the media and groupthink) stop you from thinking critically and actually analyzing the situation.

       and when do they come around? when a big story about russia takes place. The Dossier, flynns connection to russia. All of a sudden, people are strongly motivated to make sure we arent talking about that, and instead are talking about someone who lost an election and a pizza place? WHY

       You can use sources to build an argument, but nothing is accepted as absolute fact. Best example: CNN reports that "unnamed sources" say Russia hacked the election. We don't just buy that shit. Just because you see 100 random fringe sites being posted on here doesn't mean everyone takes them at face value -- we take nothing at face value. That's the point. Everyone has their own agenda so you have to look at everything and use judgement to wade through it, and this is the purpose of this sub. Just because the NYT covers a conspiracy doesn't mean we believe they're telling the truth or are even interested in it as a "conspiracy". The MSM media has been a tool for a very long time.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Dossier is complete nonsense full of grammar and spelling mistakes along with mention of the wrong person with the same name as someone on Trump's transition team, and was "leaked" by someone who was paid specifically to find "dirt" on Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       All Flynn did was talk to the Russian ambassator (part of his job description, especially considering it was soon after "sanctions" were put in by Obama in regards to "election hacking' a.k.a. "b.s.") before he took the job. He did nothing illegal, it was a trust issue that he did not enclose that to Pence. How is there some Russian connection there? I don't see it looking from my perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen the media has been talking nonstop about Russia since Ukraine, there is a clear narrative being construed here with millions of people blindly following it. I mean they even went as fair as to fabricate the claim  that "Russia hacked the electricity grid" in Virginia. The whole thing is a collaborated effort to a) get Trump out of office and b) destabilize relations with Russia for the deep state's gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally if Trump we're to be called by a Russian phone number, the media would post something like, "Russians attempt to call Trump to blackmail him," it's just sad that they have so much control over the narrative.

       sure, it could, but this doesnt seem like their MO. how is the deep state replacing narrative they dont want?  id argue that the msm is the mouthpiece of the american establishment, in that they cover stories they want covered and gloss over those they dont.

       Because they do want it, they've been anti-trump since way before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does no one find it strange that the Russian narrative stemmed from unnamed sources in the CIA and NSA before the election? Now it's the full truth based on the MSM?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there is apparently a Russian spy vessel 15 miles out from the north eastern coast of America. That's weird right? That's almost convenient after Flynn's resignation.

       I'm not saying it isn't true, I haven't been presented with evidence that makes me confident in kickstarting the second half of the cold war.

       Nice over-exaggeration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that when the news starts creating phrases that don't represent the reality of the situation and resort to emotional based fear-mongering articles to get their point across they are intentionally manipulating people to herd to a certain though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream news isn't inherently false, actually the majority of it is true, but they do spin the "truth" to achieve certain political/business goals. It's the difference between saying something like "The Russian government hacked the election," vs "John Podesta's email server was allegedly hacked by Russian based hackers according to CIA." One of those is clearly further from reality than the other (though the evidence is weak that Russia was involved in the first place), but which one became the widely used phrase? It's not that it's false, but dishonest if that makes sense.

       Major media stories, remember this is conspiracy not news or worldnews.  Typically conspiracy posters attack the main stream media's reports because the media is paid off by it's corporate owners who want a controlled populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       When all of the sudden "conspiracy" posters are promoting the main stream media's talking points and narrative, like with the Russia story, it should be a giant red flag that the shills have taken over.

       You're still completely ignoring the basis of conspiracy, that the media is in on it.  You're completely trusting their coordinated reports without questioning their motives, something a typical conspiracy poster would never do.

       It's very strange that this sub has always been critical of the media, and the deep state. It used to always dive into the CIA  MKULTRA experiments, but now apparently it is par for the course to accept their narrative and investigations.

      <p>
       They fooled us into Iraq, they fooled us into giving up our freedom, they fooled us into arming terrorist. Somehow, everyone who was critical of the government has bought the Russian narrative hook, line, and sinker without a second thought.

       'by working every day to spread Kremlin propaganda, the paid trolls have made it impossible for the normal Internet user to separate truth from fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The point is to spoil it, to create the atmosphere of hate, to make it so stinky that normal people won’t want to touch it,” Volkov said, when we met in the office of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation. “You have to remember the Internet population of Russia is just over 50 percent. The rest are yet to join, and when they join it’s very important what is their first impression.” The Internet still remains the one medium where the opposition can reliably get its message out. But their message is now surrounded by so much garbage from trolls that readers can become resistant before the message even gets to them. During the protests, a favorite tactic of the opposition was making anti-Putin hashtags trend on Twitter. Today, waves of trolls and bots regularly promote pro-Putin hashtags. What once was an exhilarating act of popular defiance now feels empty. '

       You obviously don't have a clue about the history of the CIA - it was started by the ultra left wing progressive FDR administration, and it's been the number one promoter of "non-Soviet leftist" for its entire existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA's house propaganda organs - like Time magazine and Playboy - were all 100% culturally left wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've swallowed the Deep State's CIA leftist propaganda hook, line, and sinker I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would suggest actually read a book - start with the history of the OSS, which was the organization that the CIA was founded from. It was staffed, from day one, with left-wing progressives.

       So their scheme was to run around destabilizing leftist governments and supporting right wing regimes so that I would be tricked into not noticing that they were actually super-secret progressives in some undisclosed way? Yeah, I guess they got me with that one.

       Good lord - you really have bought the propaganda. The CIA promoted globalism throughout the Cold War. Many of the so-called "right wing regimes" were only "right wing" when looked at through the eyes of Soviet propaganda.

       I think you're confusing Neoliberal with Progressives (adding the word leftists seems redundant). Many establishment neoliberals have been claiming they are progressives (ahem, Clinton anyone?) simply to get votes. A good percentage of people just believe what a politician say outright, so I can see why you'd assume this, but you're wrong.

       No, you're just trying to confuse the issue. The elite in America is "progressive" - there is not point in trying to sow confusion over labels. That is how they label themselves, and that is how their fellow travelers label themselves.

       You seem to be ignoring reality and creating your own definitions - the Clintonites are progressives - self-described. They are not classical liberals, hence the term "neo-liberal."
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "progressive" was originally used to describe people like Teddy Roosevelt, then later was adopted by the softer parts of the Communist party, and when the Soviet Union fell, the former Communists virtually all rebranded themselves as "progressives."
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton is a self-described "progressive." Her famous line against Bernie Sanders was, "would reforming Wall Street end racism? No! Would reforming the banks end sexism? No!"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's progressivism - cultural Marxism, promoting "Social Justice" instead of economic justice.

       We've been blatantly taken over by T_D and by pro Trump bots and half this sub is screaming 'SHILL INVASION'. Seriously, post any news that paints Trump in a bad light and immediately recieve 20+downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of people here who can't even criticize or view their president as anything but perfect is scary. I didn't realize this sub had turned into a pro government circlejerk.

       It happens to pizzagate posters too, quit acting like it's only Trump apologists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just post something political charged from each side of the issue and watch the upvotes and downvotes battle. I've seen dramatic shifts of 30 points up or down in less than a minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian narrative started from CIA insiders and James Clapper, who have been heavy criticized on this subreddit and always have because of PRISM, NSA spying, and MKULTRA. It's not like one day everyone decided that Trump is the second coming of Jesus. They believe that the deep state is trying to save their interests.

       How do pizzagate posts get downvoted like you claim when they litter the front page? There was literally a pizzagate sticky at one point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, Trump threads get flaired, which never happened in the almost 5y I've been here. The two biggest ones have been removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cant claim theres an effort here to silence pizzagate when the evidence points towards the opposite, especially when pizzagaters respond to criticism with shill accusations and attempts to hinder discussion of both sides. They don't want discussion, they want to push an agenda.

       And the Russian posts aren't pushing an agenda of the CIA? It happens both ways, if you question someone of shilling don't just check their comments to see if they post on the Donald. Take a second to actually read what they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is attempting to hinder conversation except the people who are decrying that this place is The Donald part 2 because their views align.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk about whatever conspiracy you want, but pizzagate was kicked off reddit and everyone is surprised that it ended up here. This is what happens with censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is an investigation into Trump's Russian connection then by all means post with all the evidence you have. I'll question everyone of your sources, which is common. If  most sources come from unnamed officials in the NSA and CIA then I will most likely doubt it. Hindsight is a bitch to governments

       "Corporate shills" - you mean progressives leftists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire Fortune 500 is left-wing progressive globalists. Just read any Fortune 500's "values" page and it reads like a Democratic party Social Justice Warrior rant - it's all about "no borders," globalism, "diversity" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire corporate establishment, Wall Street, etc., all wanted Clinton and the Democrats and they all opposed Trump. The entire left progressive movement are nothing but the shock troops of Wall Street corporate globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The progressives ARE the corporate shills - that is why the progressive movement is funded by globalist foundations and capitalist oligarchs like George Soros.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you consider yourself a "progressive" and whine about "populism" and want open borders - congrats - you ARE a corporate shill.

       It is very interesting how the open borders left shares the same anti-workers position as big multinational corps.  Let's bring in millions of 3rd worlders that will lower their costs and force down wages for everyone!  It's sad because the left used to be all about protecting the working class.

       The old pro-worker labor movement doesn't exist anymore - it was killed, starting with Carter, and finally buried by Bill Clinton and Al Gore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting in the 1960s, the "left" decided to promote "social justice" instead of economic justice - because that fit in with the agenda of the global corporations who had bought them off.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were plenty of old time labor unions that fought them - they knew what was happening - but unfortunately they lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the entire left  progressive movement stands for eactly the same thing as the global corporations do - cheap labor, open borders, imperialism, scab labor.

       "Progressive" and "nel-liberal" are the same thing. They are both opposed to classical (i.e., real) liberalism.

       You are likely confused about Bernie Sander's actual record as well. Sanders just wanted more social welfare policies - which is GOOD for corporations, because they don't have to provide health care and benefits anymore.

       He resigned because he lied to the VP, causing him to lie on national television. Nothing Flynn did was illegal. If it was and intelligence agencies had their conversations proving Trump and his administration are Russian spies something would be done about it. Idiot.

       I buy into the idea that those with power can and do exploit children, but you're obviously a trump supporter with an obvious bias.  The CTR shit is a joke,
       <a href="/r/politics">

       It's interesting to me that you have this inability to open up to a Russian conspiracy.  You're mind is not open to the idea because of your political affiliations and your own ego.

       It's interesting that you haven't addressed any of my points but instead have made the decision to try to trollbait me with phrases like:

       Trump is closer to a democrat than any Clinton or any Bush.  But before any alarms are sounded, if Trump is guided by Russia how does it benefit Russia for Trump to ban refugees, arrest human traffickers, or investigate vaccine damages and CIA torture or weapon trafficking in the middle east?

       To be fair though there are a lot of blatant Trump supporters here. As a lefty it can be off-putting seeing somebody cry big gov and conspiracy in one sentence and then go on to praise Trump (and his swamp monster cabinet) in the next.

       Nice try asshole. So, i'm supposed to believe that only you and pizzagaters know the truth about what's going on and i'm not supposed  to question the almighty trump government or suspect them of being shady and doing shady shit behind our backs? It's people like you who are trying to throw us off the scent. We should be digging into any crooked behavior. The fact that you're telling me that this Russian shit shouldn't be looked at is highly suspicious and to me it's YOU who are the shill, distracting me with garbage theories and half baked conclusions. I'll make up my own mind thank you!

       It's much easier to work with ally's than enemies. What Putin is doing is nothing compared to our "ally" Saudi Arabia, for example, or our own military interventions in the Middle East where we're currently bombing 7 countries.

       No, you're just trying to confuse the issue. The elite in America is "progressive" - there is not point in trying to sow confusion over labels. That is how they label themselves, and that is how their fellow travelers label themselves.

       Just post something political charged from each side of the issue and watch the upvotes and downvotes battle. I've seen dramatic shifts of 30 points up or down in less than a minute.

      <p>
       The Russian narrative started from CIA insiders and James Clapper, who have been heavy criticized on this subreddit and always have because of PRISM, NSA spying, and MKULTRA. It's not like one day everyone decided that Trump is the second coming of Jesus. They believe that the deep state is trying to save their interests.

       You seem to be ignoring reality and creating your own definitions - the Clintonites are progressives - self-described. They are not classical liberals, hence the term "neo-liberal."
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "progressive" was originally used to describe people like Teddy Roosevelt, then later was adopted by the softer parts of the Communist party, and when the Soviet Union fell, the former Communists virtually all rebranded themselves as "progressives."
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton is a self-described "progressive." Her famous line against Bernie Sanders was, "would reforming Wall Street end racism? No! Would reforming the banks end sexism? No!"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's progressivism - cultural Marxism, promoting "Social Justice" instead of economic justice.

       I'm sorry you've been a victim of propaganda for likely your entire adult life and never once looked passed the boogey-men you were being fed.
