    <div class="md"><p>Highly intelligent psychopaths are attracted to positions of power. They often are also very charismatic and manipulative. Perfect recipe for positions of authority, especially politics. I would also say that many child abusers are probably psychopaths, not necessarily attracted to children, but children just happen to be the most vulnerable, and that&#39;s attractive to the psychopath.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also this theory, which I find extremely interesting.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kakistocracy</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>“One of the reasons for the intimate association of the power elite with child abuse is that they might use it to maintain their, somewhat hidden, ‘kakistocracy’: government by the worst and most evil people: a highly capable brand of psychopaths if you like.</p>

<p>Psychopathy is only mildly hereditary, so an elite psychopath cannot guarantee that sons or daughters will be just as psychopathic. I expect this entails that they need a steady resupply of ruthless and power hungry individuals who understand the world deeply and pervasively and, as such, are highly capable. Normally deep and pervasive understanding leads to wisdom and a sense of responsibility, humility even. But that is precisely not what that the kakistocracy needs: it needs the same depth and pervasiveness of understanding, but in combination with utter ruthlessness and the capacity to appear respectable.</p>

<p>Enter child abuse. By abusing children you “give” them an attachment disorder by violating or destroying the deep sense of security that is the basis for an open attitude towards learning and discovering. With this trust violated the child’s world changes from a world of opportunities, to a world of potential and actual threats. And often they will search and serve those who can protect them from these threats and in doing so giving their autonomy away for life. And they might even carry it over to their children: stultifying their growth towards autonomy. Aristocrats and priests must have discovered a long time ago that abused children lead to useful adult servants; slaves actually. And while this is despicable to people with a normal moral development, it is a positive thing for psychopaths who see other people as tools anyway.</p>

<p>Yet this does not solve the problem of keeping the kakistocracy supplied with respectable appearing, super high functioning, and completely ruthless psychopaths. Only a small fraction of the population (say 1%) is psychopath and as such has the benefit of an absence of empathy and a conscience: psychopaths are able to exploit others as if they were tools. Yet the vast majority of them are not particularly evil: they can be ruthless, daring, and callous, but they find mostly norm-abiding ways to be psychopathic: they might be mountaineers, military, ER-doctors, car or insurance salesmen, real-estate brokers, or white-collar criminals. But most are definitely not the high functioning individuals that compare with how the power elite sees themselves and would accept as their peers. So how do you recruit suitable psychopaths in your midst if they do not advertise themselves as such.</p>

<p>Enter child abuse again. If you organize events for the ambitious and capable in which they progressively can show that, notwithstanding their veneer of respectability, they are actually completly ruthless, you have the ideal recruiting grounds for the kakistocracy. Of course blackmail plays a role, but the suitable candidates gladly let themselves become blackmailable because this gives them access to the inner sanctum of the kakistocracy: they prove themselves worthy members and loyal (due to their blackmailability) and in return they will receive access to power in a way they could never dream of on their own. After a while they become fully accepted a level that suits their capabilities and they will help to maintain the system that gave them so much opportunities (and can end their respectability at any point in time).</p>

<p>I think that what I have sketched above is a useful framework to understand the dynamics of elite child abuse networks. It is never an incident, it is “just” the kakistocracy maintaining and reinvigorating itself: business as usual. But the few moments the abuse networks become exposed it provides and ideal opportunity to glimpse the kakistocracy at work (and frantically protecting itself).”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, a more recent study concluded that the richer someone becomes, the more sociopathic their brain can become. That wealth of resources can make a person more callous to the needs of others. </p>

<p>So many studies these days are flawed, and I don&#39;t think anyone has yet to attempt to replicate the study for validity. Just something to note. But I believe the study was done through a computer simulation of wealth/resources increases while they gave the participants of the study different scenarios within the simulation, all while monitoring the pathways and function of the brain of the participants. It was this way they found with more simulated wealth/resources participants brains registered less activity in the empathetic areas of the brain. </p>

<p>I will try to find a link to the study results. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening with these people. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>When people &quot;believe&quot; they are superior to others, they enlarge the ego complex which lessens sympathy to others. It brings out the worst in human beings and it never fails. Anyone can do this.. cops, professors, rich people, politicians. There are people in power who believe they are equals to all other people more or less and these people are the least effected by this problem. </p></li>
<li><p>Another thing about psychos is that they usually grow up in a scenario which convinces them that most all people are evil. They figure that evil can beat evil so they start slow and work their way up as &quot;punishing&quot; people. They try manipulation, physical harm, intimidation, ect.. which all enlarges the ego complex slowly. </p></li>
<li><p>Eventually, unintended harm turns into intended harm. For example, Rothschild knows he&#39;s killing the world with his policies and so he knows he is harming us for profit purposes. Eventually, this leads to iniquity. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>in·iq·ui·ty
iˈnikwədē/
noun
noun: iniquity; plural noun: iniquities</p>

<pre><code>immoral or grossly unfair behavior.
</code></pre>

<p>As this unfair behavior happens more rapidly, the psychopath loses control over his own personality. Once personality control is lost, the psycho becomes an impulsive and very unfair monster. At this point, it is nearly impossible to reverse back into a normal human being although there has to be a way we just haven&#39;t quite figured out yet. </p>

<ol>
<li>The psychopath sees the public as a bunch of dangerous savages because he projects himself on all those people he runs across. He is greatly afraid of the public and sees them as a bunch of wolves. This fear and paranoia is extremely distressing even for the psychopath and so he figured that the only way to live in peace is to enslave people with power. If the psycho enslaves the &quot;wolves&quot;, he might be harming them but they &quot;deserve&quot; it and the psycho is more &quot;safe&quot;. Because of this thinking, the psycho seeks power to enslave the masses and what better power than the power of a politician. </li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>They are masters at words and storytelling. Their left brains are hypertrophied.</p>

<p>But they are not erudites because they&#39;d know what always happens to tyrants and empires. Nor do they possess wisdom, for they have no idea who they are and what their purpose is. They are terrified by death and truly despise themselves. They are vulgar and grotesque, have no humanity, conscience, courage, or panache. They are utterly incapable of producing anything beautiful, or even recognizing it. They hate and despise the solitary human mind, the unilateral creator who&#39;s capable of writing symphonies or telling the truth with few words.</p>

<p>These are not archetypes of real intelligence. The psychopaths are intelligent as reptiles may be intelligent. No offense to reptiles.</p>
