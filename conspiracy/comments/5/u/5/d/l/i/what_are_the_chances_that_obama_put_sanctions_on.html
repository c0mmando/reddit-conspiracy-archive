    <div class="md"><p>He was fought from every angle to heal America point blank period. When he got elected it was the first time our country was instantly divided the way it was since the civil war. Let&#39;s be real here. He simply tried to change America into a much more acceptable image around the world especially inheriting what the clusterfucks that the Neocons previously left behind. </p>

<p>Majority of the world respected him and he made sure to help/be fair the underdogs and whistleblowers to show the world that America did have a different ideal that was being hidden and overidden by a select group of people that wanted America to stay the way it had been going since it&#39;s conception. </p>

<p>That in it&#39;s essence is why it was perfect that Donald Trump came along, because he already knew in the back of his mind, it would clear the names of the innocent and pinpoint the real problem for the rest of the world. By simply allowing the Neocons in the white house again, America is about to become enemy number one, we will be looked at how the world seemingly views Israel. </p>

<p>This in itself is attributed to pride and not being humble in our dealings. The worst thing to happen was to exalt a man that has so much pride. Obama cleaned our image across the globe, he made us shine in a different light with a different attitude. </p>

<p>Now all of that is undone.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t set anything up, it was done simply by being/moving different than previous administrations and not following the traditional American way (America F**K YEA!) attitude.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<p>You work a job that gives you 7.50 every week and one week the boss decides to pay you $20.00 an hour and then the next week he takes it back to 7.50, how do you feel?</p>

<p>Trump is the same as all the other presidents but 10x worse, he&#39;s a hail-mary play by the Rothschild&#39;s. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a &quot;if we can&#39;t have it, nobody can&quot; scenario. </p>

<p>You sure about that? Obama may have come across as your Knight in shinning armor, but he was anything but.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The frequency of Espionage Act cases under Obama has earned him the reputation of waging a “war on whistleblowers.” New York Times reporter James Risen has called Obama “the greatest enemy to press freedom in a generation.” Damning words, indeed.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure? Or was that just the spin that was used?</p>

<p>Example, I can say I am a hardcore against people who gamble while still running a casino.</p>

<p><strong>From your link</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those Espionage Act cases included the trial of Chelsea Manning, who was held in solitary confinement for nearly one year prior to her military trial, prompting a condemnation from the UN special rapporteur on torture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all know what happened with that hardcore stance on Chelsea...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As long as I’m attorney general, no reporter who is doing his job is going to go to jail,” Holder said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you see, you can&#39;t believe the words in politics, they most of the of time mean nothing at all. It&#39;s the actions. </p>

<p>Is James Risen the be all end all? No. </p>

<p>What we can see is that people like Chelsea was showed a lighter hand, Snowden got away and nobody actually ever pursued Julian but the Rothschild factions because he leaked their shit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s turning out to be a symptom of a deeper running Russian connection I fear.  It&#39;s highly doubtful this is the first Russian contact they had. </p>
