       Americans have more in common ethnically and culturally with Russia than we do with Saudi Arabia, Israel, China, India, Pakistan, Japan, Korea.  Why do we want to start a war with people that are similar to us? Why do we turn a blind eye to the atrocities committed by our "friends" in Saudi Arabia, Israel, China?

       Putin doesn't have morals and he wouldn't make a good friend. It's so weird seeing him shirtless cuddling animals when I know what he's done. It's jarring, he thinks he can dictate to the world his own vision of himself, but fuck him. He'll go down in history as a violent mobster. People will piss on his grave and remember the men and women who were better than him that he had murdered in cold blood.

       Allies? U.s. has done far far far worse than anything russia has done. I have a problem  with americans always pointing fingers when they are the most aggressive and murderous nation on the planet.  Drives me nuts it is always someone else to blame for everything.

       Would you rather live in America or Russia? If America, then why are we trying to bend the knee to them and accept their influence in our affairs? We do not want to be like them. We are better than them.

       Someone else on reddit explained this decriminalization;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Keep in mind that decriminalize means that offence was moved out of the criminal law and into administrative one. It's still illegal. But instead of long jail times, administrative offences are limited by 15 days of jail and no criminal record, they also don't go through the court (unless the accused wants to challenge the accusation). So a person will sit their 2 weeks in jail or pay a fine and can live normally afterwards. If you get a criminal record in Russia, you're pretty much janitor for life - you won't get any skilled labor job.
Even the first offence (and with no serious harm) will still get an offender an administrative punishment and is still considered an illegal act.
If it is serious abuse then it is treated like a criminal act and up to 15 years of jail time can be given for that.
Russia is basically changing the basic law applicable to minor domestic violence (and only minor and only if no more than 1x a year) to be the same as for minor violence outside a domestic relationship (which changed a few years ago, but excluded "domestic" violence) - i.e. the "regular" Russian standard is if you get drunk and get in a fight with your cousin. Up to 15 days in jail + a fine + potential community service. Now, do major domestic violence OR minor violence 2x in any year - you are back to full penalties. Sort of makes sense - and goes both ways.
For example, some Russian woman throws a plate at her cheating husband and the cops are called to break it up and decide for some reason to make an arrest, it would result in a lower penalty and technically an "Administrative" one without the full standard legal process and also not necessarily result in a full-blown criminal record.
This law was pushed forward initially by 23 women of the Russian state Duma
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's not really a bad thing. Removing this from criminal law isn't bad persay. Makes it way easier to actually report domestic abuse as it doesn't have to go through criminal court.

       Not every culture is the same as yours. This only affects minor domestic abuse. Previously lets say you grabbed your spouses arm, and left a bruise, your life would have been ruined under the current laws. This stopped married women from reporting these types of scenarios because it doesn't deserve the harsh punishments.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a perfect solution to the problem, but the statistics of double domestic abuse being reported could either be more people are being abused, or more people are coming out about abuse. I don't have the answers but under the majority of circumstances, this change of law helps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Minor abuse is bad, but open handed slapping your wife one time doesn't deserve 15 years in prison. The laws before were worse. Like i said before, women wouldn't report their husbands because they would get severe punishment.

       I never said Russia was awesome.  Why is my comment so hard to people to understand. If I had to choose between Russia and a Muslim/Sharia Law country, I would choose to live in Russia.

      <p>
       Thankfully, I do not have to choose.  But if I had to, I would choose Russia.

       Your comment isn't difficult to understand, it's the context that's difficult to understand.  What does it have to do with anything?  Nobody mentioned Muslim countries or Sharia Law, so why are you bringing up a false dichotomy?

       Russia and America need each other if they are to deal with the terrorism threats flooding into Europe from Syria and Libya and the like, its not some big conspiracy like everyone would have you believe, the destabilization of Europe will effect both Russia AND the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia and America need to work together, not against each other, this is for the benefit of the entire planet, even better if we can get China on board as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sick of everyone demanding we all be enemies, maybe we don't want to be enemies, maybe, just fucking maybe, some of us just want everyone to be friends, The planet would be a whole lot nicer place if we could.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's time to stop spreading fear and hate, it's time to learn to work together, because if we cannot do that, then the Human race is doomed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: tell me why you downvote me? I want to know what the issue with 3 major superpowers working together is? at this rate my great grand kids wont get to be the space explorers I hope for them to be, at this rate, we are all fucked. Be better then that, you can help make this change, we the people can do this, it is not impossible.

       I would like to see what it looks like to be friends with Iran and Russia. I kinda feel like we are in the "do what you always do, get what you always got" death spiral. I feel like the USG has been on the wrong side for a long long time. Not that Russia/Iran is the good side, it's just maybe the not as bad side.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminds me of when I was a kid and was getting into negative stuff, and my best friend's mom asked me not to come around. And she really liked me for years. But one day I woke up and realized I was "the bad crowd".

       If you want the short version, your pipedream is only possible in a world under a central authority (as that is the reigning champion currently). They've plotted it all awhile. The final threat to their power is geurrila warfare, which means the war on terrorism, which is an eternal war, of such importance to TPTB, that they are willing to play the Op4 (Opposing Force), in order to garner an advantage over the enemy (the people).

       Like the east and west walls of the early Roman Empire (which was divided but never fell, but merely continued under the construct of a social mechanism, the Pontiffs ;), the east and western hemispheres will align, to promote a new form of order, that we practiced in the middle east, and have now brought home to all the rest.

       Hold on hold on. Stop. Dont tell me what I am saying. Just because I am not some one world one love hippie doesnt mean I am spreading hatred. I am trying to warn people that, there exists a force, which has for the last several decades, plotted with great strategy, to overwhelm the world with warfare, but peace is the final objective. Its a regional plan, followed by a global plan. I believe it may be nazis, or perhaps who was behind the nazis. Either way it is clear, that now their plans have come to fruition, and they have achieved full effective control of the world. To allow them to have it, would be to allow hate, not the other way around. You are quite literally, twisting the reality of the situation. I will not stand for this attack on humanity.

       I am not a one world hippy, but humanity is attacking itself, there is going to be a time when we have to make a choice, are we the people, going to allow the continued systematic slaughter of our own race, or are we going to stand up and say Fuck That!, enough is enough.

       Yeah, but allowing the same people who raped this planet, to be the ones who control it forever more is not the solution. Rather, a strong conversation about moral relativism and the threat of the return of the Roman Empire and a new Dark Ages with a Fascist agenda to mark the new heretics (terrorists) as the "only remaining problem in society". Meanwhile children die of starvation after toiling all day making sneakers for people locked in boxes that aren't aware of the forrest through the trees.

       World cooperation under a one-world government will be an authoritarian nightmare, a bloodbath beyond comprehension.  This is what "TPTB" is attempting to create.

       World cooperation by mutual agreements is completely different.

       the terrorists threats in syria and libya our government knew about and at best turned a blind eye to, and at worst actively encouraged/backed for machiavellian purposes.

       the whole war on terror thing is a tool of the state to gain more power over its citizens and just in general scare people into submission.

       I worded that poorly and was thinking to fast, also I am getting a lot of comments its hard to keep track of all this, getting a little overwhelmed here, sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am just speaking my mind, I am trying to keep it all as a whole, but I am not very good at writing like this, so I may contradict myself sometimes, I just hope the heart of my message is getting through, I don't usually comment on things in this manner, but I have to step up and say something, none of this is right and its only seems to be getting worse, I fear for our future, and am speaking out of worry, rather then logic, something needs to change, someone needs to step up to lead the charge, and I have no idea if that's going to happen, or if we are just going to watch as the world burns.

       Ideally the transition to democracy afterlife the fall of the urss would have been done better, and a democratic Russia could be on its way to be a European ally, or who knows even a member of the eu.

       I'm with you only all your points, but you forgot to mention the problem of the ongoing economical sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Crimea and East-Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       International sanction do work, and are mostly the only method against rogue state actors, but only if all parties do work together on this goal. If one threatens to leave the community on this we do have a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is signaling to weaken the US sanctions. This destroys the international pacts on rogue states, and we don't know what will happen then. But we can assume that Russia will just take Georgia or more as it pleases. Russia needs to get its gas to Europe.
Russia already split Turkey from the US. 
Turkey is the next rogue state. The next will be the kurd territory, as this has the biggest gas reserves. Turkey only listened to the US/western community so far (the current Mosul liberation).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a deal Trump will probably get Snowden.
Are you happy with this?

       No, Russia invading other nations is not ok, there could be more too it then that which we do not know, but from what we do know, they are being particularly aggressive in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT...
      </p>
      <p>
       Crimea has massive oil and natural resource reserves, trillions of dollars worth, if the US had not imposed so many sanctions, Russia may not have felt the need to invade another nation to keep itself afloat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying what they did what right, but they may have done what they needed to survive. Again not saying it is right by any means, but Russia is not the soviet union anymore, the more sanctions that get imposed on them, the more they will be forced to revert back to their old ways to keep themselves and their people alive and living semi comfortably, the US would do and has done the same for decades, Russia just does not hide it.

       The problem is we know why Russia is the enemy of the establishment both here and in the EU and it's not because Putin is a mean guy. It may have something to do with fiat currencies and their resistance to criminal international banking cartels, however.

       Bow to the global banking cartels? What do you mean? I've always heard "follow the money" but I don't see how it has to do literally with banks. I think it has to do more with the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of oil that Russia could soon be drilling into if Trump lifts the sanctions against it.

       So you don't know about the Fed and the banking system that runs the world and prints money out of thin air? You should look into these things. Russia is one of the last hold outs that hasn't allowed it's currency and banks to be taken over by the banking elites.

       Well, I don't see Putin drone bombing the middle east 26,000 times a year. He is a strong leader, for sure, but compared to our own government he's practically a pacifist. So to answer your question, I do believe the heads of finance who we KNOW own our "free"  press attack him because he resists their goal of controlling Russia's money supply. Also the real reason we put sanctions on them.

       If you think Putin is a pacifist idk what to say. If you think USA should be jealous of living conditions in Russia idk what to say. America is better than Russia and we should not be trying to become more like them in any way. Our banking system might be corrupt but so is Putin and theirs, so I'd rather stick with what we know than end up like Russia. Have you seen the dashcam videos? That place is a shithole. Why do you want to become that?

       Never said I wanted to become Russia. Russia has plenty of problems, obviously: Just saying I don't buy the current demonization of them. Cards on the table I would take Putin or his "puppet" running this country over Hillary Clinton 10 times out of 10. Our country has been run by evil people for a long time. But that's assuming you still think out president is always the defacto "most powerful person in the world".

       I'm well aware of the accusations that her "seizures" are caused by Kuru which she obtained by cannibalizing children after she traffics and rapes them on some Satanic alter.  Until I see actual evidence, however, that's all they are.  I could accuse someone of raping farm animals while wearing ass-less chaps and a cowboy hat while shouting at Xenu, begging him to release their thetons.  Both accusations have about the same credibility.

       The reason you always get a different answer is because there are so many. This is only a small sample but I could go on. First link concerns Libya. Second has a variety of her frimes against humanity listed. She's an evil cunt.

       Agreed, but I've seen a lot of bullshit contributed to her unfairly.  Even though this hints at a dick measuring contest, I still stand by my observation that it's ridiculous to say that she's worse that Putin.

       So the cold war was good? You enjoyed it?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why you WANT another one? No, you dont? Then why is hating russia and provoking them for decades with nato and trying to fight a proxy war against their troops with isis, why is this the answer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia has been invaded with major major losses 3 times in the last fucking century, then collapsing and getting raped for parts on its rise back up. In 16 years putin brought to relevancy and some strength. So...hate them and start a cold war with much more technology in nuclear delivery...okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       God forbid we say "okay, let's see how we can coexist and benefit from this". Must hate, must kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shouldnt we hate people that hate us? How bout islamic terrorism that uses our own money to kill our people and europeans? And they dont even belong to a nation, and they commit inhumane crimes, they are the new nazi's, we can kill em in any movie with no blowback.
      </p>

       I fully expect and believe that every country tries to influence every other county. We do it all. the. fucking. time. The CIA fucking murders people to do this, and not even just elections. We topple democratically elected governments like it's going out of style. I believe we are the extreme/violent example of that, but I also believe that other countries do this civilly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now given this particular situation, I would definitely expect Russia to try to get the candidate who didn't want to impose a no fly zone over where they're trying to help Syria stop isis to get elected. If Donald trump repeatedly said that he wants to be allies with them,  I don't doubt that he would try to gather some people to try to make that happen.

       Okay us meddling in other countries does not make it okay when they do it to us. I did not vote to topple Saddam and I sure didn't vote to have Russia influence top US officials. I don't want either to happen but I won't accept this just because of our past transgressions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, Hillary proposed a no-fly zone in Syria, I still don't know why you guys interpret that as an act of war against Russia. You do know USA fights ISIS also? Why exactly is Russia a country we want to be buddies with? Putin is an elected dictator, they murder journalists and ban protests, invade neighboring countries and claim their land.

       We fight isis solo? You do know that the Syrian government is fighting isis with the help of the Russian right now right? The same isis that we found and funded? A no fly zone would have started a lot. I feel like you don't know a lot about the Syrian conflict if you can say that a no fly zone wouldn't do much.

       All of them? There have been several cases, haven't there? Even the agent who was just hospitalized for poisoning like two weeks ago? Granted, I don't know if that was polonium or not, but it was still a Russian agent poisoned in Russia.

       Go spew hatred elsewhere please. Ignore ISIS and 30 years of terrorist funding, imperialism for profit, and general downfall of US relations across the globe. It will work out for sure when those who profited skip town and the people get fucked. We'll blame russia then too though, so all good!

       Putin wants a multipolar world, US rogue agents want unipolar world and are pushing it hard. It's bad for the whole world. Putin wants to work with the US, we war monger. Putin wants nations to abide by international laws and rules, US breaks them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each nation wants sovereignty and success for itself. And most others want rules to the game to prevent shit like US modern imperialism. You think the EU wants to answer to US? WE HAVE THEIR BEST INTEREST AT HEART?

       The 15-year old nation recovering from collapse, 3 major wars, and getting stripped for parts from the west and internal oligarchs. The largest landmass nation, with unexplored resources and its own oil.

      <p>
       That nation now wants to stretch itself THINNER, make life at home WORSE, and what??? Make US collapse? invasion? Take our oil?

       Well, they have annexed territory into their country in the last five years, and are looking to annex more (See: Tanks on Ukranian border) - The Soviet Union may have fallen, but that doesn't mean Russia did a 180.  Seriously, why do we want to be friends with aggressive conquerors. Last few times, when a country starts taking over its neighbors, they didn't stop at just one and ended in a huge war anyway, so maybe, just maybe, we shouldn't just let them keep doing it without punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing, Russia did work to influence our elections. Let me preempt what you're saying about hacking- No, they didn't hack the voting machines, they were however likely responsible for the DNC leaks. Russia also is responsible for tons of attacks on normal websites, not unlike China.

       My whole thing is, you don't have to like Trump to not buy into the cold war bullshit. I don't like Trump's policies at all, but it's like people want any excuse to get rid of him. And will believe absolutely anything. Even if the worst was true, how is it much different from the Clinton foundation taking loads of checks from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other states? The only way in which this story would be truly awful is if Trump was solely a tool of Russia for the means of actually destroying America, which I find very unlikely.

       After an election where the winning candidate ran on an "America first" nationalism platform, why would people to just suddenly pivot to "America and Russia first?" Especially after decades of the USSR being sworn enemies of the US throughout the cold war.

       If you are interested in conspiracies and you aren't talking about Russia, then you're about dogma, not actually looking at conspiracies.

       There is no question that we are at the peak of subversion actions by MANY, including Russia. And if you think for one second Russia has any interest in being an ally, you aren't paying attention.

       I like how everyone here is all of the sudden 100 in support of Russia and totally views them as a legit ally now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is a country proven to want to actively divide us, they would bomb the fuck out of us if they knew they could get away with it with absolutely no repricusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be so sketched out if it wasn't for the fact that three people in Trumps administration were exposed for having heavy Russian ties and all three of them stepped down. Also the fact that Trump has continued to lie about his involvement in Russia.

       I fucking gurantee that if this was Obama or Hillary that this entire sub would be filled with this story, instead we're literally focusing on Pizzagate reposts and more Hillary bashing, the brigading on this sub is so obvious that it's scary.

       I would like to see what it looks like to be friends with Iran and Russia. I kinda feel like we are in the "do what you always do, get what you always got" death spiral. I feel like the USG has been on the wrong side for a long long time. Not that Russia/Iran is the good side, it's just maybe the not as bad side.

       It reminds me of when I was a kid and was getting into negative stuff, and my best friend's mom asked me not to come around. And she really liked me for years. But one day I woke up and realized I was "the bad crowd".

       If you want the short version, your pipedream is only possible in a world under a central authority (as that is the reigning champion currently). They've plotted it all awhile. The final threat to their power is geurrila warfare, which means the war on terrorism, which is an eternal war, of such importance to TPTB, that they are willing to play the Op4 (Opposing Force), in order to garner an advantage over the enemy (the people).

       Like the east and west walls of the early Roman Empire (which was divided but never fell, but merely continued under the construct of a social mechanism, the Pontiffs ;), the east and western hemispheres will align, to promote a new form of order, that we practiced in the middle east, and have now brought home to all the rest.

       I explained why it makes no sense to talk about Sharia. So why do you want to talk about Sharia with me? There's literally no point to talk about Sharia in this thread.

       It is only being used as a distraction from the actual topic.

       Why are you trying to make this about Sharia? Unless you want to distract fromt eh actual topic, it makes no sense at all.

       I'm with you only all your points, but you forgot to mention the problem of the ongoing economical sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Crimea and East-Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       International sanction do work, and are mostly the only method against rogue state actors, but only if all parties do work together on this goal. If one threatens to leave the community on this we do have a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is signaling to weaken the US sanctions. This destroys the international pacts on rogue states, and we don't know what will happen then. But we can assume that Russia will just take Georgia or more as it pleases. Russia needs to get its gas to Europe.
Russia already split Turkey from the US. 
Turkey is the next rogue state. The next will be the kurd territory, as this has the biggest gas reserves. Turkey only listened to the US/western community so far (the current Mosul liberation).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a deal Trump will probably get Snowden.
Are you happy with this?
