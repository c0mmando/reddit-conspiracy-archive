        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know I&#39;m about to get called a shill, but please nobody spend any more time or energy investigating this false lead. I spent five hours last night researching these videos and can 100% verify they are FALSE. </p>

<p>I checked Twitter for every mention of worldcorp ever, as well as checked the entire Twitter history of worldcorp, the accounts it follows and those accounts followers and associates. </p>

<p>MY FINDINGS: This is a group of 14-16 year old kids in south New Jersey who created Worldcorp as vehicle to promote their music while being inspired by the very similar &quot;meatsleep&quot; Alternate Reality Game (ARG). Their personal profiles are filled with bad attempts at self promotion such as messaging the more popular YouTube channels that covered Meatsleep with things like &quot;have you seen the videos from worldcorp? They are really creepy!&quot; Or &quot;You should do a report on worldcorp!&quot; This goes back all the way to February and march of 2016, well before the fatherhood or every day I grow video. There is also factual proof they did the music for the ARG Carrilou. </p>

<p>They are loving the publicity this is bringing them and feeding into the virality by playing along. You are all getting trolled by prepubescent teenagers, please do not fall for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! So many leads that still need vetting, this is not one of them! Check my post history,  I&#39;m not a shill. I lurk more than I post, but I probably research twice as much as most of the frequent posters on voat. I&#39;ve compiled a lot of evidence that hasn&#39;t yet hit the net, no smoking guns, but close. I&#39;ve pretty much proved the satanism angle, but am sitting on the info for the right time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because they are 14-16 doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have skills in video or audio editing. They have their own SoundCloud page and are at a minimum adept with audio software. Check the twitter, you will find they are angsty teens. Remember the post about how it must be John podestas hand because it was thin? 14-16 year old boys also have thin hands. My guess is this is some older brother and his friends tormenting his little brother while his mom was out getting groceries.</p>

The site is still up people, look at it.  As far as no evidence of being on Twitter, you obviously didn&#39;t look hard enough.  It&#39;s just not being used.  Look at this voat thread.  If you have seen the videos 
 Of world Corp and then you see his social
 Media, why does it look exactly like him if it
it&#39;s​ not him?  One of the billion &quot;coincidences​?&quot;. You decide.   And he is very very very well connected.  To me it&#39;s obvious that the worldcorp
