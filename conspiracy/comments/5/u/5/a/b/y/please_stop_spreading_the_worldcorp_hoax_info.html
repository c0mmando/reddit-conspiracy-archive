       I know I'm about to get called a shill, but please nobody spend any more time or energy investigating this false lead. I spent five hours last night researching these videos and can 100% verify they are FALSE.
      </p>
      <p>
       I checked Twitter for every mention of worldcorp ever, as well as checked the entire Twitter history of worldcorp, the accounts it follows and those accounts followers and associates.
      </p>
      <p>
       MY FINDINGS: This is a group of 14-16 year old kids in south New Jersey who created Worldcorp as vehicle to promote their music while being inspired by the very similar "meatsleep" Alternate Reality Game (ARG). Their personal profiles are filled with bad attempts at self promotion such as messaging the more popular YouTube channels that covered Meatsleep with things like "have you seen the videos from worldcorp? They are really creepy!" Or "You should do a report on worldcorp!" This goes back all the way to February and march of 2016, well before the fatherhood or every day I grow video. There is also factual proof they did the music for the ARG Carrilou.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are loving the publicity this is bringing them and feeding into the virality by playing along. You are all getting trolled by prepubescent teenagers, please do not fall for it.

       "Professionally voice matched"? You mean some guy made a cut up of 2 half second clips and they sound similar? Go on twitter like I said and you will see how obvious of a troll job this is. Work smarter, not harder.

       I've been looking into the political and Catholic Church sex scandals and child trafficking, since the early 90's... You know, boy's town and Bush/Regan call boys.. Also, what do you know about the Hell Fire Club - dating back to Benjamin Franklin?... Got quite a few years on your few hours of research....

       I'm talking about this "worldcorp" stuff alone. I'm not debunking PG at all. I'm saying this is a false lead by a bunch of teenage LARPers that people should not be wasting their time on. Feel free to doubt me and double check my research, you will come to the same conclusions and be pissed at yourself for wasting your time looking into it. I believe PG is real and wake up every day hoping that day will be the day the hammer finally comes down.

       Podesta and the voice in the videos do sound very similar. How do you explain that? Also, why are you "telling" people to not look into it? If you think it's bunk, that's cool. But, you are actually telling people there is nothing to see, don't bother... You're either ignorant, or have an agenda... Why not let people research and come to their own conclusions? Why are you trying to be an authority figure, and have people listen to your words, alone? Seems fishy. 1/10 -  downgraded...

       Look at my replies on this thread, I've encouraged people to look into it if they doubt me, but that they will reach the same conclusion and be disappointed. Don't trust this conjecture you see on Reddit and voat. Go straight to the source, the official twitter account and it's associates. Maybe you should be asking the question of if people are perpetuating this hoax that maybe THEY are the ones with the agenda. Hmmm

       Check for yourself, look into it from the angle I am saying AND stop wasting your time on "professional audio analysis." You guys downvoting are the actual shills trying to get people to waste their time chasing  FAKE leads. Make sure to come back and upvote this post once you've wasted your time on to reach the same conclusion I have.

       Why don't you tell us whose paying you? Why are you trying to have people chase down fake leads and embarrass the community so the mainstream says "the PG community is so dumb they were trolled by a bunch of 14 year olds." It discredits all the other, more pertinent research being done.

       It is not registered in Toronto.  The company the site is using for privacy ( Privacy Inc. ) has Toronto base contact info. Do a whois.domaintools look up will give you more info then the domain look up you posted.

       The amount of downvotes I got for saying something similar last week was a real eye opener. If some people on this sub want to believe something they get very angry when you tell them it's not true.

       Yep as more people spent time looking into it they realized there were getting trolled by a bunch of kids not old enough to drive. Sadly there are still plenty of people who spend more time listening to the conspiracy echo chamber than actually doing their own research and believe that it really is a video of John podesta torturing a little kid.

       After watching all of the videos this explanation is most likely the correct one. It reminds me of film student bullshit trying to be edgy.

       Yes! So many leads that still need vetting, this is not one of them! Check my post history,  I'm not a shill. I lurk more than I post, but I probably research twice as much as most of the frequent posters on voat. I've compiled a lot of evidence that hasn't yet hit the net, no smoking guns, but close. I've pretty much proved the satanism angle, but am sitting on the info for the right time.

       Just because they are 14-16 doesn't mean they don't have skills in video or audio editing. They have their own SoundCloud page and are at a minimum adept with audio software. Check the twitter, you will find they are angsty teens. Remember the post about how it must be John podestas hand because it was thin? 14-16 year old boys also have thin hands. My guess is this is some older brother and his friends tormenting his little brother while his mom was out getting groceries.

       What "man"?.. The thin hand?... the voice? The thin hand could be a teenager and since this group has their own soundcloud and edited videos on their YouTube channel it's safe to assume they are at least somewhat adept in post production software. Really their personal twitter accounts is what gave it away.

       It is kinda of obvious after you watch all of the videos posted at worldcorpo. The video showing the kids standing in the woods wearing the hoodies. Those are our up and coming film makers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a combination of them producing it themselves and stealing content. All of the videos had the same or very similar filters effects etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is kind of embarrassing that people are falling for it and associating it with John Podesta and Pizzagate.

       A good sign that these are hoaxes are the accounts spreading them:
      </p>
      <p>
       example on reddit:

        https://www.reddit.com/user/fastermind
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       (links to shitty blog, has spread disinfo in the past - pizza.jpg steganography)
      </p>
      <p>
       And on voat, a post of this video that blew up had gene modification, MK Ultra, "genetic quirk of pizzagate" &amp; other nonsense added to it.  These are known pizzagate shill narratives.

       I'm 50/50 on it at the moment. I see you are getting a lot of people calling you a shill though.  I guess the best way to stop them would be to post your findings. Even if its twitter names or screenshots. Maybe a connection map.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would at least would help people to start looking into it themselves. People can then build on and strengthen you argument and there wont be such a haesh backlash.

       If it is fake then you have a very valid point regarding not wasting energy and resources.

       This is ABSOLUTELY DISINFORMATION.  Many people looked into it the second the fatherhood video got put up on you tube and talked about worldcorp....  The site is still up people, look at it.  As far as no evidence of being on Twitter, you obviously didn't look hard enough.  It's just not being used.  Look at this voat thread.  If you have seen the videos 
 Of world Corp and then you see his social
 Media, why does it look exactly like him if it
it's​ not him?  One of the billion "coincidences​?". You decide.   And he is very very very well connected.  To me it's obvious that the worldcorp
worldcorp site and him are very connected but 
I could be wrong, I mean maybe it's just
just aother billion coincidences, right?  Read this voat thread    IMPORTANT: GARRY LEE MUNROE BARNEY/ (POSSIBLE CHILD TRAFFICKER/ WORLD CORP FATHERHOOD VIDEO) (pizzagate)

       I'm talking about this "worldcorp" stuff alone. I'm not debunking PG at all. I'm saying this is a false lead by a bunch of teenage LARPers that people should not be wasting their time on. Feel free to doubt me and double check my research, you will come to the same conclusions and be pissed at yourself for wasting your time looking into it. I believe PG is real and wake up every day hoping that day will be the day the hammer finally comes down.

       Yep as more people spent time looking into it they realized there were getting trolled by a bunch of kids not old enough to drive. Sadly there are still plenty of people who spend more time listening to the conspiracy echo chamber than actually doing their own research and believe that it really is a video of John podesta torturing a little kid.
