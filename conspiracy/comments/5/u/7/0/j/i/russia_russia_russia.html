A lot of opinions on Trumps supposed plans to over through China with Russia and how Russia has been in contact for years pulling string. Then I noticed more and more self proclaimed liberals posting here calling us out or saying we aren&#39;t completely crazy. They give us credit for 9/11 but say Pedogate is bullshit as if that will sooth us and keep us from investigating more. I see more and more propganda throughout this sub every day and it&#39;s bumming me out. I don&#39;t trust the internet with any truth anymore. Not voat, not the dark web, or bloggers or &quot;insiders&quot;. I&#39;m just waiting to see now idk what to think or do.</p>

<p>Because every article that comes out with a headline like &quot;Trump is working with Russia&quot; will have a mention somewhere in the content that it hasn&#39;t been corroborated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>liberals can be into conspiracies too, i cant speak for all liberals, but i think part of what makes pizza gate unconvincing for me and maybe for other liberals, is that im not put off by &quot;creepy&quot; art , im curious how you feel about this video from adult swim, its called unedited footage of a bear</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gMjJNGg9Z8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gMjJNGg9Z8</a></p>

<p>to me thats art, its not comfortable, and kind of sureal. i guess it comes down to different value systems, the conservative leaning conspiracy theorists are usually religious, and have values and taste which reflect that,  now i believe that there definitely are institutionalized elite pedophile networks , that part i believe cant be argued against, its been found in the u.k. , portugal, 
i just find spirit cooking and all the other &#39;weird&#39; stuff underwhelming, and not evidence, it could turn out to be true, and ive never told anyone that they were stupid for believing in it, or that they should stop investigating though, so maybe im not the liberal leaning kind of person you were describing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well im not arguing that there are no conspiracies, because there definitely are, im just saying that its not(or it shouldnt be) a partisan kind of thing... to me the biggest conspiracy is the institutionalized corruption and money in our government, powerful people with money who are more equal than the rest of us, and act in their interest, and our lack of a true voice.. every other conspiracy is enabled by this one... racism, military industrial complex,  fake news, our involvement in other countries... but like i said, what i consider to be the most pressing conspiracy is colored by my worldview</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Biljana Djurdjevic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She grew up during the war in Serbia and her work reflects that horror in an expressive way. Indeed her style forces the viewer to become the abuser of the subject of her paintings. They&#39;re really quite powerful. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In her paintings, Biljana Djurdjevic refers to the victims of contemporary culture. Her portrait-like sketches are often completed in light color. The structured patterns of wallpaper or flagging refer to public environments like hotel rooms, shower rooms, or locker rooms. Even though they are dressed, the pale skin of the painted figures dominates the composition. The figures appear like the nudes in Lucien Freud’s paintings. The pure flesh becomes the target for injuries and violence. </p>

<p>The figure’s gaze directed at the viewer expresses desperation and fear. <strong>Fear of the approaching viewer who himself becomes the offender in front of Biljana Djurdjevic’s figurative paintings.</strong> Fighting dogs as well as clubs and even the cross are symbols used to indicate violence and torture, which become metaphors for all wars and distress. </p>

<p>Biljana Djurdjevic controls the view of the observer by limiting the spatial representation of the crime scene to the size of the figures. The desperate victims can no longer be abandoned to their fate. </p>

<p>In perfect adhesion to the tradition of her country of origin, Biljana Djurdjevic relates the myths of our time using the language of the manifesto and of socialistic propaganda. </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite challenging art and I can certainly understand why someone might like them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand art can be uncomfortable and can push boundaries and I do think that it is a good thing to have boundaries pushed. When people have weird things in their homes it doesn&#39;t bother me whatever, but when you have weird things, children&#39;s toys and a room that looks like it&#39;s for kids but you have no kids, and you have a statue of a decapitated head contoured hanging from the ceiling and you are known you hang out with convicted pedofiles then I can&#39;t just sit there and say well he just has a weird taste in art. No he is a deranged kid fucker who likes suggestive art </p>

    <div class="md"><p>definitely, people define art in many different ways, and even though art is subjective, i think one of its most important characteristics is that it moves you emotionally, that it communicates a feeling or idea, or state of mind , even that definition is vague... but thats the problem with trying to decide what art is and isnt, kind of like the aristocrats joke,  id never heard that joke before, but just checked out the wiki page on it,  seems like its social commentary, louis ck is another guy that can get away with joking about really taboo things, id call what he does art.. or atleast hes artful in his execution. i guess the best description of art, is that its in the eye of the beholder... as cheesy as that sounds.</p>

<p>Censors are dead men setup to judge between life and death </p>
