    <div class="md"><p>Ok instead of complaining and whining about it, I&#39;d like to ask you for some possible solutions.</p>

<p>All dystopian/sci-fi novels and media have large core elements of manipulation through environment. Wall-E had fatasses stare at a screen all day with hundreds of commercials. Black Mirror episodes are littered with futuristic mind-controlling advertisements that cater to the biologically hedonistic mind. I don&#39;t think we can really escape this fate. Whether you are on the side of the revolution or corruption, the winner made and continues to make history. </p>

<p>Manipulation is a integral part of a functioning government that stands at the top of the power totem pole. America didn&#39;t become one of the strongest countries through playing goody goody with everyone. It took, deceived, cheated, and outright killed many others to achieve and maintain its status. Such is social Darwinism at its grandest scale.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>If I am very adamant on eliminating shills and other propagandist personnel, I can only think of one way to begin doing so. </p>

<p>Education. It&#39;s arguably the slowest method for any kind of social reform but the only really efficient one. Let the common populace learn to critically think and analyze for themselves whether that Facebook news promotion of &quot;pro-Trump&quot; or &quot;pro-government&quot; is really the work of the people or the media. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t fix this issue within 10, 20 years. People are starting to speak out against it which is the first step; however, no one is willing to take the initiative to alleviate the issue. There is no hotfix. No piece of legislation. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First thought, I love the show Black Mirror. It&#39;s super spooky how close we are to that kind of reality. </p>

<p>Also, I have tried retaliating with knowledge and replying decently with substance, information, questions and links to the research the fabulous internet community has been compiling- but the most frustrating thing is that these shills lack complete substance in their replies and attempt to misdirect and misinterpret my responses. Some of the responses I&#39;ve read haven&#39;t even been complete sentences or they would reply with another jackass image that makes no sense but is somehow supposed to sway me into looking into flat earth. 
I try to have a normal, healthy debate with what I first assume are real people, but after discussion and seeing their posts it makes me want to rip my hair out because it&#39;s so obvious that they are not real. </p>

<p>I will have to post the screen shots I&#39;ve been referring to on here soon so everyone can see what I&#39;m talking about. </p>

<p>But I encourage anyone who is interested in seeing this for themselves to join the &quot;awakening: conspiracies, prophecies and truths&quot; group on Facebook (if you haven&#39;t deleted fb already) </p>

<p>You&#39;ll see so many random flat earth posts on there your head will spin . </p>

<p>And final thought, I understand this issue can&#39;t be fixed right away. But it is becoming so painfully obvious how these things are working online. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man I appreciate your willingness to put in that much effort to expose this issue further; however, I gotta advise you not to get too worked up. These shills are manipulating you as well, getting worked up as you try and approach an issue with reason only to get shot down by 100 others.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and don&#39;t look at the negativity. You don&#39;t need that bullshit. I know for sure I don&#39;t. Stop browsing that ridiculously titled fb group.</p>

<p>Take a breath of fresh air. There is still this beautiful Earth to look at to quell your mind, body, and soul. Fuck the haters. Leave that garbage at the door and take a walk, refreshed as a new man.</p>

<p>You &amp; me. We&#39;re not going to convince anyone to take action. We gotta wait till the mass wakes up. Until then, light up a j with me brotha. Let&#39;s ride out the wild ride.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One &lt;3 No problem man we are all worn down from this I actually had recently taken a month and a half from investigating for mental health reasons myself. I&#39;m back on it now and full steam ahead though. Just remember the fact that we find this terrible, and it gives us nightmares and makes us upset is because we are normal, this shit is fucked up and the normal reaction is to be disgusted, and appalled. Anyways beyond that there are positives, just looking at whats happening the amount of information coming out now and the amount of people being arrested (even if its not the big names we are all itching for) paints a very clear picture that change is happening. How long will that take and to what end? We&#39;ll have to wait and see but things are moving in the right direction, we actually have HOPE again. </p>
