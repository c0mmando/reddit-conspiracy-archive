Where is the proof of communication before the election? </p>

<p>What we know so far: </p>

<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2017/01/24/fbi-clears-michael-flynn-in-probe-linking-him-to-russia/">1. FBI clears Flynn of lying to the FBI and no charges will be filed.</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/putting-pieces-russia-story-together-n721141">2. NBC reports NO COLLUSION found between Trump and Russia.</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/15/515437291/intelligence-official-transcripts-of-flynns-calls-dont-show-criminal-wrongdoing">3. NPR backtracks and says nothing illegal took place during the Flynn/Russian phone calls.</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/15/chaffetz-asks-justice-department-watchdog-to-probe-flynn-leaks.html">4. Chaffetz asked for the DOJ now under Sessions to put the IG and probe on the leaks.</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/">5. Obama legalized governmental propaganda</a> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5">2nd source with slightly different info</a> </p>

Here is a Democrat former Senator saying the same and confirming existence of deep state/shadow govt</a> </p>

<p>And now WaPo article has to have these people running scared!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Former U.S. officials also said aggressive enforcement would probably discourage appropriate contact. Michael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, said that he was in Moscow meeting with officials in the weeks leading up to Obama’s 2008 election win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this story: <a href="http://archive.is/UK6j3">WaPo article,</a> archived link, cause fuck their writing trying to justify it and hide it behind a &quot;slam peice&quot; </p>

<p>AT THE TIME OF THE CALLS = BEFORE TRUMP WAS IN OFFICE.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the Obama admin people.</p>

<p>So those are the leakers.</p>

<p>But who ordered and who authorized the illegal wiretaps?</p>

<p>Yes, this could be bigger than Watergate but who was POTUS when the wiretaps were ordered?</p>

<p>You got it -- Obama and his crew.</p>

<p>Has a sitting President on the way out of office ever used national intelligence agencies to spy on and undermine his successor? That&#39;s unprecedented. For such an operation to take place it&#39;d have to be approved at the highest level.</p>

<p>What did Obama know and when did he know it?</p>

<p>I have linked 0 weird sources, they are all pretty much main stream. </p>

<p>Who is actually behind the shadow govt?</p>

Why make a change like this as you are going out the door?  It allows people who are loyal to him, and who never would have had access to &quot;raw signal intelligence&quot;, to now have this access.  That new access has resulted in the intelligence leaks that we have seen recently.</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s a great point, actually. forgot about Obama changing the law. I&#39;m always surprised to hear that agencies have any real regard for the law, so I don&#39;t know how important that really was, but you&#39;re totally right that does implicate Obama, to a degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s critical to note that the &#39;deep state&#39;, the &#39;shadow government&#39; is not a united entity. The Flynn resignation, the obsession with Russia, it was all planned from when Obama kicked out Russian diplomats and set up troops on Russia&#39;s border. But at the same time, other intelligence actors in the secret government have been releasing information critical of Clinton Inc. We know for example that despite the &#39;hacking&#39; script, it was an internal leak. And who else can leak such critical information than a member of the intelligence service? It is a battle among the elites, and now that the military, the state dept, the white house, the senate, the congress, and soon the judiciary have all been taken over in the process, the democratic establishment will have nothing left but their own denial. I firmly believe the twisted minds in the democratic establishment, and the corrupted corporate cronies in the Republican party do not have the mental capacity to deal with this political climate. How else can you explain the painfully obvious campaign to misinform the public on so many issues? These people are falling apart. I&#39;ve gotta think that right now, with the Flynn thing dying down, they are running out of ideas. So what&#39;s next? Oh wait more wikileaks. I wonder who provided wikileaks.org with the upcoming series? Could it have been... elements of the deep state?</p>
