<p>Here it is!</p>

<p>quote:</p>

<p>Nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls</p>

<p>From this story:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/UK6j3">WaPo article</a></p>

<p>AT THE TIME OF THE CALLS = BEFORE TRUMP WAS IN OFFICE.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the Obama admin people.</p>

<p>So those are the leakers.</p>

<p>But who ordered and who authorized the illegal wiretaps?</p>

<p>Yes, this could be bigger than Watergate but who was POTUS when the wiretaps were ordered?</p>

<p>You got it -- Obama and his crew.</p>

<p>Has a sitting President on the way out of office ever used national intelligence agencies to spy on and undermine his successor? That&#39;s unprecedented. For such an operation to take place it&#39;d have to be approved at the highest level.</p>

<p>What did Obama know and when did he know it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But interestingly enough other sources in the IC and even ABC news came out and said that nothing illegal was found in the calls.

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI has already determined that nothing illegal was said during those phone calls (as per WaPo article linked in the OP). The people who leaked the intercepts, senior officers all, knew perfectly well that the contents weren&#39;t illegal.

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know the calls violated the Logan Act.  Both the FBI and DOJ have left open that possibility.  It was questionable enough that the Donald Trump legal team needed a month to decide whether it was legal.  Councidentally, they only came to that judgement AFTER they fired the attorney general and replaced her with a pro-Trump stooge.  The definition of whistleblowing is:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The disclosure by a person, usually an employee in a government agency or private enterprise, to the public or to those in authority, of mismanagement, corruption, illegality, or some other wrongdoing.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if someone believes there was wrong doing (which Donald Trump even said there was) then its whistleblowing.  That&#39;s settled.<br/>

<p>The Jan. 24 interview potentially puts Flynn in legal jeopardy. Lying to the FBI is a felony offense.

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re both good questions.  I cannot see why he would commit a felony by lying to the FBI unless he knew he was doing something that warranted a cover up.  Or I cannot see why he lied to Mike Pence unless he was trying to make a back door deal.  Obviously the tapes don&#39;t show anything overtly illegal or suspicious, so something is missing.  The current story with the information provided doesn&#39;t make sense.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My current theory is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pence talks with the Russian ambassador, thinks nothing of it</p></li>
<li><p>He gets called into the FBI about it, panicks thinking he might have done something illegal, and lies about the content of the conversation</p></li>
<li><p>Once he&#39;s done that, he decides to stick to his version and lies to Pence too, either wanting to shield him from the potential consequences or because he hoped it would just go away</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But I can&#39;t find or build a timeline precise enough to nail whether this fits the sequence of events.</p>

<p>They usually can&#39;t release the names of the Americans caught in the net.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In some cases, when an intelligence agency issues a report based on a wiretap, minimization requires the issuing agency to substitute a generic reference in place of a U.S. person’s name—e.g., “Ambassador Kislyak said that he was looking forward to watching the Grammy Awards on television and that he was hoping that [U.S. Person] would win an award.”</p>

<p>But a U.S. person’s name <em>can</em> be used when it is necessary to understand the foreign intelligence information in the report, and no serious argument can be made that Flynn’s identity was not necessary to understand the intelligence significance of his call with Ambassador Kislyak. The call is foreign intelligence information mainly because it involves Flynn. <a href="https://lawfareblog.com/treatment-flynns-phone-calls-complies-fisa-minimization-procedures">Source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because if the call was completely innocent (as Trump has claimed) then Flynn has no reason to lie.  Even if he did misinform Mike Pence (is he tells Pence he talked to Russian officials about the weather, but really he talked to officials about the weather AND golf), then there is no reason to fire Flynn.<br/>
So Flynn either didn&#39;t lie, or the call wasn&#39;t innocent.  If Flynn didn&#39;t lie, then there&#39;s no reason to fire Flynn (obviously).  So the call couldn&#39;t have been innocent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DOJ saw the transcripts and reported to Trump that Flynn was susceptible to &quot;black mail&quot; (so you know their opinion of it).  The FBI saw the transcripts, and believe there was nothing criminal, but doesn&#39;t rule out that the call violated the Logan Act <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/15/515437291/intelligence-official-transcripts-of-flynns-calls-dont-show-criminal-wrongdoing">link</a>.  The only other people to have seen them are within the Trump administration.  It leaves open the possibility that Flynn was making deals with Russian on the day sanctions were enforced against them (not criminal in nature, but possibly illegal).  It can be cleared up pretty quickly once the public sees them.  </p>

FBI clears Flynn of lying to the FBI and no charges will be filed.
They cleared him of lying to them about whether or not he had discussed sanctions in his interview. The end. This hasn&#39;t gotten past the discussion of a single phone call yet. The rest of the investigation is still ongoing and has not yet given any results. Whether or not they do remains to be seen, but you can&#39;t say he&#39;s 100% cleared on everything, that&#39;s just not the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where&#39;s the confirmation that he talked about sanctions? Do we know what he was saying? How do we know he was trying to &quot;undermine&quot; them? And btw no it&#39;s not confirmed that Russians meddled in our election. It&#39;s confirmed that a hacker that appeared to be associated with the Russian government hacked the DNC. The rest of the damage was done by a leak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here:
&quot;Nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.
All of those officials said ­Flynn’s references to the election-related sanctions were explicit. Two of those officials went further, saying that Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to the penalties being imposed by President Barack Obama, making clear that the two sides would be in position to review the matter after Trump was sworn in as president.&quot;</p>

<p>On Russia meddling with our elections:
&quot;The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), representing 17 intelligence agencies, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) jointly stated that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and leaked its documents to WikiLeaks.
Cybersecurity experts and firms, including CrowdStrike,[55] Fidelis Cybersecurity, Mandiant, SecureWorks and ThreatConnect,[56] stated the leak of emails in the 2016 U.S. elections was part of a series of cyberattacks on the DNC committed by two Russian intelligence groups, called Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear.&quot;</p>

<p>So that&#39;s 17 intelligence agencies and 6 Cyber Security private organizations saying that, yes, Russia interfered in our elections. Or do you not  believe these 23 organizations and would rather believe the words of Pathological liar Donald Trump. </p>

<p>False, only Obama officials claimed that, but the FBI reviewed the recordings and found no such thing.</p>

<p>FTA </p>

<p>Several [FBI] officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html?">(source)</a></p>

<p>Yeah, Russia&#39;s media bad mouthed our 2 party system and criticized our police violence, but the joint intelligence report found no credible Russian hacking. The DNC emails were leaked and Podesta can&#39;t make a descent password, but was probably leaked by disgusted DNC insiders too. Did you see how much European media influenced the US election? Man, they were non-stop, especially the UK tabloids! Even Canadian media got a piece of that US election manipulation action.</p>
