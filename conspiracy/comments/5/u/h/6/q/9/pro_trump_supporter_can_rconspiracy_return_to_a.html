    <div class="md"><p><em>sigh</em></p>

<p>Im not a democrat, nor did I vote for HRC. Im not even left-leaning. The Democrats are largely to blame for where we are, and I&#39;ve been actively holding them accountable. </p>

<p>Not all Trump voters are half-wits, that wasnt my point, my point was that this sub has been filled with users from T_D who are only now interested in certain conspiracies because it supports their political wishes. </p>

<p>I skip over ridiculously partisan posts, as you suggested OP do. My only point was that the public perception of this sub was been damaged, and with it, the words of every user here have lost weight as well. (Not that r/conspiracy was ever <em>really</em> respected by the community, but its certainly gotten worse)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of ways. First, my <em>own</em> perception of this subreddit has lessened because of these posts... and I&#39;m a huge fan of r/conspiracy. Second, plenty top posts on this sub have been outrageously titled with no evidence, and the comments section have been saying this exact same sentiment. Third, other subreddits like r/worldnews, r/news and r/politics (yes, I know, r/politics is insanely biased) have been saying the same thing.</p>

<p>It just pains me to see this subreddit become so politicized when the main goal of it is to unearth corruption on both sides of the aisle. Both parties are guilty of terrible wrongs, and that&#39;s all I give a damn about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of this election, and how badly the globalists new they were losing, is why reddit as a whole has lost credibility. </p>

<p>Reddits administration didn&#39;t like the Trump support and ruined their website in an effort to silence them. They continue to ruin their site after the election is over because they don&#39;t like the revelations coming out and the truth that goes against their preferred narrative.</p>

<p>My point: the change in this sub reflects the change, and the counterbalancing, of the entire site. </p>

<p>My goal: to fight their narrative until the end of this site. I&#39;ll post my cap so long as I can hoping they&#39;ll give up, or I change minds, or you leave in search of a better site. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to lose reddit, I&#39;ve been here since way back, but because of their actions against free and open ideas, I&#39;ll fight in The Great Shit Storm of 2016-2017. It is my great honor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting point. Reddit has absolutely damaged its reputation through its censorship, thats for sure. And perhaps the change in this sub is a direct result of that. </p>

<p>Regardless, I wish we could do a better job of keeping a level head. Obviously no human can be objective, but letting partisanship cloud conspiracy investigations is a dangerous, slippery slope.</p>

<p>No, and he doesn&#39;t even have his cabinet in there yet. </p>

<p>He&#39;s appointed some questionable people but nothing can be certain yet, except for the fact that he&#39;s been keeping campaign promises. </p>

<p>Draining the swamp will be his biggest challenge. How can you say it didn&#39;t happen yet when there&#39;s been so little time? Just wait, friendo.  Things will happen. </p>
