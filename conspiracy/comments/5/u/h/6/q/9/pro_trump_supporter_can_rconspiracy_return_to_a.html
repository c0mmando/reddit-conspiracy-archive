       Yes, I did vote trump. Yes I do enjoy a good government conspiracy every now and then. But I've been here for a decent amount of time before the election cycle started and loved the deep thinking this sub devoted their time to. Conspiracies that were not biased. Like aliens or secret societies .. I really wish we would start tagging things based off their type so I could filter out the "trump this", or "hillary that" nonsense.

       I don't understand why people can't just scroll past the posts they don't want to read. No one says you have to post or read Trump/Hillary conspiracies. Just skip those if they aren't your taste. Stop being control freaks. 
(Or start an "alien conspiracy" sub if you want one)

       Can't speak for OP, but as someone who has been on this sub since long before the election, it's just frustrating to have an entire subs credibility ruined by half-wit Trump lovers who jump on any opportunity to protect his namesake.

       Not as bad as the half-wit leftists who jump at any opportunity to smear him. It is typical of the left to try to bully those they disagree with into silence. We saw that with multiple subs being deleted recently. You guys are only ensuring Trump's reelection.

       Im not a democrat, nor did I vote for HRC. Im not even left-leaning. The Democrats are largely to blame for where we are, and I've been actively holding them accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all Trump voters are half-wits, that wasnt my point, my point was that this sub has been filled with users from T_D who are only now interested in certain conspiracies because it supports their political wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I skip over ridiculously partisan posts, as you suggested OP do. My only point was that the public perception of this sub was been damaged, and with it, the words of every user here have lost weight as well. (Not that r/conspiracy was ever
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       respected by the community, but its certainly gotten worse)

       A couple of ways. First, my
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       perception of this subreddit has lessened because of these posts... and I'm a huge fan of r/conspiracy. Second, plenty top posts on this sub have been outrageously titled with no evidence, and the comments section have been saying this exact same sentiment. Third, other subreddits like r/worldnews, r/news and r/politics (yes, I know, r/politics is insanely biased) have been saying the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just pains me to see this subreddit become so politicized when the main goal of it is to unearth corruption on both sides of the aisle. Both parties are guilty of terrible wrongs, and that's all I give a damn about.

       Because of this election, and how badly the globalists new they were losing, is why reddit as a whole has lost credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddits administration didn't like the Trump support and ruined their website in an effort to silence them. They continue to ruin their site after the election is over because they don't like the revelations coming out and the truth that goes against their preferred narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point: the change in this sub reflects the change, and the counterbalancing, of the entire site.
      </p>
      <p>
       My goal: to fight their narrative until the end of this site. I'll post my cap so long as I can hoping they'll give up, or I change minds, or you leave in search of a better site.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to lose reddit, I've been here since way back, but because of their actions against free and open ideas, I'll fight in The Great Shit Storm of 2016-2017. It is my great honor.

       Interesting point. Reddit has absolutely damaged its reputation through its censorship, thats for sure. And perhaps the change in this sub is a direct result of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, I wish we could do a better job of keeping a level head. Obviously no human can be objective, but letting partisanship cloud conspiracy investigations is a dangerous, slippery slope.

       No, and he doesn't even have his cabinet in there yet.

       He's appointed some questionable people but nothing can be certain yet, except for the fact that he's been keeping campaign promises.

       Draining the swamp will be his biggest challenge. How can you say it didn't happen yet when there's been so little time? Just wait, friendo.  Things will happen.

       I like your positivity, but it looks like more of the same tbh (than the previous administrations), with the only difference being that the MSM is not behind him.

       eventually I guess there will be more criticism of Trump. At this point the corruption is pretty blatant on the establishment side.

       How about instead of making a ton of posts like this everyday we just submit posts that aren't political and then upvote them...you know like the site was made to do.

       Anti-Trump here.  I totally agree - half the political shit posted here isn't even related to a conspiracy.  I don't know why stuff like that isn't removed by the mods.  Get rid of that - I'm fine with pizzagate and Russian spies.

       We are right now at an historical time. Lots of thing are happening at the same time.  The deep state going out of cover, Pedo ring are getting busted on an international stage! The US almost provoked a HOT war with Russia before Trump inauguration, Massive media coordination to attack any nationalist candidate in Europe.

       This is real stuff that is relevant right now.

       It will pass. Sometimes it takes awhile to shake off. I think the biggest problem is the shareblue or whatever shit that is designed to provoke everyone. I am not saying all the political stuff would stop on a dime if they disappeared, but I think the vast majority of the continuing conflict here can be attributed to them.

       I agree and disagree at the sametime. The thing with current conspiracies is that were seeing many play out in real time. People are posing or challenging existing theory rather than write or wait for a book years if not decades later.
