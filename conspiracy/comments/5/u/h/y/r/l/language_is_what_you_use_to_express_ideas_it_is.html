       While it is not a secret, I rarely see it openly discussed that one of the most basic manipulation tools used by cults and propaganda artists is changing the language.
      </p>
      <p>
       They redefine words used to label an important idea that threatens their ideology, or words that are key to expressing a certain idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great example is Scientology redefining "critical thought". Hubbard defined critical thought as "a symptom of an overt act having been committed" or "a withhold from an auditor." In Scientology "overt acts" and "withholds" are the equivalent of crimes against life and freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are usually a lot more alert when you attack an idea they agree with directly. However, they are a lot more open to suggestions that they may not know correct definition of a word or a phrase. While it is not particularly helpful in convincing someone in the opposing point of view, manipulating language is a great way to
       <em>
        disrupt
       </em>
       or diminish effectiveness of certain ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       What concerns me is surprise number of comments as of late suggesting extremely wacky definitions of what liberal or progressive means. Here are a couple of examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Progressive and neo-liberal are the same thing."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Liberalism is really just the political ideology of capitalism, which pretty much the whole world practices."
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell that to Bernie Sanders and 99% movement.

       Damn. Hideo Kojima predicted some things..
      </p>
      <p>
       In Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, near the end of the game the Colonel talks about how the powers that be can basically create history with the control of information (which we see all over the damn place today)
      </p>
      <p>
       In Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, the early antagonist of the game Skull Face is [GAME SPOILERS] using a parasite to attack people who speak a specific language and weed out the ethnicitys (sp?) that he does not deem worthy of his idea of the world. He is using language to change history to his liking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty off topic but it's technically a conspiracy in a game series.

       Words are just a different kind of symbol. And symbols have been used for propaganda longer than words themselves.
