I wonder if they tried to block everything he wanted to do as well. Also, Ventura says they will try to kill Trump... and Pence would take over, who they can control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure--but I think the MN parties changed the rules after he got out of office so independents couldn&#39;t get into the debates as easily in MN.  </p>

<p>Jesse has spoken about his being knocked off US MSM shows after his &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; show aired.  Since his lawsuit against Chris Kyle&#39;s publisher, Jesse is now officially banned from US MSM shows.  He spoke about the lawsuit on Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast last fall.  </p>

<p>Since then, the appeals court overturned the verdict (which was in Jesse&#39;s favor).  Bastard corporatists win again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard him on Joe Rogan and it sounds like he spends most of his time in Mexico and loves it. He smokes weed, drinks beer, and chills out. A pretty good life really, lol.</p>

<p>He did mention some bullshit with intelligence agents after winning the governorship, but I can&#39;t remember the specifics. It&#39;s in the Rogan podcast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He explained it in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCqXIARCUDE">JRE interview</a>...you might have to watch the long interview for the full complete story (as the show jumped around from subject to subject).  I think the appeal was overturned in November or December.</p>
