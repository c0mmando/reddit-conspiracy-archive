       Hi. We're all truth seekers. I'm new to the sub and as much as I don't like labels I would describe myself as a left/libertarian/independent. Though I'm antiglobalist and could support moderate nationalism. So I'm a mixed bag. What are your political persuasions? How do you view the world and what do you value?

       Less government. Less intrusion. Less taxes. Don't care what you do in your own home (drugs, sex, religion) just don't bother me with it. Treat others as you'd like to be treated. Everyone is equal.

       i voted for jill this year and nader in 2000. i voted for bernie in this primary and kucinich in 2008. had ron paul been the repub nominee in 2008 or 2012, and dennis not have been the dem one, i would have voted for him for president. i regret not voting for perot...but i was young and he seemed goofy. such is life.
      </p>
      <p>
       i support basic income.
      </p>
      <p>
       i am opposed to bureaucracy. with current technology, bereaucracy should be less now, not more...
      </p>
      <p>
       i support public education, but don't support the premise that it can only be accomplished in the prussian style, factory system, industrial public school model that was antiquated even when i was growing up in the 80s.
      </p>
      <p>
       i agree with robespierre that the fundamental human right is the right to exist, which means that no person has the right to restrict another's access to food, water, medicine, and housing.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm an un-hyphanated anarchist, who believes the anti-state left and the anti-state right have way more in common with each other than we do with any statists of any flavor.

       All of those figures got or would've gotten my votes had I been old enough. I come close to calling myself an anarchist but don't as I don't see how the US could survive such a toneshift, then again I don't really think the current state of affairs, or 2 years ago, have been any good for the citizenry.

       I generally refrain from adhering to any particular party or ideology, though if I were to quantify my political leanings, it would closest resemble that of a libertarian socialist, which may can paradoxical on the surface.

       Basically, I would consider myself a
       <em>
        civil

       libertarian, in that the government should not infringe on your Constitutional or human rights, without exception, but a democratic socialist

As far as foreign policy is concerned, I wouldn't say I'm an isolationist, so much as a non-interventionist, that we should not be involved in so-called 'humanitarian warfare' under false pretenses as we are now or meddling in the affairs of other nations essentially violating their sovereignty, that we should only engage in conflict or warfare as a last resort and as an act of self defense, however to maintain a strong military (within reason, minus the excess) in the event we should need to defend ourselves in the future.

       I agree with most of those. I'm not big on haarp or vaccines theories. Fuck Breitbart, mixed feelings about Alex Jones. I like RT. I don't like the term "red pill" because it's often used by MRAs. I'm a skeptic of this one and both of the previous one's I've been aware of.
