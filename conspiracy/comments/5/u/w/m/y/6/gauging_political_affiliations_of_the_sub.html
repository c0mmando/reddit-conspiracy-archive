    <div class="md"><p>i voted for jill this year and nader in 2000. i voted for bernie in this primary and kucinich in 2008. had ron paul been the repub nominee in 2008 or 2012, and dennis not have been the dem one, i would have voted for him for president. i regret not voting for perot...but i was young and he seemed goofy. such is life.</p>

<p>i support basic income.</p>

<p>i am opposed to bureaucracy. with current technology, bereaucracy should be less now, not more...</p>

<p>i support public education, but don&#39;t support the premise that it can only be accomplished in the prussian style, factory system, industrial public school model that was antiquated even when i was growing up in the 80s.</p>

<p>i agree with robespierre that the fundamental human right is the right to exist, which means that no person has the right to restrict another&#39;s access to food, water, medicine, and housing.</p>

<p>i&#39;m an un-hyphanated anarchist, who believes the anti-state left and the anti-state right have way more in common with each other than we do with any statists of any flavor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Previous tea party voted Ron Paul 2012 - was following infowars/breitbart/4chan since 2011</p>

<p>My &quot;red pills&quot; are Chem trails/HAARP/geo-engineering -heavy metals having a duel benefit of weather control and human control, 9/11, vaccines (tricky subject) and NWO of course.</p>

<p>Now a left leaning libertarian voted Bernie in the primary  then Clinton because I live in a swing state and am absolutely terrified of Breitbart (Pepe) and Alex fucking Jones in the White House.</p>

<p>Huge skeptic of our current administration unlike other truthers in this thread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of those. I&#39;m not big on haarp or vaccines theories. Fuck Breitbart, mixed feelings about Alex Jones. I like RT. I don&#39;t like the term &quot;red pill&quot; because it&#39;s often used by MRAs. I&#39;m a skeptic of this one and both of the previous one&#39;s I&#39;ve been aware of.</p>
