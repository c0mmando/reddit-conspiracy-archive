<p>Look at what cuba/latin america does as well. I know vice is biased but they had a documentary a while back about how American shows make their rounds down there. They have them ripped to a flash drive or external drive where they are then sold and distributed from person to person. </p>

There are even organizations who risk doing fly-overs to drop USB sticks with news and TV shows from South Korea and the US.

<p>It&#39;s very easy for the various TPTB across the globe to censor information, but once something gets out its damn near impossible to scrub away. The truth always finds its way out eventually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes, when I&#39;m driving to work, I think about how very vulnerable we are as I pass by our, essentially, naked infrastructure. I devise little ways of fucking with stuff. I mean I would never do it because I&#39;m a pussy, but just stuff like filling a bunch of paintballs with a bit of gallium, soaking them in warm water so they&#39;re nice and liquefied, then just, you know, driving a highway at night, stopping to pop off a shot or three at the base of cell towers. Or, you could shut down train traffic just by taking a spool of wire around with you, then stopping to lay a piece across the tracks so that way the signal station thinks there&#39;s like a fallen tree or a cow or something on the tracks. Or you could take nails around with you when you travel, then drop handfuls in government building&#39;s toilets (massively, massively expensive to fix). Or like our dang transformers are sitting on wooden poles down unmonitored alleyways for pete&#39;s sake. Either terrorists are stupid, or they&#39;re not going for the kill. </p>

Under the guise of protecting kids from pedos on the internet, security screens, ID cards, log-ins, trackers etc.... will be implemented sooner rather than later.

    <div class="md"><p>This is one area I&#39;d like to see a brighter light cast on the present day happenings internally at the last-mile ISP level (Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T, ...) and social network gatekeeper level (Facebook, Twitter, reddit, ...).</p>

<p>The consolidation of telecoms into a smaller number of massive companies facilitates rolling out Room 641A or more direct controls across the entire internet, as allowing consolidation of media facilitated control of propaganda/info across that industry. Regulation through hardened net neutrality at the FCC level helped delay and disrupt implementation of controls across the Internet. A preferred method at this stage would bring down the anti-trust hammer against the consolidated telecoms and push for splitting them up, encouraging competition and making it more difficult for controls to be universally implemented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course you should doubt the official story. The FBI would never admit to fucking anything up. Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Bronx_terrorism_plot">2009 Bronx bombing plot?</a></p>

<p>The attack plans and materials were all supplied by the FBI informant who coaxed the accused into participating by offering incentives, a clear case of entrapment.</p>

<p>IMO the FBI had full knowledge of the Boston bombing plot and were going to swap out the explosives for dudes, but somewhere someone in the FBI fucked up and real explosives were planted.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not coincidental that there was a massive disinformation campaign against people trying to identify the bombers even though <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/18/us/boston-blasts/">law enforcement agencies were specifically asking the public for help identifying the bombers.</a></p>

<p>We did nothing wrong but everytime an <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a> post asking about bad things reddit did appears, there&#39;s always a highly upvoted comment saying reddit drove someone to suicide and harassed their family and therefore should not have tried to investigate. The comment&#39;s claim is completely factually incorrect as doing a minimum amount of research into the topic will reveal, yet lower comments correcting it never get as many upvotes and the original comment never gets retracted.</p>

<p>You can build a better view of a pedophile trafficking network by looking at the arrests posted by the law enforcement agencies for National Human Trafficking Awareness Month which just ended, and looking for nexus of relationships.</p>

<p>Watching people fumble manually through instagram accounts for clues is entertaining though.</p>

My favorites are the &quot;Pegasus&quot; museum which  turned out to be Alefantis mother home... and O&#39;Neil published her address with a claim there was a kill room in the basement.</p>

<p>Then there was Seaman saying he had legit insiders telling him big name busts were coming down.</p>

<p>There have been promised of high level arrests related directly to Pizzagate numerous times, and yet, none of the people connected to the theory are ever arrested. Imagine that. If there&#39;s going to be a high level Pizzagate arrest, there should at least be someone related to the central conceit of the theory and not some escort agency bust in Memphis, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Clinton Foundation has been criticized by conspiracy circles for human trafficking for a long time, and even a mainstream political commentator like Christopher Hitchens was vocal about its role as an influence peddling platform taking bribes from foreign and domestic actors.</p>

<p>Now, think about the fact that we are allied with Saudi Arabia where it is essentially known they are engaging in slavery, sex trafficking, and realize that these people giving directly to the Clinton&#39;s Foundation is a direct connection in our relation. Recall Jeffrey Epstein, known to have been trafficking underaged prostitutes and whom had video surveillance equipment set up throughout his property. Not only was he associated with Bill Clinton, during his defense it was claimed he had been part of the group that founded the Clinton Foundation. </p>

<p>Those are just connections, it&#39;s not incredibly solid. But what we know is that people at the highest levels of government and industry have been caught in multiple cases using underaged prostitutes- these kids and teenagers are coming from somewhere and it is all but guaranteed there are other people procuring them for these people. It stands to reason, that there are channels connecting very powerful people to organized sex trafficking. No guarantee its any specific group, but an organization like the Clinton Foundation that is international and multiple connections to areas and people known to engage in this kind of activity certainly looks like a place to look, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s plenty of concern about it, somebody mentions this connection literally any time you bring up Epstein. There&#39;s a quote from Trump more or less alluding to Epstein&#39;s activities from before any of this blew up.</p>

<p>Most of the conspiracy circles that aren&#39;t overtly Marxist/feminist are following Trump closely and support him. They like it when he attacks media corporations they&#39;ve hated for decades, criticizes intelligence agencies they&#39;ve criticized for decades, attacks the internationalism that is the progenitor of every New World Order conspiracy ever. Indeed to anybody that does not share their worldview, major conspiracy outlets now look like the conspiracy as they are largely covering positively a president that mainstream sources universally despise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think most conspiracy circles ultimately think that the New World Order is a Marxist form of globalism- though they package this idea in different flavors like Satanism, lizard people, jews- whatever. The common theme is world government and internationalism though. I think that most conspiracy groups ultimately promote a more right-wing world view, though you could categorize leftist targets like the patriarchy, global capitalism, etc in a similar way probably.</p>

<p>Point being, Trump is attacked by the establishments that right-wing conspiracies see as having control which proves his authenticity to these groups. So of course they will downplay his involvement both in his long history of involvement in many aspects of the establishment, and people like Epstein and the Clintons themselves. The ones that acknowledge these connections will spin him as a turncoat. </p>

<p>In general, people are more likely to defend someone they like and someone they feel is on their team. Donald Trump is the first president to do an interview on something like Infowars. So yeah, your concerns aren&#39;t misplaced. My instincts are that pedophile groups are going to become a public target of the Trump administration, and that high profile figures will be found or manufactured. My belief is that these groups exist and in them will be household names, but the risk of this as an excuse for a transition into fascism has crossed my mind as pedophilia has been the reason given for Russia&#39;s crackdowns on LGBT communities and Alexandr Dugin&#39;s philosophy has clearly influenced parts of the alt-right concerning traditionalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Epstein and Trump are both billionaire buisnessmen,its not unreasonable that they would have had some contact.</p>

<p>Once Trump found out about Epstein he banned him from his Mara Largo resort.</p>

<p>The reason Trump supporters aren&#39;t worried about the Epstein connection is because we all know it bollocks.</p>

<p>If they had anything on Trump they would have used it by now instead they are forced to make up Russian hacking bullshit.</p>

<p>The Clinton connection to Epstein on the other hand ....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Start the investigation, look at the evidence you have. Find what you can prove without making assumptions or leaps of logic, then go off only parts of it that you can prove. If you can&#39;t prove it - or at least come up with an angle to further investigate that, discount that completely. Only after examining everything and acting only with what you can prove, come up with the conclusion that it does or does not exist.

    <div class="md"><p>True, but my point is that investigating pizzagate would be like trying to investigate and prove that lizard people exist. When the evidence only exist in the realms of someone&#39;s imagination, it is pointless to waste resources on an investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No isn&#39;t. New people in the mix that can move forward down this path.. Looking at the circumstantial evidence we have already uncovered with fresh eyes. Over 1200 arrests of lower lever traffickers already within the last 30 days. All it takes is one of those folks that got hemmed up to sing for a deal, then we&#39;ll see some real action. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a highly fluid situation subject to change day-to-day. So yea, if this was years past, I&#39;d be inclined to agree with you. But today, tomorrow, the next day?? </p>

<p>In my opinion, completely different ballgame. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>False. Arrests where made in both haiti and norway. Both countries where the clinton foundation had a strong presence. Shortly after the arrests, the &quot;donations&quot; abruptly stopped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The donations did not abrutly stop. What occurred was that revenue for the foundation was down in 2016, because all the Clinton&#39;s were focusing on campaigning for the election, so they were not raising money for the foundation, as well as voluntary restrictions that they put in place, and all the political and personal attacks from Trump and his supporters.</p>

<p>As a result of the election, for the last few weeks they have been scaling back their efforts in various countries, and redirecting them to other places that need them.</p>

<p>Oh and I think you forgot about the idiot Trump and his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/world/trump-ban-foreign-aid-abortions.html">bizarre executive</a> order banning federal assistance for international health groups who counsel women on abortions or provide assistance for abortions.  </p>

<p>The Clinton foundation worked with a number of organisations to improve access to health services like Planned Parenthood which rely on federal funding, however with Trump&#39;s executive order this is no longer possible. </p>

<p>Trump as president is forcing the Clinton foundation (and other non-profit organizations) to reassess and retune what services they are providing and where, because they have no idea what other crazy shit that Trump will force through.</p>

<p>Oh look, they <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Nonprofits-Fret-as-Clinton/237728">already had plans to terminate the Clinton Global Initiative</a>, as well as pull out of Haiti. This was back in September. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, because they knew back then they were burnt and their nefarious agenda had been exposed for what it was. </p>

<p>For the record, I didn&#39;t vote for Trump; I agree with you, he&#39;s an idiot. In fact I don&#39;t subscribe to rather archaic 2-party system. It&#39;s broken and it&#39;s a farce because they make us believe we have a choice, when we really don&#39;t. But that&#39;s another discussion for another time. </p>

<p>But seriously, you realize that the CF works closely with Dyncorp and the CIA to kidnap, market and otherwise exploit missing children, right? And before you say, the CIA!? No way! They have a long documented history of drug smuggling, illegal arms and human trafficking. The money generated from these sales are used to fund their black operations that aren&#39;t included in their budget.  </p>

<p>I can see you aren&#39;t a believer yet, that&#39;s fine. Be patient, this is huge and when it breaks, there won&#39;t be a deep and dark enough hole for them to hide in. </p>

<p>All of the &quot;missing&quot; emails (650k of them) from Anthony Weiner&#39;s shared laptop with his estranged wife Huma, are now in possession of the FEDs and likely Wikileaks as well. The machine was not scrubbed and it was purposely retained by Weiner. Why you ask? The files were found archived in a folder called, &quot;Insurance policy&quot;. This would suggest he knew he was playing a very dangerous game with people that would murder him without giving it much thought. Essentially this was get out of jail free card.  </p>

<p>Arrests are coming. </p>

<p>Of course not, I don&#39;t buy into hysteria or witch hunts. Not one shred of believable evidence has cropped up, and every time one of the &quot;pieces of evidence&quot; is proven to be nothing but fantasy, it gets ignored by the Pizzagate hypocrites. and they draw even longer bows to try to keep their fantasy together.</p>

<p>There will be no arrests because the pizzagate conspiracy does not exist, and never has. The only places you can find these evidences, are fake videos and conspiracy blog sites. </p>

<p>I looked into Pizzagate and found that it was being pushed by conservative trolls on 4chan and <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, and the noise got louder the more evidence about Donald Trump came out. </p>

<p>Twitter got overrun by bots from Turkey, Russia and even Checkoslavakua promoting the Pizzagate hysteria during the election.  Someone is trying to distract us from Donald Trump and I will give you two guesses as to who his puppet master is (hint the same one who promised him a reward for removing sanctions)  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know her yet, meet Laura Silsby, now known as Laura Gayler. She was busted in Haiti for trying illegally traffic 33 children across the border to the DR. She was arrested, media didn&#39;t want to cover it, (surprise), and WJC + HC personally intervened on her behalf. Now she&#39;s a Sr Exec for the company that issues Amber Alerts for missing children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really not know about the Instagram posts? They&#39;re fairly integral to the whole conspiracy.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good compilation of them anyway. Make sure you glance at the comments while you scroll through, they&#39;re some very odd discussions going on in them.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a good run down of the Worldcorp videos here:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8rrTyRaoezw">https://youtu.be/8rrTyRaoezw</a></p>

<p>The Pizzagate links are fairly tenuous if I&#39;m honest but not worth completely dismissing. The child addresses the guy filming the video as &quot;John&quot; (Podesta&#39;s first name) and his voice is similar to Podesta&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t make him a shill, sellout or close minded though. And his post history isn&#39;t sketchy at all, if anything he&#39;s just been trashing PG for the last day or two. The thing is he wasn&#39;t even trashing PG, he&#39;s just very skeptical of all this shit and I don&#39;t blame him. </p>

<p>I also wouldn&#39;t call any of this pizzagate stuff a &#39;fact&#39; yes the instagram stuff is sketchy at best but we&#39;ve literally had no hard evidence on the Alafantis case so far, just a ton of speculation and far fetched thoughts. </p>

<p>Lets be real, 99% of the pizzagate stuff on this sub are reposts, complete bullshit or text posts such as these and less than 1 percent of the posts here are original and can be used to build a case. Everytime people like me see a &quot;Pizzagate is going down tomorrow!! Pedophiles and politicians set to be arrested by the thousands!&quot; kinda posts we lose a little hope each time they&#39;re debunked, and lets be real we&#39;ve seen close to a thousand of these false flag/bullshit pizzagate posts.</p>

<p>Are there pedophile politicians? Statistically very very likely. Are there more pedophiles than we think? For most of us I&#39;m sure that&#39;s the case. Are all these arrests and public photos linked to this whole pizzagate narrative? Probably not, and I think this sub is trying to push this agenda too hard.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been a PG supporter, but I lose more and more hope each day to a point where just a sliver of me believes parts of it. I think Alafantis and Podesta are sketchy, and James could be a straight up pedophile, but IG photos and emails with code words isn&#39;t definitive proof and I would count them as &#39;Not guilty&#39; if this was a court of law because none of this is truly damning. </p>

<p>I fully see where he is coming from, and I see where you come from as well, I respect both of your opinions (except you labeling him a shill) but I can&#39;t stand on either side (except I&#39;d probably lean more on his side if anything) </p>

<p>We wouldn&#39;t be having this conversation if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that there is so much pizzagate bullshit peddled and reposted in this sub to a point where it&#39;s just annoying and ridiculous as fuck at this point. I honestly think this PG thing is being pushed by certain groups so we ignore the conspiracies that lie in our current government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that it fails at your very first connection? Besta Pizza != Besta World Group.</p>

<p>But let’s fantasise and say it is. Then it fails at Sealight Incorporations Limited (I assume you mistyped) since it&#39;s an intermediary for nearly 4,000 companies.</p>

<p>Their director is “Standard Directors Ltd.” who are the listed director for 1,993 other entities…</p>

<p>One of those is Develcan Ventures Ltd.</p>

<p>One of their directors and shareholders is Elisana Marie-Antoinette Labonte.</p>

<p>That brings us to that thewhistleblowers.info page, I cannot attest to the veracity or that or really know what’s going on there (the site as a whole or that entry). But there are no “money laundering charges” that I can find, and I can see that ‘investigators’ aren’t getting it either they’re just reading “laundering” (or “laindering” as it says there).</p>

<p>I am going to bail there since it just gets madder, and the first connection failed in any case; not to mention subsequent ones.</p>

<p>And why start with Besta Pizza anyway, because of a logo that was changed following pareidolia + harassment?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh and also yes no kidding there are thousands of companies, that&#39;s why it&#39;s hard to track. But a link is a link. The key to hiding transfers like this IS having a huge number of intermediaries, that is exactly how money laundering via shell companies works, by making a paper trail that is too hard to follow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to address your initial problem of Besta Pizza having nothing to do with Besta World Group first. Then try to argue your 1/3896 &gt; 1/1993 &gt; etc as a link and not completely meaningless.</p>

<p>In my searching after reading your comments I came across other &#39;investigators&#39; doing the same thing with registered business addresses. Trying to claim those are links when it&#39;s not uncommon to find thousands of companies using a single address, and for that to imply nothing untoward.</p>

<p>So you still can&#39;t say that it&#39;s completely false?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still doesn&#39;t change the mountain of other evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you were so very confident about this being &quot;hard proof&quot; of Comet Ping Pong being a government front tied to CIA money laundering. But that didn&#39;t stand up to even a moment&#39;s scrutiny. What else is as damning in your mind?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh and other connections just means abusing adoption agencies, foster care systems, and the courts, police, and federal agencies in cases throughout time and throughout the world. Pedophilia has ALWAYS been the thing the elites indulge in the most, as anyone who goes deep down the rabbit hole will realize. This isn&#39;t new, it&#39;s been going on for thousands of years in one form or another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you are connecting those things to the &quot;elites&quot; then? Could you specify?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I posted a link, I&#39;m not asking to get psychoanalyzed. What is damning? The fact that there is a <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Main_Page">wiki this huge detailing exactly how many connections there are</a>. It&#39;s not Comet ping pong, it&#39;s pedogate, and I understand exactly what they are doing with children. I have watched enough videos of survivors telling the exact same stories, medical professionals like psychiatrists discussing the rampant Dissociative Identity Disoder and it&#39;s connection with abused children, MKULTRA experiments pointing to the same torture, dissociation requiring children under extreme stress and torture to fracture their minds. MKULTRA is very confirmed, and what it produced was dissociation with Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omega etc. states being programmed. It was run by Nazis from Operation Paperclip, the same Nazis that the Bush family and Royal family amongst others supported. But I&#39;m getting off track about the children. So we see charities flourishing in countries like Haiti with huge donations, no results, and tons of human trafficking and organ harvesting. Then there&#39;s a Haitian charity office of Clinton&#39;s across the street from Comet Ping Pong. Then there is joking about Haitian special pizzas all over the aforementioned Instagram pictures. A citizen in 2008 filing complains about Comet Ping Pong claiming it is a haven for rape and murder, and filming video outside with childrens screams clearly visible. Then the tunnels underneath Comet Ping Pong, confirmed with many maps (and explored too), then the placement of it on the pentagram of DC along with other children&#39;s care hospitals, and parks where there were ritually sacrificed animals found. </p>

<p>I could go on. Then the Hawaiiian incidents with Obama&#39;s &quot;hot dog stand&quot;, the &quot;cheesybay&quot; seller selling broken hard drives on eBay and an Anon investigating and finding what looks like a bucket of dissolved organic matter and underground wifi signals. Plus his signature was Mr. Potato Head, and many politicians implicated specifically took pictures with said doll. Then Obama and Biden&#39;s cheese pizza &quot;friendship&quot; bracelets. Then Biden being creepy as FUCK on CSPAN with children on numerous occasions. Then Jeff Sessions specifically blocking him from his kids. </p>

<p>Then the Podesta emails of the North Korean trafficking suspects that Bill Clinton got off (and flew home in a known pedophilic hollywood directors jet, Bryan Singer IIRC) with a picture with little kids - WITH IMAGES HIDDEN IN IT WITH STEGANOGRAPHY. </p>

<p>Then you have the numerous, numerous ex-CIA and ex-intelligence officers saying YES there is a conspiracy and YES it is abusing children and YES it is satanic. Ted Gunderson knew himself, he was killed. Andrew Breitbart called out Podesta, threatened Obama, and got himself and Tom Clancy killed. Robert David Steele is confirming it. Steve Piecnezik is confirming it (that should be enough by itself). EVERYONE has been saying the SAME THING for DECADES. </p>

<p>This goes back to Salo and 120 days of Sodom. It&#39;s their nature. They are sick, twisted, and quite fucked up. Anyone who puts even a trivial amount of effort into the research would be able to find dozens of scandals and blatant exposures of the operation that just never seem to get investigated. Johnny Gosch? Franklin Scandal? &quot;The Finders&quot;? It&#39;s all the same shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re doing it again, following the witch-hunt method.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the never the way to &#39;investigate&#39; anything. If you&#39;ve all ready arrived at a conclusion then your own biases will always lead you to find that anything confirms it.</p>

<p>You wrote this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s some hard proof that maybe even you will listen to. Comet Ping Pong and other Ping Pong places in Europe have been tied to CIA money laundering &amp; convicted money launderers through the Panama papers, including arms trafficking. So even if you&#39;re ignorant enough to go &quot;LALALALA&quot; at the child abuse stuff, Comet Ping Pong itself is proven to be a government front.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could not substantiate a single word of it, and it all fell apart instantly because a (different) pizza place has nothing to do with a company with a similar name.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re throwing all this rubbish at me, even the kitchen sink. It&#39;s almost all stuff I&#39;ve read/seen before, and often I have a better recollection of the details than you it seems.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing that you can believe in all this, when I&#39;ve seen the same and think it&#39;s bunkus. But it doesn&#39;t make me question myself, because I haven&#39;t looked at this with any point to prove, no axe to grind, and no &quot;elites&quot; to call pedos. But you&#39;ve come at it from the angle I&#39;ve described previously, where critical thinking is not endearing because it interferes with the conclusions you all ready have.</p>

<p>Pedophiles are real and there are doubtless some amongst the wealthy and powerful. The rest is fantasy and you&#39;re being used and manipulated.</p>

<p>But are you really Johnny Everyconspiracy and a bit &#39;off,&#39; or is this an act?</p>

<p>What a strange thing to say. I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s an aggressive outburst or some sort of feeble appeal to emotion.</p>

<p>Statistically I am far, far more likely to be stolen and raped than my children.</p>

<p>Were it to happen to my children it would not be committed by the worldwide global elite who would rape them in satanic ceremonies, then MKUltra them so they are disassociated from their Alpha &amp; Omega states but somehow free to make YouTube videos about how it all happened to them when they get older. ...Because there&#39;s no such thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not on anyone&#39;s &quot;side&quot;. The fool gets caught up in &quot;sides&quot;, while the sage sees through to the heart of things and realizes that <em>there are no sides</em>. The so-called &quot;sides&quot; are illusions, and in any case there are many more than two.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t taking anyone&#39;s side just now. I was pointing out, using crude humor, that you cannot make an empirical statement about whether or not Julian Assange is or is not a rapist (and neither can I!) unless you were there, looking through the window, you dirty peeping Sven, you ;D</p>

<p>Both woman have since refuted their original testimony. He did have sex with them, but it wasn&#39;t rape. </p>

<p>Also, how well do you know Sweden&#39;s laws since you&#39;ve gone out on this limb? In country you can be charged with sexual assault if you have sex with another adult WITHOUT a condom. </p>

<p>You are right misinformed wasn&#39;t the correct term here, he misunderstood the question so his answer made him look foolish. But he definitely wasn&#39;t freaking out.</p>

<p>First of all, I provided a clear cut example of Trump acting like a child and then you went into some weird deflective rant which is reflective of your shit upbringing and shit parents. </p>

<p>By the way, the validity of the guy&#39;s argument wasn&#39;t the point of the post. Trump&#39;s reaction to the guy is everything. Even more hilarious that the guy went the extra mile saying he nor his community blame Trump for rise in anti-Semitic issues.

<p>They have a picture of a little girl taped to a ping pong table. The girl is the daughter of one of the subjects of interest to the whole Pizzagate thing. They tie this admittedly odd event to a picture of Michelle Obama playing ping pong on a different table, at a different location, for one of her Let&#39;s Move! Campaign events.</p>

<p>Do you see the insanity of that little nugget of info? That makes no sense. There isn&#39;t even anyone willing to stand behind the allegations that Michelle Obama was involved in taping little girls to ping pong tables. There&#39;s no evidence of it happening.

<p>As far as I know, by the way, PG investigators have contributed to exactly zero arrests. Have you attempted to donate time or money to groups dedicated to curbing human trafficking?

<p>History is riddled with mobs of humans making bad decisions.  I have to be honest with you, however, your question took me by surprise as I hadn&#39;t really thought about it.  I did some reading and learned a bit, so thanks for that.</p>

<p>I would think the Red Scare or McCarthyism is another example.  People made accusations to avoid being accused themselves and tons of people lost their jobs.  The Salem Witch Trials are definitely one of the more popular in history.  From my understanding, it was basically<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_hysteria"> mass hysteria</a>.  Not all cases of mass hysteria are deadly, of course.  A more recent example would be the <a href="http://all-that-is-interesting.com/satanic-panic-1980s">Satanic panic</a> in the 80s and 90s.  A lot of people were accused of some pretty heinous shit.</p>

<p>I guess that my point would be - How do we do these crowd sourced investigations without succumbing to hysteria, selection bias, and confirmation bias?  There&#39;s no real accountability, and I don&#39;t know that there would be a real way to implement accountability without adversely affecting net neutrality and that&#39;s just not something that I&#39;m comfortable doing.  Like I said, I love the idea behind them, but I don&#39;t know how to keep hysteria, selection bias, and confirmation bias from rearing their ugly heads without some kind of accountability.</p>

However, how many times through the course of history have people of extreme power and or wealth use their means to systemically exploit, murder, and rape those of lower means.

    <div class="md"><p>Because the Achilles heal of this entire &quot;investigation&quot; is that it is full of bias and tenuous links between &quot;evidence&quot; that quickly falls apart under real scrutiny.  The &quot;FBI&quot; files that just got linked are full of &quot;zomg lizard people&quot; type talk and aren&#39;t even official government files, but they are being played off as such.</p>

<p>Basically, the people behind this investigation can&#39;t take any criticism and from my own personal experience, have admitted to twisting facts and presenting data in ways that is intentionally misleading for the sake of &quot;muh story!  Think of the kids!&quot;  If this were a side they opposed acting like this, they would laugh them off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the fact that I already have reason to believe that this world is in the hands of supernatural forces. I don&#39;t think these are your average greedy business men. I think we&#39;re dealing with a fucked up force. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had some pretty weird supernatural experiences throughout my life. Experiences that I don&#39;t even tell people because they&#39;re so far-fetched. I&#39;ve seen what I believe to be the bottom of the rabbit hole (although it never really ends). </p>

<p>So Pizzagate doesn&#39;t surprise me too much at this stage of my spiritual journey. I still look at every piece of information with a skeptical eye. Not every Pizzagate guy swallows all the shit presented to him/her. I&#39;m the most skeptical person you&#39;ll ever meet.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t ask me what specific piece of info swayed me, because there is a much bigger picture involved. Each piece of info is useless on it&#39;s own. All we can do is wait and see. I&#39;ve never once said that Pizzagate is true, and I won&#39;t until there are arrests made. But I have reason to believe that there is indeed a massive child trafficking ring, and I believe DC is involved.</p>

<p>You had already made up your mind on something so of course anything anyone proposes as evidence, even if untrue/shady/shitty you&#39;ll just take it as proof to confirm it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re doing a reverse investigative process. That&#39;s a pretty dangerous way of doing things.</p>

<p>We asked you to cite some solid evidence about PG and all you can come up is that bullshit nonsense about pre-conceived feelings of supernatural forces and PG happens to fit that inclination in your mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are. Admit it, neither Podesta or the person emailing is in any way worried about this legendary handkerchief.  That&#39;s 90% of you argument about this very suspicious handkerchief gone in a flash, so you drop that and go on to the &quot;language&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not suspicious, in any way.</p>

<p>Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you&#39;re busy, so feel free not to respond if it&#39;s not yours or you don&#39;t want it. Susaner</p>

<p>It&#39;s mine but not worth worrying about</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now if I realised that a random realtor had stumbled across my secret pedo handkerchief I&#39;d probably display slightly more concern.  And the realtor and the lady do so out of politeness, not fear that Podesta has accidentally left the secret map to the child dungeon on the kitchen Island.</p>

<p>You are grasping at straws.  Known pedo code? For starters I doubt podesta is on 4chan a lot, secondly if it&#39;s a known code, no one would be using it. </p>

<p>And ffs, I thought a top researcher such as yourself would have this covered</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that he emailed him in the first place shows concern. If not, why bother? Maybe not worth freaking out over, but just enough to worry since he knows podesta likes kids. Anyways, I&#39;m not sure if pizza and map aren&#39;t pedo codes, it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told and to me it makes sense. It fits in the context. And I will admit to being surprised how many handkerchiefs actually have maps on them. Knowing this, I still find it odd that he says it may be related to pizza. To me it&#39;s obvious this is a code, and if pedos refer to kids as pizza, that&#39;s incriminating. I didn&#39;t see any of those handkerchief with maps show a pizza route. Anyway, I appreciate the more respectful approach, that actually opens up dialogue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It shows the realtor and Susan are normal, polite people.  Maybe a bit overly nice.  If I found a nice handkerchief that I knew someone had left behind, I would try and get it back to them. It&#39;s not a tissue, for all we know it could be a really nice silk handkerchief.  So he sends an email, I found a handkerchief, do you want it back? Podesta, who lets not forget is undoubtedly a busy man, says nah, it&#39;s not worth the effort.   It&#39;s a totally normal exchange.</p>

<p>Bet then you add your pedo code to it.  Do we have any reason to suspect they are talking in code? Only if we have a code to begin with. What is the history of that code? As far as I know Cheese Pizza or CP was used on 4Chan as a code for child porn.  All other food related codewords were made up and fabricated by an anonymous 4chan poster and then grabbed by pizzagate &quot;researchers&quot; as gospel truth. These other words exist prior to PG at best as urban dictionary references.  They certainly do not form part of any known (by the fbi or otherwise) pedofile code language. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also interesting to note the the phrase &quot;Cheese Pizza&quot;, the only code we actually know existed, doesn&#39;t appear anywhere in the &quot;incriminating&quot; emails.</p>

<p>Imagine you are a keen car enthusiat and I steal your emails.  I decide that &quot;keys&quot; means child slave and exhaust means asshole.  What&#39;s this? Someone emailed you </p>

<p>&quot;Hey silkenindiana, you left your key behind at my house, I can drop it off if you like. tomorro?&quot; you reply &quot;That&#39;d be great, not sure what use it&#39;ll be though, the exhaust is wrecked after Saturday!&quot;</p>

<p>Disgusting! I better trawl through your instagram.</p>

<p>One post ago you couldn&#39;t believe such a thing as a map on a handkerchief existed, now I have to find you one specifically  pizza related.....and if I found one of those you&#39;d demand Podesta&#39;s actual handkerchief.</p>

<p>I have seen his instagram, it&#39;s not mainstream and not to everyone&#39;s taste, not mine anyway.  Have you ever been to any of the less savory areas of a big city? the redlight districts? You&#39;ll see weird shit like this and more.  People are kinky and wierd and like all kinds of funky shit, it&#39;s not evidence of child abuse.  They make sick jokes.  Alefantis has made a mistake lots of people make these days and forgetting that his instagram isn&#39;t just for him and his social circle, anyone can find it. Yes I looked at the &quot;instagram evidence&quot;  it&#39;s evidence for nothing.  Just out of context withc hunting.  I mean the kid with her hands taped to the table that got PGers frothing at the mouth, that&#39;s literally nothing, adults playing with a kid, she&#39;s clearly having fun, the tape is masking tape not gaffer tape.  It&#39;s a joke.  Only someone with an agenda could find something sinister in that picture, and people that do should have a look at themselves and their motives.</p>

Anyway, I think you are absolutely crazy to say anyone that thinks a picture of a kid with her hands taped up to a table is weird has an agenda. That&#39;s a stretch in my mind, a big one. Anyway, that&#39;s not the only picture. Anyone in my circle of friends makes pedophile jokes they are no longer my friend. You seem to think it&#39;s ok, which is odd to me. Anyway, thanks for the discussion, it&#39;s been interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is, people like you won&#39;t even take a look. I have never seen more curcumstantial evidence in my life than that attached to &#39;pizzagate&#39;. There is no hard evidence, but when you have a look at the curcumstantial evidence, and realise that there are far too many coincidences and connection you know there&#39;s something going on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it mass child trafficking and rape? I don&#39;t know. But to brush it off as nothing or to say there&#39;s no evidence is disgusting. The FBI needs to directly address the information and give very specific explanations. If there&#39;s no crime, then fine - but this has hundreds of thousands of reasonable people VERY worried. Give us a fucking explanation of why there are code words and pedo symbols everywhere we look. These codes and symbols were on the FBI&#39;s website. There&#39;s too much fishy shit to ignore. If you can&#39;t even agree that this needs to be looked in to, addressed and investigated, then you most definitely have not given this proper time and an open minded look. I don&#39;t know one person who gave pizzagate a proper look and was not completely convinced there is some sick shit going on. Hard evidence or not - we have enough to know there&#39;s a massive cover up of something fucked up. We want a fucking investigation. Not radio silence from authorities and media..</p>

<p>*Online citizen sleuthing will continue to be the most important force in tracking down elite pedophile networks, political corruption and inhumane occult practices, while continuing to challenge official cover-ups and disinformation. The citizen investigators with the online discussion groups has proven in Pizzagate that they are a credible part of the press arena by proving themselves to often be more accurate and honest than the news in print or television. Still needed, however, were methods of traditional journalism in organizing the many findings into comprehensive articles, which was done rigorously as possible and sometimes with acid humor in this Pizzagate series. </p>

<p>You didn&#39;t ask me anything, you asked someone else.</p>

<p>The words at the top of the post are called usernames, they&#39;re there to distinguish between different people. It&#39;s so you can know when you&#39;re talking to someone youve talked to before, or when you&#39;re talking to someone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what fucked up logic just went through your brain there, but here&#39;s how these things work.</p>

<p>Step 1) Investigate the crime</p>

<p>Step 2) Make the arrests.</p>

<p>Unless you think Trump has been arresting people without any investigation, then you will need to agree that that any arrests which happen at the start of Trump&#39;s time in charge are the result of investigations which started before Trump took charge. It is very simple.</p>

<p>It is good that Trump allowed the investigations to finish, but don&#39;t be so stupid as to think that they didn&#39;t start before he arrived.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or why don&#39;t you show them evidence that makes actual sense, not with assumptions inbetween to link it, because unfortunately when you guys make these assumptions and leaps as logical as you try make it out to be in your head, it is still a case of you guys making stuff up to fit your narrative. There is too many holes in your theorys and too much trying to beat square pegs in round holes just to keep your narrative afloat. None of you approach this neutrally and with an unbias mind, you have decided that this is real and you gather things that only suit your side of the argument brush as side anything that contradicts it.

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is, people like you won&#39;t even take a look. I have never seen more curcumstantial evidence in my life than that attached to &#39;pizzagate&#39;.

<p>Is it mass child trafficking and rape? I don&#39;t know. But to brush it off as nothing or to say there&#39;s no evidence is disgusting. The FBI needs to directly address the information and give very specific explanations. If there&#39;s no crime, then fine - but this has hundreds of thousands of reasonable people VERY worried. Give us a fucking explanation of why there are code words and pedo symbols everywhere we look. These codes and symbols were on the FBI&#39;s website. There&#39;s too much fishy shit to ignore. If you can&#39;t even agree that this needs to be looked in to, addressed and investigated, then you most definitely have not given this proper time and an open minded look. I don&#39;t know one person who gave pizzagate a proper look and was not completely convinced there is some sick shit going on. Hard evidence or not - we have enough to know there&#39;s a massive cover up of something fucked up. We want a fucking investigation. Not radio silence from authorities and media. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not true at all.  I&#39;ve tried, in the past, several times to only be met with &quot;shill&quot; or &quot;retard&quot; or worse.  You can see examples of it in this very thread.

<p>It is, but keep in mind that almost every one of the people who are skeptical of Pizzagate have been called shills, pedophiles, and retards.  It doesn&#39;t make their initial response any less assholish, but if you acknowledge that you&#39;ll have much more success.</p>

<p>I believe that part of the reason for that is the hyper-partisan nature of the people involved in the investigation of PG.  I could be wrong, but that seems to be the obvious reason.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence of a crime.  No witnesses or victims who have come forward.  Much of it is based off of a code from 4chan.  Many of these bits of &quot;evidence&quot; are laughable.  For example, the Michelle Obama example given earlier and the &quot;Clinton&#39;s &quot;seizures&quot; are caused by Kuru&quot; examples make me question the legitimacy of all of it.  Not to mention that PG seems like an exercise in confirmation and selection bias.  I repeat the last sentence like a mantra, but it appears to have some basis.</p>

<p>Please understand that I could be wrong and I will be the first to admit it, but to espouse these ideas as gospel along, knowing the aforementioned facts, with the self-congratulatory posts like these... makes me think that this just a hyper-partisan witch hunt.  It seems like people have used this to sew further division between citizens so that our attention is elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As have I.  I just came to a different conclusion.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Confirmation bias?  Can you be sure that you&#39;re truly being objective?  You could make the same argument with myself, I&#39;m not short on self-awareness.  Those main points that I mentioned previously, however, prevent me from committing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you honestly had a good look at the info on voat? It&#39;s all pretty well sourced to me. I would love for you to disprove the thing and help me fucking sleep at night haha</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have.  Many of the sources are questionable, at best.  It still doesn&#39;t change that there&#39;s no evidence of a crime.  No witnesses or victims who have come forward.  I also have a difficult time believing that people who are supposed to be nefariously brilliant somehow posted hints of criminal behavior on social media without setting their profiles to private.  I also can&#39;t take part as the intellectually dishonest way that skeptics are treated drives me away.  </p>

<p>I made a post in this thread and I&#39;d like you to see the reactions that it garnered.  The reactions that I received are far too common.  You are, sadly, the minority when it comes to PG supporters.</p>

Most of the comments that are negative towards pizza gate usually are riddled with insults calling users basement dwellers, lunatics, and they are generally trying to make users look like their stereotype of what they believe a Trump supporter looks like.</p>

<p>Are you saying that the independent investigative journalism conducted on pizza gate is viewed as hateful propaganda?</p>

Is it awkward and weird? Fuck yeah, it is. Does it mean they wanna fuck their grandson/daughter/niece/nephew? No. It&#39;s an old person, not thinking, trying to say something flattering.

<p>Yes, investigate. But if you are proven wrong then find something else.</p>

<p>You have no actual proof and any reasonable person can see it that&#39;s why you aren&#39;t getting any major traction, because everything is bullshit.</p>

<p>These guys are creating evidence and defaming actual people at the expense of nothing. They are all anonymous and can say anything without recourse.</p>

<p>Where as if you had to say it in public you would be ridiculed for the baseless accusations and society would free market your ass to the sidelines with no voice at all. Yet here you are spouting anyway.</p>

<p>Find real evidence that can convince some one besides the paranoid delusional and I&#39;ll listen.</p>

<p>Until then you sound like the inside of an insane asylum simply trying to make your political opponents look bad like a Russian shill, and nobody but you and the few upvotes you see are falling for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every year or so, there&#39;s a new one. And then, suddenly, the old ones just aren&#39;t spoken of. Not a single person admits they were wrong. No one assumes accountability. They just move on to the next one and do the same exact thing</p>

<p>See: Boston Bombing, Sandy Hook, Jade Helm.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same exact pattern. Same exact baseless claims of &quot;things are about to happen!&quot; &quot;Dominoes are about to fall!&quot;</p>

<p>This pizzagate conspiracy is one of the whackiest yet. Jesus, i just want a REAL conspiracy to talk about and discuss. But all we get is this BS pizzagate with SUUUPER circumstantial evidence, grasping connections... it&#39;s a hot mess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some people just want to have control/power/influence. Peddling shitty conspiracy theories like this one makes people feel important. They legit feel like they&#39;re &quot;part of an investigation&quot;. People on the internet suddenly &quot;respect&quot; you. People listen to you. </p>

<p>I can see why that would be very appealing to &quot;certain&quot; people. </p>

<p>But come on, at some point, deep down inside, you gotta realize you&#39;re skating on bullshit. I hope.... or do people get lost in their delusions? What I mean is, come on. I KNOW the government keeps things from us. I believe in conspiracies..... but that doesn&#39;t mean i just go around calling everything a conspiracy. And then there&#39;s people who go beyond that and just start making up their own conspiracies when they don&#39;t have an original one to talk about anymore. </p>

<p>Come on. What&#39;s this pizzagate <em>really</em> about?</p>

<p>What should Donald Trump get from his little stunt? He should learn this is a democracy, not a dictatorship.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very happy seeing people join forces in order to weed out the pedo ringmasters. We all feel that Good must triumph over this darkness infecting our world. These monsters control all aspects of our everyday lives (Political, Economic, Judiciary, Militarily &amp; Media), and we all want justice for those poor kids who&#39;ve been abused/killed/enslaved. Also we have to get justice for journalists like Jill Dando, who was investigating pedos in the BBC, Parliament, and other offices of power. Jill was gunned down, and to this day no one knows who did it. So many brave journalists have been snuffed out, and we have to continue the pressure until these monsters are destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cyber utopia - the belief that internet, technology and Elon Musk will somehow fix the things that have been wrong with human societies for thousands of years.</p>

<p>But the internet is more like the tower of Babel - the biblical story of how different languages were the cause of the great tower coming down (that and weakened steal beams). Yet now we&#39;re breaking the world up further to a point where every person has his own language - that&#39;s what the internet does (witness this post just as one example). This may seem like a positive things - allowing each person an individual voice - but in fact human groups need focus to achieve things and  affect change - extreme individuality of ppl is actually not beneficial to that.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t kid yourselves - the internet doesn&#39;t even need to be restricted because of the &quot;danger&quot; of ppl working together - people will mess it up on their own - all it takes is a few nuts believing in aliens and reptiles to turn the whole group endeavor into a total waste of time - there&#39;s plenty of those around and if by chance they are missing from some group or channel - the power that be will make sure to remedy that.</p>

<p>If you want change it will require what it has always required - a willingness to organize, fight and endure - not the typical traits of a redditor or youtuber (no offense).</p>

<p>The problem is that these shills don&#39;t care because they are getting paid, they just follow instructions. It would be interested to take a peak at what type of justifications they probably convinced themselves to be bought by political parties/companies and will actually defending pedophiles and child abductors in exchange for money. </p>

<p>If I hace 200 bucks I could buy half of them since these people have no integrity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It shows the realtor and Susan are normal, polite people.  Maybe a bit overly nice.  If I found a nice handkerchief that I knew someone had left behind, I would try and get it back to them. It&#39;s not a tissue, for all we know it could be a really nice silk handkerchief.  So he sends an email, I found a handkerchief, do you want it back? Podesta, who lets not forget is undoubtedly a busy man, says nah, it&#39;s not worth the effort.   It&#39;s a totally normal exchange.</p>

<p>Bet then you add your pedo code to it.  Do we have any reason to suspect they are talking in code? Only if we have a code to begin with. What is the history of that code? As far as I know Cheese Pizza or CP was used on 4Chan as a code for child porn.  All other food related codewords were made up and fabricated by an anonymous 4chan poster and then grabbed by pizzagate &quot;researchers&quot; as gospel truth. These other words exist prior to PG at best as urban dictionary references.  They certainly do not form part of any known (by the fbi or otherwise) pedofile code language. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also interesting to note the the phrase &quot;Cheese Pizza&quot;, the only code we actually know existed, doesn&#39;t appear anywhere in the &quot;incriminating&quot; emails.</p>

<p>Imagine you are a keen car enthusiat and I steal your emails.  I decide that &quot;keys&quot; means child slave and exhaust means asshole.  What&#39;s this? Someone emailed you </p>

<p>&quot;Hey silkenindiana, you left your key behind at my house, I can drop it off if you like. tomorro?&quot; you reply &quot;That&#39;d be great, not sure what use it&#39;ll be though, the exhaust is wrecked after Saturday!&quot;</p>

<p>Disgusting! I better trawl through your instagram.</p>

<p>One post ago you couldn&#39;t believe such a thing as a map on a handkerchief existed, now I have to find you one specifically  pizza related.....and if I found one of those you&#39;d demand Podesta&#39;s actual handkerchief.</p>

<p>I have seen his instagram, it&#39;s not mainstream and not to everyone&#39;s taste, not mine anyway.  Have you ever been to any of the less savory areas of a big city? the redlight districts? You&#39;ll see weird shit like this and more.  People are kinky and wierd and like all kinds of funky shit, it&#39;s not evidence of child abuse.  They make sick jokes.  Alefantis has made a mistake lots of people make these days and forgetting that his instagram isn&#39;t just for him and his social circle, anyone can find it. Yes I looked at the &quot;instagram evidence&quot;  it&#39;s evidence for nothing.  Just out of context withc hunting.  I mean the kid with her hands taped to the table that got PGers frothing at the mouth, that&#39;s literally nothing, adults playing with a kid, she&#39;s clearly having fun, the tape is masking tape not gaffer tape.  It&#39;s a joke.  Only someone with an agenda could find something sinister in that picture, and people that do should have a look at themselves and their motives.</p>
