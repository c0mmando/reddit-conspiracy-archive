Bill Gates has also proven to be not popular enough to instantly get to the front page (check his earlier posts, many of them stop at ~200 upvotes) so I have reason to believe Bill Gates is manipulating reddit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) announced recently that it is officially cutting ties with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. This announcement comes after it was shown that so-called vaccine “campaigns” conducted on tens of thousands of young girls throughout India back in 2009-2010 that were meant to help protect them from cervical cancer were actually cloaked vaccine trials involving two highly controversial vaccines known to injure and kill.</p>

<p>The vaccines in question are Cervarix by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Gardasil by Merck &amp; Co., both of which are marketed as protecting against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is claimed to have a link to cervical cancer. Both vaccines come with extreme side effects, and evidence shows that GSK and Merck essentially teamed up with the Gates Foundation to take advantage of young Indian girls and use them as human guinea pigs in trials of the two vaccines.</p>

If you remove yourself from the situation and forget/stop caring about everyone on Earth now and anyone in the next few generations, you should come to the realization that eugenics is a necessary evil and that a world with 20 billion people is a worse prospect than eugenics now and much more aggressive depopulation later </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t worry about the world&#39;s population growing to that number and for good reason. I learned while earning my econ degree that all countries follow the same path to becoming fully developed. Countries start out mostly rural with little available technology, specifically medical technology. In the early stages of development, infant mortality rates are very high compared to more developed countries, so men and women have alot of children since there is a good chance some wont survive childhood. As countries transition from rural, agriculturally dominant economies to more technologically advanced nations featuring growing urban populations as people move from the country into the cities to find a better paying job or an easier lifestyle free from the daily toil of farming and living the agrarian lifestyle. </p>

<p>As the economy grows, the population has more access to higher levels of technology then they were previously capable of achieving, this includes medical technology. So, the infancy mortality rate drops but people continue to have alot of children for a short time period. Once people become adjusted to the reduced infancy mortality rate, they begin having less as less children.</p>

<p>The reason the world population has explode in recent decades is due to China and India transitioning from rural societies into more economically developed nations. But, the birthrate in China has decreased significantly, and in India there have been many efforts to slow the birthrate and I&#39;m positive that India&#39;s population growth rate will stabilize soon</p>

<p>Informed consent is the most important factor (of what I believe in). Im not sure how a sum could be calculated, but I would offer a sum of money/goods/resources in return for someomes voluntary sterilization. And there would be constant reminders in very direct, clear and concise language that you will not have children of your own reproduction if you volunteer. I dont see the problem with that. We (not everyone obviously) already sell ourselves for fame and glory... why not for something that would benefit the world not only in 20 years but in 200 years</p>

To think we can give up behaviors ingrained in us over thousands of years is ignorant. Youre gonna have to do more than just meet peoples need if you dont wanna get jacked for you have so someone else can have it. Even if its your life.

    <div class="md"><p>What do you consider to be &quot;solid&quot; research? Most American or European sources that mention any kind of deception are Pro-Life affiliated and too bias to be taken more seriously than the mainstream media who will say no wrong about the operation. I will look for sources from Africa with more evidence than just words, but the amount of money involved and the relationship big organizations have with each other and the banks is a big factor in the lack of evidence or even negative opinions, not to mention how under developed Africa is compared to much of the world.  </p>

<p>While this is by no means conclusive evidence, it should be taken into consideration that eugenics was practiced here in the US and that Hitler was inspired by what he had learned about America&#39;s use of it. There are many accounts of women being involuntarily sterilized without knowing. These ventures were funded by families like the Rockefellers and Carnegies. Rockefeller also funded Margaret Sanger, whos planned parenthood initiative is often misinterpreted.  </p>

<p>One of the more suspicious (albeit inconclusive) things to me is the Rockefeller Foundation report from 1968 relating the eugenics. The amount of information thats been literally covered up is staggering. It can be found on google easily. But what cant be found (and Ive spent more than a lot of time looking) is an original version from before 2003 when dozens and dozens of pages worth of information was covered with Rockefeller logos. The fact that they covered up the information and didnt remove it outright is bizarre to me because obviously that will make people suspicious. </p>

<p>Unless there is a wikileaks type leak or other conclusive evidence is exposed then most people just will not take seriously the idea that their is any kind of wrong doing behind the scenes and that 100% of everything is for the good of those individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that total world overpopulation is propaganda. The earth has been through unimaginably destructive natural events. Thinking the pollution of humans will destroy the planet is just a testament to human egotism.  </p>

<p>Anyone who lives near or around a big city has to deal with over population on a daily basis. We all have the ability to move, but we dont because of convenience, family, and other local investments we make. Just take a look at some videos from a Tokyo subway and how many people jam them selves into a metal can like sardines. </p>

<p>So the problem is not really over population, its an unwillingness to move.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like someone was paid to show up here as well. </p>

<p>Bill Gates is eugenicist slime who cares nothing about the people other than to sterilize them and force vaccinations on indigent people who lack the right of informed consent. He gave a noted TED talk regarding lowering the human population as the only way to save the planet. The Bill and Melinda Gates [propaganda] Foundation was also exposed for buying $500K shares of Monsanto back in 2010 (valued at $23 million) and are noted for trying to take over local seed systems to establish control over world food/agriculture. Their foundation also gave &gt;$260 million to AGRA, a front movement to push GMOs on Africa. His father was also on the board of Planned Parenthood, another eugenics front organization.</p>

<p>He&#39;s basically been solely involved in eugenics and reproductive organizations or trying to control the worlds food supply. Where&#39;s the philanthropy in that, paid for hire PR reps?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny thing is, there&#39;s plenty of studies showing GMOs have negative effects. Usually the studies saying they are safe have rats fed GMO food for 90 days and just compare organ weights and look for general health. The studies finishing negative effects are using a microscope to examine the damage to things such as the intestine and liver. Being skeptical about GMOs does not make you &quot;anti-science&quot; in any way shape or form.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t buy this scam that billionaires are giving away the majority of their fortunes. If anything they set up charities as tax havens. They maintain control of the money while claiming tax exempt status. </p>

<p>They keep claiming that Bill Gates is trying so hard to get rid of his money but just can&#39;t manage to do it, that is why he is richer than ever. Bull Fucking Shit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same story with all the super rich fucks who claim to be donating a majority of their fortune to charity. It is just propaganda to keep the people from becoming upset at the egregious amount of wealth these people have vacuumed up.

<p>Monsanto never did any studies on the longterm effects of glyphosate on humans. Instead, they used their money and influence to buy politicians. They are one of the most evil companies in the world.</p>

<p>This is also the reason why so many kids have gluten allergies these days.</p>

<p>Wheat and oat based food products are especially saturated with glyphosate. Through a process called desiccation, they spray the crops right before harvest to speed up the drying process by a few weeks. It&#39;s mostly done in cold/rainy climates like Canada and the upper Midwest. It originally started in Scotland. They are spraying poison straight on to the food that humans, as well as animals eat.</p>

<p>The glyphosate levels in some wheat/oat based breakfast cereals, such as Cheerios, is off the charts.</p>

<p>All of this is a fact, if you don&#39;t believe me research it for yourself. Remember, at one point 9 out of 10 doctors said smoking was good for you.</p>
