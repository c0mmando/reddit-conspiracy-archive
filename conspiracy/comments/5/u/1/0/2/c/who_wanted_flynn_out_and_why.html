        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>NY Times claims that was was said on the call was Flynn told the Russian Ambassador not to retaliate against the Obama sanctions for hacking, which they then didn&#39;t, because that would make it easier to ease sanctions eventually. Washington Post claims it was the FBI that had the call tapped and told the White House Flynn had lied to Pence and therefore could be blackmailed for lying to his boss.  But his lying aside, the call was pretty innocuous, nothing you couldn&#39;t say as a talking head on CNN.  This all seems to be a tempest in a tea pot. I turn on Morning Joe and they are <em>so</em> relieved that Flynn is out. Richard Hass of the CFR said hopefully the replacement will be from the list of Foreign Policy types that signed a letter denouncing Trump!  Flynn made the Globalist <em>very</em> nervous. They are quite excited by the chance to get an establishment hack in that position.  Me thinks this has not much to do with Russia or that call or blackmail potential, and everything to do with Flynn&#39;s view of the world. Remember, this is a man who the media constantly reminded us, believed in <em>conspiracy theories</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like he thought he was protecting Trump admin by not telling them everything. Or maybe it&#39;s all bullshit and they knew all along. But can you blame them? Obama set up the whole thing so they could attack Trump for being weak on communists or whatever. It&#39;s such a fucking transparently baseless attack.<br/>
Flynn&#39;s resignation was damage control at the least, and perhaps a sign that the military industrial complex has regained control of US foreign policy. Even with Trump&#39;s bluster about Iran and routing out ISIS, it seems the presence of Flynn was too much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great point. Blame the election loss on Russia (a narrative still so ridiculous it&#39;s hard to believe it&#39;s been cemented into the Wikipedia of modern history), put in place sanctions as &quot;punishment&quot; knowing it sets a trap for Trump if he wants to get rid of them because they unwarranted in the first place. Flynn tells the ambassador, &quot;don&#39;t worry, we know it&#39;s bullshit&quot; and gets fired</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or how about you look at it with the simplest explanation. Flynn was outed by Sally (Former AG) to trump because she felt his connections to Russia would harm the administration and be a security risk and bargaining chip for Russia since he violated the Logan Act due to speaking about government policy while being a normal US citizen. Trump ignored her and told her to fuck off, forcing her to resign only a week later. In the hopes this Flynn connection went away, they kept quiet on the issue and made some remarks about ISIS AND Iran (who Flynn has been vocal about bombing Iran into oblivion) to try and manipulate current discussion. </p>

<p>This is another one of trump appointees with  if ties to Russia. Paul Manafort was hired and lasted, what, a month? After being found out as a Russian comrad and helping Russia with their coup of Ukraine. He later resigns due to these connections to Russia. Then we have Rex tillerson, former Exxon Mobil CEO, who has massive business ties to Russia, who&#39;s company has lost hundreds of millions of dollars in russia due to the sanctions brought on by Obama. Why is it that trump has hired so many sketchy people with sketchy Russian connections? This could be a hue conspiracy yet we blow it off because so many news outlets are covering it. </p>

<p>This should be further Investigated, but I think it&#39;s asinine to just ignore this and continue with pizzagate when we could easily be discussing and researching both. Yet somehow whenever these stories have come about trump, we get flooded with CTR + T_D shills (almost as if on purpose this happens) and the posts get tagged and taken down with no discussion on the actual content.</p>

<p>One last thing, the former MI8 spy who wrote the dossier, he is now in hiding for fear of his life, there are now some aspects to the dossier that ring true. This sub makes sure to let it be known when leakers or whistleblowers go into hiding to spread awareness, yet for this guy no one seems to care. It&#39;s almost as if the sub does not want to confront a corrupt Trump and would rather brush it aside.</p>

<p>That is my two cents on the issue</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good take. I&#39;m open to a Russian conspiracy. The Big shoes to drop there that haven&#39;t though yet are a lifting of sanctions and a pay off to Trump either in the future or in the Cayman islands stake already purchased in Rosneft.  Neither has happened yet so we wait.  I think we can say for sure that whether Yates acted out of patriotism or something else, her warning went unheeded, but her warning getting leaked did the trick. So this is just one more big win for leaking. Expect to see a lot more of it after today</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest question.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence that directly links trump to Russia? I have just heard that he is in cahoots by association really. Like, any specific business dealings that trump has in Russia? Any trips he&#39;s made there or met with anyone? </p>

<p>I know the dossier seems to be a big lead now but why add in the golden shower bit?</p>

<p>Even for the pedogate stuff, I feel there are many more things that prove its validity compared to Russia.</p>

<p>Basically, we only see trump opposition saying he has ties with Russia, but where are the independent sources backing up these claims? No Wikileaks about this? No other neutral sources backing this up? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that no, there are no direct links between Trump and Russia.</p>

<p>What is more funny, is that Trump has consistently ousted Russian links.</p>

<p>Paul Manafort worked on campaigns for Reagan, Dole, and Bush. He was an excellent pick for Campaign manager. A month later and Russian connection rumors came up (Plus rumors that Trump flat out was not liking Manaforts control of the campaign), Trumped ousted him.</p>

<p>Mike Flynn just got ousted for a phone call which, according to them was totally legal, and he was fired for breach of trust.</p>

<p>Carter Page, I don&#39;t know much about about that situation, but in the end ties were cut there too.</p>

<p>For being a Russian Puppet, Trump seems to excel at dropping these guys with any Russian association with the quickness...</p>

<p>Anyway. We are in a new era of McCarthyism.</p>

<p>Russia with their coup of Ukraine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part stands out to me. You are clearly intelligent and have read a lot, but unfortunately most of what you&#39;re basing on is globalist propaganda.</p>

<p>Soros and Co. staged the Yellow Revolution in Ukraine, kicked out the government, and installed a pro-globalist government. Russia was alarmed, as was Crimea, which is ethnically Russian, not Ukrainian. Russia annexed their own people back after the government underwent a coup and became anti-Russian.</p>

<p>Russia is not the boogey man, the globalists staging color revolutions are the bad guys. Crimean citizens wanted to return to Russia after the Ukrainian yellow revolution coup. The media is determined to tell us that Trump is a Russian puppet because the Russians are the force of anti-globalism. They&#39;ll also tell you he&#39;s a Bannon/Israeli puppet, if you&#39;re more likely to believe that.</p>

<p>Check Wikipedia, check Wikileaks, look into Crimea and the Ukrainian revolution from non-US mainstream sources. You will get a much different picture. Good luck, I hope this gets you started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hardly outlandish.  Lots of people make careers out of fleecing the US people out of taxpayer dollars in service of foreign interests.</p>

<p>Manafort (former Trump advisor who officially resigned while continuing to live in Trump tower in close contact) made a <em>career</em> out of that kind of stuff.  His lobbying firm took money from foreign governments (if you look at their history, all corrupt authoritarians), and then tried to convince congress to support those groups.</p>

<p>Flynn&#39;s actions support the notion that he was secretly colluding with Russia behind the backs of not only the government, but his own political allies in the Trump administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I asked a pretty specific question, and all I got in return was that people in power abuse their power.  So, I&#39;ll conclude that you have no reason to think that Flynn had bad intentions.  Could it not be, in fact, could it be more reasonable that Flynn did have the US&#39;s best interests when he was communicating with a Russian ambassador?  It seems that you have the mindset of Russia=Bad so that anyone who talks to a Russian has evil Putin plans.</p>

<p>Seems to me that this is a huge non-issue, and that this is just a furthering of the Evil Putin/ Trump is a Russian Manchurian Candidate conspiracy that has been promoted by the Left and mainstream media.</p>

<p>I thought you might have some reason to believe that Flynn had legitimate anti-US interests.  You don&#39;t.  I do not want to make this a discussion of Democrats vs Republicans.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t even know what the conversations were about.  Somebody does though since it was recorded, and since that recording hasn&#39;t mentioned anything nefarious, or anti US, I&#39;m going to assume that it doesn&#39;t contain it.

<p>We don&#39;t know what he talked about, but he changed his story and that means he was lying.  That means he had motivation to lie, which indicates he did something wrong.  The only thing he could have done wrong is betray his country for personal gain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.  He lied to Pence.  But maybe not because of WHAT he discussed, but probably just the fact that he did talk about something, when he shouldn&#39;t have yet.  If he just would have waited a little while, then we wouldn&#39;t even be having this discussion.  So, maybe he was a little too eager.  The fact that the mainstream media isn&#39;t focusing on WHAT was discussed, bet WHEN, is pretty telling.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know what he talked about. When he talked to them is the basis of his lie, and it&#39;s also the foundation of speculation because we can look at what topics were most important to Russia at the time.</p>

<p>When he spoke, and that he lied, are the basis for the suspicion here.  And as <em>likely as it seems to me</em> that he was taking payments or worried about blackmail, I recognize that it wouldn&#39;t be great journalism to publicly speculate on that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We, you and I, don&#39;t know what was discussed, but there are people that do.  And the fact that that isn&#39;t what is being outraged about, is telling to me that there is nothing in the context to be outraged about.  Is it suspicious?  Sure.  And if you&#39;re of the mindset that Flynn is dangerous and Anti-US because he&#39;s a Trump nominee, like you, then I suppose it is more than suspicious.  I wasn&#39;t trying to bring partisanship into this.  That&#39;s why I asked you WHY you felt that Flynn was Anti-US.   You didn&#39;t have an answer, so I assumed it was solely because he was a Trump nominee and Trump is a nazi rhetoric, that the left is crying about.</p>

<p>Not that it matters, but I voted for Gary Johnson and I view both parties as equally guilty of ruining this country.  It is in both parties interest to keep the country divided. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. Guys. There&#39;s been a conspiracy going around for the past several years that there is a 100+ nation alliance working together to defeat the globalist cabal that is full of psychopaths and pedophiles. For a while now, it was believed that Russia and positive factions in our own military were spearheading this alliance against the cabal. That&#39;s why so many people on conspiracy had soooomeeee hope for the Trump Administration, because these positive military factions apparently supported him. Now, this whole Michael Flynn thing actually could be the cabal winning this battle (but they haven&#39;t won the war). And to think Hillary just retweeted something about Flynn and Comet Pizza. Its as if they are now rubbing it in our faces saying, &quot;Haha! Beat you this time, conspiracy fuckers!&quot; Or perhaps we are all wrong, and Trump really is the next Hitler, and Russia has been working through him to &quot;undermine&quot; the U.S. (just like the mainstream, normie news wants us to think). </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5txzbc/michael_flynn_resigns_trumps_national_security/ddpxynb/">here&#39;s what I wrote in the /r/all thread</a>, but many people didn&#39;t see it because it got downvoted to -10 minutes after posting (before the thread even hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my theory:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flynn told Russia &quot;look, Obama is going to be a dick and a half to you for the last few weeks of his Presidency, but don&#39;t worry, things&#39;ll be different once we get in office, promise; unlike Some People, we don&#39;t actually want to go to war with you, lol&quot;</li>
<li>media calls Flynn out for having &quot;negotiated with&quot; Russia before Trump was inaugurated, while Flynn was still a private citizen (technically illegal)

<ul>
<li>this fits right into their &quot;Trump is a Manchurian Candidate for Putin and Russia&quot;/&quot;Red Scare 2.0&quot;/&quot;Russia has blackmail on Trump involving pee&quot;/&quot;Russia &#39;hacked&#39; &#39;the election&#39;&quot; schizophrenic, desperate narrative</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Flynn, a true patriot, takes the fall for the whole thing, and recuses himself from his position

<ul>
<li>this helps Trump out in the long run because now Trump has definitively, literally &quot;taken action&quot; against &quot;possible Russian collusion in the White House&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Twitter and other anti-Trump spaces are too busy gloating over this &quot;victory&quot;, not seeing that Trump &quot;gained ground&quot; here

<ul>
<li>future &quot;Trump/Russia collusion&quot; subnarratives are going to be harder to sell after this, without explaining the whole Flynn thing somehow—if Trump is really Secretly Controlled By Putin, and Flynn was Fraternizing With The Russians Before The Inauguration, then why did Flynn resign, instead of continuing to collude with Russia to transform the United States into a neo-Nazi white nationalist racist sexist homophobic transphobic Islamophobic patriarchal utopia?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>would be happy to be proven wrong with sources!</p>

<p>nobody proved any of it wrong, I was just told my theory was wrong and I was &quot;delusional&quot;.</p>

<p>after looking into things more, I also see the possibility of this at least partially being a political play by the Trump team to sniff out the moles in their ranks. <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/831510532318429184">Trump&#39;s latest tweet</a> seems to corroborate this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree on some parts. The Russian connection is tough to pull together coherently while making Trump to seem like he&#39;s 100% a Manchurian Candidate. I think it&#39;s an empty conspiracy for now.</p>

<p>However, I do not think Trump gained any ground nor can this be spun as a positive for Flynn or any member of the administration. The problem is timing. It&#39;s been two months since the December leak about Flynn&#39;s phone call and the intended loosening on sanctions with Russia. The press and D.C. have been discussing this for a while. Axing Flynn or letting him fall on a sacrificial sword for the administration just makes the whole situation look really, really bad when it&#39;s a delayed response to an ignored controversy. No one is feeling sorry for Flynn being a &quot;true patriot&quot; about that phone call, which he shouldn&#39;t have had in the first place nor lied to Pence about knowing the details.</p>

<p>The timing thing, and really only that, falls on Trump&#39;s lap. Why didn&#39;t Flynn get axed sooner to clean up the Russian conspiracy angle besides the White House&#39;s innate stubbornness? The intelligence leak confirming the Flynn phone call didn&#39;t change anything besides confirming what we already knew. It&#39;s just an awkward mess now that the press gets to captilize on. It&#39;s not a victory for either side and only serves to spread doubt on other administration members who also have their own ignored controversy with delayed responses hanging over their heads e.g. Tillerson, Sessions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what I don&#39;t understand. First, let&#39;s assume the following is true:</p>

<p>A) The DNC leaks were insider leaks and not a Russian hack</p>

<p>B) The Podesta leaks were a result of a fishing campaign that was not Russian sponsored</p>

<p>C) The Steele Dossier was based on unverified claims</p>

<p>D) The Democratic party and the MSM blitz-pumped the Russian narrative (both hacking and dossier) as a smear campaign post-election</p>

<p>E) Part of the smear campaign was to increase sanctions as a result of hacking (that for the purpose of this argument, we are assuming is not true)</p>

<p>F) Steele and Russia both know the above is true so they had a conversation to the extent of OPs post</p>

<p>So, assuming that the Trump admin and supporters would be comfortable in the above being true, why on earth would:</p>

<p>1) Flynn lie to Pence about it</p>

<p>2) The Trump admin not make the above rationalization public long ago</p>

<p>3) Why resign given the above rationalization</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume you meant &quot;Flynn&quot; to begun &quot;F)&quot;</p>

<p>Three good questions. I&#39;d say, 1) the call was so innocuous it genuinely didn&#39;t seem like an in depth discussion of sanctions to Flynn, ie he really didn&#39;t recall</p>

<p>2) The Trump administration <em>has</em> been adamant on all points A-D</p>

<p>3) Pence said something that was technically not correct, can&#39;t leave him hanging like that.  Trump has Flynns phone number, he can pick his brain any time, no big loss to let him go as long as a globalist doesn&#39;t get the job</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been said that Flynn was merely &quot;moved&quot; to an intelligence agency called the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) and that they requested that, henceforth, Russia route any national security matters through the INR and not the NSC. So Flynn is still active, just not publicly the National Security Advisor.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t like Trump.</p>

<p>It embarrasses the administration and continues the fervor that has started.  It removes a person who was very anti-war with Syria.</p>

<p>The American war machine rolls on towards world destruction with this move.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a camp in the US government, and it&#39;s branches that want to work with Russia and possibly China too, and then you have a camp that wants a hard line against Russia and China. And those that want this hard line against Russia to accuse those that want to work with Russia as being &quot;controlled&quot; or &#39;bought&#39; or &#39;blackmailed,&#39; a bunch of BS.  What we&#39;re seeing is a lot of people believe that BS and adopting whatever US foreign policy some are advocating.  It&#39;s masked behind support for this or that candidate, like Hillary for example. She was anti-Russia or anti-Putin, and her followers are also anti-Putin because she was. And you have these fake stories to get people behind her foreign policy, (&quot;DNC hacked&quot; etc.), and many followers go along clueless as to what the hell is going on. I&#39;m not pro-Trump or Pro-Hillary.  It&#39;s all one big circus. </p>
