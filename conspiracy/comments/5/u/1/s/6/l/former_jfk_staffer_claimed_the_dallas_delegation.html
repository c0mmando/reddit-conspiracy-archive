        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s silly, but I remember last year in an Episode of &quot;Antiques RoadShow&quot; they featured memorabilia from Sue Mortenson, a former &amp; close JFK staff member. She said, in the original episode, when asked about the flight back to Washington after the assassination &quot;Honestly, they seemed quite happy&quot; with a sort of grim look on her face.</p>

<p>Today, I went back to look at it again to link it elsewhere and...PBS removed that segment of the interview. </p>

<p>But, if you look in the comments below you can still see the responses:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/stories/articles/2016/01/11/john-f-kennedy-documents-interview">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/stories/articles/2016/01/11/john-f-kennedy-documents-interview</a></p>

<p>Kind of odd....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just in case they get deleted, here are some responses from when the video was originally posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was shocked when Ms. Mortensen Vogelsinger made the statement that some of the Dallas delegation was happy about the events of the day (Nov. 22,1963 )</p>

<p>Just watched this broadcast, just going off with the quick showings at the end.... ummm, This lady mentioned something interesting about how she flew back from Dallas on the backup plane to Air Force One with the Texas delegation and some of them seemed pleased with Johnson now in the White House..hmmm Like Texas Congressman Albert Thomas winking at a smiling LBJ just after he is sworn in on AF one.... Oswald did the shooting but maybe someone put him up to it....</p>

<p>Her comment about the Texas delegation seemingly &quot;happy&quot; after the tragic event that had just occurred is an insult to the state of Texas and to Lyndon Johnson. No one was &quot;happy&quot; that horrible day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it possible that the Dallas Delegation comments were on the televised show and not the clip posted to the website?</p>

<p>If not, it is rather interesting that they would edit that out after the fact...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure it was there last time I visited that URL. I know in my search options it showed I&#39;ve been there before but that part of the video was gone. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what episode it was but I&#39;d like to see if it&#39;s still in the episode. </p>

<p>I figure if it&#39;s in the comments under the vid it was there, but I also remember there being a transcript of the interview too. </p>
