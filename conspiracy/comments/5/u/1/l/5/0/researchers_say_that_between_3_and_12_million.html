        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Eminent researchers in the field of psychopathy describe someone with the condition as unable to generate and process positive emotions, and strongly driven by their negative desires. Studies have shown that they will go out of their way to inflict discomfort on others, even at the cost of their own time and resources.</p>

<p>These &quot;psychopathic others&quot; recognize their condition at a young age and learn to mask it. A key piece of the puzzle is that they are able to recognize their condition in others, allowing them to network and collude for a common goal. Psychopaths have been at the helm of three letter agencies and financial institutions since their inception and actively work towards causing suffering around the world, because it makes them feel good.</p>

<p>This explains:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>child abuse rings in government/military/private sector protected by police/FBI/CIA</p></li>
<li><p>Mind control, the mastering of hypnosis and propaganda</p></li>
<li><p>Starting wars for profit</p></li>
<li><p>Deceiving the world into a debt based monetary system with a secret cabal behind global money creation</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;One Party State&quot;, where supposedly different ideologies and teams are working together for a secret goal</p></li>
<li><p>the vast network of occult organizations that shadow the surface level power structures</p></li>
<li><p>False flag terror attacks to promote an agenda</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And how all of the above can be organized and executed in secret.</p>

<p>Mass awareness of psychopathy could bring down the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think greed. CS Lewis summed it up well: &quot;Greed will certainly make a man want 
money, for the sake of a better house, better holidays, better 
things to eat and drink. But only up to a point. What is it that 
makes a man with 10,000 pounds a year anxious to get 20,000 
a year? It is not the greed for more pleasure. 10,000 pounds 
will give all the luxuries that any man can really enjoy. It is 
Pride ‚Äì the wish to be richer than some other rich man, and 
(still more) the wish for power. For, of course, power is what 
Pride really enjoys: there is nothing makes a man feel so 
superior to others as being able to move them about like toy 
soldiers. Pride is competitive by its very nature: that is why it 
goes on and on. If I am a proud man, then, as long as there is 
one man in the whole world more powerful, or richer, or 
cleverer than I, he is my rival and my enemy&quot;</p>

<p>Also you are 100% right.  Here is what the Inuits had to say on the matter:</p>

<pre><code>In a 1976 study anthropologist Jane M. Murphy, then at Harvard University, found that an isolated group of Yupik-speaking Inuits near the Bering Strait had a term (kunlangeta) they used to describe ‚Äúa man who ‚Ä¶ repeatedly lies and cheats and steals things and ‚Ä¶ takes sexual advantage of many women‚Äîsomeone who does not pay attention to reprimands and who is always being brought to the elders for punishment.‚Äù When Murphy asked an Inuit what the group would typically do with a kunlangeta, he replied, ‚ÄúSomebody would have pushed him off the ice when nobody else was looking.‚Äù

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll have to research those links provided in this thread about that doctor and psychopathy. Psychopathy itself, the illegal stuff some do being separate from that, is always an interesting topic.</p>

<p>I still think psychopathy is not fully understood because the actual high level ones will never allow themselves to be studied. It could also just be human nature and some people just truly don&#39;t care while others have been successfully molded to work together to function in society ignoring their true nature. </p>

<p>The ones you see out there IRL or elsewhere calling themselves one are either extremely low level or just want to be one. That, I believe, dilutes the studies on it.</p>

<p>this is exactly right. All of the psychopaths the doctors studied have been &quot;unsuccesful psychopaths&quot; in that they couldnt handle or mask their urges. Successful psychopaths are more intelligent and skilled, and have the highest position on the food chain</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you :) I worked in the autism community, in a school and privately, until October of last year when I moved to Peru with my wife. </p>

<p>I had some powerful life changing experiences during that time. </p>

<p>Thanks for the information on the Inuit. It fits right in, a very interesting anecdote.</p>
