    <div class="md"><p>Google &quot;world debt&quot; and you will see it is about $200 trillion.
Google &quot;world money supply&quot; and you will see it is about $60 trillion.</p>

<p>How can anyone owe money that doesn&#39;t exist? Who is that debt owed to? This is the basic premise of the NWO/bankers. When you are indebted to someone, they own you. If most nations are indebted to the banking families, who really owns the nations?</p>

<p>Side note: I have read that $500 trillion number as well but not much I can find to back it up, it is probably made up. I am sticking with &quot;google-able&quot; facts as you prefer. If I were to guess where they come up with that number, maybe if you factor in all the stolen gold (US, Libya, etc), shadow money (money printed but not officially put into circulation), fractional reserve banking, etc, there is &quot;wealth&quot; that wouldn&#39;t show in a google search.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of bullshit like random triangles and hand symbols but there is also a lot of undeniable evidence. Take a look at this quote for one... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some even believe we [Rockefeller family] are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - One World, if you will. If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it - <strong>David Rockefeller</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I wasn&#39;t convinced on the devil worshipping stuff until Pizzagate. There&#39;s some nasty stuff going on behind the scenes. And since you seem to care about degrees, I also graduated from college. Degrees don&#39;t make you intellectually superior to conspiracy theorists type folks. Take a look at how foolish so called educated liberals have been acting for the past few months. Totally disgraceful. </p>

<p>But... If you can spare the time... Money Masters is a good documentary that talks about the history of money in the last few hundred years, with an emphasis on the Rothschhilds and central banking.  It&#39;s 3.5 hours...  Ring of Power is another great one to watch, but it&#39;s ~5 hours.  I doubt you&#39;re interested enough to watch either.  Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick is more focused on American history, and is a couple hours or so.</p>

<p>This documentary is about water, in it you will also find collaboration with banks and corporations and governments and the federal reserve to monopolize water and other industries, among its main message.</p>

<p>I would love to teach you exactly why the world is a fucked up place owned by bankers and controlled by a shadow government but you have to reasearch and connect the dots yourself. I don&#39;t care if you get &quot;red-pilled&quot; or not. Don&#39;t make others do your reasearch if you really want to be intelligent or enlightened. I hope you have a great day.</p>

Throughout history one can see these agendas playing out with real legislation and real consequences . The COUncil on Foreign relations is great place to start your research.

It&#39;s use and the connotations that follow are part of a control system that keeps most from accepting the truth that this country has been used against the best interests of Americans to propel these agendas.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take them one by one:</p>

<ul>
<li>NWO is a psyop by the Old World Order to subject us to <strong>fear</strong>, the only instrument of control they have left.</li>
<li>The Jewish bankers &#39;conspiracy&#39; is not a conspiracy. Christianity outlawed usury, so only Jews could charge interest and thus came to rule all the banks throughout Europe. This began under monarchies and obviously, the banks&#39; power within the state only increased once the era of monarchies was ended.</li>
<li>The illuminati is not much of a conspiracy either. It was a real secret society, and has a wikipedia page. The actual conspiracy, which I hold to be true, is that the illuminati was a psyop carried out by American revolutionaries to win the American Revolution.
George Washington and co., notorious for their spying skills, started up the illuminati and told the British Crown and masonic orders which were TPTB that the illuminati held the basic principle: &quot;the peasants will produce more under the illusion of democracy and freedom.&quot; So the British &#39;threw the fight&#39; and only found out later that the illuminati wasn&#39;t what it claimed to be. So rather than any more land squabbles all they could do was make sure our land was under the rule of their banks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two are facts, the last one is more conjecture.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to learn more I suggest reading this: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/lar/2017/4405reprnt_end_londn_emp.html#footnote-139379-1">http://www.larouchepub.com/lar/2017/4405reprnt_end_londn_emp.html#footnote-139379-1</a></p>

<p>It traces the Old World Order from Rome to the present day, employing its &#39;monetary system&#39; to rule the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, of course there are non-Jewish bankers. But up until very recently most of the banks were in the hands of Jews. One could even argue that under the Rothschilds, the primary banking house of the British empire, this is still how it is today.</p>

<p>Even JP Morgan was under the thumb of the Rothschilds. </p>

<p>I myself am Jewish, and obviously do not seek to slander the Jewish people. It is just a historical fact that the banking system was handed over to Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You summed it up very well.</p>

<p>The first point especially becomes so obvious once you really think about the claims made. The things we typically fear from the NWO – slavery, no freedom of choice, arbitrary law enforcement, democide, severely stifled prosperity – are really only extreme forms of what we have had problems with for centuries. This vision of how bad things could become in the future make us placidly accept the current state of things.</p>

<p>A truly New World Order would dispense with all this unnecessary bullshit. In a truly New World Order we would rebuild and expand our public infrastructure, we would encourage all forms of reasonable business, art, and exploration. We would build space elevators, terraform planets and reconnect with ourselves, the universe and each other. Maybe I&#39;m a dreamer, but I&#39;m not the only one... You know how it all goes.</p>

<p>We should embrace and strive for that kind of a NWO, instead of settling for the fact that while the world may be burning, we still get to have fucking iPhones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too think they are pretty bullshit in the sense that the versions of these things you usually see are disinformation, outright fiction, the ravings of lunatics, etc.  OTOH these stories didn&#39;t come from nowhere and there is a grain of truth in there somewhere. But I suspect reality is more mundane — and these outrageous versions of the story exist to make you doubt the possibility of the more mundane but sadly real versions.  </p>

<p>Somehow I doubt there is one room in one super-bunker somewhere with thirteen dudes smoking cigars ruling the entire world all by their lonesome. But I don&#39;t doubt the existence of various large-scale cabals of elite power players, most of whom are at least highly amoral if not evil, many of whom have questionable globalist aspirations, and some of whom may happen to call themselves enlightened.  This stew of globalist fuckers includes people at the top of the banking system/s, many of whom may happen to be Jewish, but that&#39;s incidental; rich and powerful people from all backgrounds can be involved in these circles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.   </p>

<p>Try thinking about the implications of &quot;huge influence&quot; of longstanding international criminal cabals.  Even if most of the shit you see about &quot;muh Illuminati&quot; is utter bullshit, any amount of it being grounded in reality is concerning.  That there is an organized effort to muddy the waters surrounding these topics, I also find concerning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NWO was coined by the british east india company.</p>

<p>the order part came from the fact that they were talking literally about their plan/goal to supplant the crown through the militarization of the new world economic mercantilist model and create a new order of power, as opposed to the OWO of kings and landed aristocrats.</p>

<p>new world part was referring to the new world, i.e. the americas, in particular the proto-venture capitalist colonial charter system. </p>

<p>with the exception of PA and RI and NC/SC, every single colony, including the pligrims were money seeking enterprises. the colonists were expected to provide ROI,  as well as service their &quot;start up capital&quot; loans, or be refused further infusions of crucial supplies.</p>

<p>in the 17th and 18th centuries the BEIC was the most powerful force in the world. they had both a standing army and a standing navy. they were the the &quot;great&quot; in great britain. it wasnt the crown that conquerred india and china, or created america, it was the BEIC. </p>

<p>in fact our flag was their battle flag and had flown over every colony from the 1600s unaltered until the 1790s when the union jack in the corner was replaced by stars on a field of blue due to hostilities that became the war of 1812. george washington marched under it. his soldiers dressed in the navy blue coats if the BEIC&#39;s regulars.</p>

<p>even the tea party was the direct result of the BEIC. they forced parliment to pass the tea act so that they could unload the surplus tea roting in their london warehouses. the tea act, as the colonists well knew, was to force them to buy their tea from one monopolistic source as opposed to being able to shop for the best price.</p>

<p>the various illuminati groups started as under the table political clubs, where treason could be plotted in secret to over through the IWO. ergo need for a secret society with elaborate initiation rituals to catch spies. </p>

<p>as time wore on, their original purpose became moot, but instead of disbanding, the societies morphed into bizarre, debauched, occult clubs deliniating the whose whos from the whose nots, the power brokers from the hangers on, just as the iron law of organizations predicts would happen. </p>

<p>they still plotted, but now about undermining democracy and the power of the common man. the collapse of the BEIC began in 1857, and it had already jettisoned the US by that time to focus exclusively on india. </p>

<p>this period between 1830 and 1850 saw the rise of populist, anti-capitalist, anti-i dustrialist, anti-banking sentiment in america, exemplified by the granting of the truly revolutionary right of universal male suffrage divorced from property ownership. this period also saw the birth of the backlash to capitalism and wage slavery. the communist nanifesto is published in 1848.</p>

<p>the new NWO were those who inherited the power of the BEIC--the jp morgans, the carnegies, the vanderbekts, the rockerfellars. but now NWO moniker had become somewhat meaningless, not unlike hillary clinton&#39;s use of mussolini&#39;s campaign slogan, &quot;stronger together.&quot; facist comes from the katin word for bundle of sticks, faces, and as everyone knows a bundle of sticks is stronger than a single stick).</p>

<p>the new NWO&#39;s goal was to capture legislatures and politicians and turn democracy into a facade (they succeeded). the 1880s saw the beginni g of the populist party and the referendum/initiative push to defend democracy from the robber barrons, the illuminati of the new NWO.</p>

<p>by the 1930s, the newer NWO, exemplified by prescot bush, became dedicated to global, totalitarian facism (in the true sense, as defined by mussolini--the union if the complete power of the stare, with the comp,ete power of the corpoeation, i.e. corporatism. mussolini himself corrected people about the word &quot;facism.&quot; facism was the name of his political party, just as NAZI was the name of hitler&#39;s, but both were corporatists. </p>

<p>finally. the newest of the NWO manisfestations--global neoliberal, inverted totalitarianism. they had to invert it, i.e. hide it behind the smiling face of consumerism, because the little folk had just faught a war against two brutal, openly totalitarian states, and were in a cold war with another. global neoliberal inverted totalitarianism is a defacto one world govt--george carlin&#39;s big club that you ain&#39;t in. </p>

<p>one source of confusion has always been that the &quot;rightwing&quot; CTers, don&#39;t know that &quot;liberal&quot; here refers to the true, classic definition of liberalism as an economic philosophy, as does &quot;neoliberal,&quot; which is liberal economics on meth. they think, like most americans that it means &quot;leftwing/communist.&quot; it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>the secret societies still exist, the iron law of organistions and all that. they are still plotting against and subverting democracy (and succeeding). they do things that range from silly mumbo jumbo to horrific acts, because it makes them feel special, reinforcing their narcissitic certainty that they are above the law, with the added bonus of providing a way for them to silence those who react in disgust to the higher level practices of the club. also, most people who seek and attain power are sociopaths and sociopaths are monsters.</p>

<p>the BEIC, robber barrons, and davosers could not have existed initially with out jewish bankers, because lending money was a heretical sin in the catholic church subject to being burned at the stake, along side witches. </p>

<p>they themselves eventially evolved into bankers through the protestant revolution, which declared money lending and ursury perfectly legitimate. however, as the first to market rule predicts, those original jewish bankers who were smart enough to team up with the BEIC and the dutch east india company in the 1600s, established themselves as the coca colas and googles of their industry, then the the iron law of organizations kicked in and they went and go to any lengths to protect their hegemony and existance. as did the BEIC, the robber barons, and the davosers.</p>

<p>the biggest flaw in the CT community is that the various factions are each only aware the one part of the elephant they are touching. they don&#39;t synthesize...plus a lot have a poor grasp of history.</p>

If you know the basis of the theory, do some research and ask yourself. And I don&#39;t just mean read on the Internet using &quot;allnewspipeline.com&quot; or &quot;abovetopsecret.com&quot;, I mean read some actual fucking books written by people involved with the conspiracy. Best place to start is &quot;Propaganda&quot; written by Edward Bernays in the 1920&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google &quot;world debt&quot; and you will see it is about $200 trillion.
Google &quot;world money supply&quot; and you will see it is about $60 trillion.</p>

<p>How can anyone owe money that doesn&#39;t exist? Who is that debt owed to? This is the basic premise of the NWO/bankers. When you are indebted to someone, they own you. If most nations are indebted to the banking families, who really owns the nations?</p>

<p>How come the USA doesn&#39;t abandon the Federal Reserve and print its own money? That is what JFK attempted to do 1 month before being assassinated.</p>

<p>If we printed our own money then we wouldn&#39;t have to pay interest to a private bank. Surely if the people recognized this then we would print our own money. How come the media doesn&#39;t inform the people about this situation? Who is the media trying to protect? Who is the media trying to inform?</p>

<p>The fallout of a banking monopoly is a that a media monopoly is needed to keep it in place. If you give a mouse a cookie... In every major industry there is a consolidation of power, where companies continue to merge and get bought up. Think of a major industry, how many companies share the market? Who owns these companies?</p>

<p>It is impossible to summarize every single detail. There is a lot of history and moving parts to bring us to where we are today. If you are curious about the history of it over the last 300 years, Eustace Mullins sums it up well and is very informative
