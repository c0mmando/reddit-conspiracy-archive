    <div class="md"><p>Not to well adjusting people like us it isn&#39;t (I am choosing to assume you are nice;) but these people don&#39;t think like you or I. </p>

<p>OP, if you want to know more about why child abusers seek positions of power then you have to look at the psychology of the abuser and the reason so many are in positions of authority.</p>

<p>So many people have got this the wrong way around on this thread. The blackmail is there just as insurance. They are pedofiles before they are blackmailed.</p>

<p>Think about it. Unless you actually commit a crime (child abuse) on tape then they cant blackmail you. And unless you were a pedo there is zero percent chance you would do what these people do. We are not taking about a person that looks 18 but is really 15. Unfortunatly it is much more vile then that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(I&#39;ve posted this a few times, but it&#39;s appropriate here as well.)</p>

<p>My thoughts? It&#39;s their command &amp; control structure. Here are some ideas I&#39;ve compiled:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pedophiles/satanists can be controlled by blackmail. Get each of your minions on video raping and/or murdering a child, and it ensures that when you give an order, it will be carried out... <em>OR ELSE.</em></p></li>
<li><p>As a prerequisite initiation, it ensures your minions have no moral quams about carrying out your orders. Kill a family? No problem. Start a war? You got it, boss.</p></li>
<li><p>As an initiation, it ensures that no Good Guys will infiltrate your ranks and expose or disrupt the operation. Even IF you or I or some Good Guys grow some balls and want to infiltrate their ranks and get some dirt on them, if first you have to rape and murder a child... well shit I&#39;m out.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s a major perk for evil pedophile satanists. Just do what you&#39;re told, and you can rape, torture, and kill all the kiddies you want with zero repercussions. These sociopaths lust for nothing more than power. What is a greater expression of complete domination of another than rape, torture, and murder... of a child?</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s so over-the-top evil that even if it&#39;s exposed, nobody in the mainstream will believe it. You might as well try to tell people that zombie dolphins from the planet Zoltar have infiltrated the government.</p></li>
<li><p>Kills compassion for their fellow humans. If the rapist/torturer had some spark of goodness that might hold them back from executing tasks that most would consider to be pure evil, these rituals help destroy it. The <a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/2016/08/09/cremation-of-care-ceremony-at-the-bohemian-grove/">Cremation of Care</a> ceremony comes to mind.</p></li>
<li><p>This sounds pretty out there, but folks such as Max Spiers, David Wilcock, and David Icke talk about interdimensional entities feeding on &quot;loosh&quot; or negative energy during these sessions. edit: I added this because I keep seeing it come up. Maybe complete bullshit disinfo, or maybe the most important item here. I have no direct experience in this area.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a structure as old as Rome. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2lrdqa/til_the_words_fascist_and_faggot_both_derive_from/">Both &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;fascist&quot; derive from the Latin root Fasces.</a> (Hang with me here.) Faggot refers to the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fasces&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;biw=1212&amp;amp;bih=553&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch">bundle of sticks used as a symbol of fascism</a>. I posit that when people realized the child abuse inherent in the system, it became a slur for the fascists themselves.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I further posit that child rape was no more acceptable in ancient Rome than it is now. This was not a normal relationship in another culture, as it&#39;s presented today. When the fascists were caught raping children, they were burned. Stories of these executions have been replaced by stories of burning non-pedophile homosexuals in order to demonize the practice.</p>

<p>Similarly, the term &quot;faggot&quot; has since been linguistically morphed into a pejorative for non-pedophile homosexuals, in an effort to obfuscate <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/12/20/very-very-bad-things/">the satanic command/control structure of child rape and torture</a> that&#39;s still in place by the global fascists today.</p>

<p>Fascists are hiding behind homosexuals just as Khazarians hide behind the Jews -- and yes there&#39;s overlap -- using them as human shields to absorb blame and deflect suspicion and as political tools where useful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because we humans can&#39;t stand the absence of a challenge. When a person is super rich, nothing legal is a challenge to acquire, nor are illegal things. Challenging one&#39;s person – e.g., writing a poem – isn&#39;t satisfying in this regard. The challenge needs to be <em>existential</em> – life or death – to be truly engaging. So, they need to do something that&#39;s genuinely dangerous, even for a billionaire.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t seek to dominate children sexually because they are &#39;easy prey&#39;. This doesn&#39;t make sense. It&#39;s not the thrill of dominating a child, but the thrill of dominating <em>humanity</em> by succeeding in defying its collective will.</p>

<p>Rather, they choose this activity because they know that if they fail and are found out, their money might not save them. Oh, they&#39;re prepared for the battle, and they&#39;ll fight, but they can&#39;t be sure they&#39;ll win. They&#39;re so powerful now that their enemy must be humanity itself, or where&#39;s the challenge?</p>

<p>This, I think, is why pizzagate etc. seems so weird. Surely, we think, it&#39;s possible even for the thickest schemer to keep the lid on something like this better than this, right? They&#39;re like the dumbest, sloppiest pedo network to date. If they hadn&#39;t their connections, it would have all been over years ago.</p>

<p>They want the risk.</p>

<p>They want us to find out, and to fight them, in order to make life interesting. For real, I believe the elite would rather die fighting &#39;valiantly&#39; for their lives against a humanity enraged than endure the twilight existence of a challenge-free omnipotence.</p>

<p>The more we allow it, the more they get away with it, the more egregious it will become. They want a war with us, you see. Everyone needs a war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Centuries - since the dawn of man, i reckon.   I think life is cyclical - these bad people infiltrate everything overtime, and it eventually brings the whole system crashing down - then a resistance of good people rise up, kill most of the bad people, and rebuild a new kingdom; and then once again, bad people slowly infiltrate over a long time period and it comes crashing down again - this is the story of the Bible, in my opinion; it has nothing to do with Creation, in the sense that we think or imagine it</p>
