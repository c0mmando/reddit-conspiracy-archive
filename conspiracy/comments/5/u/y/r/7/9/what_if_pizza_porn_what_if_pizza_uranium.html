       What if the "pizza" keyword were about moving the funds for the uranium Hillary sold... Is there a money trail to the clinton foundation from Russia?

       Explain why this isn't it, because human trafficking hasn't produced any evidence that doesn't come with the qualifier "circumstantial".

       So if you only look at emails with the keyword pizza and substitute uranium or money or stock for pizza, what trail does that leave?

       Well, viewing WikiLeaks is legal despite what MSM claims, and I've never gotten a virus from them, so I'd start there. Alternatively you can view it through Archive.is, I imagine. There may also be torrents available, but I don't trust those since they bypass Tor.

       Alefantis is a gay pizza chef who runs a family resturaunt that hosts punk concerts after 10 or 11 some nights. Dave and Busters kicks all the kids out for fight nights, but they're still "kid friendly".
      </p>
      <p>
       His instagram picks aren't that creepy, nor is the artwork. His mom lives in a big house in DC he did some renovations on and the house has a widows walk and overlooks a park.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things all seem normal to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If pizza is sometimes food and sometimes something else, alefantis is coincidental in getting trapped up in podestas coded emails.

       Actually Titus frost hacked the cpp website and found child porn through a backdoor login. He turned it over to police but was told because it was obtained illegally they couldn't use it. So actually it is all 100% true. He made a YouTube video about it. While he meant well Titus may have actually screwed up the whole thing.

       I'm not saying any of it is right or truthful, I'm still hoping it's not but this is a good introduction that only lays out facts that connect and none of those have lined up with drugs or uranium or actually just fucking food lol. So I'm not saying OMG WATCH THIS NOW, just that there's a reason so many people are convinced this is the explanation, not that we're not open to others.

       I don't buy the art argument. Yes, other work by those artists have pedophile tones to them, but the ones podesta owns are tame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comet pizza holds their concerts after 10 PM. If you are a parent bringing your child to a "Heavy Breaathing" concert after 10PM, you're a shitty parent. That doesn't make the establishment at fault. Game stop has adult themed games all day long and children are their target market.

       Yep, 100% this. I have tried, on this sub and among pg8-obsessed rl friends, to bring this up AMD am usually straight up ignored. I'm not saying people in power don't abuse it, nor am I saying that trafficking and harming children doesn't happen, I'm just saying that their evidence is on par with a 1980s Chick tract about demon rock n' roll.

       I actually hope it's something else and a lot of people
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       been trying to come up with a less disgusting explanation, it just hasn't connected like that yet and the ridiculous amount of connections to kids and human trafficking have. So I mean, if you want to find an alternative go for it. It's not just about the emails, that was just a weird connection.

       It could very well be uranium, drugs, other weapons, children, or anything else super immoral.

       Explain why this isn't it, because human trafficking hasn't produced any evidence that doesn't come with the qualifier "circumstantial".

       So if you only look at emails with the keyword pizza and substitute uranium or money or stock for pizza, what trail does that leave?
