    <div class="md"><p>These photos are very very unusual. Especially for someone rated #49th most powerful person in Washington. What&#39;s a pizza shop owner doing that makes him so powerful?</p>

<p>Why did he have all these following sketchy images on his public Instagram that paints a very odd picture of him. Why should we not ask him these questions? Why should we just shut up and assume all is well after looking at these following images? Where&#39;s the logic in that? That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking you these questions, because how can someone look at these photos and not want to know why he would do such a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that doesn&#39;t make for a healthy debate platform, and generally makes the sub look bad when people assume others are shills for not believing what some people say. It&#39;s turned into childish name calling at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless you can prove they are a shill and source their account history, it&#39;s not worth it. </p>

<p>Just debate their argument and prove them wrong. If they use fallacies, call them out. If they are winning the argument and you can&#39;t debate it, admit defeat. </p>

<p>Be humble and show humility. If you become an ass and spend your time looking for subverts, people are just going to detest the post and sub altogether. I don&#39;t want to read about shills.</p>

<p>They come in and fuck with the sub and then expect it to change for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You were warned by a mod because Rule 10 expressly prohibits users calling each other shills, because that word has become a meaningless insult (Rule 4) at this point.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the deal: If you can PROVE somebody you accuse of being a shill actually is a shill (ie paid to post disinfo) the mods would willingly overlook Rule 10. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling people shills, even if they actually are, does nothing but create a hostile sub.</p>

<p>If the person&#39;s a shill, they&#39;re going to continue shilling unless there&#39;s concrete evidence the mods can use to ban the user.</p>

<p>If the person isn&#39;t a shill, calling them a shill does nothing but insults them and makes it seem that no opinions are welcome but those that agree with your own. </p>
