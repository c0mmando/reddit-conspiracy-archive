       These photos are very very unusual. Especially for someone rated #49th most powerful person in Washington. What's a pizza shop owner doing that makes him so powerful?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did he have all these following sketchy images on his public Instagram that paints a very odd picture of him. Why should we not ask him these questions? Why should we just shut up and assume all is well after looking at these following images? Where's the logic in that? That's why I'm asking you these questions, because how can someone look at these photos and not want to know why he would do such a thing.

       look at the words you are using...destroy the sub we are already "truly" fucked.... so its like wake the fuck up.... it does not "need" to be this mentality that there is only one opinion but that there is a higher being, collective consciousness whatever it be, talking to "us" I guess? the voice inside "everyones" head is so activated and triggered that "we all want to be heard" its such a loud cry of "what the fuck is going on"

       Someone asked why things like Bowling Green are covered up, and he responded "because it's fake" and was downvoted. There's no evidence to support a Bowling Green massacre happened. Why was he downvoted? Does saying it's fake because there's no evidence make him a shill?

       I absolutely agree and don't think anyone should be limited to specific news sources, but I've seen recently that questionable news sources are taken as outright truth and used to prove someone's argument. Nothing really that can be done about that since banning certain news sources would be stupid.

       Nope. CTR doesn't exist anymore. Their webpage is deleted. Shills we see today are not CTR.

       Unless you can prove they are a shill and source their account history, it's not worth it.

       Just debate their argument and prove them wrong. If they use fallacies, call them out. If they are winning the argument and you can't debate it, admit defeat.

       You were warned by a mod because Rule 10 expressly prohibits users calling each other shills, because that word has become a meaningless insult (Rule 4) at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the deal: If you can PROVE somebody you accuse of being a shill actually is a shill (ie paid to post disinfo) the mods would willingly overlook Rule 10.

       Calling people shills, even if they actually are, does nothing but create a hostile sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the person's a shill, they're going to continue shilling unless there's concrete evidence the mods can use to ban the user.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the person isn't a shill, calling them a shill does nothing but insults them and makes it seem that no opinions are welcome but those that agree with your own.

       CTR or mediablue whatever they're calling themselves start popping up around 9pm eastern time i've noticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       they'll pick a thread and hijack it with "blah blah blah isn't trump guilty of this as well?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they scour the subs around the early morning so that when the normies start using reddit around noon time, the ctr crap is front and center on subs.

       Or 9PM EST is when people in the US are winding down from work. Lots of people that work 9-5s aren't on Reddit during the day, so it's not surprising that activity would pick up at night once people have finished with work.

       I don't mind anyone disagreeing with me, but I've been called "fuckface", "dummy" and "Trump supporter " for criticizing Hillary. Can people disagree with facts instead of name-calling?

       Yep, the fact people in this sub are still pushing the idea of CTR shills despite this place being a Trump echo chamber that would make for sense for CA to fuck with rather that CTR is completely lost on them.
