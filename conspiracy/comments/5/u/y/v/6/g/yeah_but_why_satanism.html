I realize that this sub is inundated with Pizzagate shit, but I have a problem stemming from the Pizza/Satanism stuff.  Some of the most influential people in our gov&#39;t and throughout the world practice this, so there must be some truth to it, correct?  What is gained from the Satanism angle associated with this?  I find it hard to believe that they just practice it for fun, but maybe that&#39;s all it is.  Just bored rich sociopaths?  Then why all the symbolism and nods to Satanism if it&#39;s just a for-funsy thing?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is real. They are not just bored.</p>

<p>This is a cosmic situation. Light and dark. You don&#39;t need to be religious to understand it but you do need to be spiritually minded. We are talking about dimensional realities beyond our common &#39;senses&#39;.... ET&#39;s and Inter-dimensional beings, both positive and negative. We have been manipulated by negative forces for thousands of years and this is allowed to happen because of free will... because we allow this to happen.</p>

<p>These satanists are slaves to parasitic entities. The act of blood ritual and traumatic abuse is an energetic exchange for them. Most of these people are driven by uncontrollable urge, but the higher ups understand the larger context of hidden history.</p>

<p>We are expanding our consciousness to better understand all of this. The first step is letting go of some words and definitions as we know them... Quantum Physics is the science of Spirituality. ETs and IDs are angels and demons... Keep digging and more will be revealed as your consciousness is ready for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you said though I wish people wouldn&#39;t call it &quot;Satanism.&quot; Satan is controlled opposition or more precisely if there is a Satan then that implies there is a God. Nothing has fostered the belief in God more than belief in Satan and hell and demons. Satan is the &quot;sheep dog&quot; that keeps the sheep corralled on the farm. They are all controlled opposition. God and Satan are working together on the same team to keep humanity down in the muck. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/NatxDcH.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/NatxDcH.jpg</a> (Controlled opposition)</p>

<p>There are NO Gods. Are that exists are bunch of parasitic control freaks who like to pretend to be God and force humans to worship them. Our reality is completely upside down. Humans are the Gods of the this planet. We don&#39;t need these control freaks BUT they need us to co-create their reality.</p>

<p>People need to stop giving their power away and take their sovereignty back from the parasites. Humanity get off your knees and fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True &#39;satan&#39; is a red herring... The word satan is actually a title meaning &#39;to stand against&#39;. Its only a tool in the false religion control system... The so-called gods of Abrahamic-Mesopotamian religion/mythology (including the Old Testament) were extraterrestrial. And although many of these contributed to our current genetic physical makeup, they are not to be worshipped.</p>

<p>The God that Jesus and other ascended maters speak of is the Source of All... the Universe, the greater field of consciousness and everything in it, which Jesus embodied as &#39;oneness&#39; or absolute love. The negative groups co-opted these divine truths to make a system of fear, separation and moral contradiction.</p>

<p>All satanism and luciferianism relates to manipulation by demons/archons (or negative ETs) and a larger system that has been coordinated by a plasma-based being called &#39;Lucifer&#39; (Yaldaboath in Gnostic teachings). The Cabal-Illuminati groups recognize various individual demons by name, and a few negative ET groups as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can always tell who the REALLY woke people when they start talking about the Archons. Lucifer is not Yaldaboath, Yahweh is. </p>

<p>The God of Abraham in the old Testament is Yaldaboath. That is the sacred truth a lot of people can&#39;t handle. The big 3 religions Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all worship a plasma parasite called Yaldaboath or in the Gnostic teachings we simply call him the Demiurge. He is not a creator. He is the destroyer of worlds and a parasite. He is the God of plagues, the God of horrors, and the God of death yet humans worship this control freak. This worship must end if humans are ever to fully awaken to their true potential.</p>

<p>I do not really like the term ascended master either as it is a term created by the New age deception. New age is just another religion trying to trick humans into giving up their power and make us worship &quot;THEM.&quot; The source is not a god. The source is just a source from which all consciousness emanates. In essence YOU yes YOU are the source. The source is not to be worshiped and neither are the ascended masters to be worshiped either for the are NO masters. No soul is inherently better than another soul for all souls are fractals of the same source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It also has to be noted that some of these names have been reused multiple times by this &#39;entity&#39; or others. There were more than one &#39;RAs&#39; for example... the archetype of Satan was most likely based on the Sirian Set (egypt)/Hadad (sumeria) before later being co-opted by Yaldaboath.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about all the major religions worshipping this being, as it&#39;s the one one left, playing all the parts. It took over as Yahweh after those groups left the planet... This is actually what we&#39;re referring to as Yaldaboath - <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/australian-student-confirms-that-giant-plasma-tubes-are-floating-above-earth">http://www.sciencealert.com/australian-student-confirms-that-giant-plasma-tubes-are-floating-above-earth</a></p>

<p>In my understanding, one (or the first) of the Yahwehs was Enlil of the Anunnaki (7th density Sirian-Orions)... Enlil was also Zeus. And it was in their lineage, the house of Anu, that we have most of the Mesopotamian gods, a few Egyptian ones but not all... There were ETs that allowed themselves to be seen as gods, and the ones to whom it happened reluctantly (like the positive oriented Sirian or Pleiadians).</p>

<p>So I think we&#39;re in agreement, except for the labels. For what it&#39;s worth, my knowledge comes from a Pleiadian perspective. I am Pleiadian starseed myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think using many sources is best. Everybody has a piece of the truth. For a general understanding of Satanism, I&#39;d look at Mark Passio&#39;s work. Or Michael Tsarion...

<p>I do recognize that the human mind is capable of at least minor manefiststions, and that rituals are the easiest route for some. </p>

<p>I do not believe in Satan. I could <em>maybe</em> be a deist, but I firmly believe lovecraft had that one right, in that those things are unnameable, beyond humanity&#39;s normal perceptions. Hence my oppisition to religion, with its charlatans and con men, claiming to have touched the divine, while merely driving their own agendas and coffers. </p>

<p>Those claiming absolutes, be it knowledge, paths to salvation, or even simple power are forever the enemies of goodness and progress. I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s always multiple right answers, just that those who would block them are no friends to mankind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It used to be the focus of this sub. </p>

<p>Apologies for this sidetrack tangent that occurred whilst In This reply box. More of an audience/community one, than a directed personal post. </p>

<p>Honestly, there needs to be a shift to a non pizza specific, NON &quot;conspiracy&quot; sub for the pedophillia problem. As far as news of busts, etc are concerned. Even though I don&#39;t think I ever visited the sub, PG should have been migrated, NOT destroyed. </p>

<p>That made it a genuine, PC, liability, image , TYPICAL conspiracy. While I think there&#39;s LOTS of disinfo and false flags on that specific topic, I&#39;m all for actual pedo rings being shut down. However, I do differentiate between &quot;statutory &quot; type issues and prepubescent ones.
I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s ok for adults to bang teens, just that things like that and regular prostiution stings really need to not be linked to the depravity of buggering children. Cover ups are entirely valid here, but fighting pedos needs to be out from the shadows and legitimized, not linked to young flat inside out earth shooting the towers with chemtrails under the orders of satanic alien lizards. </p>

<p>I know people have tried, but I want to assure others that even some skeptics don&#39;t like the coverup aspects, and DO want justice and security for the victims. But the focus needs to be the children, not the symbology and occult speculation. </p>

<p>Stick to facts, don&#39;t assume motives, etc, and then go for traction. </p>

<p>While I&#39;m sure actuall really evil people would not disclose this to a normal person, I&#39;ve been in positions where it likely could have been brought up. I don&#39;t know a single Lucifarian satanist, beyond some dumb kids tagging pentagrams, etc. </p>

<p>Most real evil is done by insanity and lack of empathy, coupled with zealotizm. Yes, there&#39;s been cases of human sacrifice, etc, but it&#39;s damm rare, unless you anti justify it by saying other atrocities were FOR those reasons. But HATE is the reason, not demons, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The satanism angle comes from back when secret societies first started.  anyone who tried to prove anything with science not following the bible or its teaching was a heretic and was punished and slain. The secret societies started members shared information that they had found and read in olds books, especially facts they had found out about the universe and our existence. Aleister Crowley wrote a book about occultism, satanism and lots of dark thinks which i believe was information passed down from the earliest societies. Theres defiantly a good vs evil vibe on mother earth, and i think they believe by doing evil and following the teachings they can reap its rewards. From what our 2000 years on earth have told us is that they people have actually been top of the food chain too. maybe they&#39;re onto something with the good vs evil thing? But im starting to believe we have broken the mold and humanity before greed is on the rise. The awakening/turning point in humanities existence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m totally with you. I was a devout atheist....and I guess still am, but going down this rabbit hole has me believing in the unbelievable. I based my atheism on my research of history, but now ive come to realize how much of the history we&#39;ve been taught or able to learn is a whole lot of disinformation. So when I learned that these elites are actually satanists, I&#39;m like wtf. What am I missing? I&#39;m sure none of us know the actual truth yet, but the truth is unbelievable. 
My understanding thus far is that our ancient history is far more complex then we&#39;ve been led to believe and that these groups of elites have passed down secrets, rituals and traditions that carry a lot of knowledge, technology, etc. to each other. I heard Alex Jones podcast with Joe Rogan and did a bunch of research in the CIA document archive. I truly believe that we could be interdimensional beings and this world we live in is a ruse. There is not a God like we&#39;ve been lead to believe but a higher level of consciousness. So if it doesn&#39;t matter if we&#39;re bad or good to get to &quot;heaven&quot;, then the elites must have a separate set of morals and goals which we don&#39;t have the privilege to understand or become aware of. 
However, if all this is true then we&#39;re pretty much fucked. We&#39;ll be used as pawns until we&#39;re no longer useful and our society will be reset with the elites in power. (and most of the population wiped out). 
I don&#39;t even know if I can make sense to anyone else, or myself for that matter. All this is very deep, does it matter that we all become aware? Is there anything we can do to retain a comfortable and productive way of life? I don&#39;t know any answers. All I know is that my lifelong search for truth and understanding of existence has been shaken and I no longer feel like I have a grasp on anything. I&#39;m even seeking out and valuing information in the bible! It&#39;s like there are documents available to us where we can find answers, but have we been too conditioned to be able to truly grasp a whole new world history? 
I hope I make sense to someone. </p>
