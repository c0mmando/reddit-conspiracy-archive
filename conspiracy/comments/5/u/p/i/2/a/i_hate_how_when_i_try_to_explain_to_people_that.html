    <div class="md"><p>That may work for some who are already open minded but the Socratic method comes across as aggressive and somewhat demeaning.  I think it starts with a simple idea sort of like the movie inception and that idea festers.  People are very keen on their belief system and it is difficult to change especially given the vast amount of information available today.  It&#39;s difficult to know who or what to believe.  People need to wake up on their own and no amount of force will change that.  Humanity needs to be patient and understanding because we are all in this together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry about it, a lot of people come to terms with the fact that the world is not as the mainstream media says it is, eventually. It was only really 3 years ago when I started to realise that a lot of these conspiracy theories that I had previously ridiculed did end up being correct on some level.</p>

<p>People need to learn and research this stuff by themselves, that&#39;s the only way I &quot;woke-up&quot; so to speak and I posit that it&#39;s the only way most other people will &quot;wake-up&quot;. Looking back now I don&#39;t really understand why I thought it was so far-fetched that the most powerful and wealthy people in the world would conspire to accumulate even more power and wealth - the evidence is clear to see and one tends to come to the sullen realisation that the powers that be don&#39;t even attempt to hide their blatant ponzi-scheme, they do it right out in the open because there&#39;s just not a large enough percentage of the population whom really give a shit unfortunately. I believe that will change however, and possibly sooner than most expect or realise.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re complaining about people calling you crazy, while at the same time insulting those that research flat-earth?</p>

<p>Define wacky, because just about every &quot;conspiracy&quot; is wacky, so stop being hypocritical and realize that they are defending their REALITY. It&#39;s not surpsing that people will lash out at you, you&#39;re literally changing their world views. It&#39;s normal.</p>

<p><a href="http://minstrel.republika.pl/e1.jpg">This picture</a> will help you understand the scale, line of sight, and visible surface of the Earth at even higher altitude - 40 km.</p>

<p>What curvature would you like to see from 40 km altitude exactly? Maybe <a href="http://spaceweather.com/images2016/21apr16/pop0.jpg?PHPSESSID=pjvm6ltm5o3n9au3hj5lll3v30">this one</a>? It has been taken in 2015 from 12-year-old kid&#39;s balloon at altitude of 35,7 km.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about your fish-eye lens logic. And I find it interesting that it somehow affects the Earth in the background but not these two poles in front. This lens seems to be quite selective ;) Uh-oh, and what is <a href="http://felixbaumgartner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0495.jpg">this sorcery</a>?!

    <div class="md"><p>Society as a whole has grown too complacent with its&#39; surroundings, and have become dependent on the very systems they should mistrust. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s go for the Matrix analogy; these people don&#39;t want to be red pilled. They don&#39;t want to be vigilant, or active in their governmental support and voting rights, they just want to do nothing. Mass media has brainwashed them, grooming their opinions to suit their agendas and to fulfill their purposes. </p>

<p>Right now you&#39;ve presented people the red pill, and they&#39;re freaking out, conflicted on whether to take it or the blue pill, and go back to their complacent lives. </p>

<p>Be more gentle in how you approach subjects, and don&#39;t go straight for the attack. That will only solidify their beliefs. </p>
