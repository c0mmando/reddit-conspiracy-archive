       Between shareblue, media matters, CTR, George Soros, and many more, the failing "elite" are pulling last ditch efforts to try to re-grasp their control on the narrative of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will lose because we are stronger than them. They are playing with third dimensional tools of fear and control and power over others and service to self. We need to stay together, stay in the light, honor our sacred connection to each other because we are one.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we become divided and devolve into civil unrest "they" can come in and initiate their plans they have been wanting to do. Their strategy is divide and conquer, then come in and control what's left. It's their only tactic, and can easily be beaten.
      </p>

       Yes Trump does shit things sometimes. Yeah racism sucks. Quit feeding into that energy and we will be much better off. Why focus on attacking Trump when you can focus on a positive solution instead? Getting angry and pissed off does nothing but feed these damn parasites that have controlled us for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knock it the fuck off guys and quit attacking each other over petty bull shit. Every time we do we succumb to our own dividing and separation. We are not separate. We are not different because of skin color or belief systems. Everyone is right in their own way, quit trying to impose your way of reality into someone else's reality. We all need to learn to cooperate and come together for once, if we are to survive and thrive as a species and get a new society formed for us all and have a better future. It's possible and it starts with you.

       Why focus on defending Trump? The position of president is antiquated and kinda stupid. Why should we have a single individual pursuing individual goals on behalf of 300+ million people. Why elect a new monarch every 4 years, when they shouldn't exist in the first place? The media lies, government is corrupt and broken, why pick sides in a game that only those at the top have the opportunity to win? Ignorance is bliss and you folks that play the left vs. right game must be the happiest mother fuckers on the planet.

       Agreed, trump is part of this orchestrated collapse. He is the catylist for social unrest, and he divides he people.

       Trump is the President of the United States. When he lies, every citizen has a responsibility to call him out on it. If we don't, then it will normalize his behavior. It's important that people remain critical of the administration.

       Dude, that behavior has been normalized for a lonnnnggg time. Nixon, ollie north under bush, clinton sex scandles, weapons of mass destruction, benghazi. Every president lies. Unless you want realy change i disagree with your sentiment. Most ive met just want the put
