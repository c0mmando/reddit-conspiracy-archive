          George distinguishes between legit and illegit charity workers and the profit motive created by charities
         </li>
         <li>
          When you put that profit motive underneath that work and then pair it with companies like Dyncorp that has a history of repugnant activity
         </li>
         <li>
          Clinton started a missing children charity looking over 22 to a 120 countries, but there is no transparency.

         </li>
         <li>
          If you are going to do charity, you have to have transparency. What we've shown is the exact opposite: no transparency whatsoever
         </li>
         <li>
          Richard Branson went on a crusade to mandate that everyone be an organ donor.
         </li>

          I love the idea of saving lives but there has to be more transparency first, [otherwise it is abused]

         </li>
         <li>
          Brownstone recap--George uses an example of a person being reported in an incident involving a child and getting labeled a sex offender.  It might not be a big deal among people who understand the situation, but law enforcement and revenge groups don't see it that way.  They get paid by intelligence to harass these people and do life-disruption on these people.
         </li>
         <li>
          Pam Wetterling to reduce the list to people who have actually exploited or kidnapped children
         </li>
         <li>
          Release those 19 gmail accounts, because there could still be people in the State Dept engaged in trafficking kids, even if they are simply working with the CIA, they need to stop it anyway and we need to expose this.
         </li>
         <li>
          Because we will find out who these people are eventually, but it's better to confess now and expose it, then be found covering it up later; because all this time that goes on, kids were harmed and we will hold all of you accountable for having asked for this information and having been stonewalled.
         </li>
         <li>
          The time for all true patriots to come to the aid of their country. Mccabe should recuse himself.
         </li>
         <li>
          If we find out there are a lot of emails confirming the bribery and trafficking, that's going to be a problem later on.

         </li>
         <li>
          In the genes it's caused by one nucleotide being off.  It could even mean "designer babies" (disapora theory / elite panspermia)

          There is a longevity drive in the hillary emails about CRISPR, a genetic therapy for this.

         <li>
          Dyncorp is a systemic problem.  They take sheriffs and teach them trafficking.
         </li>
         <li>
          We need to be sure that returning Sheriffs don't bring this culture back with them and are not coerced into this 'habit patter' of Dyncorp in America
         </li>
         <li>
          Not trying to single out Sheriffs, but if you run for public office, you need to disclose your past and what you're up to
         </li>
         <li>
          There is video where a child is being beaten, and someone has compared the voice to John Podesta.  I don't endorse that, and in no way do I believe that is John Podesta.
         </li>
         <li>
          A car salesman puts a picture of his car behind his desk, likewise Podesta has pictures of weird rituals pulling hearts out of the body, but you can't exactly put up a sign 'organs R us' {{ie: he's an organ salesman}}
         </li>
         <li>
          The CIA through programs like operation underground railroad and JTTF come down on these Sheriffs and say 'we want to run an operation in your county' and the Sheriff says, 'well that seems like entrapment' but then they say well our DHS grant you get next year may not be as big.  So there is a profit incentive to run these intelligence operations through the local police
         </li>
         <li>
          Operation Underground Railroad is just a Vigilante operation, it's not a public agency or police--he's a private vigilante group doing extortion for asset seizure.  I [George] and Tim Ballard have the same rank {{ie: none, officially}}
         </li>
         <li>
          George recaps bringing the 3 Muslims to justice
         </li>
         <li>
          George had defended a muslim kid that was entrapped by Andrew McCabe in the Portland Christmas Tree bomber case, and he's taken a lot of crap for that in terms of life-disruption.  "It's not me against Muslims, it's me against the Muslim Brotherhood."
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Claude D'Estree has asked George through several intermediaries to take down the picture of him at the Boston Bombing
          </strong>
         </li>
         <li>
          I never said this was Claude D'Estree.  I just put the picture up here saying, "why does this picture look exactly like him at the Boston Bombing"
         </li>
         <li>
          I know what happens a lot is they explode a bomb to cover the murders of sex sting girls {{a "Forum slide" but for traditional news--bombs get your attention, some random girl death doesn't}}
         </li>
         <li>
          If you have someone with political connections at the high level of Border Patrol, they can force a 'no search' and keep moving 'no searches' around so that they let contraband in.
         </li>
         <li>
          Hopefully Erik Prince of Blackwater will get the contract {{George said in am earlier video that Blackwater is no saint but at least he's not Dyncorp--a 'much lesser' of 2 evils}}

        <ul>
         <li>
          One way to track this trafficking is to access the software that is tracking the assets and financial transactions -- that's the PROMIS / Palantir software
         </li>
         <li>
          PROMIS looked into every country's intelligence system to see who the bad guys were and instead of arresting the bad guys, or at least watching them, Sid Blumenthal hired them.
         </li>
         <li>
          The tracking software doesn't really fight crime.   Whoever is driving the software is going to determine what results you get.  {{If a criminal uses it you get crimes, if a good guy uses it you fight crime.  Hillary Clinton and Dyncorp in this case is a criminal (see steps 1-6)}}
         </li>
         <li>
          What Palantir adds is 'object oriented', meaning that this person in the database carries information that is updated in realtime; it's getting feeds from various data sources
         </li>
         <li>
          Update on Eric Braverman -- Google Foundation is part of Polaris.  Polaris is a group that is going into this child trafficking problem ({{yeah right}}.  I think the child trafficking is really just a cover for the organ harvesting because organ harvesting is so terrible.
         </li>
         <li>
          This is basically the Clinton Foundation moving over to the west coast and changing names.
         </li>
         <li>
          The key is not to fall for it again--the social justice cover.  The enforcement is not going to come from the same group that was taking advantage of people in Libya and Syria, trafficking kids to the Saudi shieks.  That's not the person you want to put in charge. {{Fox before the henhouse}}
         </li>
         <li>
          Ashton Kutcher has been brought in to replace the ousted Peter Thiel. Kucher is a cover story--they almost can't keep a straight face when they do this social justice thing--he blew a kiss to McCain--the theatrics are a little extreme
         </li>
         <li>
          Kucher and Moore have this foundation called Thorne: they are going to be the front for Palantir--he basically said DHS came to me because they were at the end of their rope.  If you change the front sign of the business it's still the same business
         </li>
         <li>
          Gen Flynn is the kind of guy you want running your ratlines; so he knows where the bones are buried.  He knows where the US and ISIS has been tipped off on US raids so that we end up blowing up rocks instead of terrorists.  When we shoot an expensive missle we want to make sure we get the Awan brothers, but if you keep tipping people off like we did in Yemen, we aren't going to be successful {{which means the US Taxpayers have to pay for more missles}}

          After these transcripts come out about Gen Flynn, let's bring him back in because he's the guy you want fighting your ratlines.  Maybe he had a mission that he felt only the President should know (maybe he distrusted the VP).
         </li>
         <li>
          Easiest way to stop the networks is to stop the money.  Flynn in one week could dismantle the networks in one week.
         </li>
         <li>
          A lot of people say he was outed because he stopped the 2 guys in the venezuelan trafficking ring.

        -- History of 20th Century America defined by CIA+Vatican Heroin Trafficking
        <ul>
         <li>
          How did all these things get started in the first place.
         </li>
         <li>
          In order to spy, you're always going to need an airforce, helicopters, banking, places to stay for spies--those are called Proprietaries
         </li>
         <li>
          There are also cutouts -- in the front of Mena arkansas they were making parking meters in a 'park-o-meter' business in the front, and in the back making nosecones of planes for smuggling arms and drugs; that's why it's called a 'front', there's a semi legitimate business that is covering for the business in the back.
         </li>
         <li>
          This all started with the CIA
         </li>
         <li>
          Knights of Malta use Diplomatic passports as a cover to travel around
         </li>
         <li>
          History time:
         </li>
         <li>
          Paul Helliwell a CIA architect, the plan is : Allen Dulles wants to create a group of gladios (fighters), based on the old werewolf plan for the German intelligence.  You would be a normal guy during the day, but at night you do these prowler type operations like the SS does now.  Based on that old werewolf plan.  The operation was called operation gladio; they were going to do 630 of these gladios 10-13 man teams in Europe to take on the Russians in Europe.
         </li>
         <li>
          The problem is the CIA had no money, so Helliwell came up with the Helliwell plan, Operation X.  You might have seen this in Godfather II
         </li>
         <li>
          "Christmas "Havanna Conference" 1946 -- Hotel National
         </li>
         <li>
          CIA implements Helliwell Plan with Luciano/Genovese -- we'll start the heroin trade into Harlem, giving it to black musicians and asian immigrants in SF and LA who have experienced heroin before.  It won't get out of control because it will stay in Harlem basically, they thought.
         </li>
         <li>
          CIA used the Vatican bank to launder the heroin trade money to Harlem
         </li>
         <li>
          A drug company named Scapporelli would ship these Oranges, half were real, half were wax filled with cocaine;
         </li>
         <li>
          There was very little drug trade until this 1946 Havanna Conference
         </li>
         <li>
          They were packed in Havana as the trans-shipment point, and they were put into the the United Fruit Company containers and imported into the New Orleans, Miami, NY Ports, moved by Teamsters (mafia) all around the US.  Just like they moved alcohol during prohibition
         </li>
         <li>
          Gladio funded by the Heroin trade, Knights of Malta Bag Men -- the money has to get back to the bank and the Vatican, the international transfer system at the time were the Knights of Malta
         </li>
         <li>
          Pope Creates Catholic Action in Italy, Catholics in Action -- people who do sabotage and intelligence collection in the US
         </li>
         <li>
          CIA establishes the "Vatican Desk" to Collect information in Eastern Europe -- money processed at Vatican Bank, Vatican Desk processed the information
         </li>
         <li>
          Joseph Corbell, Madeline Albreight's father, was that gladio guy for Czechoslovakia
         </li>
         <li>
          William Colby, James Angleton, William Casey, John McCone--all directors of the CIA; all of these guys were Knights of Malta.  At some point you had to do your time in Eastern Europe moving this money around
         </li>
         <li>
          William F Buckley Alexander Haig, Rhinehard Gehlen -- also involved in these same activities in different war theaters.
         </li>
         <li>
          Rhinehard Gehlen was the German Intelligence werewolf program runner for Germany--he was also a Knights of Malta
         </li>
         <li>
          FFW to 6.5T missing in our budget and 240B missing in NATO budget--NATO is the original gladio program, Gladio B, C, D, JTTF budgets
         </li>
         <li>
          Afghanistan theater is now called Gladio B, per Sibel Edmond's calling it that
         </li>
         <li>
          There was a golden age of spying when we didn't rely on subterfuge, sabotage and blackmail.  Where we really were able to collect intelligence that would simply informed the military.  I think you get better intelligence that way also.
         </li>
         <li>
          Why Haiti?  Well because Cuba went communist
         </li>
         <li>
          BCCI, BCCI bank is created by the Vatican bank
         </li>
         <li>
          All the wars since WW2 have been Heroin wars
         </li>
         <li>
          You can piece together the history very clearly just by understanding the Havanna Converence of 1946

          3 Medicshare hospitals in Haiti more towards the north where they do the heart transplants.
         </li>
         <li>
          Project Medicshare was run by Donna Shalalah--she has been the president there since serving under President Clinton as the Health and Human Services Secretary
         </li>
         <li>
          Medicshare has a clinic at the University of Miami called the LAORA, the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency
         </li>
         <li>
          Where this drills down is the email(s) between Cheryl Mills and Hillary talking about Medicshare quite a bit
         </li>
         <li>
          Donna Shalala in these email threads is trying to get access to General Keen to get access to the area militarily cordoneed off in Haiti after the quake {{gotta get those organs!}}

         </li>
         <li>
          We need to get that report and find out exactly why--probably bad paperwork.  What I'm looking into now having established the people and agencies involved is looking down at the paperwork for the particular organs to follow this ratline out.

         <li>
          I think we have an organ ratline going toward Oklahoma toward Baptist Hospital at a teaching hospital, so there's very limited checks involved
         </li>
         <li>
          George refers back to the The Oklahoma city bombing, where there were 20-30 children at a facility there.  But there are over 100 different centers that have childcare facilities and we should be looking at those
         </li>
         <li>
          George thinks this organ stuff started with pediatric hearts then progressed to adult hearts and then livers
