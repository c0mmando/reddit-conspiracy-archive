       So there's been a huge amount of pedo takedowns lately. Looks like we now know exactly why and it has apparently nothing to do with Trump or Pizzagate. Here are some facts:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ashton Kutcher's organization THORN, founded in 2009, have identified 2000 child victims in the past 6 MONTHS.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         THORN developed a program called Spotlight (now in Beta) for tracking down pedos. This program is in the hands of 4000 law enforcement officials, 900 law enforcement agencies, and is used in ALL 50 states.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         THORN's spotlight reduces investigation time by 60% for law enforcement. Can reduce investigation time form 3 years to 3 weeks!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Kutcher testified in front of Senate to ask for funding in fighting human trafficking through its programs. THORN is currently not being funded by the government.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       My guess is that it's more of a combination of the two (Pizzagate and Kutcher), rather than one thing being the source of it, but I'd bet THORN is a huge contributing factor for the takedowns. Good on him for doing something about it.

       A combination? What takedowns has PG been directly responsible for? All I see are video analysis of some weird video on worldcorp. All while real law enforcement individuals and real activists that spend their time and money on the issue like Kutcher are doing the actual work.

       I meant that more as the growing awareness of Pizzagate. Not direct responsibility. People are paying more attention to the pedophilia problem in our country which attracts more attention to organizations like THORN, which further encourages people to donate, help out, and do what they can, ultimately aiding THORN in their mission and what they're capable of doing. THORN is the core of it, but the awareness of PG could be a factor in more and more of what's happening. Just my guess.

       It's a good guess. But one thing to remember is that Thorn has been around since 2009, collecting information on human trafficking and developing software to combat it. This all happened before Pizza Gate. And I doibt PG proponents have even heard of Thorn until Kutcher just this last week went before Senate to talk about it.

       Without acknowledgement from the enforcement agencies involved, this is complete speculation that could be considered dangerous considering they are a front that takes money. I'd be more interested in seeing some hard data or hearing an enforcement agency commend them for their help and service. Otherwise you could just be trying to draw a false correlation to help an ineffective charity...
      </p>
      <p>
       i think the hundreds if not thousands of people working on this stuff are the biggest catalyst. Kutcher has been doing this for years, but only after PG hit did we see an acceleration in arrests. I think it has more to do with the internet than Kutcher, PG, or anything else. The internet is bringing people's intelligence together, and they're starting to get 'professional' level results.

       You want acknowledgement from law enforcement officials to prove that THORN is working? The fact that Kutcher testified in front of senate that 4000 law enforcement officials and 900 law enforcement agencies use it isn't enough proof for you? Okay here's more, current law enforcement users of Spolight were surveyed as to the effectiveness of Spotlight, in the last 12 months they said 1980 children id'd and 2186 traffickers were identified. 
Source:
       <a href="https://www.wearethorn.org/spotlight/">
        https://www.wearethorn.org/spotlight/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Spotlight (still in beta) only this year has been in widespread use by law enforcement officials. This explains why the impact is NOW happening and not before. Before that, research and development into the problem was the main thing THORN was doing. PG hasn't actually identified anyone and lead to arrests to my knowledge(please show me one example). On the otherhand Spotlight and law enforcement have helped 2000 children in the past 12 months!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a REAL tool against REAL trafficking and you are trying to downplay it so that PG can continue its internet sleauthing and acting as if its actually making an impact. It's pretty irresponsible of you.

       Again, all hearsay and theory. Testifying to the Senate doesn't prove shit. As I said, if THORN was a key part of an arrest, I'd assume enforcement would thank them and ask the public to give more resources. I haven't seen anything like that. Sorry.

       Software can't be a game changer of this magnitude? What does that even mean. Law enforcement with the help of cutting edge software designed to catch Pedos developed over 3 years of research into the problem is ALOT more effective than watching a worldcorp video over and over until it sounds like Podesta.

       Wow, you deserve a gold medal in mental gymnastics. If 4000 law enforcement officials and 900 law enforcement agencies are using across ALL 50 states. It's being endorsed ffs. But here's even more:

       There is also a list of around 30 police departments that have officially endorsed THORN kicking around. I'd track it down for you if I actually thought it had a chance to pierce through your fact-less bubble.

       Apologize for mental gymnastics commect. But it goes both ways, if I provide you with my argument which I have, and you dismiss it cause there's not enough evidence even though there's lots of evidence, it just sounds like you are ignoring everything that doesn't fit your world view.

       I'm not totally dismissing THORN. It could well be as effective as you claim it to be. However, for you to absolutely claim that it was THORN that led to all those arrests and for you minimize the work of people who are digging to find connections is wrong. You can't say that these people haven't made a difference - if anything, all of these sources work in concert. That's what i'm responding to - your diminishing of other sources of effort. Also, hard facts go a long way. Acknowledgement is kind of a huge thing. You see - you can just make things up on the internet. Half-truths that sound real are the best ones. I try to look out for those. I think it's better to give everyone credit.

       Yes, THORN has been around for 8 years, the busts started up with increased intensity since November. Their have been more arrested in the last two months that 2014&amp;2015 combined. If anything, I'd say the FBI knows exactly who these abusers are, and finally got the green light to arrest from President Trump.

       Thanks, that fits more what what I have witnessed and tracked as well. THORN seems scary to me because of the circles it is plugged into and the fact that they were put in front of congress does not stand out as a plus for me right now. If there were open calls for pedophiles in government right now, I'd be more willing to believe it, but the fact that it's still tooth-and-nail to me means that there is a chance that THORN is controlled opposition. Hopefully not tho.

       THORN has been around 8 years. But their software Spotlight is still in beta, and it was Spotlight that law enforcement agencies CREDITED with identifying 2000 child victims and 2000 traffickers in the last 12 months alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare that to PG has not identified child victims and has not identified any traffickers. Also Trump hasn't done ANYTHING policy wise to lead anyone with rational thought to think he could have anything to do with it. Finally got the green light from Trump. WTF?  You think law enforcement needs a green light from the President to go after people breaking the law? How exactly do you think the Presidency works. Jesus Christ.

       Trump hasn't made an pedo related orders. 
Cops are doing the work, and cops are using THORN's software to catch pedos.
PG is an ocean of people looking at instagrams photos, anonymous videos from worldcorp, emails with vague pizza references, and in all that research it has lead to 0 arrests and 0 children saved. All while Spotlight has identified 2000 children and 2000 traffickers!

       Geez, spread some credit around. What's going on now. Why are we being pushed on Astor being the sole man responsible. It's doesn't work like that. It's a group effort. Ashton might be a high note but he's not the entire music sheet.

       I give credit where credit is due. All I see in this thread are PG advocates that are questioning the legitimacy of THORN, an organization that has proven results in tracking down pedos. Is endorsed by law enforcement officials in all 50 states and has been commended by Senate for its work.
      </p>
      <p>
       What credit does PG deserve? How many pedos have they caught directly? How many child victims have they identified? ZERO. So why should we act like PG deserves equal credit to law enforcement and THORN.
      </p>
      <p>
       It PG advocates actually cared about the problem they would stop wasting their time chasing ridiculous leads and just donate to Thorn. An actual organization with a actual research and development into how to tackle this problem realistically.

       Your right, thank you for some evidence to claims. Still though, he signed the EO on February 9th. 9 days ago. 9 friggen days ago, and people want to give him credit for all the pedo takedowns in the last year. THORN has taken down 2000 traffickers in the last 12 months!

       He punkd em better than PG punkd them.
How many traffickers and child victims has PG identified? 0 and 0.
How many traffickers and child victims has THORN identified? 2000 and 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       So essentially what you are doing is downplaying REAL organizations with REAL results to combat pedos. Your hurting their courageous work, and for what? So you can continue living in a fantasy world where PG are the only ones trying to take pedos down?

       You've posted this verbatim at least 3 times in this thread. That, along with your militant standoffish tone (and your history), leads me to believe that you are exactly what you are accusing us of. Someone who doesn't care about the children and only about pushing their own narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's great that kids are being rescued. This does not mean that Pizzagate is rendered moot. If anything, this group (led by Kutcher, a Clinton stool pigeon btw) could be knocking off the small fish or the competition. Making us feel all warm and fuzzy while not affecting the major players. Akin to how the DEA serves to destroy the CIAs competitors in the drug trade.

       Yeh I did. By design I posted that 3 times. Yes it is great that children are being rescued, and they are being rescued by effective and well-thought out strategies instituted by THORN. And THORN should be commended and supported for their work so they can continue stopping traffickers. Yet all I see in this thread and including you are people who want to attack THORN's credibility based on ZERO EVIDENCE. You say it yourself, you accuse THORN founder Kutcher as being a Clinton stool pigeon (where you got this idea I don't know, because you probably don't have evidence of this). It's the baseless attacking of organizations like THORN that will do more harm than PizzaGate will ever do good for children. You act as if PizzaGate is some sort of awesome grass roots movement to catch pedos. While I'm sure PG people are well-meaning, you can also see that they have a political narrative where they already believe the things they have no evidence of. And could possibly lead to innocent people being hurt for no reason. And let's not act as if PG has been effective, they have caught ZERO pedos in all their months of investigations.

       I too found this Asian beauty guy bizarre in his most recent contribution to r/conspiracy relating to alleged Russia-Trump connections. I couldn't put my finger on it, but he's something of a 2nd order contrarian with a profound trust in the system.

       It's like the skepticism of skepticism -- purposeful and indeed militant as you say. Truly perplexing.

       Everyone who downvotes this information is scum. Why are people denigrating THORN, an actual organization with actual results in fighting pedos?
      </p>
      <p>
       It gives the impression that PG advocates don't actually care about pedo arrests. They just want to continue their narrative that Clinton is a pedo monster and PG is the only one who can stop it. Problem is, PG hasn't actually caught ANYONE. And Ashton Kutcher's THORN has identified 2000 traffickers!
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if PG wasn't so focused on analyzing and trying to connect every bit of random information they find to Podesta they could actually find some pedos like Thorn is.

       Exactly. Global pedophile rings exist, and Podesta/Clinton may well be involved, but I've always considered Pgate to be the controllable distraction. The narrative is too easy to manipulate with disinfo/misinfo, and I feel that it has been from early on. The narrative has been designed to make its proponents look and sound ridiculous, regardless of whether or not there is any truth in their claims.

       Kudos to THORN, and Ashton Kutcher, for putting the resources together to be able to do something about it, while respecting what good there is left in our justice system and allowing the proper officials to handle it through legitimate legal channels.

       No they are just calling in all their low level blackmail able assets.  It has to start somewhere ... But what this is doing is providing a human shield of low level criminal justice busts to buy enough time for the Clintons, podestas,  alefantuses, abramoviches, gagas, Epstein's, obamas, mccains, grahams,  hasterts etc to cover their tracks legally and get out of the country or make deals

       Why? Its endorsed by law enforcement agencies in all 50 states. The same law enforcement agencies that were surveyed and said that they found 2000 traffickers through the use of Thorn's software.

      <p>
       Why are you dubious? Because you'd rather believe that PG looking at anonymous videos posted on worldcorp is the real reason pedos are going down? How many actual pedo arrests were the result of PG investigations? ZERO.
