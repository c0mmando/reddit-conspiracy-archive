       Even people who voted for him didn't like him. This poll is meaningless, all it does is show the extreme polarization in the US.

      <p>
       His approval with Democrats is 8% and his approval with Republicans is 90%.

       You asked for a metric.  Polls are not meaningless, unless one is brainwashed or extremely polarized themselves, and choose to disregard them.  Many republicans in congress are distancing themselves from Trump.  Please provide your sources for the 8% and 90%.  Please provide evidence for your metric supporting "chance of war is down".
      </p>
      <p>
       His approval ratings will affect his chances of affecting policy because in the USA, we have a system of checks and balances.  If Congress sees he has low approval, they will not be inclined to support his policies,.  Same for the court system, as we have already seen.  With respect to the economy, it was turned around over the past 8 years since W and his policies were bounced out and already on  this trajectory.

       "Rounded" or adjusted to fit your agenda?  Hmmm....still waiting for  your metric for war.  Still waiting for your acknowledgement of the economic trajectory set by the previous administration.  Remember "W?  Remember the Great Recession?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I suppose any republicans opposing Trump would lose their seats.  Because he is essentially a dictator and has already spoken about ruining the career of one person who opposed his ideals. But that will take two years, and that's a lot of time for him to throw enough rope to hang himself, which I suspect he will do, with flair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cannot believe you've brought the word "hypocrisy" into the discussion since Trump has shown himself to me a master of it.  The republicans had the pitchforks out for hypocrisy before the election.  I suppose they are using them for something else these days?

       Look at a chart. The trajectory changed on November 8.
      </p>
      <p>
       My metric for war is that the previous administration was escalating tensions with Russia, while Trump is de-escalating.

       Russia was escalating prior to the election; this did not happen in a vacuum.  A high-level Trump adviser was just fired for dealing with Russia prior to the inauguration.  Trump knew about it for weeks and said nothing. Do you understand the definition of "traitor"?

       Or is it someone who transfers TS information from a SCIF to a server that was vulnerable to hacking by sophisticated adversaries and uses her connections to the attorney general to avoid consequences that anyone else would face?

       It seems you are the one who is angry.  Yes, there are two views of reality in America today. One is factual,and the other not so much.  It transcends party lines.  I didn't vote for Trump or Clinton.  And I'm not angry.  Just posting data, facts and such.  Have a pleasant evening.  No response is necessary.
