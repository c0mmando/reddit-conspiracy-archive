<p>Christopher Hitchens wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be exact, Stieg Larsson died on November 9, 2004, which I can’t help noticing was the anniversary of Kristallnacht. Is it plausible that Sweden’s most public anti-Nazi just chanced to expire from natural causes on such a date? Larsson’s magazine, Expo, which has a fairly clear fictional cousinhood with “Millennium,” was an unceasing annoyance to the extreme right. He himself was the public figure most identified with the unmasking of white-supremacist and neo-Nazi organizations, many of them with a hard-earned reputation for homicidal violence. The Swedes are not the pacific herbivores that many people imagine: in the footnotes to his second novel Larsson reminds us that Prime Minister Olof Palme was gunned down in the street in 1986 and that the foreign minister Anna Lindh was stabbed to death (in a Stockholm department store) in 2003. The first crime is still unsolved, and the verdict in the second case has by no means satisfied everybody.</p>

<p>A report in the mainstream newspaper Aftonbladet describes the findings of another anti-Nazi researcher, named Bosse Schön, who unraveled a plot to murder Stieg Larsson that included a Swedish SS veteran. Another scheme misfired because on the night in question, 20 years ago, he saw skinheads with bats waiting outside his office and left by the rear exit. Web sites are devoted to further speculation: one blog is preoccupied with the theory that Prime Minister Palme’s uncaught assassin was behind the death of Larsson too. Larsson’s name and other details were found when the Swedish police searched the apartment of a Fascist arrested for a political murder. Larsson’s address, telephone number, and photograph, along with threats to people identified as “enemies of the white race,” were published in a neo-Nazi magazine: the authorities took it seriously enough to prosecute the editor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually thinking this the other day. I read those books years ago and thought the whole plot was a little extreme and played off too many conspiracy theories. But after learning what i&#39;ve learned over the past few years it seems like he was right on the money and trying to get the word out in a fictional novel. And just so happens to have a convenient heart attack before the book is released. It just lines up with a lot of other things that seem to conveniently go wrong with whistle-blowers.</p>

<p>One of the things that struck me was the government being involved in both her &quot;well-being&quot; and the same people who raped her. I never thought much of this theme until i saw all those &quot;charity&quot; organizations for exploited children that did the same thing.</p>
