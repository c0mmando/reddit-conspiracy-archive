        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Pizza Restaraunt? Check. Politician? Check. Pedophile owner? Check. Massive political ties? Check. Lawrence Vander Esch was a local politician and founder of Pizza Ranch, he pled guilty to molesting 15 boys in 2001 and was convicted of 10 years in prison. In 2006 a judge vacating his case so he actually walked without getting any charges on his record and does not have to register as a sex offender. He is currently listed of the owner of 4 Pizza Ranch restaurants even though the company claims to have erased him from their history after his conviction.</p>

<p>Sometimes he collected the samples in his restaurants; other times he collected them in a car. He even promised them 50 to 100 dollars per sample but never delivered, telling them their sperm counts weren&#39;t high enough. It wasn&#39;t the boys but their parents who brought the case to authorities. They feared nothing would happen because of Vander Esch&#39;s high standing in the Orange City area. Before being a successful businessman, he was the Sioux County treasurer. He was also on a Christian school&#39;s board, and he headed up the local Republican party.</p>

<p>JUDGE RETIRES AFTER VACATING HIS CASE EARLY THIS KEEPS GOING FOLKS.

<p>Hit the jackpot with this one. This is a brand new rabbit hole guys I need people to help look for more ties on this.</p>

<p>The restaurants have back rooms that are suitable for hosting political gatherings. &quot;If there&#39;s an event at the Pizza Ranch, nine times out of ten it&#39;s a political event,&quot; Craig Robinson, a local political blogger, told the Times. &quot;They all seem more than willing to host any candidate coming through town.&quot; <a href="http://www.edgemedianetwork.com/news/local/news//128366/gop_candidates%E2%80%99_iowa_hangout%E2%80%99s_secret:_founder_molested_male_employees_">http://www.edgemedianetwork.com/news/local/news//128366/gop_candidates%E2%80%99_iowa_hangout%E2%80%99s_secret:_founder_molested_male_employees_</a></p>

<p>Who is Bob Vander Plaats? (Robert Lee &quot;Bob&quot; Vander Plaats is an American politician and political activist. He is currently the president and CEO of The Family Leader, a social conservative organization, and the National Co-Chair for Ted Cruz for President) 
Vander Plaats and Pizza Ranch - <a href="http://www.newtonindependent.com/newton_independent/2011/01/reporters-notebook-the-vander-plaatspizza-ranch-connection-1.html">http://www.newtonindependent.com/newton_independent/2011/01/reporters-notebook-the-vander-plaatspizza-ranch-connection-1.html</a>
Vander Plaats and corruption - <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/bob-vander-plaats-violated-his-own-marriage-fidelity-pledge-accepted-millions-in-federal-funds-286e0af4a93c#.9w1og7bt2">https://thinkprogress.org/bob-vander-plaats-violated-his-own-marriage-fidelity-pledge-accepted-millions-in-federal-funds-286e0af4a93c#.9w1og7bt2</a></p>

<p>Why is the name Vander so prominent? Vander Esch, Vander Blaats, Vander Vegte, Vander Schaff, Vander Well. (The German &quot;von&quot; is a cognate of Dutch &quot;van&quot;, though unlike the German &quot;von&quot;, the Dutch &quot;van&quot; is more often part of a common surname than an indication of nobility or royalty. It can both imply nobility (Willem van Oranje &quot;William of [the] Orange [family]&quot;) or signify any ancestral relation to a particular place (Jan van Ghent &quot;John [who hails] from Ghent&quot; <a href="http://www.hull1stcrc.com/bulletin/may172015.cfm">http://www.hull1stcrc.com/bulletin/may172015.cfm</a></p>

<p>Is it pure coincidence that they are named Pizza Ranch but their signature item is actually the chicken... So chicken and pizza, where have we heard that before, they also serve what they call their &quot;cactus bread&quot; which has the pedophile swirl symbol drawn on it in icing. (<a href="http://imgur.com/rViNf07)">http://imgur.com/rViNf07)</a>) Beyond that once you look into the place more you see its a buffet style basically CiCis pizza shithole and how they are making tons of money and rapidly expanding their franchise is really suspicious, they also have a really long list of sponsers and partner deals they are in which just stinks of corruption IMO.They even have international partnership deals that gets them in countries that we already have heard about like Haiti and Ethiopia <a href="http://www.pizzaranch.com/coffeepartnership">http://www.pizzaranch.com/coffeepartnership</a></p>

<p>&quot;I feel at home. I&#39;m at a Pizza Ranch.&quot; Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee sat at a table in the buffet chain&#39;s Council Bluffs location in late March. His town hall meeting was winding down, and he would soon hop in a car to another meeting at another Pizza Ranch (this one in Sioux City). But with the smells of fried chicken and pepperoni in the air, the winner of the 2008 Iowa caucuses waxed nostalgic. &quot;I largely won it because of Pizza Ranches all over the state,&quot; Huckabee said. &quot;We created the Pizza Ranch strategy. A lot of people have copied it since then, but I think we created it.&quot; Presidential hopefuls campaigning at Pizza Ranches across Iowa — the &quot;Pizza Ranch circuit,&quot; the media call it — has become a staple of the Iowa caucuses. The down-home,&quot;- <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/05/03/pizza-ranch-circuit-iowa-caucuses/26844813/">http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/05/03/pizza-ranch-circuit-iowa-caucuses/26844813/</a></p>

<p>2008 IOWA CAUCUSES
First candidate to visit a Pizza Ranch: Democrat Hillary Clinton, on May 26, 2007, in Emmetsburg.</p>

<p>Ted Cruz connection, By the time of the caucuses, Cruz — and most of the other candidates — will have made multiple Pizza Ranch visits. Mike Huckabee told the Des Moines Register that he won the 2008 caucuses in large part through such visits: “We created the Pizza Ranch strategy. A lot of people have copied it since then, but I think we created it. This election cycle, klatches at the chain take place almost daily: a candidate in a suit (or jeans, depending on the desired optics of the day) scarfs a slice while ringed by ruddy men in ball caps, most of them obese, many of them corn growers, chicken growers, or hog growers under contract to a handful of corporations.&quot;- <a href="https://thefern.org/2016/08/the-trouble-with-iowa/">https://thefern.org/2016/08/the-trouble-with-iowa/</a></p>

<p>Other possible ties that need more looking at - Pizza Ranch Farmrescue.org connection (GMOs?) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kaC9CLvvTcYouTubeYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kaC9CLvvTcYouTubeYouTube</a></p>

<p>Relative I think it may be Vanderesch&#39;s son i&#39;m not sure of the relation as of yet Darrell Vanderesch is listed under dob records as owner of at least 3 Pizza Ranch&#39;s and two other businesses E S C H CORP 202 S SPLITROCK BLVD, and HURON PR INC 8500 E SADDLE CREEK RD SIOUX FALLS, SD 57110-7467 HE should be looked at too. Hes on facebook but I didnt have much luck finding information about him on google.</p>

<p>Adrie Groeneweg is the co-founder with this pedophile, he now owns like 15 restaurants. He should be investigated aswell. His sons name is Scott Groeneweg hes listed as the operations manager of multiple Pizza Ranch locations he should be looked at too.</p>

<p>Does Vander Esch know who took Johnny? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5clk7a/saw_the_documentary_who_took_johnny_and_it_has_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5clk7a/saw_the_documentary_who_took_johnny_and_it_has_a/</a></p>

<p>Any more leads would be helpful I searched the forum there isn&#39;t a single post about these guys but i&#39;m sure with some digging we can connect them. Understandable this needs more investigating but seems like a reasonable place to start.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of censorship going on in that sub. Even though this sub seems to be influenced too, I weirdly have better luck finding new information here a lot of times than on voat, despite the fact that the whole point of moving to voat was to avoid censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm, either I missed it or it started showing up since you sent me that link. I&#39;ll go ahead and assume I just missed it.....</p>

<p>Either way, voat seems to be compromised. I&#39;m not one to go around calling people shills and assuming all weirdness = censorship, but I&#39;ve been noticing some mod power abuse over there.</p>

<p>Someone made a thread the other day about how mods are using their power to decide which stuff is important/relevant and deleting everything that doesn&#39;t fit into that, and then a mod removed that thread and moved it over to v/pizzagatewhatever. </p>

<p>Which I guess is understandable, except it&#39;s pretty convenient for the mods to remove all questioning of their use of power and change it to a sub that has like 1/20th the number of subscribers and way less traffic. I feel like the users of that sub would be interested in knowing if it&#39;s been compromised.</p>

<p>I wonder who all was with him that day?</p>

<p>I did find these few lines at the VERY end to be illuminating:</p>

<p>Rick Santorum, the 2014 GOP winner, visited 14 of the 70 Pizza Ranches in the state, located in small towns offering free meeting rooms attractive to most presidential campaigns. But the large crowds seen at Trump&#39;s Iowa events wouldn&#39;t fit into a Pizza Ranch ,so that&#39;s why Trump decided to make the unannounced visit 18 days from the caucus.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is the first candidate Pizza Ranch co-founder Adrie Groeneweg has endorsed.</p>

<p>“I believe that he says what he’s gonna do and he might be a little bit out there, but I’m tired of the politicians,&quot; Groeneweg said.</p>
