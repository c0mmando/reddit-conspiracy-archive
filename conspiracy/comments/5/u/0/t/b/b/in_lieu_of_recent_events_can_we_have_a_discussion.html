Effectively taking the country back instead of moving forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a <a href="http://theunexplained.tv/paranormal-podcasts/edition-285-elizabeth-greenwood-alexander-nekrassov">recent episode of The Unexplained podcast with Howard Hughes</a>, Howard interviewed <a href="http://www.politicalscrapbook.co.uk/alexandernekrassov/">Alexander Nekrassov</a> a former journalist and Kremlin advisor in the 1990&#39;s. He still provides source information to MSM news outlets. </p>

<p>Nekrassov maintained that the dossier was assembled in early 2016 for a fee of $130,000 (the exact figure may be slightly wrong and also may have been pounds he was talking about). He said that the dossier was essentially a collection of Moscow rumors, and he had hear similar rumors about David Cameron and Angela Merkle. His summary of the dossier was that it was complete bullshit. He also mentioned that while it was true Christopher Steele had contacts in Moscow he said that those contacts hadn&#39;t been active politically since the early 1990&#39;s and should be considered dubious sources. </p>

<p>Please listen to his interview and form your own opinion though, because I&#39;m probably missing all the interesting elements of the conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flynn resigned because the White House was given a transcript of his conversations with the Russian Diplomat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Officials said Mr. Pence had told others in the White House that he believed Mr. Flynn lied to him by saying he had not discussed the topic of sanctions on a call with the Russian ambassador in late December. Even the mere discussion of policy â€” and the apparent attempt to assuage the concerns of an American adversary before Mr. Trump took office â€” represented a remarkable breach of protocol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The F.B.I. had been examining Mr. Flynnâ€™s phone calls as he came under growing questions about his interactions with Russian officials and his management of the National Security Council. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The blackmail risk envisioned by the Justice Department would have stemmed directly from Mr. Flynnâ€™s attempt to cover his tracks with his bosses. The Russians knew what had been said on the call; thus, if they wanted Mr. Flynn to do something, they could have threatened to expose the lie if he refused.</p>

<p><strong>Do NOT let Flynn take the fall for this story</strong></p>

<p><strong>Current number of Resignations over Russia ties</strong> : <strong>3</strong>
Flynn, Manafort, Page.</p>

<p>-<strong>Info</strong>-</p>

<p><strong>The Intelligence Community</strong></p>

<p>Our own intel agencies and spies are withholding information from the White House because of the concern that it has been compromised by Russia :</p>

<p><strong>Trump</strong></p>

<p>Trump has a relationship with Putin, which he has denied in recent times:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/in-a-2013-interview-trump-said-i-do-have-a-relationship-with-vladimir-putin/">http://www.mediaite.com/tv/in-a-2013-interview-trump-said-i-do-have-a-relationship-with-vladimir-putin/</a></p>

<p>Trump recently defended Putin from being called a killer :</p>

<p>He&#39;s done this before :</p>

<p>Trump Dossier leaks. He&#39;s possibly being blackmailed:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier</a></p>

<p>Dossier claims possible gain of 19% share of Rosneft and not long after 19% is sold to a currently unknown party :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight-idUSKBN1582OH">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight-idUSKBN1582OH</a></p>

<p>The spy who created the Dossier is highly regarded and wouldn&#39;t just make things up:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/intelligence-sources-vouch-credibility-donald-trump-russia-dossier-author">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/intelligence-sources-vouch-credibility-donald-trump-russia-dossier-author</a></p>

<p>Multiple sources now confirm some of what was in the Dossier:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/10/politics/russia-dossier-update/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/10/politics/russia-dossier-update/index.html</a></p>

<p>Additionally financial incentives with Russia:</p>

<p>Trump tweeted the day after Flynn spoke with Russia :

<p>Recording equipment was turned off for Trumps call with Putin *anecdotal need confirmation :</p>

<p><strong>Russia</strong></p>

<p>Russia confirms it had communication with Trump during campaign. : </p>

<p>Russia purges people in charge of intel (FSB). Multiple arrests:</p>

<p>Trump campaign specifically pushes pro-Putin move to Republican platform (Under Manafort) :</p>

<p>An interesting bit of data related to Killed or wounded in action numbers of Ukraine/DNR forces in the Donbass region for 2017 so far (If anyone can find a reliable source for this data please let me know, I can only seem to find &quot;an uptick in aggression&quot; without numbers.) :</p>

<p><strong>Flynn ( National Security Advisor)</strong> - RESIGNED</p>

<p>Seemingly has a relationship with Putin :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/21/trumps-national-security-adviser-pick-raises-serious-questions-about-putins-influence-over-us-policy.html">http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/21/trumps-national-security-adviser-pick-raises-serious-questions-about-putins-influence-over-us-policy.html</a></p>

<p>And apparently discussed sanctions with Russia:</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/318939-top-intel-dem-says-flynn-should-be-removed-if-he-talked-sanctions-with">http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/318939-top-intel-dem-says-flynn-should-be-removed-if-he-talked-sanctions-with</a></p>

<p>The White House knew about Flynn communication with Russia : </p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-warned-white-house-that-flynn-could-be-vulnerable-to-russian-blackmail-officials-say/2017/02/13/fc5dab88-f228-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-warned-white-house-that-flynn-could-be-vulnerable-to-russian-blackmail-officials-say/2017/02/13/fc5dab88-f228-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html</a></p>

<p>Flynn has now resigned (right after the above article was posted) : </p>

<p><strong>Manafort (Former Trump Campaign Advisor)</strong> - RESIGNED</p>

<p>Seemingly has ties to Russia (and was paid by Russia) : </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html</a></p>

<p>FBI was looking into this</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-making-inquiry-ex-trump-campaign-manager-s-foreign-ties-n675881">http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-making-inquiry-ex-trump-campaign-manager-s-foreign-ties-n675881</a></p>

<p>Truth about Manafort coming out angered Russia : </p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/russia-ukraine-trump-manafort-232101">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/russia-ukraine-trump-manafort-232101</a></p>

<p><strong>Tillerson (Trump Secretary of State)</strong></p>

<p>Tillerson gets put as Sec of State, has a relationship with Putin:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-rex-tillerson-vladimir-putin-russia-exxon-2016-12">http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-rex-tillerson-vladimir-putin-russia-exxon-2016-12</a></p>

<p>Right after Tillerson is confirmed House removes transparency rule :</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vox.com/2017/2/1/14477314/oil-companies-disclosure-rule-tillerson">http://www.vox.com/2017/2/1/14477314/oil-companies-disclosure-rule-tillerson</a></p>

<p><strong>DNC Hack</strong></p>

<p>Russia was directly responsible for the hack according to all government sources we have and additional independent sources that worked on behalf of the DNC. We&#39;ve since announced sanctions and additional retaliation for those actions.</p>

<p>If we see sanctions getting rolled back at all its more or less the final nail in the coffin. Everything since the Dossier seems to confirm the info in the Dossier. Or we just happen to have an awful lot of Russia ties for seemingly no reason at all.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russia-eyes-sending-snowden-u-s-gift-trump-official-n718921">http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russia-eyes-sending-snowden-u-s-gift-trump-official-n718921</a></p>

<p>Recommended reading (Opinion piece by a well-known, pro-American hacker) :</p>

<p><a href="https://jesterscourt.cc/2017/01/28/russian-infiltration-us-federal-government/">https://jesterscourt.cc/2017/01/28/russian-infiltration-us-federal-government/</a></p>

<p><strong>Are we still doubting that Dossier? Or is the Flynn resignation due to a Russia scandal enough to start getting through to people to maybe take it a bit more seriously?</strong></p>

<p><em>Will update if I remember any additional info or people provide anything, or fix anything incorrect</em></p>

<li><p>Why does this top secret intelligence report look like it could have been typed up by anyone with Microsoft Word. No letterhead, no specialized font. I could replicate this on my computer right now. It doesn&#39;t say what organization this report belongs to. I&#39;m assuming this top secret intelligence report belongs to Buzzfeed.</p></li>
<li><p>Why does virtually all of the evidence mentioned in the report come down to hearsay from the same vague &quot;top level Russian insider&quot; or &quot;senior figure within Kremlin&quot; or &quot;Trump associate&quot; type sources that our intelligence agencies use and have been using for decades to sell disinformation to us.</p></li>
<li><p>Apparently, our intelligence community has been collecting communications between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that have been going on &quot;at least 8 years&quot; and they couldn&#39;t attach a few emails or something? They couldn&#39;t release to the MSM a few soundbites? Apparently there is a mountain of evidence out there but we are just supposed to rely again on a report filled with hearsay. </p></li>
<li><p>At one point the report just says &quot;further evidence of extensive conspiracy between Trump&#39;s campaign team and Kremlin&quot; and the only evidence laid out is claims and allegations by an &quot;ethnic Russian close associate of US republican presidential candidate Donald Trump&quot;, and another separate anonymous source, who isn&#39;t even fitted with any description. If this is all the evidence it takes to launch a serious investigation over something, then surely there are TONS of other conspiracies out there that should merit the same amount of seriousness. Shit, I mean there&#39;s more evidence for aliens hanging out in Antarctica than evidence being brought out in this report.</p></li>
<li><p>To all the shills, I am not a Trump supporter. I&#39;m thirsty for actual evidence on this thing, but this report looks like more of the same b.s. peddled by the same agencies who have been majorly lying to us in the same way for years. And this is really weak &quot;evidence&quot; considering there&#39;s supposedly 8 years worth of communications out there. </p></li>
<li><p>Also, how is our president colluding with Russia over policy any worse than how our presidents colluded with Israel, and Saudi Arabia, over policy when Israel is content with widespread war in the Arab world and the Saudis have an unacceptable record when it comes to women&#39;s rights (and human rights in general).</p></li>
<li><p>This whole Trump and Putin thing I think would raise more alarm to groups who don&#39;t really know about America&#39;s own past interference in foreign elections, and America&#39;s own &quot;cultivation&quot; of world leaders, and who prefer to see modern society simply as TRUMP=BAD. And who can blame them when it&#39;s literally all that anyone is talking about. </p></li>

<p>What makes you sure there isn&#39;t more to the report than what was leaked? </p>

<p>SUre it&#39;s hearsay but that&#39;s what a lot of intel is until it&#39;s not hearsay and/or people die.  Much of the chronology of the reports have been confirmed and some of the characters have died or gone missing.   One was thought to be the source of much of it and Steele went into hiding until the press started taking it more seriously.  </p>
