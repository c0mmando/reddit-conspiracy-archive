    <div class="md"><p>Man, if you believe in pizza gate or anything for that matter based on rumors you should probably step back and take a long look at how low you have sunk. Yes child molestation is real and yes human trafficking exist we know this because  we have seen it in real life so there is proof to the claims , but if you can believe some random people who lie about other random people then your probably just as sick in your head to certain extent as the person starting the lie. I&#39;m sorry guys but pizza gate is fake and if you still believe it&#39;s real you are probably diluted and or a victim of a child molester or you are a child molester or thinking about molesting a child either way your sensationalizing this shit to make it a norm </p>

However, I try not to deal in absolutes and anyone paying attention can see that pizzagate itself is being used to gas-light the larger conspiracy community as well as deflect from the real and damaging contents of the Podesta emails.</p>

<p>This is a subject that I&#39;ve never publicly commented on and yet, when discussing the DNC with my Democrat friends and the need for Brazile to go.. I am called a paranoid conspiracy theorist and then everyone begins making fun of pizzagate when all I&#39;ve mentioned was WL emails and Donna Brazile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really care what your opinion of this sub is. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has never been partisan, and any attempt to suggest that is misleading.<br/>
I&#39;m reminded of when James Clapper lied to congress about warrantless spying on Americans. He&#39;s a traitor, and where is he now?<br/>
Compare that to Flynn who admitted lying to the vice president about talking to a diplomat and resigned.<br/>
And yet you suggest this bullshit development is more important than anything else?<br/>
Have you considered that Flynn was vocally against funding ISIS? Are you even aware that the US government has been funding the same terrorist groups that we claim to be fighting?<br/>
You can&#39;t shovel your CIA horse shit here, not on my thread. Well you can but I will take the time to open your mind, because this sub is about freedom of inquiry, keeping an open mind, and remaining critical of the power elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I&#39;m aware the us government funds terrorists - im not from r/all, I&#39;ve been subscribed for a long time. I&#39;m literally from a county, you guys fucked over.

<p>This &quot;bullshit development&quot; is not the most important thing. In my opinion, global warming (you know an actual basically unstoppable existential threat) is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying its the most relevant thing at the moment. Stop moving the goalposts. You keep claiming arguments I never made. Here are my points in a succinct format.</p>

<p>1) There is a conspiracy which is literally the current hot news piece and dominating r/all. It was even reported on the radio here.</p>

<p>2) said conspiracy was &quot;problematic&quot; enough that it resulted in Flynn resigning (your opinion doesn&#39;t matter in this, that&#39;s a fact)</p>

<p>3) and what did we see in r/conspiracy in this time? Attacks on the party not even involved in said conspiracy.</p>

<p>Realise when I say this place is partisan that I have no dog in this fight. I just vehemently hate people that lie to others (and usually themselves as well). And that&#39;s why I&#39;m calling out this BS</p>

<p>I&#39;m a progressive and a Bernie supporter and I have found this sub to be pretty nonpartisan. But if you do feel this is Donald 2.0 you may want to ask yourself, what happened to Reddit where a large portion of the population aren&#39;t able to express their views in more mainstream subs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nigga please, where did I say this sub should report politics. This is about this sub not paying attention to objectively the most concrete conspiracy theory currently occupying the airwaves. The establishment is largely comprised of those in power ie the current republican party, so consider that before you start screaming about narratives.</p>

<p>This sub has shown a flagrant bias against conversations negative about the donald despite his close links to many conspiracy theories (the dossier being tagged in this sub? thats highly irregular) and the fact that they are the establishment, just doubles down on the fact that this sub is going out of their way to not discuss it.</p>

<p>I dont come here for political news. I come here to see other view points, but recently all Ive seen here is one very particular view point. And anytime that viewpoint is challenged, cries of shilling</p>

<p>Its not even that I believed the dossier or any of it but the fact that conversations about it were so quickly shut down in this sub was a tell-tale sign of either that bias or that this sub is compromised. Hell my posts just recently went negative guess I triggered someone.</p>

<p>FFS, to quote the guy I was actually arguing against</p>

<blockquote>
<p>long time <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> people do not believe, they simply doubt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where has any of that doubt been, recently? Theres a very present double standard here where republican conspiracies receive all the doubt and democratic conspiracies receive all the belief. When they should all be treated with doubt, but of course the best person to lecture me on bias is someone so clearly against HRC. Like maybe consider for just a second before you cry hes supporting the narrative that I (an outside viewer) am actually able to more clearly see that bias. You know like how judges arent suppose to know the defendants in a court case. FFS I didnt even know which party was which until reddit became some political warground with Sanders4persident fucking up r/all</p>

<p>You say that but you&#39;re complaining that the views expressed here aren&#39;t the same as the views expressed on the rest of reddit.  So are you coming here for different views or are you coming here looking for a specific agenda?</p>

<p>The rest of reddit, and most of mainstream media, is extremely partisan.  But the views expressed in r/conspiracy, for the most part, do not match the views of mainstream media. That&#39;s because this is, for the most part, a nonpartisan sub.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not complaining that the views here aren&#39;t the same. I&#39;m complaining that the views here are so homogenous. I dont mind the views here (if I actually had a problem with the views themselves, I&#39;d unsubscribe). Its the lack of debate that is worrying.</p>

<p>In all honesty, the best sub I&#39;ve seen for politics is asktrumpsupporters. Yeah sometimes the questions are quite obviously loaded. But that sub is even more nonpartisan than this sub since debate of ideas is encouraged.</p>

<p>The big problem here is two fold IMO 1) the vastly different coverage/exposure of conspiracies (this may just be to the user base largely being from the_donald, so that is maybe unavoidable) and 2) the thing that actually worries me, that discourse is so vehemently discouraged here - look at this thread. Its literally a thread complaining about the fact that there was a challenge to this subs viewpoint. For a sub that is suppose to be about questioning commonly held beliefs that&#39;s disgustingly hypocritical. And its every time something gets questioned that these threads get posted.</p>

<p>Lastly nonpartisan does not mean opposite of mainstream media. Yeah I agree, the mainstream media is quite clearly biased against trump - that&#39;s obvious. Non partisan means that things are approached equally for each party ie in for example the story at hand. If it had not been trumps appointment Flynn, but hrcs appointment how would this sub have reacted? And be honest, you know this sub would&#39;ve lost their shit (rightfully so). But there is no indignation now because its the subs favourite team that was caught cheating and not their enemies. Take it back a week and devos&#39;s nomination? If hrc was (as she has been accused of in the past) basically taking a bribe for a nomination - that&#39;s a straight conspiracy that would&#39;ve received a crazy amount of attention. If hrc had a Goldman Sachs advisor?</p>

<p>All these are conspiracies involving nepotism (effectively cheating the american public) that would rightfully have been used to condemn her. But those stories&#39; treatment in this sub is very different from that, right? Because its the party this sub currently likes that are the ones clearly behaving in these dodgy ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s interesting because I&#39;ve had quite a different experience of this sub.  The reason I come here is because it&#39;s so progressive and it reminds me a lot of r/politics before the shills took over.  For example, this sub is pro-environment, pro-marijuana, anti-war, anti-surveillance state, and so on.  Those aren&#39;t conservative views.  </p>

<p>But I&#39;ve noticed that there&#39;s a concerted effort to brand this sub pro-Donald, and to shit on the sub in general.  That&#39;s what this thread is about; it&#39;s not complaining that there was a &quot;challenge to the sub&#39;s viewpoint,&quot; it&#39;s complaining that every time a post from this sub hits r/all, all the top comments are shills shitting on this sub, and trying to brand it trump 2.0.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because if people think this is pro-Trump, then it&#39;s much easier for others to dismiss the views here.  But, like I said before, this sub is actually has a lot of progressive elements. At the very least, it&#39;s nonpartisan and independent.  </p>

<p>Anyone who has been paying attention knew about Flynn&#39;s call. I don&#39;t even think people are down playing it, if he was rooted out for his ties to Russia then he should be out. It&#39;s not a conspiracy, it is how the government should run. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question for anyone on here. Are there any solutions?</p>

<p>This feels like the start of a much bigger trend... or to be more specific, over the last couple of years, corporations have realized the importance of having an <del>astroturfing</del> &quot;reputation management&quot; group constantly monitoring the major social media sites and taking action as necessary. </p>

<p>Some of these groups are more pro-active than others (some actively push agendas rather than just playing defense), but if we follow this to it&#39;s logical conclusion, every major company/interest-group is going to have it&#39;s own shill-army at some point the same way that every major company has it&#39;s own PR and lobbying firms.</p>

<p>So what are the solutions? Assuming that Reddit gave a shit, how would they protect genuine human conversation and weed out corporate shillery?</p>

<p>I genuinely can&#39;t think of a great answer short of using some sort of freaky biometrics/ID-verification to tag which users are &quot;free&quot; individuals and which users represent companies that they are on payroll for... and that&#39;s obviously a terrible idea. </p>

<p>Constant migration of the place that we discuss this shit is one option... but that obviously puts a damper on exposure/awareness... and every time we gather enough minds in one spot, the shills will inevitably show up and dillute/distract/disinform.</p>

<p>Is there any way to fix this or is this simply the new norm? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think about this all the time too. We used to have to have the freedom to have open discussion and conflicting ideas on the internet, and naturally when these ideas battle it out in debate, the ones that hold the most truth rise to the top. It&#39;s a feature of free speech that if you take every possible position and throw them out there, the people will argue amongst themsevles until this most &quot;correct&quot; (true to the natural order) ideas win out. This is what happens on forums with little/no moderation, like /pol/. </p>

<p>But now the government and companies that limited our free speech in real life, telling us what we are allowed to say or not, and which thoughts are acceptable to have, they&#39;ve infiltrated the digital world. They realised they were losing their grip on the narrative because people were able to communicate freely through the internet, and the lies and false truths were being destroyed on the digital stage.</p>

<p>When they realised this is what was bringing down their narrative, and contributed to their defeats with brexit and trump, they went into full panic mode and are attempting to re-take control. They have found each platform that was damaging their narrative, and are now actively attempting to subvert or destroy these platforms.</p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve been found, there&#39;s no turning back. They&#39;ve begun with their inflitration and they won&#39;t stop until the threat is neutralised.  It was like we had a secret club in a treehouse that no one really perceived as a threat, but now that it&#39;s bitten them in the ass, they realise we&#39;re a much bigger deal than they thought and we need to be shut down. These guys have all the money, manpower and secret information, they can infiltrate any website and take over admin control, threaten and bribe owners and completely flood comments and slide ideas out.</p>

<p>As long as there&#39;s a constant threat to them and a steady influx of money we won&#39;t be able to fight them with the power they have. Right now they&#39;re just getting started, but when they get serious and really amp shit up, we can say goodbye to the free speech we used to have on the internet; these times will be remembered as the golden years before TPTB took control. Reddit and 4chan will be fondly looked back on as places where we were able to speak our minds, but eventually died to the shills and subversion. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to defeat them, I don&#39;t think we can. </p>

Sure it&#39;s in their vest interest for our corrupt officials, which is most of the infrastructure of our country, to go to jail, but for us, if they happen to be corrupt (like pedo corrupt), then its good for us to.</p>

<p>When did Trump stop being a joke, like he was for years until this election?  What has he done, that&#39;s not pro corporate?  Please explain to me why he is the savior some seem to think he is?  Because when one looks at the facts, objectively, he doesn&#39;t come off like a great guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be my TL;DR summary as well. Volunteer mods are singled out and harassed. One by one as they burn out when it starts to be less fun and move. New mods are brought on to handle the load providing opportunity for additional biased actors to step in. Antagonistic role shifts to the new mods, more senior take a step back to preserve seniority of the mod account. When balance of power swings every decision including whether to kick volunteer mods becomes lets-vote-majority-rules. And at the end of the day you get your compromised sub with ambiguous rules that can be used to remove any content on whim.</p>

<p>The brigade flood of controlled commentary and voting is the new layer that completely breaks function of reddit as noticeably as Digg 2.0. Given the relative quiet out of the admin camp on the matter I find myself pondering whether this is what the new monetization strategy is for the site. Has site development been focused on facilitating organizations with hooks for their tools? VIP tier access if you will? Having trouble seeing the site become so warped without visible comment or steps taken by the admin team to respond to the brigade unless they are in some way complicit.</p>

<p>Sad day but that&#39;s the Internet. There were rooms to communicate authentically before and there will be forums to communicate authentically again.</p>

<p>Obviously shills exist but to the non-paranoiac brain it&#39;s obvious that they will always be outnumbered and outvoted by the massive base of actual users. The simple answer is that when a post hits <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> people from outside your carefully curated thought-bubble get in and say things that don&#39;t fit your narrative.</p>

<p>Sorry if that&#39;s triggering for you. This sub hasn&#39;t always been an echo chamber and I think it&#39;s a breath of fresh air to see outsiders interacting with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> content. It expands our horizons and theirs, regardless of who you think is right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long time lurker, posting on an alt account because everything in this sub has gotten so personal and combative lately. </p>

<p>I think the term &#39;shill&#39; is one of the worst things to happen in this sub. We know that CTR was a real thing, and that it still exists in other forms. This is true and undeniable.</p>

<p>However, I cannot express how discouraging it is when I see people on this sub raising some legitimate doubts, expressing the same reservations I myself feel, getting turned on and accused of being corporate shills. It&#39;s stifling discussion around here, it&#39;s shutting down discourse.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the height of arrogance to assume that the only way someone could disagree with your view is if they are paid to do so. It&#39;s also counterproductive to understanding someone else&#39;s perspective,  and broadening your own point of view. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also extremely polarizing. I&#39;ve often heard it said, around here even,  that Americans (of which I am not one) have been manipulated into an us vs. them mentality, and that seems to be exactly what has happened on this sub. Both sides calling each other shills, becoming further and further polarized, alienating each other with a &#39;if you&#39;re not with us, you&#39;re (a corporate shill paid to be) against us&#39;. America&#39;s politics dominate this sub.</p>

<p>Reddit might be compromised, but it doesn&#39;t take a massive conspiracy to do it. It just takes mutual fear and hatred to turn people against each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then they&#39;ve succeeded, because the term &#39;shill&#39; gets thrown out whenever anyone seems to disagree around here. People have to understand that human beings can legitimately and honestly have widely differing or even directly opposing viewpoints, without being paid to do so. Do you have any idea how crazy it seems to the rest of the world that America has elected a reality TV businessman to one of the most important positions in the world? That doesn&#39;t mean we assume you were paid to do so! </p>

<p>The term &#39;shill&#39; is useless, because even if there are people paid to post certain views, it is almost 100% certain there are other people who hold those views honestly. Engage the ideas, attack and defend sources and logic. </p>

<p>Or don&#39;t. Keep fighting and turning on each other, for all the good that will do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question. I guess it&#39;s the unique fucked up phenomenon that is the Trump presidency. For example, the Republican party has become divided on Trump. Similarly, many of the loudest democrats voted for the appointments because they are acceptable to the donor class. Now Tillerson was not an easy appointment. Many establishment politicians spoke out against him, particularly McCain and Graham on the republican side. What&#39;s going on here?<br/>
I would suggest that corporate power has infected both parties to varying degrees.<br/>
I would not be surprised if Bannon etc. started their own paid network of shills to influence the various forums. But at this point, the Trump supporters have been gullible and disciplined enough to keep the online thing going. Perhaps when Trump is revealed to be completely full of shit, the Republican party will start astro-turfing. For now, there&#39;s plenty of useful idiots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HailCorporate shills were here long long before CTR/CA.</p>

<p>Money and motive. It&#39;s a form of advertising / PR and it will continue to be as long as it&#39;s effective. I don&#39;t see any way it could ever be made illegal (for corporations that is - political campaigns are using a loophole in campaign finance regs). I also don&#39;t really see any way anon platforms can avoid this problem. They just don&#39;t have to endorse it like reddit does.</p>

<p>Free thought and discussion exists on fringe sites. Nobody will spend money on shill PR programs on sites with small userbases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the case of the primary influx resulting whenever the Russian stuff is brought up, I doubt many who consider themselves conspiracy theorists give it much credit. Anyone who does, isn&#39;t a shill persay (I&#39;m sure theres some) but they completely miss the point that conspiracy theories by their very nature are crowdsourced. Any media outlet telling us something is laughable. We need only look at the IRAQ WMD for undeniable proof of never trusting whats being TOLD to us. </p>

<p>Pizzagate meanwhile is the perfect example of crowdsourced theory. Countless individuals have worked on compiling information related to the subject. The validity should only be left up to the individual if they wish to understand it. </p>

<p>Its bordering on common knowledge that the United States intelligence agencies have zero credibility. We should question EVERYTHING they do or say. </p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not foolish enough not to call out confirmation bias. If we started having MSM cover Pizzagate many would jump for joy, but of course we have to question their motives as well. </p>

<p>tl;dr conspiracy is largely crowdsourced - question everything, always. </p>

<p>In all honesty, I don&#39;t think there is any safe haven on the Internet that has not been compromised by some outside party.  Sites like this that get cited on the MSM are beholden to the same rules as other platforms with a very public figure and role.</p>
