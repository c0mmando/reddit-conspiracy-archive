       The Flynn post has dozens of posts that consistently repeat the same three bullet points, even in reply to other posts "XYZ, reply: You're right, XYZ is so true"
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, disclaimer:
       <em>
        this isn't an accusation of brigading or shilling
       </em>
       .  Moreover I don't want or expect the mods to do anything about it.  And I hope the discussion here is open.  We all have to admit that it's totally valid that some people might be sincerely frustrated with the abundant defense of Trump here.  I will defend him, because I was on board with the evidence of neocon coups in Syria and Ukraine and so ill naturally defend peacemaking.  But that doesn't mean every conspiracy theorist would agree.  So all discussion is welcome, and I acknowledge that many might be sincerely frustrated.  That said, I also think there are people out there with an agenda to control and censor public speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Michael Flynn's resignation is "the biggest conspiracy of the ruling government ever".  It's "a huge conspiracy".  "A new level of evil".  "You'd think the biggest conspiracy around."  "The only actually true conspiracy to ever have happened."  And this sub is "the_donald lite", "trump fanatics who scream and plug their ears", "Russian agents", "people who want to see America become Russia 2"
      </p>
      <p>
       Suffice it to say, these claims seem to me to be a big hysterical and also somewhat illiterate of quite vast and evil conspiracies that are totally true that have happened in the US government.  Oh like the time we fed radioactive oatmeal to retarded kids to see how long they could live.  Or the time we supported a dictator and directly sanctioned the slaughter of hundreds of thousands in indonesia for the sake of a gold mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) OMG Pizzagate is all we talk about
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, we do talk about it.  It might be fake, but there is some compelling and creepy shit.  There are pedophile rings in the US, government agencies have committed evil crimes in the past, and some of that art like the hairy bald teeth monsters invading kids beds or the red bottom spanked kids in the shower is creepy as hell.  Sorry, but it's a damn damn good conspiracy.  We get into trends here, from Antarctica to aliens to sandy hook and 9/11.  This is a conspiracy sub not r/corruptpoliticsdiscussion.  So seeing as how Pizzagate is banned in other subs, the actual Pizzagate sub itself was banned completely, a bunch of people complaining that one little wacky conspiracy sub is talking about it seems like it's inspired by a desire to prevent anyone from ever taking about it.  Just from a proportionality perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Mods suck and love Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Um, so because the mods don't ban Pizzagate, or don't somehow censure users who defend Trump, or something, they're shills?  More like this is an effort to put pressure for the mods to start acting as censors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, these three talking points seem so disproportionate to reality, so strongly and consistent advanced since the Flynn resignation, it has the appearance of a brigade.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to discuss whether or not my sense of proportionality is good here.

       Well we have to be careful.  I don't want to say that a certain talking point is in and of itself illegitimate and a shill point, because I don't want to shut down discussion.  But that's why I've decided to focus on proportionality.

       Well and as I said, it's very compelling.  Not that it's proven, hat that it has major implications and is connected to other theories.  Plus the creepy art and videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, this is par for the course for a conspiracy sub which is about inductive reasoning, narrative smashing and rebuilding, and not deductive courtroom valid logical proofs of criminality and corruption.

       And the creepy websites, I'll never forget the chills (no pun intended) I got when visiting one of Comet's "friends" website.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing was pretty fresh, Alefantis hadn't even went public by then, and the web page is pretty different now and it doesn't include "friends".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure someone here might remember it, it was apparently a pizza place or something, the webpage was apparently made in the early 90s because it was freaking ugly, but it had information about 2016 events.
      </p>
      <p>
       The page consisted in three background layers that appeared in every page of the site, one had a drawing of a baby, the other one a drawing of a hot dog, and the other one a drawing of a goat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was looking through their page and I really felt like I shouldn't be there, it was creepy as fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would a pizza place in 2016 had a webpage that looks like it was made in the 90s and made me feel like I was doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing? that was creepy as fuck.

       You have power. You control your perspective of reality. Others may push a narrative but you don't have to let that be your reality. Identify useless conversation/ideas by the way it is delivered and ignore it. Question everything!

       It is so funny to open up every single thread and see:
      </p>
      <p>
       "This won't be discussed because it's not Pizzagate and this is r/the_d2".

       I feel like that's regurgitated more than any other pro-Trump point on here.

       Maybe if they all stopped repeating the same lines about Trump fans in every thread and actually talked about conspiracies, then Pizzagate wouldn't dominate here.

       Thanks for expressing how so many of us feel. I don't think Trump is perfect but anyone with critical thought knows this Russia narrative is being pushed by the establishment - so when Flynn's resignation is brigaded in this sub with comments belittling "pizzagaters" then it's pretty fucking obvious ShareBlue had a hand in it.

       Interesting.  Do you have metrics to analyze their flair behavior?  Also, is it a big deal as long as posts and voting themselves aren't manipulated.

       I don't right now but the last discussion brought out that this flair was highly unusual, as in only ever done 1 or 2 times.

      <p>
       It matters because we have completely outrageous posts here that get zero flair at all, this is a mod(s) attempting to alter the perception of a post.

       Dude, you summed up pretty much all of my feelings. The problem today, I feel, is that most people can't have a discussion about an opposing viewpoint without getting emotional and irrational. My main point I always try to emphasize to people is to just look at the facts don't just trust everything you hear. Like you said about pizzagate, it might be fake. Personally, I think there is almost too much "coincidental evidence" for it to not have at least some level of truth to it. But yeah, I feel like your points are totally correct, and I hope the mods continue to not cave in to the pressure, I don't understand how these people think restricting people's free speech is good. It only forces you into to an echo chamber so you disregard any thoughts you don't already agree with. Anyways, keep thinking freely and using your mind, the positive is I feel like more and more people are beginning to have this mindset. Peace is always the goal and we can only get there with more open-minded individuals. Thanks for the good read!

       Pretty much summed it up for me. All people that only come here when it hits r/all, then just keep spouting that "this is the biggest conspiracy ever, you guys should be all over this" and PG8 hate. If they hadn't of banned that sub in the first place it wouldn't be like this. Obviously, people that don't come here often wouldn't know that.

       I was referring to a screen shot of the front page right now not monthly stats. 
I'm sure if one looked at the highest voted monthly posts many would be a result of brigades opening the floodgates of r/politics tourists for drive by sneering and degrading.

       As to the Russian boogerman stories...
I think people are seeing an effort from the Deep State and alphabet agencies to dismantle your government.
      </p>
      <p>
       People should dig in because there is more to the story than your gleeful corporate media is letting on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is nice that these stories are being discussed here now and the magaheads can't stifle everything yet the narrative change has just swung the pendulum to the other side with the Shareblue brigade emboldening the Hillary and r/politics freaks to pour in and tell everyone who posts here what morons and rubes they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no discernment or honest discourse just partisan smearing and jeering.
       <br/>
       It will die down when all of the tourists from politics and t-d head back to their echo-chambers for that sweet affirmation of their personal correctness leaving this place scarred and de-legitimized.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end partisan political operators do not want an unbiased thinking ground where the defective products they promote are open to harsh criticism.

       I could make the same argument about this sub being overrun with posts like these since the Flynn thing as well. Half of the front page of this sub is "why is this now a pro-Hillary" sub, "notice all the comments are people talking shit about this sub", "Mike Flynn was unfairly forced out", "Yates leaked Flynn conversation" etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything to me it looks like a concerted effort to discredit and slide the Flynn-Russia conspiracy off the sub.

       Was Flynn's action inappropriate?  How does it fit in the context of the State Department of 2 years ago lying that the US doesn't overthrow governments, and the media covering up the US role in overthrowing Ukraine's elected government?
