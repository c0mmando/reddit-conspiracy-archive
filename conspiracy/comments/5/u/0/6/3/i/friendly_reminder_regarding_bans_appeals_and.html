        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">286</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/AssuredlyAThrowAway.html">AssuredlyAThrowAway</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TL;DR: Be cordial in your comments, and especially in your appeals to bans. If you are banned feel free to appeal via the modmail. Depending on your attitude and previous behavior on the sub we may unban you, depending on context.  </p>

<p>To all <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users, the mod team would like to give a reminder regarding forum behavior across all mediums, although we have this sub in mind when making our suggestions.  </p>

<p>By way of easy introduction, all subreddits have their rules for commenting or posting listed on their side-bar to the right. The mod team expects that users will have read and familiarized themselves with the sidebar rules before posting. Mobile reddit users are recommended to view them on a desktop version of the page. If you break these community rules, our mod team has agreed that a ban will be up to the individual mod who implemented the punishment (where possible) while appeals will usually be subject to a full panel review.  </p>

<p>This sub, as listed in our tag-line, is about free thought. However, civility is the enabling condition for free discussion and to that end we will do our best to ensure that such an ethos is protected.</p>

<p>So please, weigh out your arguments for any position you may hold on a topic in a manner that doesn&#39;t include attacks, insults, doxxing, or otherwise callous and rude behavior. This, naturally, applies to ban appeals as well.  Insulting us in modmail is not usually the best way to go about an appeal.  </p>

<p>We have thousands of regular users, a handful of mods, and an uncountable number of lurkers as well. In general, we feel some new users are not aware of the general thought patterns here and polite explanation is a far better approach for all than abusive or outright dismissive rejection. Understanding can only be furthered by rational conversation.<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">Always remember the Golden Rule.</a>  </p>

<p>As a parting reminder, many people may have moments where their behavior no longer reflects the standards of rationality they would wish to uphold as a general maxim, and this certainly applies to mods as well. If we can all strive to keep our cool, maintain a level-head, and display good manners then the mod team feels this subreddit will not only continue to exist, but will begin to thrive on reddit despite many years of organized resistance by detractors.  </p>

<p>Thanks, and lets continue to seek out the truths of our shared reality together.  </p>

<p>Secondly, if someone attacks you the best thing to do is report the incident to the modmail. Replying to attacks with more vitriol will end up with both parties being banned.</p>

<p>Can you send a reply to your ban message?</p>

<p>If you did indeed submit the comment by accident 5 times in a row, we are happy to overturn the ban.</p>

<p>We very much appreciate people like yourself who take time to engage in good faith, well reasoned, discussion and we&#39;ll do whatever we can to ensure you&#39;re not banned again in the future due to an accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on final warning for calling a dude a @$!?&amp;%# racist €#%¥! like 3 times in one thread. (Granted, the 2nd &amp; third insults were downright <em>European</em> in creativity.) Then the warning-happy mod who didn&#39;t like my {ahem} colorful descriptives resigned. </p>

<p>Then, I went for like ever not knowing I was on final warning til I insulted another mod. (To be fair, I was unaware he was a mod, and I miiiiight have been a tiny bit high.) Said mod was all, &quot;check yourself, final warning, girl.&quot; Major <em>oh-snap</em> moment right there! </p>

<p>THEN, I was like, &quot;final warning sucks,&quot; and he said contact the mod who quit. I did &amp; ex-mod said pretty much, &quot;idk you, pleb.&quot; </p>

<p>So now - I am fast &amp; loose on final warning, all hangin&#39; halfway off the cliff. I&#39;m not appealing or anything, just thought you guys might find this story amusing. I promise to be extra nice when y&#39;all ban me for calling some idiot a @&amp;$&lt;%* or a €£¥<sup>+#!</sup> </p>

<p>It&#39;s all good. I generally behave. I&#39;ll appeal if/when I ever need to. :) </p>

<p>In fact, many many users have a problem with that moderator in question, and I have been approached by them repeatedly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve spoken with him directly as well, and we agree to disagree, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the behavior was in my eyes, out of line. Many people would concur.</p>

<p>How does silencing the user base on the topic of how they are being treated by their own moderators represent <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in any way?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Participating on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> without being banned is actually pretty easy - I managed it for years despite having comments/posts removed, and disagreeing strongly with certain mods on occasion.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t noticed, this sub has been under attack since just before the US elections. We have had to ban an unprecedented number of (mostly unknown) users for abuse and attacking the sub during this 3-4 month period. It has got to the stage where there is very little tolerance for users who break Rule 10. </p>

There should be a level of both that are tolerated though, and it&#39;s up to the mods to decide who&#39;s crossing the line. Shills should be banned instantly and without warning, but a couple guys going back and forth ruthlessly should just be warned. Mods aren&#39;t attack dogs or law enforcement agents.

    <div class="md"><p>+1 -- this is why we (the mod team) sort of dont really reply to people bitching about &quot;this sub is no longer about conspiracies -- its all about <strong><em>[Whatever now!!!1]</em></strong></p>

<p>The thing is - we are mods who, as this actual thread is all about, are trying to keep the overall container of this community civil, interesting and, as much as possible, not fucked - for lack of a better term... <em>however</em> -- reddit is all about user submitted content. If you don&#39;t see what content you want here, then it&#39;s actually your obligation as a /u/ to submit that which you would like sen/discussed.</p>

<p>participate.... </p>

<p>For years, though, myself and likely thousands of others wish we could have sub /r/r/ (e.g.; <a href="/r/conspiracy/UFOs">/r/conspiracy/UFOs</a>) and allow for buckets of content like that....</p>

<p>We can do filters, but I, personally, would like to be able to filter like the above, and then allow people to unsubscribe from any sub-/r/ they don&#39;t like... and then others can go to <a href="/r/conspiracy/all/">/r/conspiracy/all/</a> to see everything.... but yeah...</p>

<p>Anyway - just so you know we mods do talk about these issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whiny? And that coming from a mod. Wow. I am trying to state facts and reply to people. Look at the comments again if you want. And I am on topic because shill-calling is in fact a problem here. Discrediting opinions like that is counterproductive for healthy discussions. Did I hit a nerve with mentioning Trump? I apologize to you then, if that&#39;s the case. But that won&#39;t change the fact that blindly following Trump or any &quot;leader&quot; in this regard, is a very bad idea.</p>

<p>Paid online operatives may be real, but there is zero way to prove someone is or isn&#39;t one. It&#39;s all based off of their beliefs. So, if I try debunking PizzaGate, does that mean I&#39;m a Clinton paid operative working to cover up the crime for her?</p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible to prove or disprove someone&#39;s a paid shill. Moreover, what is the net benefit of this? Are most shill accusations right or wrong? I&#39;d wager most are wrong, so they end up hurting overall discourse rather than stopping real shills. </p>

<p>I think the issue with that topic in particular, is that those who make arguments which suggest that &quot;there is nothing to see there&quot; are seen as being sympathetic to pedophiles, which tends to inflame emotions and makes rational discourse exceedingly difficult.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, what is the net benefit of this? </p>

<p>I think the user base and the mod team feel that an environment which is hostile to potential paid subversion benefits the sub as a whole by engendering the standing of the individual person in the discursive process; even in the face of massive amounts of capitol being spent by those working at Eglin, TRRIG, Hasbara, etc...</p>

<p>From my research on Russian astroturfing, it seems a VPN is used to make the account look like it&#39;s coming elsewhere.</p>

<p>That the folks over the Eglin didn&#39;t bother to mask their appearance tells me they have nothing to hide.</p>

<p>As for JTRIG, there&#39;s no proof they are on this sub trying to hide stuff. We know this because the leaked documents indicate they used their dirty tactics on the Taliban, manipulated public discourse about Iran&#39;s nuclear program, and fought a cyberwar with Anonymous:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Documents taken from the National Security Agency by Edward Snowden and exclusively obtained by NBC News describe techniques developed by a secret British spy unit called the Joint Threat Research and Intelligence Group (JTRIG) as part of a growing mission to go on offense and attack adversaries <strong>ranging from Iran to the hacktivists of Anonymous.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of these entities are real enemies of the U.S. (other than the fake Iran nuclear scare). My point is, there&#39;s no evidence they try to suppress new stories unfavourable to them on Reddit.</p>

<p>2) allowing military personnel access to social media, but giving them guidelines for posting (you can post on social media, but you can&#39;t talk shit about the US.) Telling them their comments will be monitored will encourage them to post positively about the US in an effort to make themselves look like they are part of the team. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/01/usaf-blog-respo/">Wired: Air Force Releases ‘Counter-Blog’ Marching Orders</a></p>

<p>In that article, they cite this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.webinknow.com/2008/12/the-us-air-force-armed-with-social-media.html">http://www.webinknow.com/2008/12/the-us-air-force-armed-with-social-media.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Capt. Faggard and his Air Force Emerging Technology team is responsible for developing strategy, policy and plans for an ever-changing communication landscape for communicators worldwide. What was most interesting is that with Capt. Faggard leading the way, the Air Force employs <strong>330,000 communicators!</strong> Their mission is to use current and developing Web 2.0 applications as a way to actively engage conversations between Airmen and the general public. Yes, that’s right, the goal of the program is that every single Airman is an on-line communicator.</p>

<p>Besides Twitter, Capt. Faggard writes The Official Blog of the U.S. Air Force; has pages on YouTube, MySpace and Facebook; helps publicize a Second Life area called Huffman Prairie; contributes to iReport (user name USAFPA); and is on Friendfeed, Digg, Delicious, Slashdot,Newsvine, <strong>Reddit</strong>. There’s Air Force widgets. And there&#39;s even a video mashup contest for high schools to show school spirit sponsored by the Air Force.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just the Air Force. Several months ago I led a training session organized by SSgt Alexis Mulero, Public Affairs Chief for the communicators in the 1st Marine Corps Recruiting District. Since most teenagers and young adults spend lots of time on Facebook, YouTube, and other social media sites, a major challenge in recruiting young people into the Marines is reaching them online. As a result of a focus on social media, SSgt Mulero says that his team has greatly increased the positive exposure of the Corps across the Northeastern U.S. </p>

<p>It would be interesting to see if the military as a whole has any method for reporting anyone (to the public, maybe via FOIAs) the number of military personnel who have been relieved/reprimanded for their social media postings...</p>

<p>Think back to the DOD report of the pentagon users of some ~3,000 who bought CP or saw CP -- yet no prosecutions... </p>

<hr/>

<p>Also, I know for a fact that FB has a whole group who is at their MPK HQ where they are responsible for finding CP/Abuse/Suicide (all the bad shit) and reporting it up internally and to FB people in general...</p>

<p>Whats funny about this is that FB basically has a revolving door with the SS and the NSA - and they hire a shit-ton of ex-SS/ex-military... They had a ret. general who was fired for apparently lascivious activity who was head of security...</p>

<p>IMO, #PG is pretty god-damned real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem is that people who side with clinton like to do this thing where they cross their arms and say &#39;there&#39;s no evidence for HIllary being a criminal&#39;.  This pisses people off because she&#39;s already decidedly a criminal, by the FBI&#39;s own words and congressional house investigations inquest testimony.  </p>

<p>The problem is not about pizzagate, it&#39;s about politicking.  People are ignoring factual information on the Clinton side because they don&#39;t like Trump--and their dislike of trump is based on no evidence but fear (false evidence appearing real).  My suggestion is that if you really want to be fair, find dirt on Trump.  But don&#39;t ignore the mountains of dirt on Clinton.  There&#39;s so much incredible dirt on Clinton that she could start her own raised garden bed business and give everyone in america a garden in their front lawns.  Which would be a good use of her dirt actually.</p>

<p>No the problem that infuriates people--and this includes people who don&#39;t even support trump--as it is a false dilemma fallacy and strawman argument to assume being against clinton is being in support of trump--is that Clinton is a fugutive from the law, and now she&#39;s teasing and taunting people over pizzagate, which, and maybe call it something else, like Crimegate or humantraffickinggate or extortiongate or 7thfloorgroupcoupgate</p>

<p>These people defending her are revealing how very little they know about history that&#39;s unfolding before their eyes.  They don&#39;t know how to handle material facts.  They don&#39;t read.  They don&#39;t dig.  They don&#39;t use critical thinking skills.  They can&#39;t handle context.  They can&#39;t handle nuance. They can&#39;t handle metanarrative.  They can&#39;t keep up.  They have a pathological incapacity to evaluate information for factuality, by playing it against other counternarratives and reading between the lines of BS politicking.  They can&#39;t read a news story from several different outlets and then use a skeptics tool of weighing it against other such stories, or considering that discreditabilitiy of varioius journalistic outlets versus others that have never been wrong (MSM vs wikileaks)</p>

<p>This is why people are infuriated by these people.  They show up, cross their arms and then want you to prove your position, ignoring of course that you already have, fully cited, and they are simply too lazy to do their homework.</p>

<p>Not even a simple search of the sub</p>

<p>NOt even a simple perusal of list of confirmed conspiracies</p>

<p>They try to debunk and deny and disprove and deflect and distract without showing any kind of attempt at being a real skeptic (ie: they are pseudoskeptics).  </p>

<p>This is why we call them shills.  They might be unpaid, or even interns, or even just tourons who have been inculcated into the cult of pseudoskepticism and antiintellectualism--not sure; but the end result is the same.</p>

<p>They denigrate this sub.  Enough of them and and the sub is worthless.  So...there you go. That&#39;s the point. And that&#39;s why we call them out.   </p>

<p>But there is value in saying that doesn&#39;t work anymore.  The way you fight them is by raising the bar and then blocking them.  IF reddit had a better block feature or a way of crowd-blocking people heuristically (ie: enough people block someone that they start to be muted / down weighted in comments so that upvoting their comments has an inherent divisor....)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>please don&#39;t take this as me being a &quot;Clinton arm crosser&quot;, but your comment makes it sound like anyone who is anti-trump, has to be pro-clinton, that is so far from the truth. I would love to have a discussion about trump that doesn&#39;t circle back to demands that i defend Clinton instead of criticizing Trump, believe it or not i hate both of them, but only one of them won the election, I 110% agree clinton is dirty, that is nothing new.... and i would <strong>love</strong> joining anti-clinton conversations if they were grounded to reality; she rigged the primaries..count me in, pay to play foundation...i&#39;m there, erased emails to cover her own ass...hell yea she did! i would never and have never arm crossed any of these topics...</p>

<p>but i invite you to find these discussions because unfortunately a strong majority of the anti-clinton post is in other dimensions, many are obviously just dedicated circle jerks, using her as a punching bag to attack the left as whole; I.e: &quot;Hillary and the Democrats are running a pedo sex trafficking ring&quot;, &quot;eric braverman hasn&#39;t used his twitter recently so Hillary must have killed him&quot;, &quot;6 degrees of Hillary connects her to sandusky&quot;, &quot;High profile Dem arrest coming in X amount of time&quot;....  these are so outlandish, they are hard to take seriously.... i mean the only conspiracies about her right now on our front page is multiple post about the exact same thing  <em>&quot;how dare she reference the same conspiracy she is accused running to troll Flynn&quot;</em> seriously?? that&#39;s just a bunch of snowflakes upset that someone else besides the hair piece would use their twitter to troll haters...  </p>

<p>also i hope you can understand how much your comment perfectly describes the feelings of both sides towards the other right now, and how desperately we need to find a way to bury this hatchet and move on.... i mean, if you swapped the names in the more generic parts of your comments it could easily be re-posted about trump arm-crossers.... both sides are looking at the other the exact same way....</p>

<p>(please don&#39;t nit pick specifics im only using this as a quick example so obviously it&#39;s not perfect, but hopefully you can see what i mean) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>she rigged the primaries</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hillary Clinton rigged the primaries? The Wikileaks disclosures show <em>dirty tricks</em> but they don&#39;t show <em>rigging</em>. If anyone rigged the primaries for HRC, I would look at the people who have been rigging elections since 2002. That would be the Republican Party. They probably rigged the primaries for the same reason &quot;Democrat&quot; paper Washington Post trashed Bernie Sanders literally hour-by-hour in the Super Tuesday period:</p>

<p>Because they knew <em>in advance</em> that the general election would be gamed for Donald Trump to beat Hillary Clinton in Electors -- and Bernie Sanders had to be pushed out of the way. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>erased emails to cover her own ass</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For all the time and effort spent on how terribly corrupt this whole email ordeal was, it amounted to a lot of bluster about nothing. So what if she deleted the emails?</p>

<p>You know what&#39;s really corrupt? Trying to get rid of <em>ethics</em>. Stealing SCOTUS seats. Jim Crow elections. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>using her as a punching bag to attack the left as whole</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main problem with the HRC &quot;punching bag&quot; was that the fists were being pushed by the Republican spin sites, rather than based upon her actual bad deeds.</p>

<p>For that matter, the entire James Comey situation smacked of Republican dirty tricks. </p>

<p>There were plenty of <em>real</em> reasons to criticize HRC -- but not much legitimate was coming from the Republican sites. You had to look at the alternative sites: wsws.org and Counterpunch come to mind. Those criticisms of HRC were very important and very real.</p>

<p>Things like Libya, Iraq, praising of George W. Bush and Kissenger, a large portion of the agenda during her husband&#39;s years, etc. Plenty of real stuff! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;how dare she reference the same conspiracy she is accused running to troll Flynn&quot; seriously?? that&#39;s just a bunch of snowflakes upset </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think what Flynn did was very serious actually. As much as I oppose Donald Trump and the Republican government, I also oppose the hardening and the -- dare I say it -- Fake News about Russia.</p>

<p>Hope you liked my nit picking. :)</p>

<p>But what you said was not truthful and was uneven. You didnt really attack both sides. And said some foolish things. </p>

<p>If you wanna inject partisanship, it&#39;ll be tough and also easy. Because not many here love or even like trump. But its been decades of cunted hillary and her secret luciferean friends. And bill and bush and other bush. These are some evil people, and many want justice. </p>

<p>Justice that we see for the first time emerging under trump. So is it too much for the Real and Active anti trump forces to not convince foolish people to essentially work for them for free? Can we get 100 days or real anti trump posts? Cause russia is not our enemy. And her own people leaked her shit. And pissing hookers went away with the garbage they brought. </p>

<p>The problem with shills is we cant really prove it when we call them out as individuals. We know 100% they exist. We&#39;ve seen how they operate. We&#39;ve become good ourselves at noticing the patterns but if we call them out it&#39;s kinda frivolous. All they have to say is the standard &quot;so anyone who disagrees with you is a shill?&quot; line and it&#39;s become moot. At that point no meaningful discussion will take place.</p>

<p>I think the user base and the mod team feel that an environment which is hostile to potential paid subversion benefits the sub as a whole by engendering the standing of the individual person in the discursive process;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That which is most hostile towards bullshit is logic and sound reasoning, not ad hominem attacks.</p>

<p>Those I see accusing others of being shills aren&#39;t those I see presenting logical arguments and sound reasoning.  It&#39;s exactly the opposite.  They merely assert an opinion, frequently and repeatedly, and when challenged with logic and reason, resort to ad hominem attacks, one of which is accusing their opponent of being a shill, though accusing their opponent of being a pedophile is also popular.</p>

<p>To the extent that there are shills in this forum, I think it is these people who are the shills.  Most people don&#39;t pass up an opportunity to share the evidence they find so convincing, but if one doesn&#39;t honestly hold the opinion they&#39;re presenting, they would have a difficult time defending it against any counterarguments.  So they have limited options.  One option is to attack the credibility of those presenting counterarguments and hope that everyone ignores the counterarguments as a result.</p>

<p>Another option is to respond with &quot;do your own research.&quot;  This merely asserts that evidence exists without requiring knowledge about any of it, which is useful given that they aren&#39;t knowledgeable about any of it.  Again, most people who want to promote their opinion won&#39;t pass up the opportunity to convince others by presenting the arguments and evidence that cause them to hold that opinion.  So when one asks for more information, and is merely told &quot;do your own research,&quot; that screams &quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just posting what I&#39;m told.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s never necessary to point out that these people are shills.  They are far too easy to argue against.  Arguing against them will change the minds of others who read those arguments, whereas calling them shills will merely make one look like a shill themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand this and appreciate the great work you&#39;ve doone having a very open and positive conversation here about what&#39;s going on (in general and not just about rule 10). But I agree that it&#39;s very hard to believe that rule 10 is being enforced fairly when you have someone in this very thread summoning and then attacking another user without consequence, while <a href="/u/ruleten">/u/ruleten</a>&#39;s documented instances of issues with mods are being removed.</p>

<p>I think it would be a very good thing for this sub to revisit rule 10 protection for the mods and strictly enforce it against users. I agree that there are paid shills, but if there really is proof of that why do we need to throw accusations around on the sub? Why not just pm the proof to the mods and leave it to them to ban the user? </p>

<p>The front page of this sub currently has multiple self-posts accusing broad and undefined groups of users (let&#39;s be honest, they&#39;re attacking people that espouse Trump related conspiracies), and this is echoing down into comments that spend more time assaulting and <em>ad hominem</em>ing people that accuse Trump of bad acts then actually discussing the facts. Is this really good for the sub? No one (ourselves included--even long time users question the bias of this sub) is going to take this sub seriously if it&#39;s viewed as a branch of T_D and if we&#39;re not taken seriously we can&#39;t <em>do anything</em>. I don&#39;t think anyone here that participates in good faith does so just for shits and giggles, I personally came here because I think this sub is a good thing to have and that exposing government corruption and malfeasance can actually help people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wondering why shills would bother targeting r/conspiracy in any way? This sub&#39;s impact on reddit overall seems pretty low and it would be much easier to criticise and destabilise from the outside - &quot;tinfoil hat&quot;, &quot;crazy&quot;, etc. - than come into the sub and do their work here. It seems like it would be a waste of resources to try and control any narrative here given that we are super sceptical about anything outside of our own pet theory. </p>

<p>The only time it may happen seems to be when a post briefly hits r/all, but even then there are enough non-shill users (from politics and td) who will be all too happy to do their work for them.</p>

There&#39;s plenty of examples of people insulting other users and treating them harshly for sharing a differing opinion in a civil manner, yet basically most of them are allowed to continue doing so.

<p>Correct.</p>

<p>Nope. I&#39;ve only ever called people &quot;fascist&quot; today, when they were happy about CNN being banned or those with opposite viewpoints being banned. Nothing &quot;dehumanizing&quot; about it. Way to play the victim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the importance of outing shills, but I think this whole sub has gone overboard with it (though admittedly I&#39;m a new user). Too many people here attack other&#39;s as shills, but never adress their arguments. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not accusing you of doing this, to be clear, but I don&#39;t see the value of doing it in general. It seems to me that when there is evidence it should be provided to the mods and left to them to ban the user or otherwise, if the user&#39;s activity rises to an actual conspiracy to manipulate and disparage the voices of this sub (whatever you think of <a href="/u/Peutin">/u/Peutin</a>, I don&#39;t see any evidence of paid shilling, just shitposting at worst) then that&#39;s a conspiracy and it&#39;s appropriate. But look at the frontpage right now, it&#39;s full of people just casually accusing their political opponents with no evidence, literally they are posts where actual conspiracy theories, with documentation, are being dismissed because of the political ramifications and not based on the facts. I&#39;m sorry but that, to me, puts this sub in danger of becoming an echo-chamber and losing all credibility for the users that actually expose serious malfeasance.</p>

<p>To be clear, I&#39;m not advocating for censorship, I just think that public attacks on other users foster an atmosphere where <em>ad hominem</em> trumps factual argumentation, and that hurts us all. The mods have the authority to ban shills and sticky lists of irreputable news sources (with documentation). I don&#39;t think we should stop policing ourselves, I just think that we need to step back and look at whether we are doing it constructively or because the current political atmosphere is so charged. We&#39;re not here to proxy war Trump v. Hillary, we&#39;re here to protect ourselves, and others, from the malfeasance of governments, corporations, and whatever other powers-that-be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i know you guys are already busy enough as it is, but has there been any consideration to adding or expanding some of the rules? my biggest gripe has been the de-railing, i understand and love that this is one of the few subs left that still allows wide open discussion, not catered to a specific group, i think dissenting opinions are more useful than agreeing opinions, but it&#39;s not hard to find users who comments are only intended to specifically derail a post becuase they don&#39;t like the subject...... </p>

<p>we&#39;re a big enough sub that conspiracies about apple&#39;s and conspiracies about oranges can co-exist but if all the apple conspiracy lovers spend more time de-railing and attacking the post about oranges, because they don&#39;t like discussions about orange conspiracies, the orange conspiracy lovers are just going to do it right back, making it impossible for anyone to have actual discussions about either without having to wade through hundreds of these <em>&quot;oranges suck!&quot;, &quot;this is apple propaganda BS&quot;, &quot;Why are you talking about apples?! how about instead, you tell me how oranges would have been any better&quot;</em> type comments....</p>

<p>also, i think it&#39;s getting to a point that using someone&#39;s account age to discredit them could be lumped in with rule 10, i would say the last couple weeks especially i have seen way more comments followed up with things like <em>&quot;ohh, because you&#39;re so smart with your XX-day old account&quot;</em>, these comments have the same intent as calling someone a troll or shill <em>&quot;i don&#39;t like what you have to say, i can&#39;t call you a shill, so ill just imply your account is too young to matter&quot;</em> </p>

<p>Again, i know you guys are busy, and adding more rules to enforce is the last thing you want to do, but if or when that time comes, these might be a few things to consider.... thx (please don&#39;t ban me, i&#39;m trying to be respectfully constructive)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, forget the brigading.</p>

<p>Why did you tag Trump&#39;s Dossier post as &quot;Unverified Allegations&quot;? Almost the entirety of Pizza Gate is unverified allegations. Almost all conspiracies in general are unverified allegations. Yet the only time you&#39;ve ever used that tag is in relation to a conspiracy involving Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Very suspicious....</p>

<p>Yet the only time you&#39;ve ever used that tag is in relation to a conspiracy involving Donald Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not a mod, but in regards to the Buzzfeed article that was flaired with &quot;Unverified allegations&quot;, the reason that specific tag has only ever been used with that specific post was because it was a direct quote from the article itself. The tag even included quotes around words <em>because</em> it was a direct quote from the article.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not commenting to argue about whether or not it should have been tagged, although possible reasons could have been the literal hundreds of people coming from all and other subs replying to the post, and ridiculing the community for not upvoting it or believing it to be absolute fact. </p>

<p>A lot of people don&#39;t read beyond the title and that was particularly true for that post considering that then and even now, all this time later, people are accusing the mods of creating that tag based on their own opinion of the post when it was a direct quote from the article instead.</p>

<p>The article itself also said multiple times that it was unverified, included many mistakes and errors, and that there was substantial reason to doubt the accuracy of the accusation - all while tons of people from other subreddits and all made the entire post and discussion about how awful the community is because most were skeptical/dismissive and that the mods are corrupt and need to resign.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that I would have reacted the same if I were a mod, but I do understand why it was tagged with that quote. The fact that people are still bringing up a single tag that originated from the article, and the fact that 95% of the comments on that post was a discussion about how awful and corrupt this community and it&#39;s mods are for not automatically believing a conspiracy about Trump that was also being pushed by the mainstream media, is more suspicious to me.</p>

<p>The mods here have tagged other posts if the title isn&#39;t accurate or seems like clickbait, and not just on Trump/Republican/Altright posts, they&#39;ve done it on Democrat/Hillary posts as well. They don&#39;t <em>always</em>, but they have, and yet there are comments from the past 2 days claiming that the only posts that have ever been tagged in this subreddit have been Trump posts, and those comments, that any regular to this sub would know is a lie, are getting 50+ upvotes.</p>

<p>A lot of the regular people from this community can tell, and are witnessing, an actual effort to portray this subreddit as nothing but Trump supporters and that our mods are paid by Russia. And 99% of the people who are doing this, and complaining about the fact people from t_d post here (as if that&#39;s somehow not allowed) dont even contribute. So many people here are doing <em>nothing</em> but bitching about how no one here is posting about Trump/Russia conspiracies, while not even attempting to make actual posts themselves that isn&#39;t entirely comprised of whatever CNN, or r/politics is saying.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame the mods, or most people in this community, including myself, for finding all of this really suspicious and exceptionally frustrating.</p>

<p>The commenters there were obviously not regulars though. Apart from having barely any activity here in there history the fact half the comments begun with something like &quot;you people&quot; gave it away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shit, the dossier post was flagged as &#39;UNVERIFIED&#39; by mods an in attempt to discredit it. There are countless other posts in here every day that are unverified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The difference is that the none of the other posts have such huge implications or try to pass themselves off as verified. Seeing something like the Russia dossier coming from generally credible MSM sources it would be easy to assume it was verified whereas seeing something about UFOs from <a href="http://www.motherearthtruthbrigade.pl">www.motherearthtruthbrigade.pl</a> is a little more obvious. I think in this case the mods just didn&#39;t want people being goaded into believing everything was confirmed rather than discredit it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. I&#39;m sure there are a number of lurkers who are not regulars in this sub and see this brigading attempts as just another post within the sub. They have done a much better job at blending in.</p>

<p>While it is hard to outright ban any accusations of shills, etc. -- unfortunately the sub is at a point where this is a constant reality, and while it may be extremely apparent to some of us, we have to realize a ton of new users have come this way due to the election, wikileaks and other recent events, so it can be very hard to discern the genuine from the fraudulent.</p>

<p>I find it funny that this is a constant accusation spouted by these people and directed towards the mods. Claiming that this whole Russia incident is a conspiracy (when MSM has been covering it, and its an advisor speaking with russia -- not the world&#39;s biggest conspiracy here folks) and you as a mod team are actively trying to surpress it is just ridiculous imo.</p>

<p>You guys have continued to defend this sub for years now and I commend you all for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it myself countless times and I myself have seen the down votes come in waves of tens and twentys because of an article that paints Trump in a bad light. How can we ever criticize our president if posts can never get out of the negatives? Seriously, scan through the top 500 posts on this sub, not a single post that paints Trump in a bad light, in fact they&#39;re all trying to discredit the fact that Flynn resigning may have been a bad sign. </p>

<p>It just seems like the comments and the articles themselves never agree with each other, which only leads me to speculate that these articles are being vote manipulated.</p>

<p>For myself, and many others, being &quot;pro-Trump&quot; is the result of a very complex mixture of political, philosophical, spiritual, and firsthand experiential knowledge that has been developed over years. Don&#39;t assume that someone is an edgy teen just because they have an opposing viewpoint from yours.</p>

<p>More importantly, don&#39;t consider the above counterpoint or any others as an attack. That is thinking of the two sides like a pendulum, which in a debate just turns into a wrecking ball.

    <div class="md"><p>The real government conspiracies are too heavy for you? I like nothing more than some hollow earth conspiracy, but this political conspiracy business is the real thing. It saddens me that so many &quot;conspiracy buffs&quot; can&#39;t hang once the real thing comes out. Don&#39;t worry, this stuff will eventually grey buried, and you&#39;ll get to go back to your &quot;What REALLY happened to Malaysia flight 370&quot; posts. For now, let it roll. This is the first time in decades that people have been so receptive to political conspiracy. I understand if it scares you. It scares me. I&#39;d rather be scared on the path to truth than to be comfortable in my bubble with my head in the sand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do those links point out? I looked at some of the comments in those threads (out of archive) and a lot of them are pretty consistent with the things I still believe, despite being a terrible T_D user as well as someone who likes to come here.

I&#39;ll take screenshots if you want, to show the real difference. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> doesn&#39;t have people yelling, typing with caps, insults, bold letters, memes, blatantly agreeing with every single person there (even when it&#39;s straight up lies,) all stuff I saw people typing when I was in middle school. T_D is a cult, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Links point out different conspiracies, instead of one or two (like pizzagate, which takes up most of the space here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) that we see today. You people NEED to believe that pizzagate is real to satifisy yourselves and be able to tell yourselves that you guys were right, Hillary is evil child trafficker. Cult behavior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You sound like you need to relax. People don&#39;t communicate one one wavelength. Memes are art, meant to rouse the mind. Have you ever seen textual art before? You see art, and are disgusted. That says more about you, then the artist. (As art is often a spontaneous act of creativity and inspiration, transcendent of an individual mind. Whereas the reaction, is specific and isolated to you.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blatantly agree when I go there. Seriously, look at my posts. People like you get banned, because you&#39;ve gone past the point of reasonable conversation, and The_Donald would not be allowed to exist they let people do what they do in other subreddits, and we would lose a place to discuss things we agree on. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s perfect, but politics is just as bad, if you go into the comments. And your cherrypicking posts isn&#39;t going to convince me otherwise. There&#39;s a full variance of crazy on both sides. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; in pizzagate, I think it should be investigated (as it is being behind the scenes) because a lot of people are roused by it, and there is some creepy stuff going on there. I don&#39;t believe there is any proof of Hilary being directly involved. I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s cult behavior for some people to disagree with me about something that has a lot of people riled up for some reason. I doubt you know much more than I do about it, which isn&#39;t much, and I can tell you it&#39;s not simply just talking about pizza if you look at the leaks/symbols/trips to islands/creepy art on instagram feeds/etc.</p>

<p>When the dossier dropped he tagged the post &quot;unverified&quot;, a tag they invented just for the dossier story. Then they deleted the post because it was &quot;brigaded by shills&quot;. Then they banned people for calling them out.</p>

<p>So we have a mod who deletes a front page story about trump because he accuses it of being brigaded by shills, who is now telling us he&#39;ll totally ban people who accuse people of being shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do we really have to blame everything on a subreddit with anti-brigading rules so strict that even writing the <em>name</em> of certain subreddits is banned there?</p>

<p>The fact is, there&#39;s a huge conspiracy currently surrounding the Democrats and more information about it is regularly being discovered and compiled. Nobody has taken over the subreddit, there&#39;s just a good conspiracy going on at the moment.</p>

<p>Also, if they were posted now you would probably consider half the posts you linked as &quot;T_D&quot; spam. Stuff about Libya for example. The Democrats have been running the show for 8 years now so there are plenty of conspiracies about them to be discussed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I figure a stickied post might get a better chance of response from a mod, but why not be as transparent as possible?  This is a conspiracy sub, populated by people who believe those in charge are hiding things from us(or those in charge are hidden from us).  I&#39;m guessing you guys have some sort of mod chat where you discuss various aspects of the sub and how to proceed, so why not make those available to the users here to view?  </p>

<p>Not only that, but putting a sticky on certain topics seems to show there&#39;s a serious bias here.  This applies especially when you(mods) feel it&#39;s fine to sticky PG stuff and also tag other ones as hoaxes and remove them.  Remember when the Trump Dossier post was quickly removed with the claim it was a 4chan hoax?  Maybe some of the mods here are compromised or they&#39;re explicitly trying to push their own agenda by abusing the privileges granted by being a mod.  Any stickied post should be tagged with the mod&#39;s name, and so should posts that have a lot of upvotes and are removed.</p>

<p>Basically what I&#39;m saying is that without transparency, why shouldn&#39;t the users of this sub seriously question the motives of those few that control it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dear mods, </p>

<p>How about we put an end to the Julian Assange is dead v alive posts?</p>

<p>The he is dead (or alive and turned) and subsequent speculation of it is a major resource burn that adds nothing constructive to this sub. It is degrading, divisive, and no amount of arguments for or against (or proof from Julian himself) will satisfy people debating the matter with exception to those trolling and/or trying to distract us from other possible conspiracies.</p>

<p>For those that need a personal opinion: After seeing the Hannity interview video and other times he has appeared publicly, I am convinced he is alive and frustrated with being stuck in that embassy. Speculative posts on his current status downplays the pain and suffering this is causing Julian and his family which reflects poorly on all people that debate this issue (and by proxy this sub itself, rule 10 states &#39;Posts that attack this sub&#39; which I find &#39;very&#39; poorly enforced).</p>

<p>I state that as an Australian, with a better understanding of the accent and mannerisms of my fellow countrymen than most people who visit this sub, and not from a position of wishful ignorance or emotional belief (see my post history if you doubt the conviction of my character).</p>

<p>Please, from a humanitarian angle, can we cut out that out and start actively trying to restore the quality of this sub, to better reflect what we had over six months ago?</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>8n0n, Australia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I endorse what <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> says about the golden rule - if you treat the other users of this sub with respect you will be welcomed here. But I also think it necessary to add a warning: <strong>People who come here to attack the sub or its users (Rule 10) are likely to be banned immediately, with little chance of appeal.</strong> </p>

<p>This sub has been growing steadily at a rate of about 15,000 per month for some time, we are currently just outside the top 100 largest subs. However, with any influx, there will be a percentage of newcomers who cause real problems for the sub - the anti-conspiracy types who refuse to entertain conspiracy theories that haven&#39;t been endorsed by the MSM, and/or haters who feel the need to attack the sub and its users, and try to create division within the userbase. </p>

<p>The sub saw a large influx of Donald Trump supporters last year, attracted partly because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> passionately despises Hillary Clinton (who is regarded as the high priestess of Deep State corruption) but also because this sub was one of the few subs which didn&#39;t chase out Trump supporters. This influx caused quite a few problems with our existing users (in what is and always will be an apolitical, or rather anti-political, subreddit) but on the whole, this Trump influx has made decent efforts to assimilate.</p>

<p>However, since shortly before the US elections in November, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has seen a huge uptick in abusive users, most of whom appear to be rabidly anti-Trump, and this has caused a great deal of conflict within the sub, because it initiated a proxy war between pro/anti Trump supporters which has been very destabilising. It is unclear why this anti-Trump &quot;brigade&quot; decided to subscribe, seeing as most of them appear to qualify as anti-conspiracists, and it has caused a lot of work for the mods. We have been removing vast numbers of hostile (Rule 10) comments and banning offenders at an unprecedented rate. </p>

<p>Whereas a year ago, we might have banned 1 abusive user per day on average, that figure is nearer 10 per day at the moment. If you do the maths, that represents over 1,000 bans since the start of November (and yes, you read that right). The mods do not shy away from making these decisions - we are absolutely committed to defending this sub from threats, be they internal or external.</p>

<p>The point of my telling you this is to emphasise my warning at the beginning of my comment. If you come here to mock the sub or denigrate or antagonise its users, or try to disrupt the free discussion of conspiracies, your comments will be removed, and you will be banned, and it is very unlikely that you will be re-admitted.</p>

<p>When your moderation team bans people with differing points of view, and feels comfortable sending that after having banned the person with a differing point of view, you&#39;re no longer a forum for open discussion. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with anything you&#39;ve posted, but unpleasant and abusive seems to be where the problem is. Clearly, the mod who sent that is both. Unabashedly so--he sent it knowing it would be made public. The user who posted it was expressing an opinion contrary to what that mod was comfortable with. Unsurprisingly, he is banned. Perhaps he was unpleasant? But if that guy is the one who decides, then Houston, you guys have a big fucking problem. </p>

<p>I really like this sub, even if I&#39;m in the minority with my political beliefs. I get heated. I take my down votes. I haven&#39;t been banned. That&#39;s a testament to your team. But, with what went down in that post, it&#39;s clearly just a matter of time. I no longer feel welcome. </p>

<p>I am still active enough in this community, outside of reddit,  to attend events and pine for the days of staying up hours past bedtime listening to Art Bell.  Seeing that guy&#39;s edit feels personal to me, somehow. People with similar points of view to me are no longer welcome, and are treated like shit by, at least, one of the higher ups, and banned by those/that same people/person. </p>

<p>Be my guest if you want to ridicule his stupid Mexican Wall, or lampoon his poorly thought out Muslim travel ban, or mock him for telling Putin he &quot;expects&quot; Russia to pull out of Crimea. The man is making poor decisions, based on poor advice. </p>

<p>But the MSM-peddled narrative that Trump is Putin&#39;s stooge is a fake conspiracy, a psyop to dupe those who mainline from the mainstream media. The regular users of this sub are just not convinced by it at all, and the credulous conspiracy neophytes who are swarming over our sub wittering on about this fake conspiracy are an irritant.</p>

<p>The truth is that Trump is perceived as a threat by the CIA and the Deep State, insofar that he is not under their direct control, and they are doing everything to get him impeached. Whatever you think about Trump, he is the elected President, and the US will descend into a dark place if he is ousted by the unelected elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Trump influx has made a decent effort to assimilate.&quot; Judging by how vastly the sub has changed and how many bans you are handing out now, only to anti-trump supporters, I ask that you prove your claim that there has been an effort to assimilate by pro-trump supporters. There have been countless cases of vote and post brigading that I have seen, I wonder why you have chosen to only point out anti-trump examples. I also ask when and why the mod team became politically biased. .......... Hell, who am I kidding, I already know the answer like everyone else here - this sub has been aggressively taken over by trump supporters who are silencing opinions they disagree with at every opportunity. The mod team and new Donald users want people with different opinions out of the sub - many of whom are the ones who started &amp; contributed to its somewhat positive reputation on reddit - and have made this sub into a laughingstock that will never reach the front page unless brigade tactics are used. I&#39;m genuinely upset about that fact. Up until now the sub has been one of the biggest forces in legitimizing conspiracy theories to the average Joe. Now, its seen as a TD megaphone sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t answer either question, and did your best to discredit my opinion. You know I use alts like every other long term user here, and you know I wouldn&#39;t comment unless I cared about what this sub used to be. This is a message to the rest of the mod team: this mod is biased, and is actively silencing conspiracies he disagrees with. If this sub reddit continues down this path, we will rightfully be seen as a biased source of info - and any impact we had on the reddit userbase will be gone. Again, I deeply care about this sub reddit, and I know you do too. Thank you for making this place what it was, and all the best in the future.</p>

<p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you&#39;re account seems to have been shadowbanned by the reddit admins.</p>

<p>I have no insight as to why the admins did that to your accounts, and I only have the power to approve your comments in this subreddit, however the best way to appeal a shadowban is by messaging the admins via the modmail of <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a>.</p>

<p>Nope. I&#39;ve only ever called people &quot;fascist&quot; today, when they were happy about CNN being banned or those with opposite viewpoints being banned. Nothing &quot;dehumanizing&quot; about it. Way to play the victim.</p>

We have had to ban an unprecedented number of (mostly unknown) users for abuse and attacking the sub during this 3-4 month period.
