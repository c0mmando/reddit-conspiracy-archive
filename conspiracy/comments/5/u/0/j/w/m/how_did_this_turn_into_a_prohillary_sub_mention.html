    <div class="md"><p>I am a Trump voter.  I read the conspiracy stuff here about him because I have an open mind.  I even posted on here questioning his cozy relationship with Bill Clinton.  They came here and insulted the heck out of us.  Then started pro-Hillary crap like she still had a chance of winning.  Said this is a safe place for Trump supporters.  Ahhh.  He is POTUS, why wouldn&#39;t we be welcome everywhere.  I&#39;m not here to shill for Trump and don&#39;t expect to have to listen to them shill for Hill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the ctr stuff has definitely slowed since the end of the election, now the amount of regular people who try to engage in conversation about this stuff for the first time are automatically called shills.  So you can&#39;t expect them to hang around talking to a wall, ya know?</p>

<p>And you can&#39;t have things both ways, if trump is going to be talked about as a savior here, then you have to expect some backlash.  the posts criticizing, or even questioning trump get downvoted and ignored simply because of the amount of the donald members here. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s fine, but its really depressing that this sub immediately gets rid of a post trying to talk about the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5txz03/michael_flynn_resigns_trumps_national_security/ddpyujq/?context=3">Trump/russia connections</a> which there are quite a few.  Not talking about it, or his cabinet members, or his use of a private server, or his use of his unsecure android phone, or his business practices, or any of his other questionable decisions on a sub that went so hard against everyone else is a travesty.</p>

<p>I get people want to have hope that he is an outsider who&#39;s going to do great things, but turning a blind eye to what&#39;s happening just makes it worse. </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is no longer an issue, (thank god) yet people are still using her as a scapegoat to why trump is good, which needs to stop if there will be any progress towards bridging the gap between the right and left.  Relegate her name to the conversations for which actual evidence is found, or at least hold our current president to the same standards as she was and continues to be scrutinized by.</p>

<p>Otherwise, r/conspiracy is just going to turn into another propaganda piece, just for our current government.  The one that can actually do the most damage to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a direct quote from what you responded to.</p>

<p>&quot;I get people want to have hope that he is an outsider who&#39;s going to do great things for us, but turning a blind eye to what&#39;s actually happening doesn&#39;t make that happen, and what&#39;s worse, is it just makes this sub even less credible.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is no longer an issue, (thank god) yet people are still using her as a scapegoat to why trump is good,&quot;</p>

<p>So once again, hillary clinton out of the picture, and deflecting all criticism of trump to, &quot;we&#39;ll what about when barack,&quot; or &quot;what about when hillary,&quot; literally has no bearing whatsoever on what trump is doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what is Trump doing that is so horrible, you talk about all these connections.  The only one I have seen about connections was forced on us by shills and hold no weight.  He is an international businessman not like it would be hard to assume he has a couple of connections with Russia.  Furthermore what is wrong with that we need to be allies with Russia not cold war enemy&#39;s again.  They fight him on every decision he makes. If you have so many Trump conspiracies that are relevant and have actual weight to them other than just some vague connection that doesn&#39;t matter anyway post them.  This isn&#39;t TD if the conspiracy has weight it will be listened to however the ignorance that everyone here is Pro tTrump simply because we dont have a bunch of conspiracies on the top of the page about him is wrong.  Maybe it is because he hasn&#39;t done anything that bad or that even compares to the crap the left has been pulling.  Trump isn&#39;t perfect but compared to these other people he is small apples in my opinion.  Until something actually relevant breaks I will continue to argue the Hillary stuff is more important simply because her corruption didn&#39;t end with the election.  Seems to me you are just wanting the focus off the issues that we are actually involved in right now and onto Trump for whatever reason.  Like I said if there is anything about Trump that is actually worthy post it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a theory.  Now all you have to do is prove it.</p>

<p>Not as a rule, but brigading is against sitewide Reddit rules, so if the mods determined there was a brigade afoot, I would expect them to remove the offending post every time.</p>

<p>They found the link which likely drew people.  it was an NP link.  There was even a poster who admitted to finding the submission via that link.  So far I see two examples in the last month or so.  Also, Pizzagate has been the dominant subject, which implicates Democrats like Podesta, Clinton, et al.  Finally, we just had 8 yrs of unconstitutional governance from Team Obama.  Coverage of topics in this sub tends to be cyclical, and right now, perhaps, much of the sub is hasn&#39;t completely adjusted to the Trump presidency and all it will entail.  I mean, it&#39;s only 4 weeks old.</p>

<p>Can you prove that it was?  Of course you can&#39;t.  Why not address the points made within the post or the story itself instead of constantly crying foul about brigades?

<p>Not to me.  I was active in one of those submissions and I definitely saw it as a brigade.  Having been a member of this sub for ovr 8 yrs on various accounts, I feel very confident in the mods and their desire to keep this place censorship free.  Censorship is what <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> does to right wing sources.  Censorship is what Reddit does to topics it doesn&#39;t want discussed.  Mods taggind two posts in a month&#39;s time as brigaded, and them removing those posts is hardly evidence of censorship.</p>

<p>You &quot;felt&quot; it was a brigade.  Great, but you cannot prove it was or wasn&#39;t.  The entire point of my post, that you apparently missed, was why not address the post and content within instead of hand-waving discourse as brigading when you&#39;ve no evidence and doing so is meaningless.  I see people constantly labeling others as shills, using account age and post history, and claims of brigading when forced to confront ideas or stories that they disagree with instead of discussing the actual content.  It&#39;s intellectually dishonest and only does harm to the quality of discourse within this sub.</p>

<p>I see that you handle suggestions and criticism well.  Must be great to have nothing to improve on!  Sarcasm aside, I would rather see quality discourse instead of intellectual dishonesty and division within this sub.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s always been true in this sub....but the cabal changes.  One example is pizzagate.  For a while, those posts were all being heavily downvoted and couldn&#39;t make it out of the new que.

It is no different in any of the main subs like <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> or <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.  People are free to up or downvote submissions as they see fit, and yes, many entities break Reddit rules, use botnets, etc, to give the appearance that more people are either for or against a particular thing.  Try this exercise:  post an article which paints Trump in a positive light top <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.

<p>but how did they surmise we are &quot;actively ignoring any Trump conspiracy ideas, and instead focused only one party and Hillary stuff&quot; by looking at one post which made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>?</p>

<p>It&#39;s well known that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is just another alt right sub shilling for trump. It&#39;s not that they looked at one post and knew. It&#39;s that they just knew it before hand, saw the post on the front page, and decided to see how an alt right pro trump sub was reacting. Then they comment cause why not, they&#39;re there. Then they get accused of being shills. Then they remember that yes, this is an alt right sub shilling for trump.</p>

<p>I know that&#39;s what Democrats think.  That doesn&#39;t make it a fact though.  I didn&#39;t vote for Trump and will happily lambast him when he violates the Constitution as Obama did.  Example:  He has already committed a crime by assassinating a US citizen extrajudicially.  Unfortunately, Obama established the precedent that it was ok to do so.</p>

<p>Sure.  My points still stands, however.  Through all of this, however, the most troubling thing is that votes come in waves.  Whether that&#39;s for or against a position.  It&#39;s almost like this sub is a battleground for different outside groups.</p>

<p>your memes are behind the times, friend. it&#39;s 2017, Fox News is &quot;okay&quot; now (though still not as good as liberal-approved CNN), you&#39;re supposed to be accusing me of watching Infowars or reading Breitbart</p>

<p>and yes, you&#39;ve caught me; I <em>could have</em> been repeating someone else&#39;s theory. but unless you can find someone else saying the same thing I said, before I said it, you&#39;ll have a hard time proving it.</p>

<p>believe it or not, I actually reached the conclusions for my theory on my own; using my own brain(!), I was able to look at what the mainstream mass media is telling us, and infer a possible alternate explanation.</p>

<p>again, there should be no reason for hostility; all I am doing is expressing ideas, fleeting thoughts that passed through my mind, thoughts that nobody else but me might be exposed to if the Internet didn&#39;t exist and I was able to share them.</p>

<p>so what&#39;s the problem with sharing ideas? if they&#39;re wrong, and provably so, then it&#39;s no skin off my back. but if they have any truth to them at all, or even if they don&#39;t but they cause someone reading them to think even <em>further</em> outside the box, in ways that I did or could not... is it really so bad to just share them, here on a subreddit expressly focused on sharing and discussing conspiracy theories?</p>

<p>Probably because Trump is now the establishment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This really can&#39;t be emphasized enough.</p>

<p>He was <em>always</em> the establishment, really. A billionaire real estate developer with ties to Hollywood and business leaders across the world? The very definition of establishment.</p>

<p>And now he&#39;s the <em>President of the United States</em>, surrounded by powerful, rich, influential people.</p>

<p>He&#39;s the exact sort of person conspiracy theorists would normally be watching like a hawk.</p>

<p>Which is why posts like this one are so hilariously stupid and transparent.</p>

<p>This sub isn&#39;t T_D, but there are a large number of people trying to make it a branch of T_D.</p>

<p>And no one who actually reads this sub regularly thinks it&#39;s pro-Hillary. That&#39;s so  obscenely stupid I don&#39;t even know where to begin. It&#39;s been aggressively anti-Clinton for years and likely always will be. It&#39;s routinely flooded with anti-Clinton posts, even now that she&#39;s out and Trump is in.</p>

<p>This thread is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Except he&#39;s not, not by the conspiracy subs traditional definition of the word.  The &quot;establishment&quot; is the Main Stream Media, and the corporations that own it and profit from it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d imagine that people being labeled shills constantly while some of the most popular posts involving Trump were removed irritated people.  If you&#39;ve been a regular, especially recently, then you&#39;ve surely seen the growing discontent.  Also, just because someone has &quot;Anti-Trump&quot; opinions doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re pro-Clinton.  </p>

<p>The echo chamber aspect is most interesting to me though.  You have users from a sub that are not used to any discourse reacting to one thread that reached <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.  You can differentiate these posters by their verbiage, which is curious on its own, and getting to see their reactions is interesting.  I could be wrong, but it seems like many don&#39;t like having their opinions or ideas challenged.   Either way, the reaction is interesting to me.</p>

<p>Did you try and engage those that you think are &quot;mean&quot;?  Tried to understand their positions or empathize?  Do you think that all anti-Trump positions or opinions make someone pro-Clinton?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who the fuck cares whether it&#39;s shills or not, it does not make the story that came out any less true. This sub did bury the shit out of the trump Russia links and now there is valid proof of it and Trump just had national security advisor resign for his talks with Russia, plus manafort who also resigned due to his Russia connections, and Rex tillerson with the mass amounts of money he makes off of lifting the sanctions in Russia. It all fits together. I&#39;m not a shill and I&#39;ve been trying to show this for months and we finally see the truth. Trump was a Russian puppet. Our elections were corrupted by the DNC and Hillary and her gang, but little did they know that Trump was corrupting the same elections with their Russian help. Trump is a piece of shit and this is getting better and better</p>

<p>DT is attacking the debt problem - he is fighting against it as he believes more work equals more jobs. He is obviously not initiated or he would have abandoned the &quot;jobs for all - coal be good!&quot; long ago. </p>

<p>Podesta emails were leaked from someone inside, likely the guy double-tapped in DC - they were not a hack. The reason for the attention to the DNC-centric leaks are because of a proven track record for corruption. RNC-centric leaks are also prevalent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t kill the messenger.</p>

<p>I used to be really into conspiracy theories, but back in the 80s, 90s, and the 2000s, there were conspiracy theories from all over the political spectrum. Lefties talked about the JFK assassination, MLK, RFK, the Church Committee, sometimes they&#39;d talk about UFOs or &quot;psychic&quot; energy, but they&#39;d talk about CIA mind control, the CIA running crack and heroin into the ghettos, stuff like that.</p>

<p>But the right wing <em>also</em> had their share of conspiracy theories too - everything used to be linked to the USSR, for instance: if kids were listening to heavy metal, it was because the Soviets were paying heavy metal bands to pervert the youth of America and convert them to Satanism, homosexuality, and drugs. Right-wing conspiracy theory often veered toward pretty fringe areas: anti-tax, Posse Comitatus, the &quot;Jews run everything&quot; shit, etc. Militia-types were heavy into conspiracy theories (&quot;black helicopters!!&quot;) about the Clintons in the 90s, just because Bill Clinton was president at the time. If you talked to 100 conservatives, 30-35 of them might start talking about how Bill and Hillary killed Vince Foster, about Whitewater, etc. But most of the time, <em>those</em> particular conspiracy theories were easily dismissable (unlike the JFK assassination, for instance). </p>

<p>There used to be conspiracy theories that would cross over. Lately we&#39;ve seen the right-wing grab hold of conspiracy theories about the US intelligence community, for instance. For years, right-wingers wouldn&#39;t consider conspiracy theories that involved the CIA or FBI, because those organizations were committing crimes and doing &quot;business&quot; that engendered favorable results in the eyes of right-wing conspiracy theorists: they were going after Communists, they were targeting &quot;hippies&quot; and Lefties, they were overthrowing Socialist governments, etc. I saw the pinnacle of this when the Iran-Contra hearings were happening and conservatives were outraged that the government wanted Oliver North and parts of the intelligence community to be accountable for doing <em>actual</em> bad shit. Conservatives back then argued in favor of opacity for secret intelligence operations, not transparency, because transparency would jeopardize ongoing missions that would be favorable for the US and its business interests.</p>

<p><em>Far-right</em> conspiracy theorists barely gave a damn about the ATF, for instance, until Bill Clinton was president; there were anti-tax protesters and terrorists like Gordon Kahl who would <em>very</em> occasionally get into shootouts with the police or go on the run, but these were people who were involved in the Klan and other underground right-wing groups. The FBI and CIA didn&#39;t bother them - the LEFT were very critical of those organizations, not the right-wing. They were more concerned with &quot;international Jewry&quot; and the like.</p>

<p>But since Clinton&#39;s presidency and especially since 9/11, it seems as though the right has had a monopoly on conspiracy theory. Sure, the Left had their share of George W. Bush-era speculation (who remembers Jeff Gannon?), but it seems as though the lines between &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; blurred somewhere along the way and the right started dominating conspiracy discussions - and somehow really &quot;dumb&quot; conspiracy talk (like chemtrails and anti-vax) became associated with the Left. </p>

<p>In the last year or so, this sub in particular has become dominated by anti-Clinton discussion. Sure, CLinton has her fair share of skeletons in her closet, but over the course of the last year or so, the focus on Clinton has led a lot of people in this sub and in the conspiracy community to believing that Clinton&#39;s perceived rival, Trump, is somehow <em>on their side.</em> Like, somehow Trump is some kind of truth-telling underdog champion of human dignity and freedom or some shit. </p>

<p>Which is <em>completely idiotic.</em> He&#39;s a rich, lying scumbag with virtual <em>acres</em> of closet space dedicated to storing skeletons. He&#39;s no different than <em>any</em> shady politician, if not worse. If Trump - and members of Trump&#39;s team - are in power now, why not focus on them? They&#39;re running the show now; if the idea behind conspiracy speculation is to question those in power, those <em>with</em> power, then he and they shouldn&#39;t be immune from investigation. It seems like people in this sub somehow think that Trump shouldn&#39;t be questioned, that no one should be holding his administration&#39;s feet to the fire. Which is....odd, given what the conspiracy theory community has always been about: interrogating and investigating power.</p>

<p>Given that a <em>lot</em> of space and time have been devoted to Pizzagate, it seems reasonable that there should be time and space dedicated to <em>any other</em> conspiracy theory, no matter if its adherents are pro- or anti-Trump...right? Otherwise, this sub would just be shilling for Trump. I mean, I&#39;m sure that there&#39;d be a lot more activity in this sub is anti-Trump conspiracy talk were allowed to thrive. And I&#39;m sure that a lot of people who would otherwise gravitate toward this sub but have been turned off by the overwhelming right-wing slant of the discussions would be involved if participants would be willing to entertain the idea that Trump is just as vulnerable to conspiracy talk as Clinton or anyone else. I mean...look at the upvotes that certain anti-Trump posts get, but then look at all the threads and posts calling out anti-Trump posts. It seems like people might come here looking to talk about Trump&#39;s various shady behaviors then get turned off by how rabidly <em>pro-</em>Trump many of the discussions are; sometimes people drive-by upvote posts because they want to bolster what someone has said without getting their own hands dirty. </p>

<p>Whatever. I&#39;m just saying that this sub should allow and foster anti-Trump conspiracy theories because the incessant focus <em>away</em> from Trump immediately cuts off what could be a great many productive discussions. </p>

<p>And the immediate jump to &quot;You&#39;re a CTR shill!&quot; is dumb. Believe me, there are <em>a lot</em> of people out there who are not pleased with Trump, and we&#39;re not getting fucking paid to post about this motherfucker. We&#39;ll post about him for free, happily. This idea that any anti-Trump sentiment is astroturf is astonishingly insulting to a lot of peoples&#39; intelligence.</p>

<p>Oh, I see that. But you have to consider that we are currently depended on <strong>oil</strong> and Saudi Arabia is our Dealer. So we can&#39;t afford breaking with South Arabia. Once our energy dependence is gone, Saudi Arabia is next. Will probably take a couple of decades. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like a dichotomy, but it actually isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I say, let&#39;s get rid of every radical muslim in the western world by deporting them, to keep the home country safe. </p>

<p>Additionally let&#39;s also eradicate ISIS with every air strike we can, promote a Regime in Iraq and Syria that keeps Islamic forces contained and when we become independent of Saudi Oil, we can talk about making another enemy on our list.</p>

<p>Till then I am fine with proxy wars in the middle east, since we have the superior military strength.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try and shed some light on my thoughts about all this and hope to get some sort of balance.  </p>

<p>When Trump started getting serious attention, I refused to even listen to people talk about him.  I often cut people off at work and asked them not to bother me with this retarded topic.  Trump is a tool, he didn&#39;t even deserve my 1% attention.</p>

<p>Then something odd happened.  Wikileaks opened my eyes to a lot of fucked up shit.  I spent close to 18 hours a day for two weeks digging into the emails and going deep down that disgusting pizza rabbit hole.  The_Donald became an important place for me to visit to get info about this, and while I was there I noticed something.  The people posting were a lot like me.  They cared about the email leaks, they cared about the truth, they cared about each other.  Sure it was a circle jerk of massive proportions, but it felt good to be a part of it.  It felt... right.</p>

<p>After seeing some posts on that subreddit, I started seeing the truth of what Trump was saying and doing.  I still considered him a joke, but quickly realised main stream media was going all out in an attempt to ruin him.  Now here&#39;s the thing, I Fucking hate the media.  All the conspiracies you can think of don&#39;t come close to the shit the media has done in the last 100 years.  </p>

<p>So why was all MSM after him?  This made me think that there was something there.  And then when he won, seeing how the media and people in general just didn&#39;t know how to act, well that showed that the fix for Hilary failed.  The master plans have very obviously been ruined, and now it&#39;s a mad scramble to fix it.  </p>

<p>Maybe he&#39;s worse than Hilary.  Maybe we are always going to be slaves in the big picture to the elite, but I can&#39;t lie that seeing Trump tell CNN to go fuck itself feels soooo good.  If only for the fact that the media is getting destroyed and people are forced to search for their own facts and truths....well maybe we have a chance.</p>

<p>Because he has said and done hugely alarming, largest-red-flag-I&#39;ve-ever-fucking-seen stuff. It is nearly impossible to list the amount of completely inexcusable and unacceptable things he has accrued over the course of the election and since. If I were in the media I don&#39;t know how I could have possibly covered it all without sounding completely obsessed with criticizing Trump, because he just kept saying more stupid or alarming shit.</p>

<p>At any rate, in principle the MSM should &quot;be after&quot; everyone: if there is something the public should know about (e.g. a questionable action or statement) it&#39;s their job to find it and report it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>working class new yorkers hate him cause he stiffs contractors anytime he can and hires foreign workers, hell he just applied to get more guest workers at mara  lago, rich new yorkers hate him cause he has no class.  Black people hate him cause he&#39;s obviously racist, from redlining to his insistence on the guilt of the innocent central park five in the face of overwhelming evidence, and just the assumption cause he&#39;s a rich white guy who&#39;s dad was pro-kkk and he&#39;s never tried to prove he wasn&#39;t racist in any meaningfully convincing way.</p>

<p>my personal feeling is he&#39;s the ultimate expression of surface over substance, he&#39;s like the human form of the concept of gold plating a banister or some shit to impress people, expensive and useless.  That kind of aggressive image promotion just reeks of overcompensation and misdirection.</p>

<p>Once i went with some co-workers to a pyramid scheme recruitment, didn&#39;t realize what it was exactly until the pitch, didn&#39;t figure out how their scheme worked till towards the end.  The scheme was they convinced you you were selling internet access, some third party isp membership or something, but the real trick was that everybody who signed up had to pay a 500$ background check.</p>

<p>The pyramid scheme people reminded me of trump.  The meeting was at some rental house and one of the sales cultists tried very hard to make me impressed that a ne patriot used the house sometimes, fancy (likely rental) sports cars were parked out front, checks for thousands of dollars were pinned to the refrigerator like a childs drawings, all the sales cultists were in suits or fancy dresses.  Them and trump wore wealth in the exact same way, like an assassin bug, as camouflage to trap the mentally unwary.</p>

<p>no, he has everything gold plated and encrusted in whats supposed to be gems, everything about the image he projects has the trappings of being incredibly expensive but is so overdone as to eliminate any suggestion of elegance or grace.

<p>previous republican administrations were whitebread and all, but the red meat the trumps gave the right wing racist base with the promises of a wall and a muslim ban really drove the racist vote out.

<p>Here&#39;s a little history lesson for you: Trump&#39;s first appearance in the New York Times was back in 1973, when he was being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/07/30/1973-meet-donald-trump/">sued for refusing to rent to blacks</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that there hasn&#39;t been a shift over to Trump because there was such a brutal and ugly campaign run only 3 months ago with so many dirty secrets being uncovered has resulted in zero repercussions. In essence, the majority feel cheated out of a victory and will not stop until they receive penance for all their &#39;work&#39;. It&#39;s why I believe #pizzagate holds so much more water than your typical conspiracy. Those e-mails painted very succinct angles of fraud in regards to the primary election process and <strong>nothing</strong> was done about it. The media is clearly on the Democrat and Clintons side and there is a large populace that are fed up with it. They are out for blood. Between the Clinton Foundations connection with Haiti-trafficking, Clintin-ISIS and Podesta-pedophilia, SOMETHING has to break, right? This is compounded by the fact that Trump has alluded to some odd behavior in relation to Clinton/Epstein with some rather choice words. This is backed by the near 2000 trafficking arrests since his November win. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the big Trump conspiracy right now potentially, Russia? While anything is possible, we have a Democratic party who has been pushing that narrative so hard that it has all but lost all steam. Wikileaks has said time and time again it was not a Russian operative that provided the e-mails. If they are wrong at such a top level, why would anyone believe anything granular? This is backed by the fact we know there are a ton of people in the alphabet agencies that wanted to do anything they could to prevent a Clinton win. That makes infinitely more sense than Russia having blackmail over a well known, public facing billionaire with a household name. But even more so, if the media won&#39;t run with any of the mounding evidence for any of these conspiracies, why should the opposing side look deeper into Trump? It&#39;s the main stream narrative vs the researchers/conspiracy guys. And the researchers want a stamp in their books before moving on.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact this administration hasn&#39;t even been in place for a full month yet so there&#39;s still 4-8 more years to go. A lot has happened in 3 weeks, but it still is only 3 weeks of potentially 200-400~. Plenty of time to pivot to new ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you said, except for where you equated the massive amount of pizzagate posts with being pro-Trump. I am on the left politically, and I hate and distrust Trump as much as anybody. But I also have watched the pizzagate situation growing from the start, and I absolutely think it&#39;s real.</p>

<p>If a lot of people here also think it&#39;s real, then of course there will be a huge amount of posts every day about it. Not only does the situation risk falling by the wayside like the investigation into the Franklin scandal, which died out and failed to indict the politicians involved, but it also involves the lives of children. </p>

<p>If pizzagate is true, then everyday there is no smoking gun evidence or arrests means more and more children being hurt. So I really don&#39;t get the complaint about all of the pizzagate posts. It has nothing to do with left or right, it&#39;s just that the evidence already found is enough to make a lot of people here believe it to be true.</p>

<p>And if you read the comments to a lot of the pizzagate posts, you&#39;ll see there are plenty of people who aren&#39;t pro-Trump who are involved in this. It&#39;s just a big deal to a lot of people, and this kind of situation brings a lot of urgency with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it. I agree with everything you&#39;ve said about what has happened to this sub in the past year. To be honest I was a huge Sanders supporter in the primaries, and in part was because of the anti-establishment rhetoric he used, which really spoke to how I feel politically (no,duh that&#39;s why I&#39;m on this sub). But when all that shit with the DNC happened and Bernie lost, I was so mad about it. Then all the Wikileaks/emails came out against Clinton and I was so anti-Hillary at that point that I switched over and voted for Trump, and actually had an ounce of hope. </p>

<p>And even when I did vote, I never felt a sense of loyalty or strong support for him. My vote for him was mainly out of anti-establishment candidate, and now the political state we find ourselves in is horrifying. I totally agree with you, even if he declares to be a man of the people, he is the fucking President and should be held to the same scrutiny that this sub has given every other president. I also am turned off lately because frankly the discussions here are not as genuine or as thoughtful as they were before the election, regardless of the subject matter. And I think a lot of that has to do with what you saying about die-hard Trump supporters here now wanting anti-trump discussion. </p>

<p>I also really liked the beginning of your post when you talked about how both sides evolved with their theories. Anyways, this was an awesome post and was spot on about how I also feel about this sub.</p>

<p>And I still really enjoy this place, you can still find good, intelligent, non-biased discussions, but it&#39;s just more rare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha! It makes a lot of sense now. In my opinion,  Donald Trump wasn&#39;t the savior we all thought he was. I know all of us will be left scratching our heads the moment his administration is over. I believe he had his finger on the pulse of the Republican TEA party base, and used it for his advantage. Now him and his kleptocrats in Washington are using the GOP to essentially raid the public coffers and bring us 5 steps closer to corporate tyranny than we previously were. He&#39;s an acceleration of Clinton, a fifth Bush administration, and a man who clearly has misguided policies.</p>

If he has nothing to hide then let&#39;s open a Congressional investigation, FBI investigation, and also let Jeff Sessions take the reigns in making sure we weed out any corruption.

<p>T_D users still think Hillary and Donald are competing. They thought they&#39;d be happy he won, but now he&#39;s the President and they don&#39;t have Hilary as a target, they&#39;re being forced to defend Trump on his own. It&#39;s way harder to deflect to Obama (not gonna debate on his presidency, but you can&#39;t argue that the perception of Obama is nearly as bad as the perception of Hillary) so they keep pretending it&#39;s still Trump v.

<p>The massive NYPD case on Anthony Weiner and the 650000 emails on his shared laptop with wife Huma Abeddin, are key to unraveling the crimes of Clinton and her cohorts.   Most of these emails are associated with Hillary Clinton and the state dept.
According to NYPD Chief of detectives, Robert Boyce, the emails contain proof of child exploitation, sex crimes, money laundering, perjury and pay to play.
These emails are key.   The FBI has them now.</p>

<p>So many of us are hoping Jeff Sessions will allow the FBI to thoroughly do their job without being held back by politics like the last investigation.   The last Clintn investigation was a joke.
There was no Grand Jury called,  no subpoenas, no court orders, co-conspirators were interviewed together and given immunity for nothing in return.  The FBI never handles cases this way.</p>

<p>The Trump vs. Clinton contest is <em>over</em>. If something about Trump is criticized, &quot;but Hillary&quot; isn&#39;t an answer, yet it still seems to be the default, knee-jerk answer for many people.</p>

<p>If the topic is <em>about</em> Clinton, criticize away. Investigate, shine a spotlight on her dealings, and so on. She&#39;s earned all the attention she gets in that regard. She was a shitty politician.</p>

<p>The whole <em>point</em> of this exchange is that speaking out against Trump doesn&#39;t make someone pro-Hillary, and that answering Trump criticism with &quot;but Hillary!&quot; is ridiculous and pointless.</p>

It&#39;s a gathering of like minded individuals gathered for the specific reason of rallying around a politician they&#39;re rabid fans of.

To think it was anything OTHER than an echo chamber you would have to be really really REALLY dumb,so I&#39;m not sure what point you&#39;re trying to make there. The problem comes when public spaces like Facebook become echo chambers because then misinformation spreads like wildfire. when the uninformed are exposed to it.

<p>Echo chambers created by data analysis and algorithms, so that it&#39;s easier to provide you with content that they know you will consume, and ads that they know speak directly to you.</p>

<p>These types of algorithms were being used by CTR, and they are being implemented by the Trump administration, as well. Did you know that Trump&#39;s data analysis company claims to have between 2,000-5,000 data points on every single American in the United States?  It&#39;s really easy to create an echo chamber with that much data on the people within that chamber. </p>

Whether it be Hilary, Obama, the government, immigrants etc and so on it&#39;s the same.  It&#39;s how he props himself up.  I&#39;m not using this as a negative necessarily, but there is one issue...</p>

<p>Who do you have to compete with to win now?  He&#39;s picking a fight with the media, or anyone else who has influence.  The problem is, the buck stops with him, now.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m so sick of seeing accusations of &quot;brigading&quot; whenever there&#39;s a legit news story that involves an actual conspiracy. Like...you know that&#39;s what happens when people find out information about something they find interesting, right? They go find sources of information about that thing they find interesting. They may even comment on threads about that thing making the news that they find interesting. </p>

<p>Anything that doesn&#39;t fit the &quot;Trump can do no wrong and he&#39;s the swashbuckling hero of freedom-minded people everywhere&quot; narrative gets accused of being Shareblue or CTR or &quot;Marxism&quot; or &quot;brigading from r/politics&quot; or astroturf...anything but an organic, <em>authentic</em> expression of interest, or a real expression of an actual, valid opinion. </p>

<p>Think about it: Trump was elected President because of a razor-thin margin in several swing states. He <em>lost the popular vote.</em> more people voted <em>against</em> Trump than <em>for</em> Trump. And since elected, he and his administration have been overreaching, issuing insane numbers of executive orders, shutting down dissent, cracking down on their opposition. There have also been numerous revelations of corruption in his administration. Insiders have been trying to let the media know about how shady and potentially dangerous his inner circle is. His top advisors hold opinions most people don&#39;t share and they&#39;re trying to ram their wildly unpopular agenda down the world&#39;s throats....and this is somehow <em>not</em> supposed to provoke a backlash?! </p>

<p>Seriously, the people in this sub and in other pro-Trump areas of this site need to wake up to the fact that Trump&#39;s actions, policies, and stances are <em>actually</em> unpopular. You know, among <em>people</em>. </p>

<p>And that <em>mayyyyybe</em>, just maybe, there might be some conspiracies going on with the guy. It&#39;s just weird that people think pretty much <em>every goddamned person</em> in Washington and pretty much every super-rich dude everywhere is some kind of criminal, but...uh, <em>Trump *</em>isn&#39;t***? I wonder where people got the idea that Trump wasn&#39;t corrupt. Where are they getting this idea that Trump&#39;s administration is absolutely free of actual, legit conspiracies?</p>

<p>Whats with you the_donald users coming here and claiming its a pro-Hillary sub?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve actually noticed a lot of comments running around lately.  Like, &quot;Wow, looking at all the comments, I never would have believed so many Trump supporters would be standing up for communists&quot;.<br/>
There were like literally 20 comments and no one had said anything like that, yet the comment was heavily upvoted.<br/>
It starts with a false premise, build the narrative, argue against and declare the moral high ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you totally, but you currently have the top post...so perhaps they have point in arguing that this sub, like most of reddit, tends to be towards a more liberal world view.

    <div class="md"><p>Thats because they flood subs with their useless bile. Also you think I&#39;m leftist because I made 2 posts in r/fuckthealtright? Why don&#39;t you read the comment and poster I was talking too. The guy was defending racial determinism (he apparently can&#39;t get along with dark skinned people because muh genetics) , and ethnic cleansing. So if calling out a legit racist person on their bullshit is leftist I guess I&#39;m leftist. This has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with idiots shilling everywhere. </p>

<p>CNN and all the rest of the mainstream media have been lying to us for decades, you can&#39;t blame anyone for being skeptical of conspiracy&#39;s they try to put on us.</p>

<p>And i dont know if you see this side of it, but we&#39;re all human beings that have a visceral reaction to anything involving child abuse.

<p>I wasn&#39;t? I was just pointing out all of the forum sliding going on by Trump shills. Hence my original post. If you want to be skeptical about Trump conspiracy posts, go for it.

    <div class="md"><p>Please be more specific.</p>

<p>The National Security Advisory to the President of the United States just resigned due to a potentially improper relationship with the Russian government.</p>

<p>Do you expect people to <em>not</em> talk about it and to <em>not</em> criticize the man who picked the guy in the first place?</p>

<p>Plus, loads of people have been urging others, &quot;focus on Pizzagate!&quot; and responding with &quot;But Hillary was corrupt, too!&quot; Do you expect people not to notice this and not to comment on it?</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy sub. Something like Flynn&#39;s resignation should be <strong>huge</strong>.</p>

<p>And yet:</p>

<p>Among the top 25 threads right now, just 2 are about the Flynn case, and 3 of those are about how he was set up. <em>not</em> about him conspiring with the Russian government.</p>

<p>3 of those top 25 threads are about Clinton.</p>

<p>10 of the top 25 are about pizzagate or are tied to it in some way.</p>

<p>This sub is <em>dominated</em> by one topic, and when one measly thread out of 25 talks about a different topic in a way you don&#39;t like, i.e. discussing Flynn&#39;s alleged collusion with the Russian government, it&#39;s &quot;fishy?&quot;</p>

<p>Give me a break.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neil Gorsuch is likely to be &quot;more conservative&quot; than Scalia. If you think the state of the Fourth Amendment is bad now, you won&#39;t recognize it in a few years.</p>

<p>As for Anthony Kennedy, obviously the gay marriage decision was a &quot;liberal&quot; one. But remember, Ted Olson was a lawyer for the support of it. There had long been articles online entitled &quot;The Conservative Case for Gay Marriage.&quot; Most important, this was a social issues decision.</p>

<p>Before Sandra Day O&#39;Connor retired, the &quot;conservative block&quot; was Roberts-Thomas-Scalia-Kennedy. After she retired, it became Roberts-Thomas-Scalia-Alito. Kennedy became the &quot;swing voter.&quot; This moved the court to the &quot;right.&quot;</p>

<p>Case in point: in about 2003, the court struck down a state abortion restriction that did not include an exception for the life of the woman. After, the court upheld the national abortion ban. One vote, big difference.</p>

<p>So, Anthony Kennedy may be the &quot;swing voter&quot; now, but it swings to the &quot;right.&quot;</p>

<p>When it comes to business, Anthony Kennedy is solidly on the side of &quot;conservatives&quot; -- he proved that loudly not only by supporting <em>Citizens United</em> but by writing the decision.</p>

<p>When you consider that Republicans have been very careful lately with their nominations, I am just about positive that Neil Gorsuch will not only be &quot;far right&quot; -- he will be further right than expected.</p>

<p>The &quot;mistake&quot; of David Souter echoes. The two newest Republican appointees, Roberts and Alito, are very far right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First you equated me with the donald, which isn&#39;t true. Then you tried to twist my words and now this. You keep grasping at straws but you still don&#39;t get it. I have never said I am fair or balanced, just that I actively engage in this sub with an open mind, and am tired of people who migrate over here when we hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and make low effort posts and cause division and dilution of content. That does not mean I dont see the trends. It doesn&#39;t mean I am &quot;fair and balanced&quot; by whatever metrics you decide at any given moment. </p>

<p>I am particularly annoyed that ETS keeps linking over here, and discussing our subreddit as if they have some kind of stake in it. We dont want or need other subreddits telling us or our mods how our sub should be. People flooding in from both sides of the politically polarized environment have strangled this sub, and it is only getting worse. And yes, this is a trend across all of reddit. Why do you think the donald was created? It is a reactionary sub because hyperpartisan, mainstream, democratic politics have completely taken over the rest of Reddit. First <a href="/r/politicaldiscussion">/r/politicaldiscussion</a>, then <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, then <a href="/r/worldsnews">/r/worldsnews</a> and it is spreading like a cancer. This was once a site where people from different backgrounds could come to exchange ideas, but it has been intentionally converted into a democratic political propaganda machine. Out of that came the hyperpartisan right, on their containment sub the donald. Now, the two seem to be fighting to claim <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but this subreddit&#39;s strength was that it was a bastion from all of that. It is a place to discuss wild theories and fringe ideas away from the propaganda echochamber. To uncover the things that are intentionally hidden from the public, the things that the talking heads dont tell you. What the fuck do you think this is? Its a fucking conspiracy subreddit. Yet people come on here and post CNN links and wonder why people don&#39;t upvote it. </p>

<p>Part of the reason we have so many users from the donald, and part of why most of them are active and constructive participants is because the left wing has forced them away. Reddit has become incredibly hostile to anyone who doesn&#39;t blend in, and thus those of us on the fringe have developed some shared interests. Yet this tide has followed us here, and it cant blend in because all it wants is to take over all dissent, to have everyone think the exact same.</p>

<p>I have asked very simple things of you and others who migrate over here - 1) stop insulting our mods. 2) stop attacking people and being close minded and dismissive, that is the antithesis of our subreddit. 3) stop treating our sub like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. This is not the place to go to whine about how much you dislike the donald. You can go to just about any other subreddit on this website and circle jerk about how much you hate trump and his supporters. If you have a problem with the discourse here, or if it offends you that people disagree with you, then this probably isnt the place for you. you can try lurking for a while or at the very least engage in earnest and open minded discourse. Instead, you have done the exact opposite. You have jumped to all sorts of assumptions and conclusions, you have been hostile, and you have repeatedly used this sub as the place to express your angst for the donald.</p>

<p>You continue to argue with me by making baseless claims and intentionally misrepresenting what I have said to you. What else can I do at this point? You are intent to continue with this dishonesty and do not seem to have made an effort to actually realize what I have been trying to tell you. I feel I have made myself quite clear, and unfortunately, I don&#39;t see this discourse becoming anymore productive.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have heard they are trying to do people. The left wing of politics has really degraded all of their morals. Violence in the streets and doxxing, yet they still claim a moral high ground. Then they attack <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for daring to disagree with them and look into things that involve the liberal politicians they seem to hold with such high esteem. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really baffling. Yet at the same time they seem totally unaware of this, and seem to think they are always the &quot;good guys&quot;. They don&#39;t seem to comprehend why people are fleeing the Democratic party in droves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obviously not everyone who is left wing, I am probably further on the left on the classical political spectrum, but specifically the radicalized wing of the current left wing politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have found that the best way to deal with this is to spread information about all types of shills. This will hopefully encourage people to stop assuming a comment or post is correct if it is highly upvoted, stop adopting the beliefs of their &quot;peers&quot; on social media just because it seems like a lot of people believe something, and stop assuming only one side has shills. </p>

<p>Many countries and corporations use astroturfing to change the minds of the masses. This includes the governments of the US, China, Britain, Israel, Turkey, Russia, and Vietnam. It also includes Warner Brothers, Microsoft, Sony, Dish Network, Lord and Taylor, and at least one pharmaceutical company called Duchesnay. Since this practice is technically illegal, and since it&#39;s very easy to get away with it, there are obviously a lot more companies that do this.</p>

<p>I encourage all to spread around the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=iz5uo692&amp;amp;sh=40bfc489">Astroturfing Information Megathread</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People already call others shills. All I&#39;m doing is providing information about the practice. Telling me that I&#39;m harming discourse isn&#39;t going to stop me. Along with spreading this information, I have also been explaining where you might see them and where you probably won&#39;t. </p>

<p>Shill confessions can be <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/5pzcnx/shill_confessions_and_additional_information/?st=iz2pr9t3&amp;amp;sh=2e21d360">found here.</a> </p>

<p>Going by the number of entities that we know for a fact hire shills,  and going by the tools they use to manipulate conversations online, we can made a guess as to how pervasive the practice is. First, we need to realize that it&#39;s very difficult to prove that a company is hiring shills. The actual number is probably much higher, especially considering the fact that this is an illegal practice for corporations and a disaster when a population finds out their government is spreading propaganda online using sockpuppets. They use &quot;keyword alert&quot; services, which give them notifications when a specific word or phrase is mentioned on social media. They can be in your thread within minutes. The second point I want to make is the fact that even if the total number of manipulated posts is 3 percent or even 1 percent, if these organizations are being run by even semi-competent people, they will concentrate their efforts only on threads which have a high visibility, such as everything on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> or anything that has the potential to hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> later in the day. If they have extra time, which they probably always do, they will dip into lower threads because they have to fill up their time if they work 8 hours per day. Think of it like billboards. 99 percent of the Earth is billboard free, but these ads are strategically placed in high traffic areas, which ensures that almost everybody sees a couple billboards every day. Even if 1 percent of the posts and comments are manipulated by shills, you can easily see their work every time you browse Reddit. </p>

<p>Why are they on Reddit? Isn&#39;t this a niche website? Not anymore.  Reddit.com is the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com">7th most popular website</a> in the United States (3rd largest for social media) and has <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/reddit.com#overview">more traffic than mainstream media and media websites, such as cnn.com.</a> In my experience, Reddit gives you the most views for the amount of effort you put in. It&#39;s extremely easy to spread information on here. That&#39;s why they come here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real problem isn&#39;t shills per se, its brigaders from hivemind subs. If you look at who the &quot;shills&quot; are, their mostly ETS posters that migrate in mass for certain topics (eg. Flynn). </p>

<p>This is specifically against Reddit rules. The same rules which are strictly enforced by <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a> and others against The_donald. They should be strictly enforced all over the board, but <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a> and the other admins have fallen into partisan enforcement of the rules to shape reddit into a hivemind that suits their narrow beliefs. </p>

<p>Brigading is the single most detrimental thing to discourse on reddit. it. It degrades and destroys the ability of subs to maintain their own culture and open discourse by inundating a small sub like ours with spam of like minded people looking to push a shared agenda. We need help from admins here, the only other solution would be for mods to ban people with ETS, the_donald or similar subs in their post history but that would go against everything this sub is about. We obviously cant ban political discussion because it is so often intertwined with conspiracy. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind a few threads about last year&#39;s DNC nominee, but the election is over and there looks to be many other conspiracies unfolding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was a Democrat for over 10 years, but in 2016 I left the party when the DNC literally cheated Bernie, his supporters, and our very democracy. My time and money was wasted on a candidate that had no chance, and if we had known this from the start we could have built a real coalition around a 3rd party like Stein. Imagine what she could have done with $100 million (Bernie donations).</p>

<p>And now neither Keith Ellison or Tom Perez will admit that the DNC rigged the system against Sanders. That tells us one thing at least... that our job isn&#39;t done yet. If we want to restore power back to the American people and restore a functioning democracy we have to hold them accountable. Until then, I have no issues with DNC/Clinton posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. And it will continue to cost them. The biggest problem is is that by having a party be completely ineffective, we essentially become a 1 party system which makes America even more of a tyrannical oligarchy. If we are mandated to have a two party system, it would be ideal to at least have two functional parties and some quality discourse, but that seems impossible at this point.</p>

<p>Actually he didn&#39;t, because he was never in the general election, because he lost the primary. All of the &quot;shadiness&quot; I saw out of the DNC emails I saw were all from after he had basically no chance of moving on. Staffers were understandably frustrated at him for dragging out the primary way longer than necessary, because the writing was on the wall after New York and that was precious time spent dividing the Democrats instead of trying to rally them around the person who was (at that point) clearly going to become the nominee. This is like Politics 101 here.</p>

<p>Look, I wish he won. I voted for him, I proselytized to my friends and family. I&#39;m probably going to join the Democratic Socialists of America. Still, I&#39;m a cynic at heart, and all this strikes me as an attempt to pretend Bernie and his ideas could only be defeated by cheating and a denial that Hillary had electoral upsides (mainly in the form of name recognition) that Bernie just didn&#39;t.</p>

I think he wins in this universe, where Trump didn&#39;t see him as enough of a threat to attack him (on the contrary, he pushed the &quot;Bernie got cheated&quot; narrative to increase apathy among Democratic voters). I do believe he would have won against Trump, but A) we can&#39;t know for sure and B) it was kind of irrelevant after he failed to beat Hillary. And he did get beaten. People want to pretend it was all down to the DNC somehow, but he lost by millions of votes, more than Hillary was losing by when she dropped out to leave the way open for Barack.</p>

<p>Or when Donna Brazile passed along debate questions... against the rules.</p>

<p>Or when the DNC didn&#39;t hold Clinton accountable for LYING TO AMERICAN VOTERS that is also against the rules <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkS26PX4rc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbkS26PX4rc</a></p>

<p>These are small-picture people. Instead of accepting the plain facts that Clinton won the caucus and out-hustled Sanders at the state convention, they want to talk about arcane rules being imposed, <strong>whether chairs were really thrown</strong> and if anyone should make a fuss out of chalk on walls and sidewalks (even if the messages were hateful).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CHAIRS WERE NOT THROWN. The DNC spread an article that begs the question of Bernie supporters, but no chairs were thrown. This article is extremely misleading, and the author was implying that chairs were thrown for months. <a href="http://usuncut.com/politics/nevada-reporter-chair-throwing/">Oh... and Jon Ralston was FIRED</a>.</p>

<p>Considering that Comey reopened the case a week before the election and American voters chose Hillary in the primaries because she was a &quot;safe choice&quot;, and then when Comey gave his testimony in June and the DNC didn&#39;t hold Clinton accountable, that is basically spitting in the face of every Democrat in the United States and telling them that the DNC doesn&#39;t give a shit about them.</p>

<p>You can speculate all you want, but that&#39;s all it is. Instead, why don&#39;t you focus less on speculation and more on demanding accountability when you have facts right in front of your face. Nobody in our country should have supported the DNC or Clinton, especially after they were lied to throughout the primaries as proven by James Comey &amp; Julian Assange. Clinton shouldn&#39;t have ever been on the ballot, so who cares if <em>you</em> don&#39;t think he would have beaten Trump? Bernie was the only politically legitimate candidate Democrats had.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not discuss both? Neither party has a monopoly on corruption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though they did retort with what Hillary did and not what Trump&#39;s team is doing now, I think this shows (on a small scale) why no more civil conversations go on.</p>

<p>FWIW; It is clear that <strong>BOTH</strong> parties (even given that Trump is not a republican and Hillary is not a democrat) do not have a monopoly on corruption. And given that Hillary is not in the White House (thank God!), and has no state power, that doesn&#39;t mean she couldn&#39;t still have some connections with people still in the government that could try to undermine the current administration. And before you solely point to President Trump being a pawn to President Putin/Kremlin, lest we forget who paid into the Clinton Foundation. Lest we forget why Obama gave his &quot;red line&quot; speech to Assad given that America had no interest in Syria until a certain Saudi wanted some &#39;pipe work&#39; done. But oh, Obama is no longer president, so I guess what he and Clinton did, just magically disappeared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you&#39;re 100% right about what this place isn&#39;t about. I don&#39;t want to be part of the problem because I really love this sub.</p>

<p>But can I pled my case for having a wee bit of hope in trump? I&#39;ve always loathed both sides. Can count on one hand politicians that I don&#39;t absolutely hate. Trump seems like a wild card that is so far doing what he said. He actually may not be evil. Clearly, he&#39;s no politician. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump is going to &quot;fix it,&quot; but hope that he&#39;ll at least try to take back a bit of the government from tptb and restore it to us Americans. He&#39;s the first &quot;dictator&quot; who wants us citizens to be armed! He&#39;s really the first glimmer of hope for me since I fell down the rabbit hole. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a good thing that Trump is getting normies to talk about conspiracies, globalists and the shadow government? He&#39;s dismantled the 2-party system and is destroying msm. His supporters now know the gop/dnc is the same and believe a ton of conspiracies. They&#39;ve also done some of the best citizen journalism and digging through wikileaks, etc. His supporters seem like a net benefit. Some of the best info as far as conspiracies is now coming from t_d and there&#39;s a lot more people really doing some good investigating because their sub is extremely active.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well put. I would just add to this that it seems far too many of us (and I&#39;ve been somewhat guilty myself) of seeing conspiracy/corruption on one side as somehow negating or diminishing the conspiracy/corruption on the other side. E.g. if the Clinton Foundation corruption is as far reaching as alleged, then we should ignore corruption and conflicts of interest with Trump; or conversely, Trump&#39;s corruption is so bad that we should ignore Clinton and more broadly the Democratic establishment&#39;s corruption. </p>

<p>Before this election, it seemed the general &quot;sense of the sub&quot; was that politicians on both sides were either a) funded and directed by the same cabal, or b) funded and directed by different cabals/factions, none of which had the people&#39;s interest at heart. It seemed we used to understand that neither Overton-approved side was good, but now the sub is as split into camps as the rest of the country. I think some of this is certainly intentional on the part of <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/22/1112509/-The-Gentleperson-s-Guide-to-Forum-Spies"><em>forum spies</em></a>, yet it&#39;s up to us to actively resist their efforts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This should be a pro-conspiracy, not a pro-Trump or pro-Hillary sub.</p>

<p>I would argue we should be anti-conspiracy ;) but I get your drift. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Do the people at r/conspiracy honestly believe that some &quot;outsider&quot; was able to trick the corporate media, the Republican party, and even the Democratic Party into giving up the pole position of control?</p>

<p>To override the establishment with such ease would make &quot;ignorant&quot; Donald Trump the most brilliant man who ever lived.</p>

<p>I have another idea. Donald Trump is smarter than people give him credit for, and with key player sin the Republican Party the media, and perhaps even in the Democratic Party perpetuating this illusion of &quot;outsider,&quot; the entire establishment got what it wanted. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mhm, think for yourselves. Absorb the data, break it down, come to your own conclusion. Share your conclusion, accept criticism, repeat the process with what you have learned. Everything has to come from you. This applies to everyone.</p>

<p>You are responsible for your thoughts and action. No matter what Trump says he will do, or whatever people say Hillary has done, it should not affect you. You should take ALL [every single piece of data, whether it is obviously faked, or seemingly authentic, and analyze and criticize the fuck out of it.] information available to you. From there, you can see different layers of what is actually happening.</p>

<p>None of these things matter if you are just listening to what others are saying and cannot critically think through the layers of misdirection and disinformation.</p>

<p>LAYERS ///</p>

<p>Public - The back and forth we see on the news. Questionable integrity.
Private - The official private positions that we don&#39;t see people discuss on the news. 
Misdirection - Almost always talked about on the news, but mostly posted in alternate news forums and communities. Bits of truth.
Disinformation - Almost never talked about on the news, but mostly posted in alternate news forums and communities. Bits of truth.
Propaganda - Always on the news, usually criticized in alternate news forums and communities. Almost 100% backwards on the truth.</p>

<p>This is, of course, my personal opinion, I&#39;ve merged most layers together to give a general overview and things may or may not work like this. ^</p>

<p>You <em>do</em> realize that being anti-Trump is not the same thing as being pro-Hillary, right?</p>

<p>Why is it so difficult for you to wrap your head around the idea that someone can be against Trump and <em>also</em> be against Clinton, or that they can acknowledge that Trump is unfit for office and <em>also</em> believe Clinton was unfit for office?</p>

<p>Though it&#39;s hard to tell sometimes, this is a conspiracy sub, not a politics sub. Looking at corruption in office and potential conspiracies is what this sub is for, <em>regardless of who&#39;s in office</em>.</p>

<p>Perhaps instead of accusing everyone who disagrees with you of being a shill (even as you yourself shill all day and night), you could actually give objectivity and try. You might find it refreshing.</p>

<p>Democrats have zero power in the federal government right now. There isn&#39;t much point in looking for conspiracies perpetrated by a group that doesn&#39;t have any power. It only makes sense that conservative conspiracists would lose interest and liberal conspiracists would replace them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Trump is their one chance to take down Hillary and other corrupt politicians before it gets completely out of hand, if and when he does, they&#39;ll eventually turn on him for his past/future shinanigans. Why take out Trump now if he&#39;s about to shake things up with TPTB or break this Hillary stuff wide open. This type of shake up doesn&#39;t happen often. If he doesn&#39;t do shit and ends up aligning with the elite, this sub will turn on him overnight... In the end, many here aren&#39;t pro/anti trump/hillary, they&#39;re anti corruption, simple as that. I don&#39;t like Trump, but I&#39;d rather he rips us off a few billion over his term but completely exposes the previous corruption and in the long term saves us a few trillion. It&#39;s sad, but at this point many feel it&#39;s probably our only chance at fixing government, even if the whole thing collapses onto itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have noticed a recent uptick in People trashing Trump, promoting MSM, and FBI narrative. I noticed it around the time I saw Sharedblue agenda&#39;s being passed around. </p>

<p>Trashing Trump is one thing, but promoting MSM, and FBI  narrative is another thing for this sub to now be leaning toward. </p>

<p>On the other side, I have also noticed a &quot;Praise kek,&quot; &quot;red pill,&quot; narrative being pushed as an alternative to research critical thought and analysis. </p>

<p>I think the bottom line is what I went on about this past Friday; &quot;Hillary fucked Reddit up.&quot; Her actions artificially disrupted the community. When she chose to hire shills to harass people, control the narrative, and brigade anything resembling free thought. </p>

<p>I can understand TD supporters are here. They were forced out of just about every other sub, but I don&#39;t understand why HIllary supporters showed up here. Prior to the election this sub was a Hillary trashing paradise. </p>

<p>We all want to act as if we are separated and above believing something that some would consider possible. Then, when some new info comes out that MIGHT prove you right, we like to shit on those people to feel good about ourselves.</p>

<p>Truth is we ALL think some crazy shit is going on. We just want to be part of the winning team that guessed it right. </p>

<p>We should all be working at a common goal to find the truth (whatever it may be) and not beat each other up.</p>

<p>.....conspiracy?</p>

<p>The real question is why your pizzagate doesn&#39;t offer its own sub/safe space for you, so you don&#39;t get triggered by rational discourse.</p>

<p>I feel like this sub is a perversion of &#39;no sleep.&#39; It is as if everything has to be treated as real.</p>

<p>No doubt there is a genuine US/Russia conpiracy occurring today. Bring it up here and the response is &#39;but pizzagate.&#39; Gimme a break. This need not be so political.</p>

It would have been an ill advised thing to do clearly but it isn&#39;t validation. This sub shouldn&#39;t be Pro-Trump or Pro-Hillary.

<p>Dude the national security advisor just resigned after he lied about conspiring with the russian government. This on top of the president, who hired Flynn, already being accused of working with the russians.</p>

<p>People want to talk about it, they think &quot;hey, conspiracy usually goes for this sort of thing. Why wouldn&#39;t they love the government working for a foreign government?&quot; So they came to the sub meant to discuss conspiracies.</p>

<p>Imagine for a moment, that this sub wasn&#39;t obsessed with pizzagate. But then, Podesta gets busted for being a pedophile. Suddenly a bunch of people go to this sub and start talking about how clinton must be involved in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did this sub become so pro Trump and political? When I was lurker. I came for the fun. Now all I see is how the political system is playing everyone for fools here. What ever happened to the theory that Trump and Clinton are part of the New World Order? Designed to tear down the government from the inside out? And divide us while doing so? That was a real conspiracy. Not all this chump change like voter fraud. That&#39;s not conspiracy. That&#39;s been happening for ever. The EMAIL issue happened all the time. Trump being an ass. So what? Not conspiracies. Pizza gate is the best conspiracy out there. Sadly you guys think that Hillary Clinton is some how a pedo or involved with pedos on purpose. Think she has a choice? Bill is the one who created the foundation and he&#39;s the one that kept her afloat. She owes him and all his disgusting friends. </p>

<p>Trump is a weirdo. Far more of a weirdo as Clinton. So when I look at it, as someone who believes in real conspiracies, i know they are both pawns in the same game. I choose Clinton cause she is far better pawn and a pawn that deserves to be played more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At its core, I don&#39;t think this sub is pro any political affiliation. What I DO believe is that this sub has a fluctuating base of users depending on the current political status of the world. When Hillary&#39;s shady practices were brought to light many pro trump/anti Hillary freethinkers (myself included) flocked to this sub in order to discuss these practices with like.minded individuals. Now that many of Trump&#39;s shady practices, and those of his cabinet, are being brought to light we are seeing an influx of pro Hillary anti trump free thinkers. Its just a constant ebb and flow... My two cents</p>

<p>Nothing will change as long as <a href="/u/spez">/u/spez</a> is in charge. He is no longer fit for the position and his incompetence is ruining all of reddit, and by proxy general discourse on the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a Trump supporter, and I have been since day one (simply for the idea of throwing a wrench in the gears). But something is definitely up in my opinion. Trump was not supposed to win, this was not supposed to happen. I still cannot honestly believe that he won the election, and my personal belief is that something else is at play here. I am not saying that Trump cheated the election, because I honestly believe he didn&#39;t. What I do think however is that he was meant to win, as a sort of sacrificial lamb to the slaughter. Something is up, something big. I think we are looking at a big push coming up and we are being overwhelmed by propaganda. This is the exact subversion tactic Yuri Bezmenov discusses, he talks about being overwhelmed by information that it is impossible to decipher the truth. I think that what we are about to witness is just complete breakdown of society and structure. We will be so overwhelmed with &quot;news&quot; and leaks, and who did what that eventually the bottom will fall out, leaving the mess ripe for the picking from whoever is masterminding this. </p>

BLM, the anti-Trump, pro-lgbt marches, women&#39;s march, etc. He has his hands in everything, and the media has been pumping this coverage out.

Using apps that deletes your messages? A white house aide promoting a business tied to the trumps?  Trump&#39;s connections to Russia are scary to say the least.

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. I used to participate here a lot, but the election turned this sub into a T_D vs. CTR battleground and it just all became noise. IT was impossible to participate objectively because of it. Since Trump was selected, the Trumpeters have remained and the CTR&#39;s have fucked off, but the Trumpets like to thwack down any dissent early and often by whinging on about hos this sub is so &quot;anti-Trump&quot; &#39;all of a sudden&#39;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s mass madness. More so than usual. And more importantly, it&#39;s not very informative any more. Try to post anything that&#39;s not Pizzagate or Trump/Clinton related and watch it immediately fall into obscurity. This sub was one of the last worthwhile places on reddit and now it&#39;s a hollowed out husk. </p>

<p>You &quot;felt&quot; it was a brigade.  Great, but you cannot prove it was or wasn&#39;t.  The entire point of my post, that you apparently missed, was why not address the post and content within instead of hand-waving discourse as brigading when you&#39;ve no evidence and doing so is meaningless.  I see people constantly labeling others as shills, using account age and post history, and claims of brigading when forced to confront ideas or stories that they disagree with instead of discussing the actual content.  It&#39;s intellectually dishonest and only does harm to the quality of discourse within this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that there hasn&#39;t been a shift over to Trump because there was such a brutal and ugly campaign run only 3 months ago with so many dirty secrets being uncovered has resulted in zero repercussions. In essence, the majority feel cheated out of a victory and will not stop until they receive penance for all their &#39;work&#39;. It&#39;s why I believe #pizzagate holds so much more water than your typical conspiracy. Those e-mails painted very succinct angles of fraud in regards to the primary election process and <strong>nothing</strong> was done about it. The media is clearly on the Democrat and Clintons side and there is a large populace that are fed up with it. They are out for blood. Between the Clinton Foundations connection with Haiti-trafficking, Clintin-ISIS and Podesta-pedophilia, SOMETHING has to break, right? This is compounded by the fact that Trump has alluded to some odd behavior in relation to Clinton/Epstein with some rather choice words. This is backed by the near 2000 trafficking arrests since his November win. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the big Trump conspiracy right now potentially, Russia? While anything is possible, we have a Democratic party who has been pushing that narrative so hard that it has all but lost all steam. Wikileaks has said time and time again it was not a Russian operative that provided the e-mails. If they are wrong at such a top level, why would anyone believe anything granular? This is backed by the fact we know there are a ton of people in the alphabet agencies that wanted to do anything they could to prevent a Clinton win. That makes infinitely more sense than Russia having blackmail over a well known, public facing billionaire with a household name. But even more so, if the media won&#39;t run with any of the mounding evidence for any of these conspiracies, why should the opposing side look deeper into Trump? It&#39;s the main stream narrative vs the researchers/conspiracy guys. And the researchers want a stamp in their books before moving on.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact this administration hasn&#39;t even been in place for a full month yet so there&#39;s still 4-8 more years to go. A lot has happened in 3 weeks, but it still is only 3 weeks of potentially 200-400~. Plenty of time to pivot to new ideas.</p>

<p>your memes are behind the times, friend. it&#39;s 2017, Fox News is &quot;okay&quot; now (though still not as good as liberal-approved CNN), you&#39;re supposed to be accusing me of watching Infowars or reading Breitbart</p>

<p>and yes, you&#39;ve caught me; I <em>could have</em> been repeating someone else&#39;s theory. but unless you can find someone else saying the same thing I said, before I said it, you&#39;ll have a hard time proving it.</p>

<p>believe it or not, I actually reached the conclusions for my theory on my own; using my own brain(!), I was able to look at what the mainstream mass media is telling us, and infer a possible alternate explanation.</p>

<p>again, there should be no reason for hostility; all I am doing is expressing ideas, fleeting thoughts that passed through my mind, thoughts that nobody else but me might be exposed to if the Internet didn&#39;t exist and I was able to share them.</p>

<p>so what&#39;s the problem with sharing ideas? if they&#39;re wrong, and provably so, then it&#39;s no skin off my back. but if they have any truth to them at all, or even if they don&#39;t but they cause someone reading them to think even <em>further</em> outside the box, in ways that I did or could not... is it really so bad to just share them, here on a subreddit expressly focused on sharing and discussing conspiracy theories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you said, except for where you equated the massive amount of pizzagate posts with being pro-Trump. I am on the left politically, and I hate and distrust Trump as much as anybody. But I also have watched the pizzagate situation growing from the start, and I absolutely think it&#39;s real.</p>

<p>If a lot of people here also think it&#39;s real, then of course there will be a huge amount of posts every day about it. Not only does the situation risk falling by the wayside like the investigation into the Franklin scandal, which died out and failed to indict the politicians involved, but it also involves the lives of children. </p>

<p>If pizzagate is true, then everyday there is no smoking gun evidence or arrests means more and more children being hurt. So I really don&#39;t get the complaint about all of the pizzagate posts. It has nothing to do with left or right, it&#39;s just that the evidence already found is enough to make a lot of people here believe it to be true.</p>

<p>And if you read the comments to a lot of the pizzagate posts, you&#39;ll see there are plenty of people who aren&#39;t pro-Trump who are involved in this. It&#39;s just a big deal to a lot of people, and this kind of situation brings a lot of urgency with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it. I agree with everything you&#39;ve said about what has happened to this sub in the past year. To be honest I was a huge Sanders supporter in the primaries, and in part was because of the anti-establishment rhetoric he used, which really spoke to how I feel politically (no,duh that&#39;s why I&#39;m on this sub). But when all that shit with the DNC happened and Bernie lost, I was so mad about it. Then all the Wikileaks/emails came out against Clinton and I was so anti-Hillary at that point that I switched over and voted for Trump, and actually had an ounce of hope. </p>

<p>And even when I did vote, I never felt a sense of loyalty or strong support for him. My vote for him was mainly out of anti-establishment candidate, and now the political state we find ourselves in is horrifying. I totally agree with you, even if he declares to be a man of the people, he is the fucking President and should be held to the same scrutiny that this sub has given every other president. I also am turned off lately because frankly the discussions here are not as genuine or as thoughtful as they were before the election, regardless of the subject matter. And I think a lot of that has to do with what you saying about die-hard Trump supporters here now wanting anti-trump discussion. </p>

<p>I also really liked the beginning of your post when you talked about how both sides evolved with their theories. Anyways, this was an awesome post and was spot on about how I also feel about this sub.</p>

<p>And I still really enjoy this place, you can still find good, intelligent, non-biased discussions, but it&#39;s just more rare. </p>

<p>I used to think that&#39;s what WikiLeaks was about too, <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/831468455413030912">until today</a>. That organization should be living up to their name and LEAKING the freakin&#39; transcripts of the conversation, not attacking leakers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since 9/11 conspiracy has been cominated by conservatives? Motha what?! 9/11 is the biggest conspiracy out and it solely implicates republicans. This is not left vs right. It is right vs wrong. </p>

<p>If you actually spent time here you&#39;d realise the majority of posters are aware that politicians are on the same team, regardless if their tie is red or blue. If you want to see a discussion you have all the power to come in here and start it. But I suspect you are just here to try discredit this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get you but I find it so tiring h IBF to repeat this all the time. Pizzagate is NOT a partisan conspiracy theory, it involves BOTH sides of the political parties, the elite. I notice that people from the left try to constantly frame this as a right wing conspiracy, when it isn&#39;t t all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have addressed several of them today in an effort to try to put all of this shit to an end. I am so sick of them coming in here and attacking users and shit talking our mods when they only even come here to defend Hillary or attack Trump. That is not what this is about yet they do not seem to understand how their behavior is unwanted and grating. </p>

<p>You are correct in that they come here to repress dissent and freedom of discourse. To attack the very reason that the people of this sub come here for and yet wonder why the are unwanted.</p>

<p>It is truly mindblowing, but we will continue our subreddit here. This is one of the few places left on Reddit that isn&#39;t completely taken over by the mainstream democratic agenda and they are doing their best to try to ruin that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you&#39;re 100% right about what this place isn&#39;t about. I don&#39;t want to be part of the problem because I really love this sub.</p>

<p>But can I pled my case for having a wee bit of hope in trump? I&#39;ve always loathed both sides. Can count on one hand politicians that I don&#39;t absolutely hate. Trump seems like a wild card that is so far doing what he said. He actually may not be evil. Clearly, he&#39;s no politician. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump is going to &quot;fix it,&quot; but hope that he&#39;ll at least try to take back a bit of the government from tptb and restore it to us Americans. He&#39;s the first &quot;dictator&quot; who wants us citizens to be armed! He&#39;s really the first glimmer of hope for me since I fell down the rabbit hole. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a good thing that Trump is getting normies to talk about conspiracies, globalists and the shadow government? He&#39;s dismantled the 2-party system and is destroying msm. His supporters now know the gop/dnc is the same and believe a ton of conspiracies. They&#39;ve also done some of the best citizen journalism and digging through wikileaks, etc. His supporters seem like a net benefit. Some of the best info as far as conspiracies is now coming from t_d and there&#39;s a lot more people really doing some good investigating because their sub is extremely active.</p>
