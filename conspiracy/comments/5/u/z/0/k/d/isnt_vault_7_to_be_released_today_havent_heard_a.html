<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, i will forever appreciate the DNC leaks, as they confirmed stuff we have suspected for ages. I just don&#39;t like the way his proof of life was handled, and how selective they are with what is leaked. Add the fact that Julian also grew up in an Australian equivalent of the Finders cult, which could well have been an arm of MK/Monarch..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone could point out where Wikileaks, a representative thereof, or Assange said that Vault 7 would be released on Feb 19th, I would appreciate it. </p>

<p>I think that release date is a rumor derived from the conflation of &quot;Vault 7 - coming soon!&quot; type tweets from Wikileaks with the date of Ecuador&#39;s elections (today, Feb 19). Maybe people thought that Assange would be kicked out of the Embassy immediately pending the results of the election and the rumor of the Vault release date derived from the &quot;well, he would release the info before he got kicked out, right?&quot; kind of thought process?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the end of October, when Assange released his plan of leaks that were to happen, (Which never did by the way, there was supposed to be leaks released until the end of the year, but stopped the day after the election), the same thing happened. Some source would say the leaks were to be released on such and such day, and they wouldn&#39;t be, but that source was never wikileaks. I believe this is a disinformation tactic to have folks loose interest before the leak is actually released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some have theorized that feb 19th is the day that vault7 would be released to the public because it co-insides with the Ecuadorian election being held today. Apparently the idea is, Assange along with @anonscan have been working together and those series of tweets were threats to the deep state / shadow gov&#39;t to stay out of the election process and let free, open and honest elections down south. The implications of which, if they (DS or SG) got involved and rigged the election, it would certainly be in favor for the candidate that has publicly said that his first act of business would be to serve JA with a 30-day eviction notice. So basically those clues weren&#39;t for us; those were messages to the opposition to let them know they are in possession of the goods to out them to the gen pop for what they really are... Evil. </p>

<p>But I agree - For a number of reasons, including his internet being cut around our election, WL changing the way they tweet and then them bungling the PoL situation... My instincts tells me he&#39;s gone. Either out of the Embassy, in a eastern european CI@ blacksite or dead. </p>
