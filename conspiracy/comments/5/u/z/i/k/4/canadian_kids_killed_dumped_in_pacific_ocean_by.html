<p>Native children are being kidnapped, placed in private yachts, abused, killed and their bodies taken outside Canada’s twelve mile territorial limit to be disposed of in the ocean by prominent Catholic clergy, businessmen, judiciary, military and politicians according to a former employee of a Vancouver Catholic Cathedral. “The Vancouver police and RCMP appear heavily implicated in child trafficking and protecting these sick and wealthy men” Pastor Kevin Annett told the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State, in investigation for the ICLCJ Court.</p>

<p>Two children were raped and killed as part of the Cardinal inauguration of Quebec Archbishop Gerald Lacroix according to a report filed in 2014 at the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. Eyewitnesses claimed Cardinal Lacroix, Catholic Jesuit Superior General Adolfo Pachon and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s senior cabinet minister Denis Lebel participated in the rape and human sacrifice of a five or six year-old boy and a small girl in the basement chambers of Jesuit Headquarters next to the Church San Lorenzo Piscibus in Rome. The Italian mafia Ndrangheta supplied children for an office at the Vatican according to documents filed at the ICLCJ Court.</p>

<p>In 2011, Rev. David Kalamen, Pastor of Kelowna Christian Fellowship in B.C. was stunned to hear that BC judges Mary Southin and Duncan Shaw supported pedophile rights. </p>

<p>In February 2011, there was a parliamentary session to focus on the wording of Bill C-54, a legislative bill designed to increase or impose mandatory minimum penalties or punishment on sexual offenders of children. Psychology experts were brought in claiming that pedophilia was a sexual orientation comparable to homosexuality. Where do they find these experts? </p>

<p>In July 2011, a Muslim scholar, Sheik Saleh Ibn Fawzan Al-Fawzan issued a fatwa defending Muslim child marriage. He gave an interpretation of Sharia law reinforcing that there was no minimum age for marriage and that girls can be married even if they are in the cradle. The only question was whether the child was literally physically capable of bearing the weight of her new husband. </p>

<p>In August 2011, Vogue Magazine (Vogues enfants) promoted lingerie for 4-year-olds and began marketing clothing for children that sexualizes them. Simultaneously, a conference was being held in the United States to normalize pedophilia: “It’s not my fault that I feel this way.” In a twist of focus, one of their purposes was to deal with “society’s negative reactions to a love of children.” </p>

<p>► Canada is the # 2 nation in the world for hosting child sex sites.</p>

<p>► 80% of those convicted had images of children under the age of 8.</p>

<p>► 19% had images of babies and toddlers under the age of 3.</p>

<p>The Mass Media Pedo Acceptance Drive, LBGQTP?</p>

<p>The Toronto Star - Is pedophilia a sexual orientation? Dec 22, 2013.</p>

<p>Dr. James Cantor of CAMH has shown pedophilia is like a sexual orientation — a deep attraction that cannot change. Now, pedophiles who have never molested children are seeking social acceptance.</p>

<p>CBC - Virtuous Pedophiles - 8,000 Catholic Pedo Priests Worldwide Are Looking For Alter Boys</p>

<p>Pope Francis told an Italian newspaper recently that roughly two per cent of the Catholic clergy could be considered sexual abusers, a figure that represents approximately 8,000 of the church&#39;s 400,000-plus priests. </p>

<p>In 2013, Montrealer David Goldberg, a former local newspaper editor and minor baseball coach, wrote a candid column for The Atlantic magazine about his own arrest in 2012 as part of an international child-porn bust.</p>

<p>Hockey is Canada&#39;s Religion - Maple Leaf Gardens is Canada&#39;s Mecca - And a pedophile palace for Gordon Stuckless, a hockey coach who was charged with 100 counts of pederasty on 18 boys. He got 6 years, which means he&#39;ll likely be out in less than 5 years. I guess Canadian judges love hockey and little boys.</p>

<p>Children’s Aid Society Abductions And Accusations</p>

<p>Right from the onset of the Society abducting a child and also without police consent, frequently from the school, the rights of the parents to reasonably defend are removed. The Society will bring the matter to court within five days although they may have been setting up a case for a long period of time without the families knowledge. </p>

<p>CANADIAN ROYAL PEDERASTY</p>

<p>The Queen of England Stole 10 Native Canadian Kids In 1964. They were never heard from again, before she took them, she made them kiss her shoes. The one surviving witness died before making it to court. Lord Mountbatten was a pedo who liked to mount and bat little boys.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://aangirfan.blogspot.ca/2011/03/queen-and-missing-kids.html">http://aangirfan.blogspot.ca/2011/03/queen-and-missing-kids.html</a></p>

<p>Frank Giustra is a famous Canadian billionaire buddy to the Clintons who hales from British Columbia ( Where else? ). He owns Lions Gate Films and a music company because that&#39;s where little dreams are made from. After the Queen, he&#39;s Canada&#39;s biggest pedo. While&#39;s there&#39;s no &quot;smoking dick&quot;, there&#39;s a preponderance of circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>IF YOU LIKE ABUSING LIL&#39; BROWN BUMS, THEN WELCOME TO CANADA.</p>

<p>The Highway of Tears murders is a series of murders and disappearances of mainly aboriginal women along the 720 km (450 mi) section of Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada from 1969 until 2011. Between 20 - 40 victims were murdered hitchhiking that stretch of road.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_of_Tears_murders">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_of_Tears_murders</a></p>

<p>CONCLUSION: You may think this is just a hit piece, and you&#39;d be right. It&#39;s a hit piece just like the BBC, Washington Post and New York Times do against pizzagate all the fucking time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more like: Epstein says he&#39;s setting up a great party on his plane. Clinton expresses interest. When he gets there, there are young ladies made available. They probably look older than 18 or 19, some of them might actually be. Once your interests are determined, they start to gain control of you. Once you prove your loyalty your interests are catered to.</p>
