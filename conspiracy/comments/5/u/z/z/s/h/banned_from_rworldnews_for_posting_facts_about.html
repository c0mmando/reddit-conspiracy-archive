        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In a post about how Donald Trump was lying about Sweden&#39;s issues with refugees, I said...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.thelocal.se/20170116/i-dont-let-my-little-brother-go-out-at-night-any-more">What</a> could he be talking about? <a href="http://www.whatfinger.com/single-post/2017/02/18/Blondes-Are-Not-Having-More-Fun-As-Muslims-Rape-and-Rampage-Across-Sweden">What</a> could it be... Trump must be making all <a href="http://www.savemysweden.com/tag/sweden/">this</a> stuff up. Putin must have dressed up a bunch of Spetsnaz as refugees and sent them to Sweden.
The fact is Trump was referring to a Fox News segment dealing with a <a href="https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/8579/sweden-sexual-assaults">very real issue</a>. And as usual, rather than discuss the issue he was talking about, the media is going to focus on what he said. Only this will backfire because it takes no time to look up <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/mumford-sons-gutted-after-sexual-attacks-at-sweden-fest-20160705">this</a> <a href="https://knoema.com/UNODCAKRS2013/unodc-assaults-kidnapping-robbery-sexual-offences-sexual-rape-total-sexual-violence-2013?location=1001220-sweden">information</a>. It&#39;s almost like Trump knew exactly what to say to get people to look this up themselves and see what all the fuss is about. It&#39;s almost like he knew that the media would take the bait. And gasp. They did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure they realize that they are in fact the ones who are racist. Nowhere did I say they were committing these crimes <em>because</em> they are Muslims or refugees. Yet why was I banned? Because this is offensive to Muslims or refugees to post mainstream news stories about this crisis. Apparently the Washington Post, when it talks about Donald Trump, is infallible, but when it talks about refugees, it&#39;s anti-Muslim propaganda.</p>

<p>You should know by reading my comments I was not saying they&#39;re <em>all</em> criminals, rather that based on the actual facts that there <em>are</em> criminals among them, as there are criminals among <em>all</em> populations of people, and that there is a very real issue here as cultures clash. It seems that these people, these mods, seem that by censoring people and coddling them they are protecting people. In fact, it is the height of liberal hypocrisy that they should think it is their role to protect Muslims and protect people from &quot;bad speech&quot; by censoring facts. Less speech is not the answer, more speech is the answer. By continuing to perpetuate this ignorant silence, they are the ones facilitating the clash of cultures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been banned from <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, too. Which is funny to me because I often find myself, even though I do not support Trump, defending him to idiots who have no context or understanding of anything going on in the world outside of what CNN is telling them. I think Trump and all he represents, which is nothing unique, and is in fact occurring all around the world, is a necessary phenomenon for history to progress. I remain indifferent to Trump as a scientist remains indifferent to a virus they are studying. However, I find it hard to not feel some negative emotions toward those who lift Obama, the war monger and liar, up as a god emperor and want to pretend America has suddenly begun its descent into fascism when it began long before Trump <em>and</em> Obama. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t that the worst part though? The media and people who follow the media&#39;s narrative are getting people to defend someone that they don&#39;t even support because of of their constant lies. Instead of actually talking about issues realistically they make it about race, gender, and religion. Don&#39;t allow for facts and if you disagree you&#39;re removed for being a racist.</p>

<p>These divide tactics only work for so long until they end up backfiring as more and more people who would have been on their side are pushed away for being something that they are not. When you aren&#39;t allowed to bring up facts or statistics and are supposed to make decisions based on emotions this is the result.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with accepting refugees. It&#39;s the ignoring reality and the save them all approach that is the problem. We know for a fact <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/how-isis-smuggles-terrorists-among-syrian-refugees-453039">ISIS</a> is using these people. We know they are using <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/08/28/491699567/isis-child-soldiers">children</a>. We cannot ignore reality.</p>

<p>Actually, none of that is true. Most Americans in the United States today trace their lineage back to the 19th and 20th century, very few are descended from the slave owners or original settlers to the United States.</p>

<p>Everything you just said sounds good because it&#39;s edgy, but it&#39;s bullshit. From the slave bit, to the Jew angle. There is no <em>Jewish</em> conspiracy. The elite that try to manage the world are descended from Asiatic and European people and they use the Jewish angle to deflect from criticism. They&#39;re not <em>really</em> Jewish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I  know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door, which no one can shut. For you have only a little strength, yet you have kept My word and have not denied My name. 9Look at those who belong to the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews but are liars instead. I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and they will know that I love you.</p>
