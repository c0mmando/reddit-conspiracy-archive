       Nope. That is the current most spooky conspiracy out there. I read around the edges of it, and prepared an environment that would let me work on it. But in the end I became worried enough about how it could potentially hurt my wife and family that I couldn't dive in.

       It was a very strange couple of months. There were many reports of Internet outages, and heavy instant censorship on the chans and Reddit. I watched it happen. Extremely spooky. Something definitely happened on October 17, and a lot of people went dark as soon as they got close with a bunch of reports of houses getting ransacked and people being watched.
      </p>
      <p>
       The transactions were put into the Blockchain on October 17, and John Kerry was in London, so I think, based on what happened, the embassy was raided, a deal or some threats were made or
       <strong>
        they got a better understanding of the state of their intelligence and what Assange has up his sleeve.
       </strong>
       So, Assange maybe agrees on some deal where he goes quiet or something but tells them that wikileaks is universal and the information is everywhere, so it can't be stopped? I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But over the few months, there were MANY documented Internet outages and reported fuckery that has since gotten a bit more mild, and more concentrated on pure shilling. I think there's something big coming our way, and we're going to get stages of disclosure over time.

       Well, how don't you understand? I'ts foolish to try to find something in blockchain. Also this post is LARP. Also assange is alive :p
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll tell you why it's waste of time:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)you can't upload insurance file on blockchain. Blockchain just don't support it. (Cablegate backup was small leak) but if you think that someware there are WL insurance file then you are wrong. WL insurance files are very big
      </p>
      <p>
       2)if there is some leak insurance file (very small) or some wl backup someware in blockchain, its obviosly encrypted. Wikeaks don't wan't to anymody know about whats inside leaks before leaking. Btw.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)if there is someware password in blockchain, you will never find it. Its just not possible. Sorry, its just not. Not possible to check and find all texts hidden into blockchain and test them on isurance files
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks would also never do that, because there is no reason. Their team has passwords. Some journalists have passwords. Why to put them in blockchain someware. Noone would ever find them. Also there is no reason why someone should find them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also only blockchain investigations (if you can call them so, they are not investigations) were on wikileaks public bitcoin adress. And there are nothing. No passwords, no files. Calm down.

       I don't believe what you are saying disproves the plausibility of said LARP.  I'll address each major point you made and why they don't eliminate the possibility of this theory.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It IS possible to upload files along with your transactions on the blockchain. There may be a file size limit, and WL insurance files are large, I will give you that. However, other threads I recall seeing were saying that the insurance files were partitioned out into smaller bits.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2) its obviosly encrypted.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's the point. They were searching not only for the files but also the encryption keys to access them, which they claim are hidden in the blockchain as well.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        3)if there is someware password in blockchain, you will never find it. Its just not possible. Sorry, its just not. Not possible to check and find all texts hidden into blockchain and test them on isurance files
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Any justification backing that up? Impossible due to what? The only argument I can see there is that it's 'impossible' due to the sheer magnitude of texts one would have to search through. In that case, it is not actually impossible, it is just difficult and would require immense work to get through.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wikileaks would also never do that, because there is no reason.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       On the surface it may appear there would be no reason, but if you are willing to consider that WL may be compromised in some way the reason is there. Fuckiness surrounding the embassy in October? Largest DDOS in history directed at WL during the election? Assange still hasn't signed his PGP key signature? These are all things that could potentially give reason as to why WL would choose such a strange 'hidden in plain sight' method of distributing their files.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not claiming that this is confirmed in any way, rather just that it is plausible.

       In my opinion, this was a black pr campaign that was meant to:
1. Discredit Wikileaks (while Julian's internet was cut) and 
2. Take the heat off of Clinton, by making people think Assange had been captured and Russia was leaking information.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was all meant to get anyone interested in finding the truth about Assange into a limited hangout, where no progress was made and anyone with a differing opinion was squashed out.

       It's going to get out eventually.  The government cannot stop a deluge, right now they are just buying time,  plugging a drip here and there.  The truth alone is victorious.
