       I'm so confused by what Trump's presidency actually means for America. I can't tell if he's trying to turn things around one step at a time, or if this has been the plan since his election. Split the public like always, appoint a bunch of bankers into cabinet positions, and have scandals become the distractions that get "behind closed doors" bills passed.

       Deportations are proceeding at an awfully slow pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you show me at what rate deportations have gone previously and at what rate they are going now? Also, is this statement a hunch of yours, something you heard on tv or do you have actual numbers showing a slowdown? If you can prove it is a slowdown, can you also provide any info that this slowdown has been caused solely by Trump's actions or policies and not just the random flow of things?

       You had to know that I was going to ask what your old account was,  originally you stated you lost your password.  If you didn't know your old account why would you say you lost your password.  Your question says you noticed this sub being pro trump yet your account is ten days old.  So you are implying that you have been on here a while and recently noticed it became pro trump, so ten days is not a while, and how long has it been?  I haven't played poker stars in 5 years but I remember all three of my names I used.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are also saying  that you just happened on Reddit ten days ago and accumulated 10k in karma after a long recess and apparently a bout with amnesia.  That is impressive

       You did use the liberal quite well in this exchange, after being caught you brought up irrelevant information "can't use multi quote" knowing I would not do what you ask, you then deflected the entire conversation by calling me a loser and resulting to insult hoping I would get angry and return the insult to completely get off the topic of your shill account being compromised.  It has been a pleasure.

       Again giving up causes you to lose.  You cannot lose then give up because the game is over anyway so why continue to play a game that is over?  They should hire smarter shills if they want to achieve the expected result, up the shill budget.

       He speaks too casually, most politicians every single thing they say or do is perfectly planned out beforehand, their sentences are perfectly constructed so as to not offend anyone, everything they say is clear and concise so that the dishonest media can't easily use what they've said against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is opening himself up to the onslaught from the media by being vague or speaking in rhetoric, Trump is a wet dream to dishonest journalists, every single press conference he holds there are numerous things you can twist and distort to use against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's either naivety or a complete disregard to what the media thinks of him, both are dangerous. A massive chunk of the population are forming their opinions on him based off headlines from the media.

       Who the fuck cares whose political party people associate themselves with? I ain't gotta be a certain party to know a good conspiracy when I see one. That's one good thing about this sub, it unites us all regardless of creed.

       The annoying thing is that this thread simply isn't a conspiracy at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hopefully going to be removed as it's not appropriate for this sub. But then people will complain about the mods being pro Trump, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if people stopped posting threads about him that aren't conspiracy related, the mods would stop having to delete stuff!

       Personally, I don't think its reasonable to arbitrarily just automatically assume that he is a puppet of the system.  Most of the people I see making that assertion only back it up by saying 'well, he's friends with the Clintons; or he made a statement about Jeff Epstein; or Mercer (or whatever the fuck his name is), or some of his cabinet members are questionable, ect.  There hasn't really been a concrete or conclusive argument or pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are going to say that he is just a puppet, then that implies that the whole media / political and celebrity war against the Trump administration is essentially a big play/make pretend.  I know there are a lot of people here who believe that, and I think you give the 'system' way too much credit.  These people, regardless of much money they have, are still a bunch of incompetent idiots at times who make mistakes like any other human-being - they aren't gods (like they want you to think they are).  It takes years of effort and huge amounts of money, and major risk just to compromise all these people in the first place; let alone have it all just be make pretend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't doubt that a bi-product that they enjoy for all the collusion and warring is the public turning on each other and keeping themselves busy fighting - but it seems pretty obvious to me that that is only a side effect, and the real big picture is that there is a new big guy on the block, and whatever webs they spun is in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       The friendships and alliances that may have existed with trump in the past don't really matter - trump's admin seems to have their own new agenda compared to the globalist one that we are used to; and this presidency is business, not personal; so people will undoubtably be betrayed.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that being said, I will offer some things I wish Trump would do better - I wish he would do a better job uniting the 'left' and 'right' public - some people will always refuse to like him, and thats fine - but I wish he would change some of his rhetoric, and maybe be more vocal and receptive to some of the environmental concerns many people are having with him.  I think he has already made it clear that he isn't anti-lgbt and he isn't anti-muslim, even though people refuse to let it go.  So, idk

       I think the Israel bit is theatre. He can't just show them his hand, Israel already hates the fact that he's America first and wants to end ISIS (founded by Israel and Saudi Arabia). That being said, his view on net neutrality sucks.

       plenty wrong with him. Israel, lack of public action on saudi arabia although i am starting to think Iran is the true saudi arabia. The reason I ''shill'' for him is because out of all the options at the time, he was the best of the bad guys.
He is pretty real, which is refreshing, but the whole israel, saudi relationships are weird. Perhaps its part of a bigger picture that i don't see but those who countries in the middle east are pretty much root causes of mega problems.
