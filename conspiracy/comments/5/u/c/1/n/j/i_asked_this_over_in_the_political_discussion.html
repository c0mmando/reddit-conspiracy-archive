    <div class="md"><p>I agree. We can be peaceful trade partners, but not allied with them, or anyone for that matter.

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. It&#39;s been a long process of propagandizing the citizenry and dumbing them down. TPTB have thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years of experience with this (which is why the Founders had such views, they knew coming from the olde world - well some, some of them were wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing, imo). They are a cancer, which infects than slowly kills it&#39;s host, then jumps to the next via the last bloody cough of the host onto the closest host it can find.  </p>

I don&#39;t think favoritism to any countries, especially ones that actively oppose most of the ideals that America once symbolized, is asustainable strategy in the long term.

    <div class="md"><p>True, I have my own opinions and theories on Switzerland. It was more of a topical analogy, which is widely accepted that they are for the most part neutral and &quot;mind their business&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Totally. It&#39;s definitely the de facto cross cultural metaphor for Switzerland. But like every other facet of this world we live in, it&#39;s a castle built on a swamp of lies. There is nothing neutral about the world banking cartel.

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously this would the approach average Americans would favor, but we our entire economy is pretty much being held up by the fact that we are so entangled with the international community. Petro dollar, the need for constant conflict to justify defense spending and foreign operations, ensuring currencies are pegged to the dollar, installing governments that favor our economic policies and banking systems/access to cheap natural resources and labor, the list goes on. We are in too deep at this point I&#39;m afraid. System&#39;s bound to fail at some point but it&#39;s not going to be good for you and me IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The following is one of my favorite quotes in history. </p>

<p>“Posterity! You will never know how much it cost the present Generation to preserve your Freedom! I hope you will make good use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in Heaven, that I ever took half the Pains to preserve it.”</p>

<p>– John Adams</p>

<p>Adams was also keenly aware how history is shaped to fit a narrative. The dude hated the painting of the signing of the Declaration Of Independence because it didn&#39;t accurately represent history... </p>

<p>My question for you; do you believe these forefathers were true patriots who were very aware of the Cabal bloodlines, and they saw the revolution as their chance to break free? Or do you believe they were &quot;led&quot; to their beliefs of patriotism by unknown forces without their knowledge? </p>
