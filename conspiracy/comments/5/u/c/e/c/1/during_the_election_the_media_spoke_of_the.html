       Remember after 9/11 when they alphabet agencies were revealed to have not shared intelligence and the fuss they made when the DHS was created to help solve this problem?  Well it didn't. And the agencies still don't trust one another. For good reason. The CIA is essentially and shadow government run by the Ivy League elite and the FBI is the blue collar version of that. DHS is filled with government flunkies and NSA is all corporate sabotage types. None of these people trust each other.

       Well, the news media's position pretty much throughout the investigation (for months and months) was that the FBI had Trump leanings. This was throughout the time when Trump supporters on here were calling Comey a traitor or not.

       The FBI was complicit in covering up for Clinton. Two separate times. Now, I think this came from AG Lynch flexing on Comey more than the whole group wanting that, but they're still complicit regardless. Also, the CIA was always pushing for Clinton, that's part of where the lies of Russians hacking elections came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that Trump is in office, the CIA may be attempting a coup. The Democratic establishment that the CIA supported before the election certainly is pushing to impeach Trump despite him not doing anything to merit it (yet). Dems can't impeach a war criminal like Bush, but they're chomping at the bit to pull it on Trump. Why don't more Democrats find this suspicious?

       IC ground level troops have been leaking important info. They are

      <p>
       IC generals are compromised by TPTB and are actively trying to disrupt the "Outsiders". These are
       <em>
        The Bad Guys
       </em>
       . They are able to do a lot from their positions of power (eg: Michael Flynn) - but it takes time and is not 100% effective (as ground troops do most of the actual work). They are still hindered by the bureaucracy. They require absolute secrecy, yet are forced to react quickly to new developments, sometimes causing "glitches" in the Matrix. This is their greatest weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war between these forces is what is causing the disruption in your newscasts. The answer is "Both".
