        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You can&#39;t trust the media. Even if you don&#39;t support Trump, this is a fact that cannot be escaped. It is the same media that lied us into killing millions of people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria while bankrupting the country. It is the same media that are beholden to their corporate masters. And it is the same media that are now frantically against Trump.</p>

<p>When nothing is ever confirmed or verified, and it&#39;s all coming from &quot;sources&quot;, it&#39;s dishonest to even describe it as a story, let alone some kind of smoking gun. With the email leaks on Hillary, there was real evidence to evaluate. The worst they claim Flynn did was that, while setting up a meeting (literally his job), he said something to the effect of &quot;all topics can be discussed&quot;. The contrast between these two examples cannot be more stark.</p>

<p>I wonder if the people who are stuck in the left/right paradigm, or enthralled by the Trump haters have asked themselves, why are all the Republican leadership so openly against Trump? Why are Democrats Dennis Kucinich and Tulsi Gabbard warning us that the deep state is trying to take over against all Americans, and that we need to stop funding Al Qaeda and ISIS? How does it feel to be fighting for the side of people like Dick Cheney, John McCain, Bill Kristol, Charles and David Koch, Paul Ryan, and Lindsey Graham? Could it maybe, possibly, be that, this isn&#39;t about left or right?</p>

<p>Even the most skeptical American should recognize that there&#39;s almost nothing lost by giving Trump a chance for a few months versus supporting neocon warmongers in a coup attempt that apparently has to happen instantly. When every poll shows that people are progressively and increasingly losing trust in the media, why is it that they&#39;ve quintupled down on the same hysterical and apocalyptic rhetoric? Why are they crying wolf, and in the process destroying their most precious assets, their credibility and viewership? Whatever the reason, it must be pretty darned important if they&#39;re willing to destroy their own businesses!</p>

<p>What&#39;s more likely, that all the &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; regarding the misdeeds of the existing fossilized leadership of both parties are true? Or that Trump is a misogynistic, bigoted, homophobic, sexist, racist, transphobic, fascist, Nazi, KKK member who is bent on global genocide, while also being controlled by Putin, Sessions, Bannon, Kushner, and a racist frog?</p>

<p>Hey, Trump says let&#39;s &quot;drain the swamp&quot; and he appointed all these powerful people into his cabinet. I know these billionaires types are usually bad, but sometimes they aren&#39;t, and since it changes virtually nothing to wait and see what Trump does, maybe this will be a case where they actually drain that swamp of corrupt politicians everyone has always claimed to be against? It won&#39;t take very long for us to know definitively whether his actions are good or bad for your average person. Why not wait 6 months? Talk is cheap, judge by actions. We learned that one the hard way with Obama, we won&#39;t forget it just because 6 months goes by.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be a &quot;Trump supporter&quot; to see that you can&#39;t trust the media.</p>

<p>Now is the time to point out these facts to your friends who remain under a spell. Show them how the media lies. Help them get out of the left/right paradigm, but do it with a friendly smile using key questions so that they figure it out for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, right you are. It&#39;s an interesting balance discussing partisanship on this sub. Overall, most of us, as you probably know, are of the opinion that when it counts both parties work together. Like, when it serves to maintain government power for example.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, pizzagate unequivocally started at the_donald. I think mostly people just end up getting all fucking butthurt because partisanship is deeply ingrained in all of us. </p>

<p>I see a lot more <em>actual evidence</em> for pizzagate than all of the russia rumors and buzzwords going around, but I will acknowledge that it&#39;s possible there was collusion. I certainly can&#39;t prove there wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also mountains of evidence and millions of dollars that tells us leftist organizations not only care about, but are influencing, online communities just like this one.</p>

<p>So, of course you will see things how you will, but to me there is a reason why there&#39;s an imbalance.</p>

<p>I thought we told you fucks how it was going to be on November 8th? <strong>We&#39;re making America great again!</strong> Either cooperate with us and get on the train (<em>get a better deal on your issues</em>) or oppose us and be left behind. President Trump is going to be sitting in that chair for at least the next four years. Eight if he turns out to be the President I expect him to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is protecting our borders a &quot;warped perception of reality&quot;?</p>

<ul>
<li> Its not out of fear either, its about being able to deport illegal immigrants who commit violent felonies and not allowing them back. </li>
<li>Most 1st world countries have border control, unless they are bordered by water. A country without borders isnt a country. When we are seeing a mass migration of people into our country without papers or anyway to check the backgrounds, yes its a problem. We dont have border police for nothing, and we have had them for a LONG time, they only got neutered in the last 8 years. </li>

<ul>
<li>Which countries are banned and for how long? 90 days? and the countries listed were put on that list by Obama. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3yesvvYEvs">You know who else wanted strong borders outside of Trump? Bill Clinton.</a>  His words himself. Hmm why is this all of a sudden a big deal</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Citation please where he is pushing for anything unethical.  Yet we DO see unethical things causing problems from the commander in chief everyday, mostly from the Dems but also the Media and some in the GOP as well. His business dealings and the media spin puts alot of his past into question when you can&#39;t trust what much of the press says anymore. </li>
</ul>

<p>So far you only sound like a chicken little, he doesnt even have his whole cabinet in and is dealing with a possible coup by entrenched intelligence officers. Note he is the elected president. </p>

<p>You aren&#39;t going to convert a Trump supporter FYI, but note we do have a shitton of Liberals, LGBTs, and different ethnic backgrounds now in our midst and we all get along and all are waking up. </p>

<p>1) We have no idea what he plans for expanding the NSA nor the Patriot Act. I have yet to hear anything out of his mouth, in fact he doesn&#39;t even have his whole staff confirmed. So take some time before you freak out about that.. </p>

<p>Question back: Did you lose your mind when Obama was confronted with the problems with the NSA with the Snowden leaks? Or are you just worried now because of OMG Trump.</p>

<p>2) He is AUDITING the fed. You expect him to just get rid of it? What would happen to the US Dollar? </p>

<p>3) Infringing on the 2nd amendment? The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of the people to keep and bear arms.. He plans to keep this well intact . </p>

<p>4) and undying support of Israel (all things Hillary were for). .. Yep he just got back from a press conference with Bibi yesterday and even had the balls to ask him to negotiate on further expansion into Palestinian territory in front of the press. </p>

<p>Where are your problems with this? </p>

<p>lol my folly was responding back to you. There was literally nothing in your post that shows me you have &quot;critically analyzed&quot; your own position at all? </p>

<p>The Media is considered to be the 4th branch of government, during the election in the leaks we saw how deep the mainstream media is entrenched in the DNC. Frankly I never realized that the media controlled the left so strongly. People like you I guess (judging by your post only) are running around acting as Trump is a despot in his 29? days in office already.. while we saw a looming possible war with Russia with the possible election of Clinton. Instead of breathing a sigh of relief, we see more and more anger and violence coming from the left as well.. </p>

<p>Just think about where the left is now. </p>

<p>They patted themselves on the back when Clinton asked Trump to cede the election peacefully for the good of the country when she wins. HAHA </p>

<p>So where are we now? </p>

<p>&quot;Liberals&quot; are now violent and yelling about possible peace between Russia and the US. </p>

<p>&quot;Liberals&quot; want to shut down free speech and attack those who want to listen. </p>

<p>&quot;Liberals&quot; who think that they should punch &quot;Nazi&#39;s&quot; in the face because its their duty? </p>

<p>Look in the mirror and figure out what fascism means, what real racism is, and where you people went wrong. </p>

<p>Im a former liberal, and all I hear from whats left of them is bullshit and trash now. Its always the most hypocritical logic, like calling ALL whites racist just for the color of their skin. Or how about how the police are ALL racists (which is WTF right there)  while they run towards danger while the rest of us can run away. </p>

<p>Stop it you arent higher minded, you just have no idea what the fuck is really going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Acting like Trump isn&#39;t widely spreading misinformation on purpose to liken his cause is idiotic. MSM is wrong sometimes, sure, and has lied in situations, and they need to be held accountable, but acting like he&#39;s the gatekeeper of truth and anybody reporting on his wrongdoings&#39; is an enemy and must be lying is counter productive of protecting the country.</p>

<p>But what if that vetting process isn&#39;t based upon telling the full truth, but a portion of the truth that best serves a select few people&#39;s interests? That&#39;s what it has seemed like for at least the past 3 years probably longer, when you only see one side of the story and having an emotionally driven title is more important than the actual information you know something is wrong.</p>

<p>Each site doesn&#39;t act in a bubble and they get there information from specific people and places. They not only control public opinion of all public figures as seen by false allegations of anti-semetism in pewdeepie, but control public opinion of each other (Republicans are labeled as racists and nazis, Liberals are labled as SJW) we live in a 1984, brave new world site where the full truth is hidden in favor of selective facts without context and anyone who disagree&#39;s will be called &quot;denying facts.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of what you are saying is definitely true, but there is one thing that bothers me.</p>

<p>The mainstream liberal media was very Anti-Bush at the same time that they were pushing the bogus establishment propaganda that justified the second Iraq war.</p>

<p>The msm narrative was &#39;W is an idiot&#39;, but when it came to war the administration and the MSM were in lockstep. They found something they could agree on in the name of &#39;patriotism&#39; (read &#39;profit&#39;).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what that means for our situation today, but I do think that the people who seek to control the opinions in this country are very good at what they do. The message that they put out is less important to them than the reaction the masses will have to that message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Big difference. They where hostile to Bush in appearance only. The attack that they use at the time where lame and not pertinent. Nothing that would have any great traction toward an impeachment. Basically it was just noise.</p>

<p>With Trump it&#39;s an all out war! what they are implying is outright seditious. Appeal for assassination, Legal overthrow, Violent overthrow etc.....</p>

<p>Not the same thing at all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of similarities in the attacks. Remember that Bush won the electoral college but not the popular vote and was made president by a Supreme Court decision. The whole &#39;not my president&#39; bullshit was going on then too. </p>

<p>The people who are calling for violence are merely doing so to polarize the nation and divide the people. </p>

<p>Even the Russia stuff against trump, while seemingly damaging, has no substance. It only serves to intensify the division of the people. Trump supporters don&#39;t trust the media so they just rally around the president. The people on the left only believe it because they want a reason to hate him. </p>

<p>As long as the people are divided we are powerless to stop those in control from acting against our interests. As long as we are distracted fighting each other TPTB will continue to destroy this country, and they will do it with the consent of half the country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, although I disagree with the whole draining the swamp thing.</p>

<p>I lost all hope that Trump drained the swamp, he went from trashing Hillary and Cruz 24/7 for having such deep wall street ties and claims over and over again that he&#39;s going to &#39;take down Wall Street&#39; and then his first day he hires 6 of the highest Goldman Sachs CEO&#39;s to run the economic side of our country. Not only that, but he dismantled the Dodd Frank act which had the sole purpose of regulating Wall Street so that we won&#39;t go through another economic crisis. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust the media all that well, but when I see every intelligence agency from around the world slowly come to the same conclusion that Trump has heavy Russian ties I tend to have more faith in the conspiracy. </p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious Trump is hiding his involvement in Russia, anyone who&#39;s talked to their fair share of human beings can easily see that. What we as a community need to do is get to the bottom of this just as we do with Pizzagate or Hillary or Obama. We can&#39;t just let this entire thing slide because &#39;the media can&#39;t be trusted&#39;</p>

<p>So many people, especially here, treat politics as if it were their favorite football team. There are no winners or losers here, we&#39;re all American for the most part and that means we&#39;re all on the same team. There&#39;s no point in fighting and bickering with each other. </p>

<p>We all need to approach each subject with an open mind, being a closed minded Trump supporter/Trump hater won&#39;t get you any further in life.</p>

<p>What people really need to do is just flat out drop ties to our favorite politician/government, our government has never cared about the average Joe&#39;s like you and me, why the fuck would they start caring now? </p>

<p>Yes, with his being bailed out by the Rotshchilds, expanding the NSA, renewing the Patriot Act, not abolishing the Fed, infringing on the Second Amendment without Trial, and undying support of Israel (all things Hillary were for) - yeah he&#39;s SO anti establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree with you on the media.  Trump will give people plenty of real things to worry about like his cabinet picks and his comments regarding civil forfeiture.  The amount of focus on Russia is disturbing. I have serious concerns regarding Trump. I think he is leading us to war with Iran and he is a hard line authoritarian with little regard for the constitution which is dangerous given the tools at his disposal.</p>

<p>But this rift with Russia they are endlessly pushing falls right in line with Iraq, WMD, etc..  They want to ramp up the cold war again and weaken Russia, which is not good for the majority of the people in the world. Things would be much better if we existed peacefully.</p>

I&#39;ve worked in news for 6 years and I&#39;d advise you and everyone who spews this nonsense to stop getting your media from bullshit sources and stop bitching about a subject you have no concept about. You are all armchair journalists and if you were actually worth your salt, you&#39;d apply to a local station and actually do some investigating/reporting or learn the actual process and how thing work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking just this as I lay on my couch (home sick from school) watching GMA. As soon as the program started they put a big banner across the screen that reads &quot;WHITEHOUSE IN TURMOIL&quot;. They then went on to bash Trump for about fifteen minutes. I sat and watched with anger in my heart as I know millions of people across the country are freaking for their trap at this very moment.</p>

<p>I  have stopped watching, I think I&#39;ll just take today to get better and catch up on my reading. Television, particularly TV news, is the cancer of our nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your part on Flynn is so wrong. </p>

<p>It was illegal for him to discuss sanctions with the Russians while he was a private citizen. </p>

<p>Apparently, he then lied to Pence about that happening. </p>

<p>It was found out that it happened and Yates informed the WH that he could be compromised and blackmailed due to that action. </p>

<p>Then Flynn resigned (or was forced to depending on which spokesperson you believe). </p>

<p>So either A: Flynn did talk to Russians about sanctions but lied to Pence. </p>

<p>Or B: He didn&#39;t talk to Russians about sanctions, told Pence the truth, then resigned for having never lied. </p>

<p>And all of this has been confirmed by Trump who has went after people leaking the information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But he has a point. The tiniest shred of evidence can start an avalanche against anyone here, except Trump. As soon as anything is posted about Trump, everything is discredited.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again; Many of the Trump supporters here need to be far more skeptical of anyone in power. People need to realize that it&#39;s a new game - new tactics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. But to me that leads to the main point of it all; people need to stop believing that Trump is a man of the people and that he represents them.</p>

<p>The possible Clinton relationship ought to be a testament to that - amongst many other things.</p>

<p>So many people that ought to be far more critical and skeptical of Trump - and anyone else in power - are eating the whole schtick, just because the tactics changed.</p>
