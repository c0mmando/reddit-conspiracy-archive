These include collecting satellite transmissions, phone calls and emails that cross network switches abroad, and messages between people abroad that cross domestic network switches.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it is most definitely not okay when Israel spies on us. And just like Israel is breaking a treaty by occupying Palestinian owned land, Russia broke a treaty when they invaded Crimea. We should seek peace with Russia. Cautiously.

    <div class="md"><p>Took your advice, googled &quot;Trump Deutchse Bank&quot;.. clicked the first thing that came up which was an article from the ultra-liberal Guardian who I&#39;m sure would love nothing more than to expose every skeleton in trumps closet. </p>

<p>The title - Deutsche Bank examined Donald Trump&#39;s account for Russia links</p>

<p>What did they find? &quot;The internal review found no evidence of any Russia link&quot;.... yawn.</p>

<p>Maybe there is one, though.. who knows? I should have been more specific because &quot;ties&quot; or &quot;links&quot; with Russia is pretty vague and honestly no big deal on its face. I want to see evidence that Russia was responsible for the DNC/Podesta hacks, because they were released by Wikileaks who has vehemently denied that the Russian state has sourced them with any documents.. and if it is proven that Russia was behind the hack, then I need proof of collusion with Trump. Without those two things, there is no story.</p>

<p>Oh and also, exit polling data showed that those hacks really didnt have an effect on the election outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.. There&#39;s definitely smoke there so I&#39;m interested to see what else is revealed. Still a lot of speculation involved... while there is no speculation about the vast expansion of the scope and power of the surveillance state under Bush and Obama. Much bigger implications than even the worst speculative ramifications of this whole Russia-Trump theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am more cynical. I firmly believe the surveillance state will continue to be developed. Since 9/11, and the 24 hour news insanity where news has been translated by various talking heads and you get opinions instead of facts (thank you MSM, I&#39;ll draw my own conclusions if you don&#39;t mind) it&#39;s been a perfect set-up. Now, all journalism is suspect, and all information easily dismissed. The privacy and autonomy we once enjoyed has vanished with barely whimper of protest. Net neutrality, our last bastion of free speech, is on the chopping block of corporate control. Controlling resistance means controlling information and monitoring citizens. The New Order will not be partisan and will require cooperation between US and Russia. Side note: Both countries are not coincidentally controlled by the recently reconciled Catholic Church- The Vatican and the Russian Orthodox Church. A new EO gives churches the right to political participation, and the Catholic Church is the wealthiest organization on earth.     </p>
