        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems like the media keeps going after the Trump administration for being too close with the Russians, and that Putin is a murderous dictator who we cannot ever be civil with. But pre-election they wouldn&#39;t stop saying &quot;if Trump was president we&#39;ll end up going to war with Russia!&quot;</p>

<p>Which leaves me confused. I&#39;ve asked several people in different threads, but have yet to get a real response. So could someone, please, ELI5 how removing sanctions, opening trade, and overall improving our relationship with Russia would be a bad thing for the American people (not just the Military-Industrial Complex)? What makes them so much more dangerous than all of the other shady countries that we call &quot;allies&quot;?</p>

<p>Edit: Please keep responses civil, as I&#39;m not looking for a fight. I&#39;m looking for a discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a complete strawman. No one has argued for worse relations with Russia. Even Obama and Hillary wanted to &#39;reset&#39; and improve relations with Russia (which they utterly failed at).</p>

<p>The concern is that Trump may be compromised by Russia. Whether it&#39;s through blackmail (more and more items in The Dossier are being confirmed), or just good ole fashioned bribery (receiving kickbacks from Russian oil oligarchs for lifting sanctions). This should be a real concern for all Americans.</p>

<p>Or is your argument that <em>even if he is compromised</em>, we could benefit from it? If so, then I don&#39;t even know where to start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have been trying sell this stake for <a href="http://rbth.com/business/2014/12/09/kremlin_to_sell_off_195_stake_in_rosneft_in_bid_to_raise_funds_42095.html">a while</a>.</p>

<p>My guess is the undisclosed party is <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/qatar-seeks-gas-pipeline-to-turkey#page2">Turkey and/or Saudi Arabia</a>.  </p>

<p>Check this out:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/aug/30/syria-chemical-attack-war-intervention-oil-gas-energy-pipelines">&gt; The Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline plan was a &quot;direct slap in the face&quot; to Qatar&#39;s plans. No wonder Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan, in a failed attempt to bribe Russia to switch sides, told President Vladmir Putin that &quot;whatever regime comes after&quot; Assad, it will be &quot;completely&quot; in Saudi Arabia&#39;s hands and will &quot;not sign any agreement allowing any Gulf country to transport its gas across Syria to Europe and compete with Russian gas exports&quot;, according to diplomatic sources. When Putin refused, the Prince vowed military action</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar%E2%80%93Turkey_pipeline">Wikipedia</a> is okay but overly-summarizes a vastly complicated issue.</p>

<p>Maybe the Saudis are giving up on their threats now that the war looks to be going Assad&#39;s way. So now they get a leveraged deal for 19% the company with 25% down but they won&#39;t say this publicly or maybe ISIS turns back on their funders. They also aren&#39;t on the best of terms with Qatar publicly. </p>

<p>If the above is the case, who <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-us-russian-ceasefire-in-syria-has-broken-down-but-who-is-at-fault-a7316756.html">loses out the most?</a></p>

<p>I have no idea how Trump and team fit into all of this as it appears a lot of this was in motion before the election. Doesn&#39;t mean turn a blind eye to the rest of the Russian connections - maybe they are adjunctly related as a Plan B.</p>

<p>One easy way to identify propaganda is when there is a major story like this energy deal (regardless of Trump), that doesn&#39;t even link back to it&#39;s <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rosneft-tnkbp-deal-idUSBRE92K0IZ20130321">own previous reporting on the subject over a year ago</a>.</p>

<p>But we also shouldn&#39;t forget about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencore">Glencore</a> and it&#39;s history of bypassing sanctions.</p>

<p>For one: Glencore contributed only 300 million euros of equity to the deal, less than 3 percent of the purchase price, which it said in a statement on Dec. 10 had bought it an &quot;indirect equity interest&quot; limited to just 0.54 percent of Rosneft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the issue of him using his position as president to get rich! Here in America we call that an ethical violation because it opens the door up to being bought. Crazy scenario, let&#39;s say that trump, for instance, suddenly raised the cost of memberships to his resorts, increased the rent in his buildings and started to appoint people who have bailed him out in the past. People would become suspicious about these actions, justifiably, because it would appear that he is using his position to increase his wealth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but the thing is, there is no actual evidence he is worth the billions the West says he is. This is curious to me. I&#39;ve looked into, and there is no hard evidence. Is he a millionaire? Maybe. A billionaire? Not seeing it. Something aint right about the reporting. Seems like more propaganda of some sorts. Watch a few documentaries on the man. He&#39;s a very curious individual. Almost like he wants people to think x, when it&#39;s really y. Could be inherited from his childhood and days in the KGB. At the end of the day, idk... Who the fuck knows, lol? Crazy ass world/times we live in...</p>

<p>Aye. We will never truly know the full truth about so much, which saddens me. I&#39;m a person who wants to know the whole truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Americans hate change</p>

<p>America needs an enemy to keep the military industrial complex  chugging along and its economy humming. Every Time there is a threat of a recession america goes to war. </p>

<p>Years of &#39;official&#39; russia hate has actually made people through this propaganda hate russia. By changing this, along with more highlights of lies told by america, will further reduce the credibility of the government, the old government the military industrial complex influenced government. Spanner in the works. </p>

<p>Becoming friends with a long time &quot;enemy&quot; means USA is somewhat declaring that it is no longer the ONE TRUE SUPERPOWER OF THE EARTH TO RULE THEM ALL. Which is once again spanner in the works.   </p>
