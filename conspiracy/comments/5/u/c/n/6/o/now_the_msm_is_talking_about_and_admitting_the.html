<p>The constant MSM demonization of Trump is reverse psychology to get the working class to embrace him. The guy is a Trojan Horse. Notice how he&#39;s never criticized for being a zionist. Or for having six Goldman Sachs banksters and at least one Bonesman in his &quot;anti establishment&quot; cabinet. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s Trump being aggressive towards Russia: <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/831846101179314177">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/831846101179314177</a></p>

<p>Where do you live? He is constantly criticized for having GS cronies in his circle. Less on the zionism but it is out there among the (((anti-zionist))) crowd. And no one gives a shit about bonesmen, that is so 2004.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I hear is that GS bullshit too, and I alway mention that Trump received $0 (ZERO) donations from GS , not a dime , ever.</p>

<p>Hillary gladly accepted MILLIONS upon freaking MILLIONS of dollars from GS, was paid even MORE millions in speaking feeds by GS to give private speeches to GS, then she fought like hell to keep then from getting released. That&#39;s how we found out she has two positions on every issue, a public and a private postion. Meaning she takes millions, than promises us one thing, then promises the opposite to GS and other campaign donators .</p>

<p>How nobody was outraged by this , especially the average Democrat, is amazing to me, I have no understanding of their logic on this.</p>

<p>Especially because they then turn around and pretend Trump was the issue in that. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the psyop. The deep state isn&#39;t &quot;anti-Trump&quot;. The MSM and &quot;alternative media&quot; (controlled opposition) is <em>claiming</em> that the deep state is anti-Trump. But the claim is false. It&#39;s part of the psyop marketing campaign for Trump. He&#39;s being marketed as &quot;anti establishment&quot;, so that he&#39;s embraced by the working class and the precariat.</p>

<p>Another part of this campaign is the demonization of him (over trivial matters). That&#39;s reverse psychology. </p>

<p>Yet another part is the fake notion of a &quot;war among the FBI and the CIA&quot;. This paints a picture of &quot;good guys&quot; within the intelligence community. </p>

<p>Newsflash: There are no good guys in the intelligence community. They all support the zionist banksters. They all support the MIC. They all support Israel. (Trump supports all of these, too, and he&#39;s not even trying to hide it. He talks about it openly.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think part of the reason you are being downvoted is because you are speaking as if you know the truth, but in reality you are just speculating like the rest of us. It could turn out to be as you say. That would be quite an impressive plot!  </p>

<p>However, if we are being honest, it is far too early to discard the possibility that Trump has actually stepped into this dangerous game with good intentions. How do we know that you are not part of a disinformation campaign designed to sow discord in online communities and undermine Trump&#39;s presidency? </p>

<p>Also, I think your assertion that there cannot be any &quot;good guys&quot; in the IC is cartoon-ish and unrealistic, and this is another part of the reason you are being downvoted. It can&#39;t be true that everyone who enters the IC has evil intentions. How would anybody really know for sure until they join the club?  </p>

<p>We&#39;ll have to see what happens. If these human trafficking busts continue to escalate and law enforcement legitimately takes down a powerful international criminal organization involved in human trafficking, I will expect you to come back here and eat your words. </p>

<p>We all know the gov&#39;t is compartmentalized. It is patently false to claim all intelligence for the greatest nation are &quot;all evil&quot;. Most of them are family men doing a job that pays well enough. You seem new to the conspiracy arena. Also you seem in a state of panic or mania about the situation.</p>
