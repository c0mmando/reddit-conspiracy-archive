        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The torture video was posted on reddit 7 months ago on r/creepy by u/child_of_old:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/4q5by2/each_day_i_grow_some_more/">https://np.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/4q5by2/each_day_i_grow_some_more/</a></p>

<p>The video was taken down, but you can clearly see that the thumbnail of the video is a still frame of the same video that Pizzagate Internet detectives are saying contains John Podesta.</p>

<p>The user who posted the video stated how he found it here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5u4qaf/john_podesta_is_the_man_from_the_torture_video/ddsvrmz/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5u4qaf/john_podesta_is_the_man_from_the_torture_video/ddsvrmz/?context=3</a></p>

<p>For those that don&#39;t want to click on the link, here is what he said:</p>

<p>&quot;I dig alot through the internet trying to find things that scare me, the time i found that video i had used google translate to search in another language bringing up results that wouldnt show in a normal search.&quot;</p>

<p>Now I know that some detectives investigating the Pizzagate scandal will claim that this doesn&#39;t prove anything, that it&#39;s still John Podesta. Let&#39;s look at the logic behind that statement. The user found this video by doing an advanced search on Google (something that took detectives 3 months to do). This was 7 months ago. Seven months ago, in July 2016, there were DNC leaks coming from Wikileaks. In March 2016, Podesta fell for a phishing scam and had his emails stolen. He knew that emails were being leaked left in right for months upon months in advance before Wikileaks finally leaked the &quot;pizza&quot; email that would supposedly incriminate him. The first emails that Wikileaks released from Podesta&#39;s gmail account were in October 2016. The emails where Podesta uses &quot;pizza&quot; as slang for child porn according to Internet detectives did not come out until November, around election day. Podesta had an amplitude of time to have this video of him torturing a child and incriminating himself off the Internet. The video was on YouTube for christ&#39;s sake... why do I even have to bother bringing in logic? It is now debunked. Carry on 4chan.</p>

<p>Someone else posted a link in the thread where people on r/ARG are identifying it as ARG. The video has shown up on a gaming channel. There is even less proof that the video is real than there is that it is Podesta.</p>

Not because I am a &quot;shill&quot;, but because I want to see real, intuitive, detective work take place on real conspiracies.

<p>This is the Internet. There&#39;s a whole entire section of it dedicated to snuffs, child porn, and brutal rapes. It&#39;s full of 18-40 year old men that will eat you alive. It&#39;s not hard to believe that someone made that website for shits and giggles at all. You must be new here.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen you debunk anything. You just say that its not real because you think Podesta would have gotten it off the net. Ok well no one can prove that unless you can ask Skippy himself.</p>

<p>2) Even if he was aware such a video leaked, would he be concerned about scrubbing it at all considering the male in the video isn&#39;t seen on camera?  </p>

<p>3) The dems were 100%&#39;certain they were going to win, so perhaps any scrubbing he was planning would be after an election victory when he had full intelligence services at his command. </p>

<p>4) After the email hack, how soon would he realize the data was going to be leaked through WL? He may have just thought it was a basic data breach for a couple of months. And even then, would he have considered people would have made the pedo connections? Would he have remembered any of the pedo emails still in his in box, and forgotten to delete?  </p>

<p>I really <strong>really</strong> hope the video is a fake. But I don&#39;t think you have officially debunked it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to reply to this statement instead <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5uc0zb/john_podesta_is_the_man_from_the_torture_video/ddtiy74/">of your other reply</a> .  </p>

<p>Some other failures you have made in logic in this thread is how the video made it onto the internet. </p>

<p>As 2 commenters pointed out, he fell for a phishing scan... on a GOOGLE account. Which means the Phishers also had access to his google-drive, which is a perfectly reasonable place to store a video. </p>

<p>Another option is that Podesta shared the video with others, and someone else leaked the video. CPorn makers frequently video and share the results with other pedo&#39;s as part of the power fantasy they live. Sharing the video and evading capture is a common behavior displayed by people like this. Please read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Hunting-Humans-Modern-Multiple-Murderer/dp/0771050259">Hunting Humans</a> which details this behavior excellently with regards to serial killers. This behavior is found in both deviant types. </p>

<p>A third option for the leak (both email and video) is Podesta&#39;s missing cell phone. If the video was recorded on his phone then anyone gaining access to the phone could very possibly found the video on the phone. It&#39;s not like Podesta was picking secure <a href="mailto:p@sswords">p@sswords</a>. </p>

<p>Finally, you haven&#39;t even considered Podesta posting this video himself to the internet, perhaps on a private dark web site or some such thing. Again, this is behavior displayed by many pedos. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but your logic is full of holes and so many people have pointed out the failings of your argument at this point that your statement that it&#39;s OFFICIALLY DEBUNKED is laughable.   </p>

<p>Judging by your replies to others in this thread I assume you&#39;re probably going to call me <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5uc0zb/john_podesta_is_the_man_from_the_torture_video/ddtd19x/">&quot;a fucking retard&quot;</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5uc0zb/john_podesta_is_the_man_from_the_torture_video/ddsxti0/">&quot;shill&quot;</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5uc0zb/john_podesta_is_the_man_from_the_torture_video/ddt0weq/">or the ever elegant &quot;stupid&quot;</a>.  </p>

<li><p>Who would share this video with others? Also dumb.</p></li>
<li><p>This is just assuming too much.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is all just presumptive insinuation. I presented the time line which is better logic than anything you brought forth. He had a bare minimum of 9 months to make sure any video he had on his Gmail account or phone was removed from the Internet, regardless of that. Explain to me how a random person on the Internet found it on YouTube and then nothing happened for 7 months? The logic behind anyone still defending this garbage is completely flawed. Your argument is that because his password was p@ssword, because he left his phone in a taxi, and because he got phished he is too retarded to know about a video of him torturing a child is on the Internet. The fact of the matter is; absolutely nothing in those emails incriminated him. THIS video will. So obviously, he would be frantic over its removal AND have an amplitude of time to have it removed. Someone found the video MONTHS after he was phished and then it didn&#39;t get any attention until 7 months later. Regardless of whether or not anyone knew that was John Podesta in the torture chamber video they would have reported it to the police because it was on YOUTUBE. That is how you know the video itself besides being John Podesta&#39;s is fake    </p>

<p>Taking all of this into consideration, you would have to see that even if it IS John Podesta in the video, the feds won&#39;t do anything about it, therefore making this whole investigation pointless. That isn&#39;t the case, however, becuase it&#39;s not John Podesta in that video. And yes, you are all of those words and more. I wish we could discuss this face to face.</p>

<p>This whole theory has been debunked on multiple occasions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your logic is literally some of the worst I have ever witnessed on the internet. Quite literally.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ve assembled a string of thoughts into a timeline full of holes and misunderstanding but you&#39;re insisting that it&#39;s the only explanation. Despite many people in this thread politely pointing out holes in the concept and you reforming your argument to account for the glaring problems in your statements you instead hold fast to a terrible idea and name call those who have disagreed with you. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s dumb&quot; may be an accurate description of the actions your are referencing, but that doesn&#39;t change the reality of fact that murderers, rapists, and pedophiles all display the very behavior I&#39;m suggesting. Yes, it was <strong>dumb</strong> John Wayne Gacy filled his basement with dead bodies. Yes, it was <strong>dumb* Jeffrey Dahmer kept body parts in his fridge. Yes it was *<em>dumb</em> Peter Truong kept 64 hours of rape video of his baby son on his home computer which he shared internationally with other pedos. These things happened and they are **dumb</strong>. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to make this fantastic logic argument that <em>Officially Debunks</em> the video then you need to be able to account for the possibilities of the things I suggested with more reason than &quot;it&#39;s dumb&quot;. It&#39;s <em>not</em> assuming too much to suggest he stored video on his personal gmail account, or on the phone he may have recorded it with, or shared it with other pedos, or intentionally posted the video himself. <strong>ALL</strong> of these things have been done by other pedos in the past and will probably happen in the future. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost at the point in this conversation that I might think you are shilling, but your arguments are so astoundingly bad the only people you could be shilling for would be Trump in order to make CTR shills look bad. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case though because you probably really believe everything you are saying. </p>

<p>What could you possibly do if we had this debate face to face?? I&#39;m not sure there is much more you could bring to the table? </p>

They have people protecting everyone involved including Skippy (John Podesta). I didn&#39;t want to believe the video based on the voice but the fact that the child screams john and Skippy is too fucking real for words. It&#39;s haunting. I&#39;m forever traumatized. There are other videos too and are still very much available on that worldcorpo site. It&#39;s fucked. I think the only way to bring it down is to have people like us investigate. The CIA is involved in pedoring shit so they won&#39;t be of help. Laura Silsby who was arrested for stealing 30 kids in Haiti got a job working for Alertsense (the people who send out amber alerts). It&#39;s up to us to save these kids. </p>
