        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Russia, Israel and China are now in posession of the Hillary-Weiner 650,000 emails<sup><sup><a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/266674-former-defense-secretary-says-clinton-server-may-have-been-compromised">[1]</a><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/29/hillary-clintons-emails-in-vladimir-putins-hands/">[2]</a><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/03/16/investigation-hillary-sent-dozens-of-emails-on-her-blackberry-from-russia-and-china-raising-risk-profile/">[3]</a><a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/Skeptics/Political_skeptic/Neocons/Hillary/hillary_clinton_email_scandal.shtml">[4]</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>Even though this happened on a private server, felonies involved with public officials, which means we the public have a right to see them. </p>

<p>Clearly the FBI is in cahoots with Hillary in dragging their feet on the subject of Hillary&#39;s FBI admitted felonies and in releasing those emails to the public<sup><sup><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/Edward-Snowden-shows-how-FBI-managed-to-check-650000-Clinton-related-emails-so-quickly/articleshow/55305049.cms">[5]</a><a href="http://thesaker.is/what-does-it-take-to-bring-hillary-clinton-to-justice/">[6]</a><a href="http://americanactionnews.com/articles/breaking-judicial-watch-drops-bombshell-on-email-investigation">[7]</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>This means they are in violation of the FOI Act and the Federal Records Act.  Comey and McCabe are breaking the law and nothings being done.</p>

<p>But more to the point, our enemies have more information than we have.  Putin has known something as far back as Sept-Oct.  &quot;You&#39;re being distracted&quot; he said.  The media kept saying &quot;Putin was taking on the NWO&quot; as preparation to probably preempt the narrative that Trump is working with Putin, because it turns out, the media IS the NWO, given that the MSM is CIA and the CIA is fighting Trump tooth and nail right now.</p>

<ul>
<li>This happened 10 days ago, but and IT spy ring of 3 muslim brothers living in the same house was busted in Congress.  Marie Bartaromo with that story.<sup><sup><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5t5app/anyone_seen_this_yet_report_about_the_3_muslim_it/">[88]</a><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5tp438/the_muslim_brotherhood_has_infiltrated_the_us/">[99]</a><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5st8n6/muslim_brothers_abid_imran_and_jamal_awan_were/">[911]</a></sup></sup></li>
<li>Three brothers were able to be in the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Dept Homeland Security Committee and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs-- the three key intelligence committees in the House.</li>
<li>HPSCI oversees the CIA, Homeland Security, ODNI, all the Military Intelligence agencies, 22 agencies it oversees.  There were about 8 congresspeople involved in these hacks</li>
<li>Awan brothers--all under 22 years of age, and all making 160k/yr.  Jamal Awan.</li>
<li>Haven&#39;t heard much about this in the press, a little on Barney and on Lou Dobbs.</li>
<li>This is equivalent to the Rosenbergs; they put the Rosenbergs to death, so I don&#39;t know why there hasn&#39;t been any arrests been made.  They were fired from their jobs but they were caught hacking into these 8 representatives&#39; accounts: Duckworth, Carson, Schult, Castro, Richmond, Frankel, Spier, ? (what&#39;s the eighth?). That&#39;s espionage act.  That&#39;s death sentence.</li>
<li>Adam Schiff didn&#39;t say anything, CNN didn&#39;t say anything.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are being cuckholded by our own government.  Only we didnt&#39; sign up for it, nor did we pay mistress for the service, nor did we pay another man to come in and have sex with our wives, nor do we find this situation a particularly arousing fetish.  Like finding your wife in bed with another man, this is a situation that inspires violent crimes of passion, to be cuckholded. </p>

<p>Now imagine that you&#39;re paying their salary while they laugh at you and give you nothing.  They are either useless bystanders accomplishing nothing, or they are using their political celebrity to disparage Trump on some kind of ignoramus bandwagon, or they are subverts selling our secrets to the enemy.  I want you to get mad, dammit!  I want you to go to your windows, open them up and shout, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZwMVMbmQBug?t=65">I&#39;m as mad as hell and I&#39;m not going to take it anymore!!</a></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Here is what you can do</strong></p>

<p>Write letters, get on social media, talk about these things with regular people.  Talk about these issues in comments in reddit for example.</p>

<ul>
<li>Encourage President Trump and followers to release the <em>650,000 emails from Hillary&#39;s server and Weiner&#39;s laptop</em> -- they belong to us</li>
<li>Encourage President Trump to at least release metadata of the emails; </li>
<li>Encourage President Trump to release the identities or at least the metadata of the 19 gmail accounts used by the State Dept</li>
<li>Encourage President Trump to release metadata of the private donors to the Clinton Foundation</li>
<li>Make FOIA requests if you have to</li>
<li>Encourage President Trump and followers to pass a <strong>Federal Medical Cannabis Act</strong> that removes Cannabis and CBD from Schedule I, and decriminalizes it universally--with no means for states to supercede with greater prohibition. This will DISRUPT the liberal mind, and have them eating their own tails for the next year as they begin to infight over &quot;Trumps Draconian Authoritarianism&quot; that doesn&#39;t exist.  This will be a good nonpartisan sell which he can spin as opening up the possibility for enhanced cannabinoid research by Pharma companies, and by regulating the industry, and lessening the overtaxed prison system while reprioritizing the police force towards violent crime and domestic terrorism.  Also, it saves lives and eases suffering for specifically those with severe pain, fibromyalgia, crohns, aids, cancer, and reducing duration of parkinsons and epilepsy effects.  This will shut Bernie up also as it will sweep the rug out from under his feet, leaving him standing on a cold floor looking frantically for his socks.</li>
<li>Tell everyone you know about <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5svapd/trumps_tax_plan_1_no_income_taxes_25k50k11_2_all/">Trump&#39;s Tax Plan</a>.  It will dumbfound them. If they don&#39;t understand it, explain it to them in even simpler terms.</li>
<li>Encourage everyone to watch the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5uevmg/wake_up_america_dennis_kucinich_defends_trump/">Kucinich video</a></li>
<li>Encourage everyone to watch and study the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5sgnw4/cliff_notes_on_george_webbs_series_the_dyncorp/">George Webb Sweigert Dyncorp Harvest series</a></li>
<li>Encourage President Trump to listen to what Kucinich has to say, and consider quarantining or freezing assets of the entire IC until he can sort out what&#39;s happening.</li>
