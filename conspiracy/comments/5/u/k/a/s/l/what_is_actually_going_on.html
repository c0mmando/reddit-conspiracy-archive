        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been contemplating writing this for about a month. Let&#39;s put aside politics for a minute. Forget your hate and preconceptions of either political party or persons. </p>

<p>The media is the citizenry&#39;s eyes and ears. The only way the people of a country know what&#39;s going on within government and throughout the country is through the lense of the media. </p>

<p>Now given that premise we know <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6?client=ms-android-sprint-us">six companies </a> control almost every major news agency. Jeff Bezos, in the top seven richest persons in the world ($72 billion &gt; worth), owns not only Amazon but The Washington Post. Carlos Slim, Mexican business billionaire and in the top 7 richest people in the world owns the majority share of The New York Times. </p>

<p>Republican and Democratic leaders did their best to destroy Trump&#39;s chances in the spring of 2016. Mitt Romney, the previous Republican presidential candidate, even attacked Trump in a now infamous speech. He won the Republican nomination in despite of the RNC and DNC. </p>

<p>Trump was equated in the media to Hitler, the KKK, White Supremacists, George Wallace throughout the campaign. Violent riots in Chicago concerning a Trump rally happens in the spring/summer of 2016. The media portrays Trump as the sole individual/entity responsible for any political violence on either side. </p>

<p>FBI director Comey clears Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing and then signals a short &quot;reopening&quot; of the investigation days before the election. There are talks of a schism inside the FBI. </p>

<p>Trump wins the election, shocking almost everyone. </p>

<p>Directly after Trump wins the mainstream media from tv (CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, etc) to print (Washington Post, NYT, Post Globe, etc.) to the radio (NPR, public radio) start talking about the term &quot;fake news&quot; as if they&#39;ve been given talking points by their bosses. </p>

<p>Directly after Trump wins those same media outlets suddenly start interviewing racists such as Richard Spencer and giving guys like him a voice. </p>

<p>Suddenly it felt like all these organizations got the same memo with directives to use terminology like &quot;the alt right&quot; and to suddenly become overly concerned about Steve Bannon who <em>sssshhhh</em> may or may not be &quot;a racist&quot;..... </p>

<p>Google and Facebook and other Clinton supporters suddenly are discussing &quot;fake news&quot; and how to control and censor it. </p>

<p>The mainstream media quickly regains its footing after the initial shock of Trump winning to only double down attacking and nitpicking his every word and action. </p>

<p>Wikileaks head, Julian Assange, is rumored dead or in prison as his internet access has been cut off. </p>

<p>Since then, mere months ago, it seems like an avalanche effect has been used to where if something is said enough and in enough different ways then it must be true. People are now outright forgetting or even misremembering the recent past because the cacophony has drowned out any logic, reason, discussion and possible dissent. </p>

<p>Persistent actual <a href="https://youtu.be/w5p7LZ0U6GE">fake news</a> by the mainstream media that is <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ilaW05Y.png">played as real. </a></p>

<p>Within a few months the media, not Trump or his surrogates, have stirred up division within the United States and now any Trump supporters are &quot;nazis&quot; and &quot;idiots&quot; and &quot;white supremacists&quot; etc and Trump is viewed as a illegitimate president. </p>

<p>Rumors <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-hackers-believed-to-have-stolen-trump-info-from-dnc-computers/">as far back</a> as June of 2016 tell of Russia hacking the DNC. There&#39;s a Trump &quot;dossier&quot; banted about news rooms and government agencies for months before the election. The &quot;dossier&quot; is opposition research on Trump which is rumored to have been initiated by Jeb Bush and other fellow Republicans and then passed on to Hillary Clinton&#39;s camp. </p>

<p>No allegation within the &quot;dossier&quot; has ever been verified, even after 6 months or more of it being passed around. </p>

<p>On December 29th of 2016 the Obama <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/us/politics/russia-election-hacking-sanctions.amp.html?client=ms-android-sprint-us">administration </a> initiates sanctions on Russia for being involved in the hacking of DNC servers. </p>

<p>We know now Michael Flynn, soon to be NSA for the Trump administration, calls up the Russian ambassador on December 29th and talks about the sanctions the Obama administration put forth that same day. The United States intelligence community is taping every phone call between the two as part of the investigation into Russia hacking the DNC servers. </p>

<p>Soon after all this Russian diplomats, ambassadors, and officials start dropping like flies. Murder after murder happens. </p>

<p>Suddenly, almost a week before inauguration day, the &quot;dossier&quot; which has been around for months, leaks. No news agency can verify anything within it but they go against the ethical standards of journalism and print the allegations and use it as a topic of discussion. </p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t any allegations within the &quot;dossier&quot; ever been proven? Why, given that, are any news agencies discussing anything dealing with it? </p>

<p>If there&#39;s no provable verifiable evidence that Trump had/has underhanded or criminal connections with anyone in the Russian government, why is the media portraying it as such? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say everything the media has been insinuating is true. Trump is a manchurian candidate, cultivated by Putin and the Russian government for years. Paul Manufort was his handler. Michael Flynn is in bed with Putin. Trump knew about Russia hacking the DNC servers. Putin is blackmailing Trump. Why can&#39;t our intelligence agencies prove one iota of anything? After months and months of investigation. If one iota of this were true why wouldn&#39;t the Obama administration rush to prove it? Why would Obama willfully allow Trump to take the oath of office? </p>

<p>Why is the media portraying calls from Flynn to the Russian ambassador as some kind of &quot;smoking gun&quot; that somehow proves allegations in the &quot;dossier&quot; to be true and Trump&#39;s supposed Russian connections to be true? The Logan Act, which according to the media Flynn is said to have violationed, has never been used against anyone before. You are telling me no former administration before an inauguration has mentioned potential policy agendas to other governments around the world? Yes, they just weren&#39;t taped and illegally leaked by United States intelligence agencies. </p>

<p>Julian Assange, in recent days has written:</p>

<p>&quot;Amazing battle for dominance is playing out between the elected US govt &amp; the IC who consider themselves to be the &#39;permanent government&#39;.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Trump&#39;s Pentagon embrace balances attacks from CIA+NSA. But if you can&#39;t fire them don&#39;t hire them. Mattis+3? An unfirable caucus. Danger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Michael Flynn: With a phone call &amp; sanctions as bait he stopped dozens of US spies &amp; their kids from being expelled. A diplomatic+intel coup&quot;</p>

<p>What is actually going on?</p>

<p>Could democrats be correct and Trump is this manchurian candidate puppet controlled by Putin and Trump being elected was some ingenious plot?</p>

<p>Could republicans be correct and the elites in the United States were shocked by Trump&#39;s win and are now on an all out vindictive assault? Trump is being scapegoated and attacked on all sides by the bureaucratic political elite and the left leaning mainstream media? </p>

<p>Is it possible Russia did hack the DNC servers but wasn&#39;t connected in any way with the Trump campaign? Trump won fair and square. Now democrats and bureaucratic elite in Washington are attacking him on all sides?</p>

<p>From Trump&#39;s inauguration speech:</p>

<p>Today&#39;s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another -- but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.</p>

<p>For too long, a small group in our nation&#39;s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished -- but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered -- but the jobs left, and the factories closed.</p>

<p>The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation&#39;s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.</p>

<p>That all changes -- starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.</p>

<p>It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.</p>

<p>What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. </p>

<p>This is a very naive thought. We are entering something bigger than ourselves, on a cosmic/spiritual level. Not talking religious.. We haven&#39;t seen anything yet, wait two years, methinks. The hurricane is off shore, for now. This is the time you should be prepping, and figuratively boarding windows. Get your affairs in order. When the cosmic storm comes a shore, you cannot even imagine the damage... It will pass, as the eye comes through, but it&#39;s not over.. True hell still awaits.. After the storm, a great enlightenment, if you make it out... Methinks, not many will, literally and figuratively... </p>

<p>I cannot stress this enough. Get your affairs in order... Pay off debt (or don&#39;t), buy rural land (~1 acre is plenty), start learning the basics (hunting, fishing, gardening, self sustainability). You&#39;re going to need this, in the world we are entering. I would also suggest moving North of the Equator. Some where with 4 seasons and has fresh water (not salt water)... for drinking and the habitat within, said waters.</p>

<p>Peace and love, all! Buckle up buckaroos..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the things always been. we are entering what we havent already exited, and the 4d chess is. thats whats going on.
   some dates will be remembered as the days things happened.
this is a super logical thought. We are entering something smaller than ourselves, on a cosmic/spiritual level. Not talking lack of religion. we have seen things sometimes. wait some time, you might see again if you stopped seeing. this is the time you should be. get things done like you did that one time you did. when the storm comes, dont think about it, it is not possible to even fathom it. when the unfathomable comes fathomable the unfathomable will still be unfathomable though. unfathomable things will still await.... After the unfathomable, a great fathom for all, if you fathom it out.... methinks not many will literally and figuratively fathom thier way out.... 
I stress this. Get shit done.... do what you were going to do already.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange said it best in your quote. Trump is not what the establishment wanted, and they are going apeshit, telling msm to spew venom on him and fabricating stories. I am inclined to think that everything they are saying is a boldfaced lie. Not that trump is perfect, but their allegations just don&#39;t make any sense, and they don&#39;t concern anything of real importance. Russia &#39;hacking&#39; the election by revealing documents that our government incriminated themselves with is silly. Even if they did, the info is still true, and clinton didn&#39;t deserve to win, in which case THANK YOU RUSSIA! If trump somehow colluded, that kind of makes him a whisteblower and american hero, so I don&#39;t see how this narrative works against him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being blinded to information is exactly what Trump wants. You need to be critical of both sides. Take news with a grain of salt, but do the same to Trump&#39;s statements. It&#39;s not something OP did, but it&#39;s something you can do.</p>

<p>Flynn shit, for instance, made him quit within a month, in a political timing that wouldn&#39;t explain a resignation if it&#39;s not endangering the whole administration. That&#39;s something you can clearly trust the media about.</p>

<p>I saw an article recently about Melania being devastated since Trump took oath. That&#39;s bullshit and irrelevant. Don&#39;t trust that. It&#39;s as simple as that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some things should just be taken at face value. A lot of what you wrote is surface level and should be interpreted that way. Trump is a Washington outsider, got slight help from Putin, but actually isn&#39;t team Putin. People are surprised he won because the mainstream media doesn&#39;t reflect the public at large but only the opinions of New York and California which vote primarily democrat. Couple that with the fact that the Trump campaign did just enough outside the norm to cause typical polling techniques to underestimate his popularity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I think it&#39;s likely that Trump wasn&#39;t &quot;meant&quot; get become president is because every MSM outlet is spewing venom towards him, calling him a &quot;Russian Spy&quot;, blaming everything on Russia and Putin, trying to divide the people even further.</p>

<p>Regarding Trump&#39;s speech, he also said;</p>

<p>&quot;<em>We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>This is on top of what you mentioned. I&#39;m thinking that everything&#39;s going to be fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.</p>

<p><strong>This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.</strong></p>

<p>We are one nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams. And their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.</p>

Now there is turmoil within the letter organizations as the good guys see a chance to abolish this crooked shadow government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very simply, the government was infiltrated. The people who infiltrated it align themselves with various groups, some of which are religions like Scientology, but are also aligned with each other. That&#39;s why it&#39;s hard to pin anything down to a single motive or religious belief. Trump is an insider to one of the subgroups and he is in the midst of ousting another subgroup, but, the partnership still exists as a whole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about how groups like the Freemasons operate. To join you need to believe in a higher power, but it can be any higher power.  So you end up with a bunch of powerful people from different organizations and religious groups that are all members, each of which has a rank. You might have a 33rd degree morman and a 33rd degree scientologist. So these people will be loyal to their religious group but at the same time be bound by the rules of the larger organization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump supporters need to think critically as well. Conway&#39;s use of &quot;alternative facts&quot; and Press Secretary Sean Spicer bumbling words and shouting at the press are egregious miscalculations. Self inflicted wounds. Trump actually does lie and tell half truths often and it hurts him because how can he call the media out on their lies and misleading coverage when he&#39;s guilty of it himself? Both sides of the political spectrum, republican and democrat, then have red meat and &quot;proof&quot; to validate their beliefs. </p>
