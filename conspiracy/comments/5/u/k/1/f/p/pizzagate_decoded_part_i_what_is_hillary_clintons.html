<p>This is part of an on-going segment to try and decrypt various infamous symbols and references which have come up during Pizzagate-related research. These notes may then provide as useful tools for others who may come across further references in their own research.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Internet researchers have been mystified ever since a WikiLeaks email was uncovered tied to Hillary Clinton which made a cryptic reference to an &quot;owl/minerva rule&quot;. There has been much debate as to what this meant, including its potential reference to the occult and the goddess, Minerva.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think the last paragraph violates the owl/minerva rule? </p>

<p>They are fine with the last paragraph.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/5680">Excerpt from Jacob J. Sullivan email to Hillary Clinton</a></p>

<h1>Decoded</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Minerva represents a group of like-minded states that support the creation of credible and binding institutions, possibly backed by a limited but creative use of force&quot;</p>

<p>In the first, competitive mode, Minervian powers support multilateralism primarily based on their perceived economic or political self-interests.They support global institution-building either to upload national constraints to the global level or according to counter-hegemonic motives against the US.</p>

<p>In the second, normative mode, Minervian states support multilateralism under the influence of norms and ideas promoted by grassroots actors...In general, the success of the normative mode is dependent on the relatively weak mobilization of adverse interest groups and relatively low costs in terms of relations with the US. These intervening variables vary over time and windows of opportunity may close after key events.</p>

<p>The third key mode has involved domestic political leadershipâ€“ i.e. the projection of domestic agendas in Minervian countries onto the global agenda, usually involving multi-level coalitions...This is a top-down mode where political leaders in key states are the prime movers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The essay, <em>Minerva&#39;s Rule</em> was written by two University of British Columbia professors in May 2007.</p>

<h1>Possible connection to the Bohemian Club and/or occult</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.lovethetruth.com/jis_images/cremation_of_care.jpg">Bohemian Club</a></p>

<p>It has been noted that the specific reference to the &quot;owl&quot; may reveal this to be a clue into the philosophies of the Bohemian Club. This secretive organization of political world elite conducts frequent rituals in honor of their owl god, Moloch. </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton has also been involved in another infamous WikiLeaks email in which she uses State Department email to forward one of her team&#39;s reports in which a chicken sacrifice to Moloch is described.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With fingers crossed, the old rabbit&#39;s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch</p>
