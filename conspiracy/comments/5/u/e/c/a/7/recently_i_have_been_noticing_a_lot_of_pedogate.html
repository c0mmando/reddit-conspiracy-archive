I know I&#39;m over simplifying (still trying to decipher what is real and what is bat shit). So I started thinking of all the kids movies that tie into this. The first examples that came to mind are Monsters Inc. (monsters have to consume children&#39;s screams and fear to power the monster city) and Trolls (the bergins have to eat trolls to be happy). Is this Hollywood flaunting it in our faces? Could it be someone trying to hint and help?</p>

<p>Not just Hollywood. Nearly every aspect of the advertising, marketing and entertainment industries use hidden subliminal messages/images that are generally hiding in plain sight. These subliminal images, more often or not, are of a sexual nature.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recent movie/shows I&#39;ve caught that reference this stuff. I&#39;ll do my best to not include spoilers as all of these are actually entertaining and worth the watch in addition to being interesting for their referential content.</p>

<p>Split: MKUltra, the movie! Complete with direct scenes of incestual pedophilia. Good work M. Night Shyamalan. Really portrays Dissociative Identity Disorder to a believable setting, and references that it stems from extreme childhood suffering/torture.</p>

<p>Dr. Strange: references the multi-dimensional universe, zero-point energy, and beings that exist in those other dimensions. Related to PGate via the Podesta zero-point energy / interdimmensional beings emails. Suggests that &quot;western science&quot; may not actually be at the forefront of understanding the human body/mind as we had imagined. </p>

<p>The OA: directly references the notion of psychic powers and the &quot;energy/light&quot; nature of the soul. Addresses the notion that &quot;black ops&quot; style experiments that push people to their more extreme limits will ultimately reveal something about the nature of life that could fundamentally change the entire world.</p>

<p>Stranger Things: pulpy, but this is in the line of XFiles stuff that references government/corporate experiments pushing the boundaries of science and discovering alternate dimensions. </p>

<p>True Detective: directly referenced Pizzagate like activities before it was even a thing in the public zeitgeist. The very first episode features a woman killed in a ritual murder with the spiral symbol painted on her back... the same type of symbol we&#39;ve all become so familiar with.</p>

<p>Combine that with the passing fad of vampires/zombies (which warrants deeper discussion as being symbolic fears in a left vs. right political paradigm), and you could make a solid case for some really interesting stuff being hinted at by Hollywood. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s others... but the point is, it seems that this sort of stuff is really bubbling to the surface is a way that I don&#39;t remember happening recently. In the 90s there was a phase where this supernatural stuff was all the rage... so this could just be a return to that sort of popular fandom that Hollywood is cashing in on, but the specificity of stuff like True Detective and Split makes me wonder if there&#39;s more to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. The other argument to be made is that the pop-culture references aren&#39;t following the truth... instead, we are all buying into one massive fantasy that has been suggested by pop-culture, but that doesn&#39;t actually exist in anything even close to resembling the monsters that we have painted on the walls.  In other words, this is all just a massive psyop to get people believing in fairy tales and ghost stories while they rob us blind through utterly mundane means (banks, taxes, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Confirmation bias is so you can acknowledge and walk away.  It gives you a sense of completeness when really you&#39;re just noticing connections.  </p>

<p>The entire subculture you reference exists in subliminal nature.  Of course it has to be almost crazy to make the connections because they have the buffer there as a safety net.  Doubt is their biggest defense.  </p>

<p>Having looked at symbology for years through artwork and research there is no way that symbols aren&#39;t used for things that people swear up and down they aren&#39;t.  Isn&#39;t that the whole idea behind coding and hiding things in plain sight?</p>

<p>This stuff is very real.  Watch The Neon Demon or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  </p>

<p>The tongue in cheek references are too plentiful to be meaningless.  We need to acknowledge the battle for once instead of holding onto doubt of our instincts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the problem: I have a friend that is a local judge and I have thought about broaching the subject with him. But anytime I have said anything critical about a lawyer  or another judge in this area he definitely clams up and I get the sense that they will do anything to protect the good old boys club. I am pretty new to the conspiracy group. But I&#39;ve never understood why sex offenders and child molesters get such light sentences. It confirms the fear I&#39;ve had all along that it is a much bigger problem than we would like to admit. What I really don&#39;t understand is all of the trolls and shills on here that can look at this mountain of circumstantial evidence and not think that there is anything going on.

<p>Things that, yeah, could implicate certain people and unravel certain threads if entirety exposed and proven to be what we think they are, but are either air-tight or well-conditioned to withstand us &quot;crazies&quot;.</p>

<p>It keeps up from searching much deeper because we&#39;re being thwarted trying to prove certain things.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why when we get things like pizzagate, leaks, and human trafficking, &quot;fake news&quot; explodes and saturates the world. So not only are we now basically criminals, were unredeemable and those we investigate are just the victims of a strange game.</p>

<p>They had a contingency for us. We didn&#39;t expect that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might be difficult for you to comprehend, but real people make those things. Not children. Not some robot. Adult human beings. Funny, Creative, intelligent, intellectual, well travelled, multicultural human beings. Yes, when you spend 3 months animating 3 minutes of a single background shot, or writing a 3 minute piece of dialogue, you tend to sneak little things in there. Things that won&#39;t get picked up on the fly, but generally by the subconscious. Things like a penis in the negative space of a shadow. Sometimes they&#39;re smart and sometimes they&#39;re just funny and often a little depraved. The point is, you only know what these things are if you already know what they are. It&#39;s never something consciously addressed, so it&#39;s always going to go over a kids/naive persons head. </p>

<p>&quot;The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer, I&#39;m declining to help
I&#39;ve been lying to my body can&#39;t rely on myself oh no&quot;</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;All&lt;/b&gt; of these examples have deeper meaning, even though it&#39;s top layer meanings are still somewhat clear. A few of his songs can even be used as mantras.</p>

<p>This is one example, I believe I have provided accurate information, if not, please let me know and I can list more examples or explain. Some of the meanings left by artists are only clear to people who have an understanding of the way certain things work intentionally, so only they can decipher what is being encoded.</p>

<p>There are many more examples from different artists that I could list, but since I had said &quot;albums depicting secret messages&quot;, Coloring Book is a great one.</p>
