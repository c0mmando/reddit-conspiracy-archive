<p>The other problem I see is that I am starting to think pedophilia isn&#39;t just a small aberration in society. I think it is a large and thriving subculture that has existed along side the rest of normal civilization forever. I think it is at least as prevalent as homo/bi-sexuality, but likely more so. And I think our leadership has it in spades. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homosexuality is different because its between 2 consenting adults. Pedophilia is as bad or worse than murder. They are effectively killing/raping a childs soul/innocence, there is no consent. If they are attracted to kids then bang a 18-30 year old that looks young. At least they can reasonable give conscious consent. A less than 12 year old cant give consent because they dont know what the fuck is going on. These evil fucks do though, in fact its what they get off on, stealing the childs innocence. They should get no rehab, no prison, they need to burn at the stake...fuck podesta and fuck all you shills trying to downplay it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing his point - if you go to college you&#39;re told pedos are like 1% or less than the population. Being one IS their sexuality. Trying to make one not is akin to making a straight person not straight anymore - or making a gay person straight.</p>

<p>Hopefully you are intellectual enough to understand that this is independent of my opinion of them. It&#39;s something we&#39;ve been lied to about as a species and I&#39;d like to know why.</p>

There may be a way to allow pedophiles an outlet like virtual reality so they dont feel the need to do it in real life or something. I think its more than a sexual orientation and that wanting to have sex with an actual prepubescent child reveals some kind of mental illness that should be studied by psychologists. And pizzagate is about ritual satanic abuse by cults, supposedly containing high ranking members of the elite, so it goes much deeper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and as evidence for that statement you compared it to homosexuality. I think that&#39;s weak evidence. What real evidence shows that it can&#39;t be treated? If some teenager realizes they&#39;re attracted to children and gets help for it, is there hard evidence that shows he&#39;s unlikely to be successful? Most mental disorders can be treated, why not pedophila? </p>

<p>that&#39;s the opposite of safe to assume.  Prostitutes are CONSTANTLY abused by the police.  Have you ever met a vice cop?  They rape prostitutes all the time, and steal their money and drugs.  It&#39;s basically systematic.</p>

<p>I had a friend who was arrested once for &quot;assaulting an officer&quot;.  What actually happened was he watched a cop beat the shit out of someone and then asked the guy for his badge number- so they beat the shit out of my friend and then had to charge HIM with assault because otherwise they couldn&#39;t justify it when my friend showed up at the hospital.  </p>

<p>Anyway, the point of my story is that as the cops were taking my friend in handcuffs to the hospital, they were bragging the whole time about about how they get to screw the local strippers for free because otherwise they can take them in for prostitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, gotcha.  the prostitutes aren&#39;t prostitutes because they want to be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m somewhat inclined to agree.  there are many circumstances that can lead to prostitution- one of which is needing a job to support yourself and your family. And sure, there are probably some people who were coerced into it by others.  But there are some aggravating circumstances that might lead to the career choice- drug addiction and a police record might be big ones.  Not having job skills, might be another.  But having an arrest record certainly plays a role in the vicious cycle which can lead to exploitation.</p>

<p>Sexual exploitation exists everywhere.  That&#39;s the issue we&#39;re reacting to.  Obviously the exploitation of minors is part of that and particularly egregious.  BUT what&#39;s the difference between a 17 year old being exploited by this circumstance, and an 18 year old?  One is considered a victim, and the other a criminal.  Without knowing further nuances on their individual cases, that&#39;s the only distinction we can make.</p>

<p>People are accusing me of downplaying sexual exploitation here- but unless you can&#39;t handle the thought process it takes to determine the nuance, you get sucked into being reactive and bundling concepts which don&#39;t deserve to be painted with such a broad brush.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to continue to call out the authoritarian assault on people&#39;s liberties, because I feel that the violence perpetrated by the state on its people is what drives the behavior so many here are reacting to.</p>

<p>I think it would be better to land on the side of: no prostitutes should ever get arrested for the act of prostitution.  There is at least a <em>chance</em> that they are being exploited, and arresting them for that would be reprehensible. If they are not being exploited and are doing it purely because they <em>want</em> to- we don&#39;t lose out on anything by letting them go with a pamphlet on resources available to them should they choose to change their lifestyle. </p>

<p>of course.  but the way that California sting was set up- and how many of these stings are set up, is to lean on the girl to claim she&#39;s being exploited and to give up her &quot;pimp&quot;.  If she gives up the pimp, she&#39;s a victim.  If she doesn&#39;t &quot;snitch&quot;, she&#39;s a criminal.  You don&#39;t need to have a pimp to be being exploited.  </p>

<p>But then again, sex as a financial transaction isn&#39;t necessarily exploitative by definition.  I know some very well educated women (Ivy league) who have done it.  They&#39;re probably not going to be arrested for it, because they&#39;re smart.  Whether it&#39;s &quot;escorting&#39;, or getting a &quot;sugar daddy&quot;... whatever.  They frame the transaction to take advantage of the loopholes.  &quot;Leave the cash on the dresser&quot;.  I&#39;m not turning tricks- I&#39;m selling &quot;art&quot;.  The sex is free.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Definitely!  Those services should be made available.  Decriminalize and provide services.  But what we&#39;re seeing is Law Enforcement using the fact they&#39;re making services available to distract from the injustice of criminalizing prostitution.</p>

Saving kids is what it is all about, but if news outlets and other sources claim 1700 arrests in regards to child sex crimes when in fact it was only 700 in regards to child sex crimes a 1000 for other offences like prostitution, the public aren&#39;t getting the full story, can make judgments in areas like voting etc that may ultimately make it worse for victims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah - I may be voicing a minority (albeit growing) opinion that the thrust of this crowd-sourced investigation needs to be expanded to examine all routes/realms of trafficking, i.e. arms trafficking, human trafficking, drug trafficking, organ trafficking etc.  Whether the victims are adults <a href="http://ktla.com/2017/02/01/474-arrested-28-sexually-exploited-children-rescued-during-statewide-human-trafficking-operation-lasd/">(verified)</a> or children <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-childporn-idUSKBN15P0UT?il=0">(again...verified)</a>. </p>

<p>Until prostitution is legalized and regulated, there is no reason assume any working girl/woman is there by her own accord.  Also - it stands to reason that an adult trafficking victim could have very well been a trafficking victim as a child.</p>

<p>You can take a piss out side and can labeled forever as a &quot;sex offender&quot;.  Why do you think that is?  Just the nature of our puritanical society?

While they&#39;re waving headlines in front of your face about some dingus who downloaded the wrong video off of pornhub, with their right hand- what the hell do you think they&#39;re doing with their left?</p>

<p>Nobody is &quot;working up the ladder&quot;.  None of these articles have anything to do with each other except that Law Enforcement agencies have realized it&#39;s easy to trick the public into supporting Vice operations by manipulating the language and playing into deep seeded fears.</p>

<p>&quot;Wednesday, August 10, 2016 — More than 1,300 sex buyers – a record – were arrested across 18 states in this summer’s National Johns Suppression Initiative aimed at reducing sex trafficking, Cook County Sheriff Thomas J. Dart announced today.</p>

<p>The operation by a national coalition of law enforcement agencies recovered 32 underage girls lured into human trafficking and made 71 human trafficking arrests. The operation lasted approximately one month, from July 1 to August 7. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t accurate either. The biggest &quot;sting&quot; he uses as an example of &quot;trafficking arrests&quot; was the 474 arrested the other day in California. This particular sting was the 3rd annual (they&#39;ve been doing these arrests and investigation on a yearly basis for the past 3 years), and also included MOSTLY solicitation/prostitution arrests between two consenting adults in a state where that&#39;s illegal (unless you&#39;re filming porn). So for him to even use that number (the largest on his list of examples) is incredibly disingenuous towards the point OP is trying to make with the post. Not only has it been an ongoing task force for the past 3 years, making annual arrests, but it also only included a fraction of actual trafficking-related arrests for adults and children.</p>

<p>Yet another nationwide &quot;sex trafficking sting&quot; where the main targets of police attention are men who solicit sex from consenting, adult women. The sting, part of a bi-annual &quot;National Johns Suppression Initiative,&quot; ran from July 1 to August 7 and <strong>netted 1,358 arrests for solicitation of prostitution</strong>, in 18 states. </p>

<p>71 arrests is nothing compared to what&#39;s happened the past 3 weeks. OP compiled over 1,500 in this post. That&#39;s over 20x your figure in a fourth of the time (3 weeks compared to one summer). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe he brought courage to the last few remaining civil servants who were tired of see the vile corruption running rampant in their own government.  </p>

<p>For many decades the naive young workers with optimistic views of what it was like to work in government came quickly to realize what a macabre cesspool their government really is. This dark abyss called the federal government has many demons and very few angels and like a web of trouble has everyone yielding to its chaos. The youthful who were not strong enough mentally and spiritually ended up washed up or controlled by the agents of darkness. The ones who try, the ones who care, the ones strong enough to remain sane only ended up stunted. Unable to dispell evil, they can only watch as their country, constitution, and citizens are torn up limb from bloody limb.</p>

<p>But they saw a light. It was a tiny light, puss puss of a light, but it was definitely there. They saw a clown.  A clown from TV, on TV doing something that clowns do. Make people laugh. And this clown. This clown said something that shattered the glass ceiling of our firmament. He said &quot;our politicians are so corrupt, we need to get money out of politics&quot;. For anyone who wasn&#39;t mind controlled and was watching at that very moment. They felt a surreal energy envelop them. They knew, this was their hope.</p>

<p>The found others who found this light in the darkest crevices of the internet. They memed with eachother they keked with each other,  until the memes became too powerful. At this moment they discovered the Egyptian God of KEK was powering these memes. They also discovered Chinese Meme Magic(zodiacs). 2016 was the Year of the Fire Monkey. The last Year of the Fire Monkey was 1776. At this point Indian Americans and Indian Indianans started to worship Trump as their Savior for the upcoming Kali Yuga. And then late in the election they discovered the ultimate Mandela Effect. Trump and Pence are now mentioned in the bible. Across all cultures memes and magic have transcended into reality.</p>

<p>But the fight was not over. It was known that the elites worship Moloch in Bohemian Grove. But ever since the wikileaks revealed Hillary&#39;s Spirit Cooking and Pizzagate, these &quot;demons&quot; in government have become more than just a title. The FBI took their first swing with a full investigation process. But they were too weak. They were too fearful of their own mortal lives. They did not want to die like the rest of the whistleblowers who went against Her. They could not cut off the head of this Hydra who will not die. Her body fails on a daily basis. But these elites just reanimate Her for the next rally.</p>

<p>&quot;Enough is Enough&quot; Shouted the God Emperor from the throne of Trump Tower. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG-_8Mvkcnc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG-_8Mvkcnc</a> Lightning struck the tip of the tower as he took off his cape and crown and was nominated by the RNC. He looked to a bewildered and beatem Chris Christie on his stubby knees. The whites of his eyes and his fat could not calm his shaking body.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll give you a choice Christine. You can either end up LIKE THEM&quot; As he sways his massive arms to show the bodies of Jebrah and El Rato lying in the hall. &quot;Or you can work for me&quot;</p>

<p>The answer was clear.</p>

<p>&quot;Ben you my nigga&quot; said the God Emperor said to Carson and the three of them walked outisde.</p>

<p>At this moment the God Emperor grew in size like ultraman. His foot as huge as the tower He slowly walked towards the debate hall. With each step of his giant foot, supporters grew in the wake of the dust like flowers blooming for the Forrest God in Princess Mononoke. By the time he reached the debates, he had already amassed half of the country behind him. But it was not enough.</p>

<p>Now the real final battle will begin.</p>

<p>I actually commented on that in another post saying it would be interesting to see how many busts happened in previous years. I was wondering if we were just noticing them more now because people are paying more attention. If what you&#39;re saying is right then I&#39;d have to admit I might be wrong.

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/us-human-trafficking-arrests-hit-all-time-high-in-2016/article/2612757">Washington Examiner</a>: &quot;In its inaugural year, HSI took 300 people into custody. That number more than tripled to 938 in FY 2011. The following year saw 967 arrests, but doubled to 1,877 in FY 2013. The next year had 1,770 arrests and FY 2015 saw 1,437. From Oct. 1, 2015 through Sept. 30, 2016 (the standard fiscal year), HSI picked up 1,952 people.&quot;</p>

<p>At this rate, Trump&#39;s administration will beat the total for 2016 by the END OF THE MONTH.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I used my power of inference for most of them.</p>

<p>&quot;Forty-two people have been arrested by the Polk County Sheriff’s Office during an extensive undercover investigation targeting child sex predators, authorities said.&quot; Extensive under cover investigation - implying this took a while to orchestrate</p>

<p>&quot;Those swept up in the operation were arrested between October and earlier this month and were charged with indecent liberties and electronic solicitation of a minor, authorities said. &quot; - clearly shows that the operation lasted the course of several months</p>

<p>&quot;Now that the auto show is over and the undercover operation is complete, the FBI is sharing exactly what happened in Detroit and its suburbs. In some cases, it even involved children.&quot; - Including this because it was an event based sting, so A) we can infer they do this every year and B) it shows the arrests were beholden to the timing of the event so it&#39;s timming with the others isn&#39;t suspicious</p>

<p>&quot;The nationwide sweep produced the most arrests since operations began 13 years ago with 29 pimps detained and a further 723 people arrested for buying sex across 15 states, according to the Cook County Sheriff&#39;s Office in Illinois, which takes the lead on the annual sex trafficking crackdown.&quot; - this is the super bowl one showing they do it every year for the past 13 years</p>

<p>&quot;The operation was part of what&#39;s called the National Johns Suppression Initiative -- an annual initiative now in its 13th year. In Harris County, it ran from Jan. 4 through Super Bowl Sunday and netted the most arrests of any agency.&quot; - again another sting that takes place every year for the past 13 years.</p>

<p>&quot;The National Johns Suppression Initiative ran from Jan. 18 through Feb. 5 and led to the arrests of 29 sex traffickers and of 723 people who tried to purchase sex, the Cook County sheriff&#39;s office said. It included nearly 30 law enforcement agencies across 15 states.&quot; - same initiative as the last but a different area and separate article.</p>

<p>&quot;More than 30 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and task forces, including the Los Angeles Regional Human Trafficking Task Force, participated in the third annual “Operation Reclaim and Rebuild” enforcement operation, according to a sheriff’s news release.&quot; - the news release linked in the article states it&#39;s the third annual so again an on going sting.</p>

<p>Meaning that 7/12 of the busts were planned year long or older operations and the ones that weren&#39;t you will find were the small busts of just a few people where the argument could be made that they likley wouldn&#39;t be related to the alleged pizza gate pedo ring.</p>

<p>I ignored international stories because they are almost definitely unrelated, as well as the one where no arrests were made, and any cases involving 1 offender like sadusky or the national guard officer. All of which I think are fair exclusions, however you could make the case for sandusky I suppose.</p>

<p>&quot;Those swept up in the operation were arrested between October and earlier this month and were charged with indecent liberties and electronic solicitation of a minor, authorities said. &quot; - <strong>clearly shows that the operation lasted the course of several months</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t &quot;clearly show&quot; anything, the length of the investigation isn&#39;t mentioned at all?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Forty-two people have been arrested by the Polk County Sheriff’s Office during an extensive undercover investigation targeting child sex predators, authorities said.&quot; Extensive under cover investigation - <strong>implying this took a while to orchestrate</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, there is no time frame in this text. Not one. You don&#39;t get to just make up a timeframe because the words &quot;extensive undercover operation&quot; were used. </p>

<p>Okay, so five of your seven you listed were <strong>provable</strong> yearly ops. That leaves 11 ring busts and 2 high profile arrests in 3 weeks going off just the stories in the compilation thread. That&#39;s still wayyyy more than normal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if we&#39;re going off just the story compilation thread you&#39;re lying. Because I didn&#39;t leave out 10 ring busts if we&#39;re going by the stories. Second I do get to decide a time frame, it&#39;s called inferencing and it&#39;s what you people do for all the pizza gate stuff, if we can&#39;t do that all you&#39;re pizza gate evidence would go up in smoke. The adoption center has no proof of any trafficking, only that they failed to adequately follow procedure to prevent those things. </p>

<p>&quot; “And our investigation has been ongoing for a number of months. It’s anticipated to continue for several weeks if not several months.”&quot; The state representative story which I didn&#39;t include because it was in the &quot;possibly related&quot; category also took severl months</p>

<p>&quot;A state trooper said in the arrest affidavit that on Nov. 21, the alleged victims’ father turned over to investigators text messages from Sandusky in which he asked one of the girls for nude photographs.&quot; Sandusky was in the works for a while as well.</p>

<p>So now of the 15 total stories that aren&#39;t international, 10/15 took place over a long period of time definitely took a large period of time to conduct and we can easily infer that many of the others did based on what was said. Some arn&#39;t even related to human trafficking anyway, like the adoption center or the representative.</p>

<p>And again, January was Human Trafficking Awarness month, it&#39;s the month they always do these type of stings in. Just because you weren&#39;t paying attention before doesn&#39;t mean there are more now than befroe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is saying that all these arrests and the information materialized instantaneously. We&#39;re trying to say that they had the information on these people for months, if not years but they were some how blocked from getting the go-ahead.</p>

<p>Like really, you have to be pretty dense to not see the connection. People have been talking about all of this pedophilia stuff over the course of the last year and suddenly, almost every single day, more and more arrests are happening all over the states? Pedophilia is rampant in the United states and it&#39;s government on both sides. You don&#39;t think the higher ups have been protecting their own over the past 9 years? They all have crazy dirt on each other, that&#39;s why all of these raids were being blocked. They have been making money off of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know they havn&#39;t because if you bothered to read the articles you&#39;ll find all the larger busts are part of initiatives that happen every year around this time to coincide with January being Human trafficking Awarness Month, some of which go back 13 years. this isn&#39;t a new thing by any stretch of the imagination, they do this every year and around this very time. I will concede however that many of these were reported to be the biggest busts ever for these initiatives, so perhaps whatever point you&#39;re trying to make is connected to that fact.</p>

<p>What wrongdoings did the media expose? That Flynn talked about sanctions? Not illegal.. unless he said something stupid like which is next to impossible since Flynn knew he was being recorded by the same agency he ran for years. He just didn&#39;t think the IC would be that petty to uncover his &quot;lie&quot; to Vice President Pence. Which also isn&#39;t illegal but since Pence and Spicer already said he didn&#39;t talk about sanctions then that made him untrustworthy in public opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all very interesting ever since pizzagate was unleashed back to back to back to back these busts all over have been going on. I feel like  each bust lends information to where the next one was. These government agencies are being purposefully negligent to allow children to be kidnapped sold and abused in exchange for profit. However if you don&#39;t pull it out from the root all of these efforts will only serve as a short term wound dressing for these issues.</p>

<p>The fbi are going after the fodder bring down the masterminds at the top. Stop teaching the American people that if you have money and powerful connections that you can profit from the rape abuse molestation murder and complete degredation of defenseless children.</p>

<p>FBI renew the people&#39;s faith in you by locking ALL who are involved up not just the nameless entry level pesos but the powerful political masterminds behind it all. It needs to be done.</p>

<p>I wonder if it&#39;s being saved for last. I think they do have somebody at the top facing charges and they are singing like a canary to get a lesser sentence for themselves and the fbi is following there tips to bust all these hidden operations.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I think is going on right now. Or at least what I hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was that not ONLY the MSM reported on that and that your comment didn&#39;t make any sense since most reports in the OP were by smaller outlets.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t read or watch ABC, probably they sometimes lie. Reuters IMO depends on the topic. To me they seem more or less neutral politically. Reuters doesn&#39;t tell me how to feel about what.</p>

<p>There is almost no 100% objective journalism nowadays. What is suspicious is when the largest news outlets report the same political opinion bullshit, instead of reporting facts.
It&#39;s almost like a John Oliver show, without the laughter in the background and smartass jokes. They basically read out the headline, quote an analysis from a totally reliable anonymous source and then start construing the info for you and asking questions they themselves answer in the next sentence so you suck the info up and only see their story. If you cut the subjective opinions out of the reports, what&#39;s basically left is the headline.</p>

<p>Also &#39;Since the MSM always lies..&#39; is something you are using so you can prove that there are instances in which the MSM does not lie and therefore dismiss all claims that the MSM frequently presents wrong facts or even fake news.</p>

<p>I know I am running against a wall trying to explain this to you since you seem or are pretty much convinced of your worldview but I got nothing better to do right now and there is always the chance that my counterpart is actually trying to listen and consider another point of view.</p>
