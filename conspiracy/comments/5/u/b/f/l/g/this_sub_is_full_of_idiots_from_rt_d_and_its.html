    <div class="md"><p>His cabinet is basically a bunch of billionaires and warmakers, with a lot of old Bush-era people back in power too. There is LITERALLY a secretive group of billionaires that meet every day to plan the future of the world. It is undeniable. It&#39;s the fucking Cabinet.</p>

<p>His VP is an ardent Christian Warrior right conservative.</p>

<p>Whatever Trump does is window dressing. The people running every facet of the executive branch now are some of the most elite of the elite.</p>

<p>He&#39;s <em>saying</em> things that appease you while his cabinet slowly undermines the long-term health of the nation for the profit and gain of the owner class.</p>

<p>ffs his sec of state is an <em>oil exec</em>; his sec of education has 0 qualifications, barely understands public education issues (other than that she wants to dismantle it and replace it with Christian schools) and is the sister of Blackwater&#39;s founder (who is rumored to be directly advising the president and the cabinet - yeah nothing better than having the nation&#39;s secretive scandal-ridden mercenary army&#39;s founder being directly tied into your cabinet).</p>

<p>Not to mention many (Trump included) are still invested in conflict-of-interest holdings they stand to personally profit from. This is banana republic levels of bs.</p>

<p>Trump is the facade. The president usually is. If he builds a wall to keep the third world out while his administration does their best to turn the US into a third world country, what the fuck was the point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree on that. There&#39;s no reason to be in a constant state of animosity against the only country on earth that can completely destroy us within minutes.</p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s hardline stance against Russia was just another instance in a long line of mistaken antagonism against a far weaker (yet still MADable) competitor. They care more about prying away little puppet states in the third world than actual American security (from nuclear attack, the only real threat posed to us).</p>

<p>We squeaked out of the Cold War without destroying the world, and that was despite our idiotic attempts to bully and push the Soviets every chance we got. Kissinger, since you mention him, actually put the military on nuclear attack footing just to save his diplomacy over an Israel peace agreement (as he had promised the Soviets, partners in the deal, that Israel would be prevented from attacking, and then gave them the green light as he put the US air force in the sky to scare the Soviets from responding to this blatant promise breaking). Yeah, our relationship with Israel is more important than the one with the USSR/Russia...</p>

<p>It is absolute insanity. If left unchecked, it will end civilization eventually. That is inevitable. You can only dance on a cliff edge so many times before falling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The billionaires are pawns.  It is the trillionaires that are calling the shots.  The trillionaires control the CIA, and are using the CIA to get Trump to comply with their policies.  </p>

<p>Usually before a person becomes President, they are involved with Bilderberg, the Trilateral Commission, or the Council of Foreign Relations so they know what the policies are.  Trump was never a member of any of these organizations, so he has no idea what their policies are.  He is probably having trouble even understanding the policies.  </p>

<p>This is why I am glad Trump won.  I can just imagine Kissinger trying to explain to Trump the subtleties of foreign relations, and getting frustrated because Trump wants to discuss the wall.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont worry, time will tell.</p>

<p>Im as legit as it gets. I dont have all the answers . I&#39;m not claiming i know everything.</p>

<p>But after not watching tv for years, and studying the news.. i started seeing a correlation between news and peoples thinking pattern.
 With the media implying someting, they allow the human conscious and subconscious to figure out what. That starts the gears rolling.</p>

<p>So when the media is constantly bashing trump, they actually are selling a image. This has multiple purposes that im not getting into now because its late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Among people who have looked into the global conspiracy, Trump being either a globalist or alternatively being used by them is commonplace. People who do not see that are seen by many as beyond rescue :(</p>

<p>Any hard evidence is hard to come by but I&#39;ve seen a few posts and comments around here that are fairly compelling, I don&#39;t want to look them up now but as &#39;not my press&#39; says, you can find the info if you want to. </p>

<p>The clearest &quot;in your face straight from the tube&quot; examples that I can think of right now are how Trump always speaks in a way that can be understood in two different ways, thus doing a dance with the MSM resulting in division in the public, Trumps family ties, and his conspiracy teasers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. So you attest that the MSM is making a coordinated effort to basically endorse Trump through attacking him?</p>

<p>How does this fit in with the revelations during the Democratic primary about media collaboration with the Clinton campaign and the dissemination of talking points. Did they then switch sides to Trump after the primary?</p>

<p>Its an interesting thought, I am just not sure the MSM is even that clever honestly.</p>

<p>If you recall about a year ago, many hard core Republicans were saying they would vote for Hillary if Trump was the Republican nominee.  It is because these hard core Republicans ARE members of Bilderberg, the Trilateral Commission, and/or the Council of Foreign Relations, and they will not support an outsider instead of an insider.  The whole Democrat-Republican thing does not matter in that case.  In fact, it is a distraction to give voters the illusion of choice.  </p>

<p>Usually before a person becomes President, they are involved with Bilderberg, the Trilateral Commission, or the Council of Foreign Relations so they know what the policies are.  Trump was never a member of any of these organizations, so he has no idea what their policies are.  He is probably having trouble even understanding the policies.  </p>
