       Or they're aware of the depths of human depravity and it has ruined their curiosity and created a sense of despair. Myself I'm not super opposed to the human race going extinct. I think it would be nice to be free of the mortal coil. I just think it's shitty of us to damage the environment for the other animals.

       There is truth in this. So many good people want to think others are just as good as they choose to be. Yet, it seems to me, that people are averse to looking at the demons within, or rather the seemingly unwanted or unpleasant aspects of our thoughts, feelings and actions, because they don't want to have unpleasant feelings. Yet, tolook at these shadow aspects of ourselves is to demystify them, to understand them, to then perceive them on a regular basis, not just within, but outside of oneself. In coming to
       <em>
        know thyself
       </em>
       , we come to know how others work too.
      </p>
      <p>
       This knowledge of self, of its darkness, allows us to navigate around much of the darkness created by others around us. It's a study of self-interest. Self-interests that conflict with others are what tempt beings toward evil. Evil is simply self-serving behavior at the expense of others. Self-serving beings chase gain, avoid loss and calculate risk. They are very predictable. Those know know more about themselves can predict and utilize such beings. This is how evil beings form into hierarchies. They often avoid the selfless ones, because their behavior deviates from that script, so it is less predictable, and it could easily throw a spanner into the works of their organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other path you can go with this knowledge of self is to help others and even yourself, provided it is not at the expense of others. Things like avoiding drama and entangling situations are easier and often harmless to so in relation to others. Indeed, avoiding their drama can even help them sometimes. They may just be seeking a cheap emotional high instead of fixing their own issues. You can sometimes see exactly what's wrong in another person's situation and if you are able to adequately articulate it to them, in a tactful enough way, you can help them help themselves to do very real good for them. This is significantly harder, but far more fulfilling, than choosing to manipulate others to serve yourself.

       Yeah you're both right. Acting like gatekeepers to conspiracy theories will totally make more people aware of them and definitely convince them. /s

       Sorry, I guess I have to be more literal here. It's astounding that someone on a conspiracy forum can't connect the dots as to why I posted that. I linked to a subreddit about people who think they're smarter than they actually are and act pretentious about it. The post above me makes it sound like anybody who doesn't believe in conspiracies is "asleep" which is also meant to say that they aren't conscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your view that I'm simply throwing shit for no reason is an alternative fact.

       You guys have a horrible record in predictive power. You get 99% of everything wrong, but latch onto the 1% for self conformation. Notice almost all actual conspiracies are never predicted by you guys. Sandusky jr, nope.  Flynn resignation, nope.  Could you guys point to a single time you were ahead of the actual media? If you guys had any sense, this fact would humble you guys. But nope, you're awake. Lol.

       Are you high? What even are you really trying to accuse us of? Are you saying we can't predict the future? No shit lol. Is that even what we do here? Yeah, sure we predict long term things, but why would we be randomly trying to guess Flynn's resignation?

      <p>
       And what exactly have we gotten wrong? Do you even believe in TPTB? If not, then you're really foolish honestly. If you don't believe that the elite are trying to complete the NWO, I will gladly show you some videos! Cheers!

       Predictive power indicates sound logic and comprhension of evidence. This is how scientists and statisticians are able to predict future results.

       You guys are worse than random at predicting results. Prove me wrong. Show me some example of your conspiracy theories that actually turned out to be true. Show me links to you guys getting something right before the standard media.

       It takes unbelievable stupidity to call someone retarded while being blatantly ignorant of the subject. Yes dummy, predicting the future. Do you think when a chain reaction explosion occurred when they split the atom they were surprized? It wasn't magic dummy, it was science.

       I never disputed that conspiracies exist.  My claim is you guys never predict them. They are always found out using traditional investigating and sound science.  Never by conspiracy theorists. You guys just claim them after the standard media discovers them.

        For example, you guys are currently sure that Podesta tortured some kid on video. Using the statistical history of your predictive ability, I can say with a 99% certainty that it's completely false. Nothing will come from it, yet that won't stop your future confidence. It should.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So we 'entertain' the idea/possibility that Podesta is a Pedo because of a TON of clues, Spirit Cooking, the 'artwork,' Hastert, codewords/wikileaks, and, you know, stories like this:

       Personally, I'd bet $10K that Podesta will eventually be outed as a Pedo, but that's just me. I admit I could be wrong about it, but that's the beauty of being a 'thought/possibility entertainer.'

       Fair enough. I think there is absolutely nothing there and it's a poor hypothesis. Good hypotheses often turn out to be correct, I just don't think you guys are good at coming up with them. I feel like if you were, you could go back in this sub a year and find cases you guys got right before the media.  They just aren't there.

       Well I've always been out of this matrix. I've always been aware of the BS. I have experienced a lot, at right now in my spiritual journey, I'm learning about kundalini and letting go of your ego etc. It's a hard process, and even the most advanced spiritual teachers will tell you that they're still working on your ego. Basically I'm taking it one day at a time. I've learned to suppress emotions. There are some things I'm working on regarding my ego. So not 100% there, but I know what needs to be done.

       The real spiritual teachers tell you that the ego doesnt really exist as its own independent thing. Its a mental process.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ego is the feeling of being a separate localised self.

       Okay well explain how the brain produces states of awareness? Or how it's connected to the awareness? I understand that your ego doesn't exist, but I'm not sure what else you're trying to say.

       It really is quite lonely. I am slowly trying to wake my girlfriend up. I had my first experience of seeing someone brain literally REFUSE to listen to the information I was providing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have gotten her to agree that we at least knew about 9/11 and let it happen and probably demolished the buildings. She believes in some of pizzagate as far as the highly organized international trafficking of children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, I tried to red pill her on the Boston Bombing. Being from Mass, she was really affected by it. As I am telling her all of the inconsistencies, I could see it on her face and in her eyes that she literally could not go any further. Her brain hit a wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a strange sight but now I can see that that really happens to people and they literally just can't believe some of this shit to be true.

       You're doing a fantastic job.  Sometimes you can't full redpill people right from the start.  With many people, you just need to plant a few seeds.  It plants distrust and skepticism of the system.  That is the first step to awakening.
