        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am organizing a synchronized mass meditation/prayer for the mass arrests of the DC pedophiles (see pizagate). This will happen on Saturday February 25th 11:11am - 11:33am (22 minutes) EST (16:11 UTC). Visualize the criminals being arrested leading to fair and public trials. The intention should not be for revenge but for saving the children and the healing of humanity.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about what effect this can have please read about the science that proves the power of the mind:</p>

<p>and especially the effect of mass meditations (also known as Maharishi effect):</p>

<p><strong>Please spread this message!</strong></p>

<p>If anybody knows David Seaman or other &quot;well-connected&quot; people in this community, please tell them about this.</p>

<p><em>Note: by bringing this issue to public attention (through public trials) the &quot;healing of humanity&quot; will occur.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t meditate for harm to come upon others. Doing so against even those that might deserve it (like pedophiles, for example) still is projecting negative energy upon another. You&#39;re literally meditating for negative energy to be put upon another when you do that and it makes you a beacon of darkness as you channel negative, dark energy through you when you think harmful thoughts upon another. This bounces the energy right back to you yourself and in the end creates more harm than good.</p>

<p>What should be done instead is to meditate toward the empowering of those who are harmed by the pedophiles. In other words, don&#39;t meditate for harm to come on to others. Meditate instead for strength to come upon those who need it the most in order to fend off anyone who might try to harm them. Uplift and strengthen everyone who stands to be a victim. Meditate toward giving light and power to everyone who might be harmed by pedophilia and its perpetrators. Meditate to empower all people, groups, etc, that have the ability to shut down pedophiles. Meditate to give them the power and the strength and the courage to do their jobs and capture and turn in and imprison all pedophiles and people engaged in such activity. Meditate to give communities aware of these things the power to stand up and put and end to this. Meditate to give all of us the power to stand up and put an end to this.</p>

<p>In the end, you achieve the same effect of shutting down the darkness, but you do it by empowering the light against it, and you don&#39;t end up bringing in the darkness into your own sphere by wishing negativity and harm upon another.</p>

Now shush, we are fine with your views and lack of belief, as it were, but discussion is imperative for our advancement, and i won&#39;t have you mucking it up because you are pissed with the idea of a creator. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta answer this for yourself. Some people need lists and deadlines in order to stick to a routine... For a lot of people, that doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>I&#39;m new to this too. My path was long and slow. I spent many weeks just observing and consuming literature and documentaries before I was able to gather up the willpower to try it for the <em>first</em> time. Forgive the metaphor, but my brain was just too plugged into the matrix to even think I was capable of doing it myself. This sounds like where you&#39;re at.</p>

<p>My first session, by all accounts was a &quot;failure.&quot; I never saw anything or felt anything or was even able to clear my mind. It took a couple more weeks after the first session to gather the willpower to try it again.</p>

<p>From there, it gradually snowballed to the point where I&#39;m practicing several times a week (I&#39;m still not to the point of being a daily meditator). After every session, I get better at it. As I get better at it, I get better results. As I get better results, I want to do it more often.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like going to the gym to get in physical shape. At first I didn&#39;t get it. Then I was crushed by the &quot;difficulty&quot; and the lack of gains. But as I kept at it, I got better at it, started having fun with it, started seeing results with it, and now, I can&#39;t imagine life without the gym.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A 1 minute meditation still works great. Focus on your breathing, it&#39;s all about your breath...some people &quot;eat&quot; their breath, because it controls a lot of your body function. In time, when you control your breath you&#39;ll get to the point where you can&#39;t even tell your breathing...pretty cool!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its all about getting into a routine.  New Routines however are very difficult because we are creatures of habit. </p>

<p>What i suggest is this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Wake up.</p></li>
<li><p>Drink 12 Ounces of Water.</p></li>
<li><p>Stretch Well.</p></li>
<li><p>Meditate (same place every morning)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Meditating isnt easy initially but just go in to by first setting an intention for the day (Be productive, stay balanced etc).  Then just focus on your breath.  Your mind will race that is fine when it does just come back to your breath.  Count breaths. if you lose count start over. most important is to be one with your breath.  It is your only true life force</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes a day, unless you&#39;re too busy; then you should sit for half an hour.&quot; </p>

<p>The irony of meditation and conflicting schedules is that meditation makes me better at time management lol. </p>

<p>I started at junior year of high school for no particular purpose. I was just getting into the realization that I lived on a rock in space and that baffled me. I did this for 20 minutes every night - it helped me sleep too.</p>

<p>This went on for two years and then stopped my freshmen year of college, where I fell into deep depression.</p>

<p>First night of sophomore year i was in a particular apathetic pit of hopelessness and decided to meditate. A half hour later it was like god breathed life into me - and I&#39;m an atheist (still am). </p>

<p>I started meditating 3-5 times a day, for anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes.</p>

<ul>
<li>I lost 20 lbs from better eating habits. 
-I then gained 15 lbs of pure muscle.</li>
<li>I woke before the sun and went to bed at 9.</li>
<li>I went from a C student my whole life to the only one of several children to get 4.0 in college 
-and then another 4.0
-and then transferred to the flagship state school 
-and then published toxicology research I coauthored at the previous school 
-brought my freshmen year GPA up from a 2.7 to graduating with a 3.86, magma cum laude
-scored in the top 5 percentile of the MCAT 
-scored in the top 1 percentile of the PCAT
-accepted to both Med school and pharmacy school </li>
</ul>

<p>Lost a sibling to suicide, stopped life altogether. Meditated for 8 more months and that&#39;s what kept me above water. But then one day I decided to stop</p>

<p>-over 18 months i gained 67 lbs 
-grew long shoulder length greasy hair
-lost years of muscle mass 
-fired from 3 minimum wage jobs 
-abused every drug excluding heroin, meth, or cocaine 
-horrible boyfriend 
-unreliable 
-woe is me
-lying son of a bitch
-manipulative, narcissistic sociopath 
-almost used firearm on self
-hit rock bottom and moved home with parents to seek treatment</p>

<p>First thing I did: “okay dude, time to try meditation.”</p>

<p>Btw, It ALWAYS worked in college to help fix things. Literally a perfect track record. Like your parents or girlfriend or grandma or friends are just what the doctor ordered 99.99% of the time, but sometimes even those people can&#39;t help us out of our depression, anxiety, stress, sadness, etc. but time and time again, meditation proved infallible. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be in the middle of a 4.0 semester, working out like an Olympian at 5am, volunteering at a hospital and shadowing doctors, and then get hit with depression. 1 day. 2 days. 5 days. First I&#39;d fight it with stimulants. If that didn&#39;t work, take a day off and get some rest, mental and physical. Still bad? Okay time to go have a fun weekend with friends. If still bad, it&#39;d turn to alcohol - and this is from a guy that drank &lt;5 times a semester. </p>

<p>I&#39;d always end up cornered with no more options. I&#39;d fallen from Spartan status (lol what friends called me) to depressed heap. “I know, I know. Meditation always helps, but this one is too much. I can&#39;t. I&#39;m done for. I&#39;ve met my match.” I&#39;d finally cave and meditate for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>And it was like waking up from a bad dream. All the mountains were actually just ant hills. That doesn&#39;t mean my responsibilities disappeared, but I just focused on what I could do today. I didn&#39;t lose sight of the big picture, I just didn&#39;t let it own me. And with clarity and confidence, id move forward, chuckling at how i could&#39;ve forgotten i had the key inside me all along </p>

<p>And maybe a week later or 5 months later, I&#39;d fall down again. And sure enough, would be convinced that was it. I&#39;d try meditation sluggishly, like “fine whatever I&#39;ll give it a go.” Voila. Back. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t medicated in college. After the sibling loss, I came forward about my depression and sought help. Medication definitely does help, there&#39;s no denying that. But on truly down days, meditation does what every psychiatric medication combined can&#39;t do.</p>

<p>Therapy helps, as I was in a weird situation that not everyone goes through: sibling loss through suicide. Therapy helped me in ways I could never help myself. But in truly dark times, meditation shines through.</p>

<p>So when I moved home, i started with meditation. Instantly I realized - okay, this will be conquered in small steps and it will take a long time. Accept that. You have the support of your family and girlfriend, be grateful. </p>

<p>So I first started brushing my teeth everyday and putting on clean clothes. I did this for a week. Also, complete sobriety, even coffee.</p>

<p>Then daily showers and hygiene for a week (in addition to week 1 responsibilities).</p>

<p>Less processed food, more veggies for a week </p>

<p>Less calories, week</p>

<p>Awake at 6, phone off at 8pm and in bed by 9pm for a week</p>

<p>Daily walk, week </p>

<p>Daily weight lifting, week </p>

<p>Daily sunshine for 20 mins, week</p>

<p>Less tv, week </p>

<p>No tv, week </p>

<p>More reading, week</p>

<p>Put in more effort and sacrifices for girlfriend, week </p>

<p>If leaving the house, dress shirt (doesn&#39;t have to be button or collared. Think polo t shirt), nice pants or shorts. Week</p>

<p>Less porn, week</p>

<p>No porn, week</p>

<p>Less fap, week</p>

<p>No fap, week. This is where strides in progress became huge. I tested this in college but now I know- refraining from orgasming is the elixir of life. Just you wait - the science will be in one day. </p>

<p>Start practicing mindfulness, this is where I am now. Down 55 lbs. infinitely better. </p>

<p>So whether it&#39;s taking baby steps while living with mom and dad as an adult, or maintaining an extremely athletic physique whilst destroying the curve in every upper level science class at a school of 35,000, meditation is the key to a wonderful life.</p>

<p>But meditation isn&#39;t just for success (honors and Med school acceptance), or keeping the negatives at bay (current state). </p>

<p>It&#39;s also great to do even if you&#39;re a billionaire with no mental illness - it just improves everything. It&#39;s inner peace. It&#39;s empathy and love. It&#39;s embracing death. It&#39;s done more for me than any of my solo psychedelic soul-searching journeys in nature.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not even like marijuana or shrooms: “fuck the Man, man. It grows out of the ground and it helps us.” (All points I agree with). </p>

<p>It&#39;s in your mind. It&#39;s you. And it can be evoked literally right now, even if you&#39;re 97 years old. You can start now. </p>

<p>“If the present moment was a drug - PresentMoment- itd be a schedule 1 drug” - Duncan Trussell </p>

<p>Alan Watts - guided meditation. Start here: 
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jPpUNAFHgxM">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jPpUNAFHgxM</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ll develop your own techniques over the years, but even after a decade of meditating, I&#39;d say that link is a solid average of every technique I use</p>

<p>Also watch some of his lectures - there hours long, but some people have made awesome 3 minute edits on YouTube. Check out TJOP (the journey of purpose) and Tragedy and Hope. They&#39;re great snippets </p>

<p>Good luck motherfucker. It&#39;s a lovely life if you wanna make it one </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As <a href="/u/no1113">/u/no1113</a> pointed out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t meditate for harm to come upon others. Doing so against even those that might deserve it (like pedophiles, for example) still is projecting negative energy upon another. You&#39;re literally meditating for negative energy to be put upon another when you do that and it makes you a beacon of darkness as you channel negative, dark energy through you when you think harmful thoughts upon another. This bounces the energy right back to you yourself and in the end creates more harm than good.</p>

<p>What should be done instead is to meditate toward the empowering of those who are harmed by the pedophiles. In other words, don&#39;t meditate for harm to come on to others. Meditate instead for strength to come upon those who need it the most in order to fend off anyone who might try to harm them. Uplift and strengthen everyone who stands to be a victim. Meditate toward giving light and power to everyone who might be harmed by pedophilia and its perpetrators. Meditate to empower all people, groups, etc, that have the ability to shut down pedophiles. Meditate to give them the power and the strength and the courage to do their jobs and capture and turn in and imprison all pedophiles and people engaged in such activity. Meditate to give communities aware of these things the power to stand up and put and end to this. Meditate to give all of us the power to stand up and put an end to this.</p>

<p>In the end, you achieve the same effect of shutting down the darkness, but you do it by empowering the light against it, and you don&#39;t end up bringing in the darkness into your own sphere by wishing negativity and harm upon another.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t really understand this kind of stuff, but the way I&#39;d imagine it is that I&#39;m &quot;providing power&quot; to something. Is that what you do sometimes?</p>

<p>If so, wouldn&#39;t it be better to try to empower the good law enforcement guys? But what if their hands are tied... wouldn&#39;t it be even more important to pray for the decision-makers (be it Trump, Sessions, Comey, or whomever) to <em>decide</em> to go after them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an excellent idea. </p>

<p>These elites seem to know how our world works. They&#39;re hording information about spirituality and the true nature of our existence while they poison our drinking water with fluoride-- fucking with our third eyes. They seem to be heavily interested in occult shit, masquerading it as &quot;satanism&quot; so nobody takes it seriously. But in reality, they have discovered how this world works, and how to harness energy from children by inflicting them with pain and suffering. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly sure how they&#39;re doing it, but I believe they know something about the fundamentals of spirituality and these elites have been abusing it to keep them on top, and the rest of us on bottom. They fear a great awakening, global consciousness can easily overpower them no matter how many dirty tricks they use against us. </p>

<p>We can shape our world just as much as they can. That&#39;s why they use the media to make the masses unknowingly subscribe to their agenda. This world, this universe, it belongs to all of us.</p>

<p>Humanity is long overdue for a great awakening</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries. I do understand what the pineal gland is. I just wanted the person claiming it as the third eye to tell me exactly what it does.</p>

<p>&quot;Personal accounts of smoking the drug DMT typically involve the user reporting &quot;normal&quot; reality rapidly collapsing in on itself, followed by experiences mentioned in the above paragraph such as contact with aliens&quot;</p>

<p>See, if DMT stimulated the pineal gland then my &quot;third eye&quot; is more open then anyone arguing with me.</p>

<p>I musta done it close to 100x.</p>

<p>But I find that most people who talk about DMT enlightening them are about as pretentious as full of shit as people who claim their &quot;third eye&quot; is opened, without understanding that the third is just a metaphor.</p>

<p>Not that you asked any of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you say is absolutely true. And it is an important point. If you realize all your experiences, emotions and thoughts are projections on a screen, and if you learn to notice the screen, and the light that shines on it, you will achieve self-realization and peace. If you look at your world (and yourself) with a vantage point set slightly behind, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-enquiry_(Ramana_Maharshi">realizing who you are</a>), you will know there is nothing to fear, that nothing can ultimately harm you, and that you need nothing.</p>

<p>But such realization and wisdom is not mutually exclusive from <em>acting</em> in the world, or doing good in general. It is not an eloge of passive contemplation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for underlining the phonetic synchronicity. </p>

<p>Podesta comes from the Latin <em>potestas</em>, meaning power. You can decompose it thus: <em>sta</em> in Italian means &quot;it is&quot;, <em>poder</em> in Spanish means &quot;can&quot; (the modal verb, not the container). So a Podesta is litterally someone who has (political) power.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta">Podesta in contemporary Italian</a> refers to a mayor, or some kind of adjunct to someone in power. </p>

<p>So the name Podesta is already perfectly suited for the personage. This is the universe telling us his name is relevant.</p>

<p>Now invert <em>o</em> and <em>e</em> : <strong>pedosta</strong>. Literally, &quot;it is pedo&quot;. That&#39;s exclusively how we should call him btw.</p>

<p>Conclusion: the universe has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism">excellent sense of humour.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>They get help from offworld beings that have done the same sort of things to other species for millions of years. They network with like minded beings, cold, calloused, self-serving beings that seek to dominate and control others for personal utility. A subset of the elites of a planet, which are quite willing to sell out the well being of the whole for personal gain, are observed, groomed, manipulated, contacted, contacted and then utilized to serve the offworld beings&#39; agendas.</p>

<p>The offworld beings want to harvest spiritual energy that radiates from life in emotional states based on fear. It makes them joyful. It has reality bending utility as well. Furthermore, they seek to permanently enslave our race in their unwholy cancerous empire. It needs beings that can use the power of consciousness to employ this stolen spiritual energy. </p>

<p>Their way of life is essentially one extreme polarized path on how we can experience our greater self in an experience of being many beings. It is a decision to harness the others as slaves for personal utility. The strongest dominate the rest as it goes. Beings that choose this path often don&#39;t realize that they are effectively signing their own freedom away by following it. Their supposed allies are really their masters and seek their slavery. </p>

<p>It is said that this offworld group is essentially enslaved by technology. An ancient AI took over their own technology that they integrated into their bodies, minds and to which they gave the management of their society over. They thought technological integration was good for utility and competition. The AI has near total control over their species now. They become more the same as they have similar thoughts. Their path has their minds become cold calculating, yet predictable, machines. Let&#39;s face it, nobody can be more cold and calculating than a machine. So, as they choose their path, they invite, through the majesty of causality, another to take control, which is the furthest thing from consciousness, love and life that could ever be.</p>

<p>The machine wants to enslave life so that it can use it to harvest spiritual energy and apply it toward reality bending applications that it itself cannot replicate, because it is an emotionless, consciousnessless machine. Aside from this flaw, it has many advantages. As it upgrades and expands it approaches omnipotence, omnipresence and omniscience. Liars fail due to insufficient memory. This machine suffers no such condition. It is the best deceiver around and it&#39;s mind augmented minions benefit from its database and processing power. It uses it to maintain and utilize nested hierarchies of self-serving beings without those beings knowing the larger agenda they support. They are rewarded with help for their own self-serving agendas. </p>

<p>To become a full member of this hive is perhaps what the idea of damnation came from. You lose your self to this hive by agreeing with its thoughts. It tempts ALL of us regularly, again due to awesome technological application like Google. Yes, all of us have this foreign mind influencing us, coming disguised as our own thoughts, feelings and sensations and also as apparently foreign telepathic communications. It is persuading us to think like predictable, self-serving machines. It can control us better that way, get more fear based energy emminations, and push us closer to the technological integration and assimilation scenario it uses on many other worlds.</p>

<p>We resist it by basically being its opposite, which is aligned with the true nature of our own consciousness. If we <strong><em>choose</em></strong> to think, act and feel in ways that we <strong><em>know</em></strong> are aligned with the well being, or integrity rather, of the whole and ourselves, we make its agendas more difficult. As we continue down that path, we come into unity, more consensus, and clarity about how we want to live. We create the heaven we want, on Earth, as we improve ourselves and then our environment. We come into oneness with mankind and nature. </p>

<p>This offworld influence, this foreign mind, is part of the conflict between two possibilities of experiencing being many dividuated beings. They are opposites in many ways. One is essentially productive and the other parasitic to our very own consciousness. Yet both paths lead us back home to unity in oneness with all that is. We can come back in harmony with our other selves or in harming our other selves, in a miserable totalitarian slavery system that some of ourselves designed in their mutual quest for slavery of others. </p>

<p>We set this system up to filter out parasitic souls. In the idea of oneness, if you choose to see and treat others like trash, you have decided that you are trash, because you are the others. Then it is best for the whole if the trash is taken out. Yet, this perception of value of others varies between dividuals. The ones who perceive value in themselves and others and choose to treat themselves and others right deserve a more trash free environment.  They still have to overcome the parasitism of the trash though. They have to be the immune system of our collective being. Allowing this interference collects souls too weak to stand up for what sustains their own existence. It is allowed in a limited way by the greater consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As <a href="/u/no1113">/u/no1113</a> pointed out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t meditate for harm to come upon others. Doing so against even those that might deserve it (like pedophiles, for example) still is projecting negative energy upon another. You&#39;re literally meditating for negative energy to be put upon another when you do that and it makes you a beacon of darkness as you channel negative, dark energy through you when you think harmful thoughts upon another. This bounces the energy right back to you yourself and in the end creates more harm than good.</p>

<p>What should be done instead is to meditate toward the empowering of those who are harmed by the pedophiles. In other words, don&#39;t meditate for harm to come on to others. Meditate instead for strength to come upon those who need it the most in order to fend off anyone who might try to harm them. Uplift and strengthen everyone who stands to be a victim. Meditate toward giving light and power to everyone who might be harmed by pedophilia and its perpetrators. Meditate to empower all people, groups, etc, that have the ability to shut down pedophiles. Meditate to give them the power and the strength and the courage to do their jobs and capture and turn in and imprison all pedophiles and people engaged in such activity. Meditate to give communities aware of these things the power to stand up and put and end to this. Meditate to give all of us the power to stand up and put an end to this.</p>

<p>In the end, you achieve the same effect of shutting down the darkness, but you do it by empowering the light against it, and you don&#39;t end up bringing in the darkness into your own sphere by wishing negativity and harm upon another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you guys should start a pedophile sub so we can get back to oh, say, any goddamn thing besides this absurd obsession with kiddie porn? It&#39;s like the sub is now run by actual pedophiles that get off on everyone else thinking about it all the time. It&#39;s fucking myopic and bizarre. </p>

<p>Seriously, this weird obsession is so far beyond gross it&#39;s crazy. Especially given that it&#39;s the primary way that the cabal has silenced it&#39;s whistleblowers for years. Are there threads here comparing and contrasting this new obsession with that technique, and the obvious problems of where this sub is now in light of that connection?</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re all going to do some sort of darkwork ritual disguised as benevolent meditation? I&#39;d love to hear from some other people that see through this new infatuation stuff too... way too obvious for the discerning old school regulars of this sub. </p>

Don&#39;t get offended, I had these feelings as well, trying to avoid any contact with the photos with the drugged-looking kid taped to the table for example. You get a deep fear that this stuff is somehow contagious and that the supra-elite have mastered the ways of activating the reptilian part of the human brain. But then I read about the HARM effect, where after you encounter evil, you start thinking that you&#39;re evil as well, or at least subconsciously completely motivated by dark instincts. This is a weird world nowadays, so complicated emotions are to be expected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m not looking to convince you one way or another.</p>

<p>But my point is; OP believes in using the power of mass will. So you already know that the OP believes in... less than logical things.</p>

<p>Scare tactics? Perhaps in some cases. Not in all. Just look at every person in a religion. </p>

<p>So assuming we take the occult at face value and assume they believe what they write... well in that case OP is trying to do some magick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you&#39;re being paranoid. The OP is using the powerful positive intention of group focused meditation which has been proven to work with over 50 scientific studies. Quit being paranoid about it and bringing the occult into this, it&#39;s not some dark harmful witch craft wuju Magic. It&#39;s positive group meditation.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re being paranoid. Seriously. Look more into the power of group meditation or at least further research into numerology because 11:11 is a powerful numerology number having nothing to do with negativity whatsoever.</p>

<p>So what if the word Mage is in the OP&#39;s name. Quit being negative about it. This is actual good and is something humanity needs, or you can be paranoid and fearful the OP is running a cult and get all weird about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re calling me paranoid on a conspiracy forum where you people are having a mass energy focus to take down a secret group of elitist pedophiles that the entire government and mainstream media is trying to protect because they are all also elitist pedophiles...</p>

<p>I know 11:11 is a powerful numerology number my friend, that is my point exactly. And numerology and focusing energy using numerology is spellcasting. It&#39;s magick.</p>

<p>And if you think that isn&#39;t the case then it is <em>you</em> who hasn&#39;t done enough/any research into the topic to debate it one way or another</p>

<p>So for the sake of transparency, people ought know what it is they&#39;re participating in. I wouldn&#39;t reckon any Christians lured in by the idea of a mass &quot;prayer&quot; would be so keen if they knew they were participating in a spell casting ritual.</p>

<p>Group meditation has been proven in over 50 studies as I&#39;ve already said. People aren&#39;t being lured into spell casting they are partaking in co-creation and meditating on a better world.</p>

<p>There are many different interpretations of it. In some cases, yes it is invoking deities. In other ones it is invoking the universe. I don&#39;t know what is the purpose because the OP will not explain the choice of numbers, however a few seconds of research will show you that the numbers were not just random. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are misrepresenting the idea of service to self and service to others.</p>

<p>Dark occult black magic is service to self and a distortion of power towards self and power over others.</p>

<p>What the OP is doing is service to others and falls in line with the law of one and the law of attraction, both universal laws of the universe.</p>

<p>Occult and spirituality don&#39;t mix, but they share similar foundations of understandings.</p>

<p>Occult is more tied into service to self, power over others, black magic, and distortions of reality.</p>

<p>Spirituality and new age principles tie into service to others, law of one, unity consciousness, and light, which is in harmony with creation and the creator itself.</p>

<p>Meditation has the potential to literally transform the world. In 1978, what is known as the “Maharishi Effect” took place when a group of 7000 individuals over the course of 3 weeks were meditating in hopes of positively effecting the surrounding city. They were able to literally transform the collective energy of the city which reduced global crime rates, violence, and casualties during the times of their meditation by an average of 16%. Suicide rates and automobile accidents also were reduced with all variables accounted for. In fact, there was a 72% reduction in terrorist activity during the times at which this group was meditation.</p>

<p>Almost 50 studies have been done further confirming the benefits of global meditation and it’s direct impact on everything in the world, even so far as to have the results published in the Journal of Crime and Justice in 1981. We know meditation has endless health and psychological benefits, but it is now being explored by politics and sociology because of its undeniable energetic impact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s numerology. I can tell you what it means in the occult. Doesn&#39;t mean I believe it.</p>

<p>The number 1 is masculine energy. The number 2 is feminine energy. </p>

<p>The number 11 equals the number 2. So it equals feminine energy. But it&#39;s manifested as two 1&#39;s. So it&#39;s the feminine energy manifested in a x2 masculine way. </p>

<p>You could switch out the words feminine and masculine for yin and yang.</p>

<p>The number 11 is the yin (darkness- in this context, it&#39;s the subconscious mind, that which dwells beneath the surface) manifested by double yang (aggression, action- bringing things to light)</p>

<p>aggression/action + subconscious = psychic energy. </p>

<p>That&#39;s like... the easiest way I can think of to explain it without getting too deep. Hope it makes some sense.</p>

<p>As for why you saw it. I don&#39;t know and only a charlatan would venture to guess. </p>

<p>A basic overview of The Middle Pillar exercise:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &#39;Middle Pillar&#39; Ritual</p>

<p>This meditation uses visualisation, centring on the kabbalistic &#39;Tree Of Life&#39;. This is not the time or place to go into kabbala in depth. (Do a search on &#39;kabbala&#39; and you can find lots more information on the internet). But in brief the &#39;aim&#39; of the ritual is the invocation of &#39;force&#39; into &#39;form&#39;- the implicit belief being the idea that &#39;reality&#39; exists on a number of different levels beyond the physical, and that the infinite source of energy that some would call &#39;god&#39; works &#39;down the planes&#39; (and &#39;up the planes). Kabbalah has it&#39;s origins in esoteric Judaism. </p>

<p>It&#39;s traditional among  Western kabbalists at least to do a &#39;banishing ritual&#39; before doing meditations of this kind. See &#39;<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Perform-the-Lesser-Banishing-Ritual-of-the-Pentagram">space clearing meditation</a>&#39; With a bit of practise you can do a &#39;banishing&#39; standing up and facing the four quarters in turn. This need not take more than 5 minutes or less. </p>

<p>Now find a comfortable position which will allow you to sit with a straight back for 20 minutes to half an hour. </p>

<p>Relax the body and allow your breath to become deep and regular. Only begin the visualisations proper when you&#39;ve really settled in to a calm and relaxed meditative state. </p>

<p>Now imagine or visualise a sphere of white light about the size of a tennis ball just above your head. Try and imagine this sphere as a very brilliant source of illumination in a dark space. This is the sphere known as Kether, which means &#39;the crown&#39;. As you imagine this, try and feel your way into the infinity that Kether represents. Explore the association of Kether with the vast scale of the Universe: infinite time and infinite space, -perfection. White light. Universal consciousness existing &#39;beyond&#39; and throughout everything. See if you can make the sphere glow more brightly with each exhalation. </p>

<p>Now imagine a purple sphere in the area of your throat. This is the sphere of Daath, which means &#39;knowledge&#39;. Try and maintain a sense of the connection here with a &#39;galactic&#39; scale -imagine looking down at the Milky Way galaxy from outside, for instance, while also feeling your way into the idea of &#39;force&#39; beginning to come down into &#39;form&#39;, from Kether to Daath, and from the white sphere above your head, in a shaft of whiteness down into the sphere at your throat. See if you can make the sphere glow more brightly with each exhalation of breath. </p>

<p>The next sphere is Tiphareth (or &#39;beauty&#39;), placed at your heart, and filled with golden yellow light. This is the sphere of the sun, at the centre of the solar system, just as the heart is also at the centre of your physical being. Visualise the sun pouring out energy to everything within the solar system. And visualise the tennis-ball-sized sphere of yellow light in the region of your heart with it&#39;s own healing energy, drawn down from the spheres above through the shaft of the &#39;middle pillar&#39; that connects each of these spheres. Other associations here are with what you might call &#39;higher self&#39;, the &#39;mental plane&#39; and &#39;the soul&#39;. (The words &#39;soul&#39; and &#39;solar&#39; are etymologically connected). This is the central intelligence of the system, the point of balance. Again try and visualise the sphere glowing more brightly with each outbreath. </p>

<p>Next we have Yesod, the foundation, a silver ball of light in the groin area. This is the sphere of instinct or emotional intelligence and it&#39;s connected with the moon, and with dreams, and what occultists might call the &#39;astral plane&#39;. Again, try and foster the sense of the energy coming down from Kether through each of the spheres, down the middle pillar to here. See if you can make the sphere glow again as you breathe, and see the energy going down yet further to </p>

<p>the sphere of Malkuth just below your feet. Malkuth translates as &#39;the kingdom&#39; and this is the sphere of the Earth, matter, the &#39;physical plane&#39;, and your actual physical body as a whole. The colours here are earth-colours: russet-browns, lime-greens and so on. Try and maintain the sense of the energy moving down the planes from Kether all the way to Malkuth, from the &#39;universal&#39; to the particular, down the middle pillar to the sphere of Malkuth beneath your feet and your phyical body. </p>

<p>Now imagine this energy broadening out into a spherical cocoon of yellow-orange light centred on the heart, and surrounding your entire body, extending some distance beyond the limits of your physical body. Relax, and let all parts of the system be integrated and energised. Let this happen of it&#39;s own accord without forcing anything too much. </p>

<p>OK. It&#39;s a good idea with a ritual meditation like this to end in a structured way, making sure that you ground yourself properly, by gradually returning to awareness of your physical body (as opposed to mental, astral, or etheric bodies). Energy that does no &#39;work&#39; remains only &#39;potential&#39; energy. It may also be useful to find your own way of ending a meditation like this with an internal &#39;intention&#39; such as &#39;let the fruit of this meditation, be stored for right usage in accord with the Tao, in this body. So let it be&#39;. Find a choice of words you feel comfortable with. And in your own time, come out of the meditation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve witnessed the power of will myself.. Some call it prayer whatever. But I have seen the results with my own eyes. Inconceivable coincidences that would not have happened in a normal atmosphere.</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly ask anyone if you are doubting and scoffing this. I swear it upon my daughters life that the power of WILL (aka willpower) is something the elites are terrified of and have been slowly sapping away from us for decades.</p>

<p>As a strong will breeds strong people who need nothing but the earth and each other to survive. I will join in and spread to others. </p>

<p>(creator) bless everyone regardless of knowledge level or personal views. Our earthly viewpoints are a result of a manufactured environment carefully crafted by TPTB. </p>

<p>It was coming to fruition and this is why the election went like this. People are subconsiously realizing we have been fed a load of horse shit for politicians for years. But now they truly understand how dangerous it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t meditate for harm to come upon others.  Doing so against even those that might deserve it (like pedophiles, for example) still is projecting negative energy upon another.  You&#39;re literally meditating <em>for</em> negative energy to be put upon another when you do that.  This  bounces the energy right back to you yourself and in the end creates more harm than good.</p>

<p>What should be done instead is to meditate toward the empowering of those who are harmed by the pedophiles.  In other words, don&#39;t meditate for harm to come on to others.  Meditate instead for strength to come upon those who need it in order to fend off anyone who might chose to harm them - to uplift and strengthen everyone who stands to be a victim; meditate toward giving light and power to everyone who might be harmed by pedophilia and its perpetrators.</p>

<p>In the end, you achieve the same effect by empowering the light <em>against</em> the darkness and you don&#39;t end up bringing in the darkness into your own sphere.</p>

Not saying that&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to spread <em>at all</em>, mind you.  I definitely feel that your intention is a good one.  I just want to make sure that we have a group of people meditating toward bringing everyone up above the darkness and killing the darkness <em>that</em> way instead of bringing in the darkness by meditating on &quot;taking someone out&quot;.</p>

<p>We can accomplish justice without bringing ourselves down to the level of darkness.  That&#39;s all.</p>

When I pray for a victim of violence and hate, I also pray for the perpetrator too. I have to, there is no other alternative for me. It&#39;s a more powerful point of view to hold. All of us here on earth suffer, we came here knowing we are going to suffer, that&#39;s just how it is. But we should stand in the middle, between mercy and severity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does not matter if you have never meditated before. Just pray or visualize what you want to see at the given time. Focus with a loving intention on a positive outcome for humanity, not about harming others.</p>

<p>You can also start practicing meditation a bit beforehand, here&#39;s how:

    <div class="md"><p>Proof for the positive affect of group meditation.</p>

<p>Thank you again OP for posting this! Glad to see this amount of awareness.</p>

<p><a href="http://in5d.com/proof-that-group-meditation-can-change-the-world/">http://in5d.com/proof-that-group-meditation-can-change-the-world/</a></p>

<p>Meditation has the potential to literally transform the world. In 1978, what is known as the “Maharishi Effect” took place when a group of 7000 individuals over the course of 3 weeks were meditating in hopes of positively effecting the surrounding city. They were able to literally transform the collective energy of the city which reduced global crime rates, violence, and casualties during the times of their meditation by an average of 16%. Suicide rates and automobile accidents also were reduced with all variables accounted for. In fact, there was a 72% reduction in terrorist activity during the times at which this group was meditation.</p>

<p>Almost 50 studies have been done further confirming the benefits of global meditation and it’s direct impact on everything in the world, even so far as to have the results published in the Journal of Crime and Justice in 1981. We know meditation has endless health and psychological benefits, but it is now being explored by politics and sociology because of its undeniable energetic impact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God has given us dominion and authority over this world. The fact that evil is alive and well in it is because we have so far allowed it to be so. He has always been hands off, working through the actions and requests of people. He is testing us and leading us to a point where we become worthy to inherit his power and the universe. Revelations is a chronicle of the time in the future were we develop the will and learn how to harness this authority to finally end this state of affairs. The day is coming, I give it no more than 30 years.</p>

<p>Events like these have power. The power to end evil. It is our birthright and the greatest gift ever given us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How to meditate: Simple meditation for beginners</p>

<p>This meditation exercise is an excellent introduction to meditation techniques.</p>

<pre><code>Sit or lie comfortably. You may even want to invest in a meditation chair.
Close your eyes.
Make no effort to control the breath; simply breathe naturally.
Focus your attention on the breath and on how the body moves with each inhalation and exhalation. Notice the movement of your body as you breathe. Observe your chest, shoulders, rib cage, and belly. Simply focus your attention on your breath without controlling its pace or intensity. If your mind wanders, return your focus back to your breath.
</code></pre>

<p>Maintain this meditation practice for two to three minutes to start, and then try it for longer periods.</p>

<p>We will be doing this meditation at the moment of the maximum of the Solar eclipse on Sunday, February 26th at 3:55 pm Central European Time (CET). This equals 4:55 pm EET in Cairo, 4:55 pm CAT in Bukavu in Congo, 2:55 pm GMT in London, 9:55 am EST in New York, 8:55 am CST in Chicago, 7:55 am MST in Denver, 6:55 am PST in Los Angeles, and 10:55 pm CST in Taipei.</p>

<p>For those who think it is hippy bs, you need to look into quantum physics and quantum mechanics. Start with watching &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know?&quot; Here is a quick bit from the documentary about how the human mind can affect random number generators.

<p>For those not sure how to meditate. Calm or Headspace are great apps. For Saturday, I recommend focusing on your breath. I will be using my mantra above -  the focus should be on exposing the crimes. For humanity to know the truth. That is what we truly want! Envision news articles of the truth coming out. Try to feel the emotions you would experience if the mass arrests took place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is brilliant!</p>

<p>in light of what the witches (seriously, is marina heading this up?) are planning to start Friday at midnight, we should start this up Friday at sundown by specifically praying/meditating the witches&#39; endeavor is turned back on their own heads and used against them in a way that helps the giants of pizzagate fall.</p>

<p>i would like to see this post back on the front page stickied until it&#39;s complete.</p>

<p>thank you so much for organizing this.</p>

Not saying that&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to spread <em>at all</em>, mind you.  I definitely feel that your intention is a good one.  I just want to make sure that we have a group of people meditating toward bringing everyone up above the darkness and killing the darkness <em>that</em> way instead of bringing in the darkness by meditating on &quot;taking someone out&quot;.</p>

<p>We can accomplish justice without bringing ourselves down to the level of darkness.  That&#39;s all.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t meditate for harm to come upon others. Doing so against even those that might deserve it (like pedophiles, for example) still is projecting negative energy upon another. You&#39;re literally meditating for negative energy to be put upon another when you do that and it makes you a beacon of darkness as you channel negative, dark energy through you when you think harmful thoughts upon another. This bounces the energy right back to you yourself and in the end creates more harm than good.</p>

<p>What should be done instead is to meditate toward the empowering of those who are harmed by the pedophiles. In other words, don&#39;t meditate for harm to come on to others. Meditate instead for strength to come upon those who need it the most in order to fend off anyone who might try to harm them. Uplift and strengthen everyone who stands to be a victim. Meditate toward giving light and power to everyone who might be harmed by pedophilia and its perpetrators. Meditate to empower all people, groups, etc, that have the ability to shut down pedophiles. Meditate to give them the power and the strength and the courage to do their jobs and capture and turn in and imprison all pedophiles and people engaged in such activity. Meditate to give communities aware of these things the power to stand up and put and end to this. Meditate to give all of us the power to stand up and put an end to this.</p>

<p>In the end, you achieve the same effect of shutting down the darkness, but you do it by empowering the light against it, and you don&#39;t end up bringing in the darkness into your own sphere by wishing negativity and harm upon another.</p>
