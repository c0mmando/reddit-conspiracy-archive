<p>i have no trouble with that at all, the system is that evil and we are trapped in it</p>

<p>and isis is backed by the cia and israel, who also did 911 and killed JFK (and the 1980 October surprise and control the drug trade in the United States and Afganistan)(why are you reading this right now if you haven&#39;t read/heard mark gortons essays, derrick jensens endgame and hypernormalization)</p>

<p>but for some reason these murderous, conniving masterminds of political economy continue to operate in such a way that allows for people like me to completely lay out their operations in public, and all they have to do is, menacingly, write a check box next to my name.</p>

<p>as long as they keep the giant bell curve of humanity from getting the same check box, they can let us live without releasing small pox or something similar.</p>

<p>this is what i believe, and why i don&#39;t have children, for whom i would have to fear for in the shadow of the things I have to say in public because of the size of my balls</p>

<p>we dont have to pick just one conspiracy, but we do have to always search for the deeper root that we can strike.</p>

<p>I believe both pizzagate and trump&#39;s obvious compromising relationship with russia, like the entire military and police force does not want the entire cia and nsa to have their activities opened to russia. And they aren&#39;t happy about sharing it with Israel, which is just as much a threat in the long term.</p>

<p>Why? because the last thing Israel and Russia and China want is a powerful United States, what they really want is that we slit each others throats.</p>

<p>So strike at the root, but if you think that happens to be the entire fucking other half of the country, that is going to be The Big Lie. As much as I want to think Soros is just funding anti-republican organizations because he has a big heart and cares about human rights, I know he stinks just as bad as Adelson and the Koch brothers.</p>

<p>They will sit back in the Azores and watch our race war on TeeVee watching their fortune double from the bets they made against us, if we are that idiotic.</p>

<p>Therefore, with that in mind: if you raise a gun at another American you better be goddamn sure of your reasoning, and I&#39;m looking at you, cops at DAPL and the upcoming protests in the inner city.</p>

<p>Keep your wits about you and remember, THERE IS NO URGENCY DRIVING THE NEED FOR REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE, OUR CIVILIZATION IS MORE STABLE THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN, DON&quot;T DESTROY WHAT IS WORKING AS A FORM OF PROTEST</p>

<p>For example, a place like r/conspiracy, which is a neat thing in the world. It&#39;s worth working and writing smart things here, even if it is owned by probable zionists and if everything we type here becomes part of some, menacing, AI singularity, the benefit we get from it is incredible, like nothing that has ever existed. The aforementioned murderous cabal want to ruin it, pretend it can&#39;t exist, corrupt it. But even if they end it here, we will make it somewhere else, then the next place.</p>

<p>Or they will win.</p>

<p>But I believe, but cannot prove, that the internet has onionified, censorship has become impossible, their only tool now is the reverse cargo cult, to make us give up, get us to believe, like the many &#39;oh r/conspiracy sux&#39; posters, that it&#39;s a waste of time.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the bottom line: They wouldn&#39;t be trying if it was.</p>

<p>That is all, for now.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys, you know I&#39;m in debt to this russian company for 500 million dollars, and I really want you to help me set something up for them where I get a percentage of all the drilling in the arctic, if I just, you know, give them them that entire territory to get myself out of debt&#39; </p>

<p>&#39;here are my tax returns, it&#39;s all there on paper.  and oh yeah, I&#39;m going to let the russians in on the entire national security council, because you know, Putin&#39;s actually a pretty cool guy.  He&#39;s going to help us make america great again&#39;</p>

<p>Yep - just as I suspected, a progressive who has nothing but contempt for working class Americans, all while hypocritically pretending to speak in their interests.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even like Trump all that much. If I was dictator of America, I&#39;d be deporting people like you first. Certainly the Founding Fathers had no use for anti-Americans like you.</p>

<p>The only decent thing Obama the CIA lackey ever did right was make peace with Iran and kind of stood up to the Zionist entity a little bit. Other than that, Obama was complete shit - and he was a life long CIA stooge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>right, i got that wrong, das kapital is what i was talking about, which is a complete takedown of capitalism, and it hasn&#39;t been refuted.  piketty&#39;s book is more correct, also not refuted, and proves that capitalism without socialist restraints is suicidal insanity that has nothing to do with efficient distribution of resources, or being the best system we have come up with, as i suspect someone like you might claim </p>

<p>you&#39;re also right im not a communist, i use all kinds of ideologies when they are correct but find any one of them taken as the only fundamental truth, like our society still does with capitalism 100 years after it has been proven to be a horrible basis of anything, to be really stupid. </p>

<p>which is what you believe, not much stupider you can get than that, believing something that has been known to be wrong for a 100 years</p>

<p>are you a flat earther too?  and i wonder where this hostility comes from, it&#39;s like you just appear out of nowhere, spout incoherent non-sequitur criticisms from a high horse</p>

    <div class="md"><p>right, i got that wrong, das kapital is what i was talking about, which is a complete takedown of capitalism, and it hasn&#39;t been refuted.  piketty&#39;s book is more correct, also not refuted, and proves that capitalism without socialist restraints is suicidal insanity that has nothing to do with efficient distribution of resources, or being the best system we have come up with, as i suspect someone like you might claim </p>

<p>you&#39;re also right im not a communist, i use all kinds of ideologies when they are correct but find any one of them taken as the only fundamental truth, like our society still does with capitalism 100 years after it has been proven to be a horrible basis of anything, to be really stupid. </p>

<p>which is what you believe, not much stupider you can get than that, believing something that has been known to be wrong for a 100 years</p>
