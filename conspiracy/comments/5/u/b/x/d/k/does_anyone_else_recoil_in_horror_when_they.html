       And please, don't demean yourself by making it sound like only Americans can be "easily manipulated". Fact is, public opinion anywhere can be easily manipulated by the people that own the media.

       I think places like Russia people still remember a lot of very negative experiences with government. The majority in Canada and the US still think that paying taxes is good, and the government is using that money to help you and pay for roads and schools and the government is your friend.

       Even though they are in the current spotlight the Sioux are just one of many Native tribes who have basically been given Casinos for their land, and future.  True native Americans are very very few and far between.

       I had an old friend call me out of the blue who I hadn't talked to in years, and he was woke to some of the deepest rabbit holes, stuff that I was scared to tell him about because he's religious (Greek Orthodox) about the god of the OT being a demiurge/demi-god/lower being and that the light at the end of the tunnel is trap

       It's mainly parroting of whatever talking line is on TV or Facebook, particularly the need to get to the bottom of the Russian thing which is the only reason Clinton lost. This is coupled with near constant ridicule of whatever the topic of the day is. Maybe one in ten say things like "well that would only legitimize him" and "that's why we need to resist" and "yeah he won't last long" every time his name comes up. And these are pretty normal people. No one around here has ever read wikileaks or thought about why Russia would even care enough to get involved. They don't know. They just know Trump is the worst thing ever and somehow gamed the elections and should be removed whatever the longer term consequences.

       I don't wanna say
       <em>
        indoctrination
       </em>
       (even tho it is), but this is largely a product of the way you're raised in American education. Only use "credible" sources. Major News Orgs are the only ones that can be cited along with the US gov, and they never lie. Science just means that whatever "scientists" say is right, is right. Maybe they'll skim over alternative theories but it's always framed as -- "oh, btw some people think something else happened than what the government said, but don't trust them they're all
       <em>
        crazy
       </em>
       conspiracy theorists." At least that was my experience.

       Yep, hence the "fake news" crisis since Alt-news has become the source that relies on data + documents gained with leaks + FOIA requests + paper trail on sketchy past government programs. MSM has become divorced with reality since they do not acknowledge this actual primary evidence, and instead reports on rumours while acting like they are credible ("an intelligence agent from your government said this, you must believe them").
      </p>
      <p>
       Alt-news frequently has terrible sources, hence the readers automatically need to have a sense of discernment/scrutiny to get anything out of them, so they never really care about reputation, they just care about the story by itself. MSM relies on NEVER BEING WRONG, hence they throw their reputation around like it's the only thing that matters and have stopped trying to actually back any stories up in reality. MSM viewers are led to follow the sources that are "most reputable" and since they always seek reputability, once they think they've found it they stop considering if something could be misrepresented.

       If it was JUST lies.... it's the slight misdirection, the tiny manipulations that are the most damaging.... like little worms boring into your brain undetected... It can be a word... a tone, an inflection.... very deceitful and effective.  Google Ron Paul being discussed by MSM.  they were very effective in keeping him looking insignificant.  Word choice, tone, inflection... even a few newscaster rolling their eyes after Paul spoke to indicate "another crazy idea".

       Yeah they really do a brilliant job of half way reporting stories. Slightly misinterpreting things on purpose. They also say shit in a way that IMPLIES one thing but gives them the wiggle room to come back and say they meant something else. Its all so dishonest and fucked up.

       Absolutely. This election clearly demonstrated that a significant portion of the voting public is willing to support perpetual oligarchy, so long as the figureheads blows sunshine up their asses. The fact that Clinton was the same as Bush, who was the same as Obama, is entirely lost on them.

       One way I like to Red pill people is to stop using phrases like this and quote the following numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only 19% of the population voted Clinton or Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people did not vote.  Those are the people that believe the two party system has failed.

       The old techniques of control are mapping quite well to the technology of the internet, and working just as well, and better. That's to be expected. What isn't expected (I believe) is the extension of human mind
       <em>
        into
       </em>
       the outputs of the dynamic amplification + inhibition control system, and the effect that has on the mind.

       Smart people are usually the easiest to manipulate.

      <p>
       They think they are too smart to get manipulated and let their guard down. Also, most mind fucks bypass the  rational thought centers of the brain. Intelligence doesn't matter when the primal fear buttons are being pushed.

       It's also good to think about what makes a person 'smart'. It's someone who, at some point in their early lives, felt like they weren't smart enough to the extent that they've spent their lives acquiring knowledge. Deep down, they remember that sense of humiliation of not knowing, or knowing the 'wrong thing'. Perhaps they were ridiculed for it, or at least perceived that they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       For these people, their smartness is their social acceptance. They're enough because they know the 'right answers'. That's why they're so susceptible to manipulation; because, you simply need to convince them that the consensus is X and they'll do everything they can to mirror, intelligently, that view.

       as someone looking from outside "america" I can say people is more easily manipulated when they are not social online, for one reason or another, not particularly just because the CIA is cool, but because if you only hear things from one person or news source you will be easily manipulated anywhere.

       No, because it makes sense.  You don't have to have an advanced degree in psychology to understand how easy it is to control a whole mass of people. Especially when you have had years to do so. The only thing that gets me, the most worked up, is the fact that you can see the two parties fighting over big stuff like abortion and gay rights. That gets people really mad and pissed off, but then nobody notices the two parties coming together to butt fuck the general public. But then again they don't show that kind of butt fucking on the news. So actually I'm not surprised at all.

       Yes, but you have to realize that there is no way for ANY of us to check and confirm all of these stories that are happening all over the world. Hell, there is no way for me to check what is happening in NYC or LA as I do not live there. You either have to sorta trust the alt-media to eventually bring out the truth, or only trust what you see with your own eyes.

       We are all vulnerable to subtle manipulation. However, when we understand how it works, we perceive it more consciously and then it has far less power to manipulate us. So, perhaps we should educate ourselves and others on the methods that are used, so that the methods become less effective and our species becomes less vulnerable to manipulation. Think of it as updating antivirus signature files. It immunizes against infiltration.

       I can argue and show them information from 1st hand sources until the point they are left in a state of complete cognitive dissonance where they cannot deny the things I have shown them, and they will turn around an hour later and repeat the same stupid shit I JUST SHOWED THEM they were wrong about.
