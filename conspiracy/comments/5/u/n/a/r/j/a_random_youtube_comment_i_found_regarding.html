       James Alefantis, you are a businessperson in a high profile position in your community, and you posted on publicly accessible social media, for the world to see: many many 'jokes' and references to graphic sexual acts, 'cum,' images with sexual nudity, images with two guys clearly engaging in homosexual fellatio taken from pornography with a slice of pizza photoshopped over a man's penis, references and 'inside jokes' about the walk-in cooler being a #killroom, photos of private parties which were then publicly shared for the world to see of party-goers covered in 'blood' wearing thongs and rolling around on the floor directly underneath the same ping-pong tables that you want kids to come play at with the hashtag #sex added, 'jokes' posted about #cumpanda and #cumhole with a photo of plastic toys inside a red painted tire, repeated photos which you may have thought were kitsch but were of a graphic sexual nature and were posted to market your restaurant.  BUT you posted these things alongside many photos of babies and small children.  YOU did, no one else, but YOU.  YOU painted a degenerate scenario which may be fine for adults, but when combined with what you were trying to market your establishment as being (wholesome and child-friendly) resulted in people wondering: what the hell you were thinking?
      </p>
      <p>
       And beyond that, what the hell were you doing?  Don't blame others for this--YOU created this, no one else.  The social media posts that people have pounced upon are one sexual image and sexual text after another.  They were not one-off jokes, but a repeating pattern that created an image of YOU and your environment as being hyper-sexualized and reveling in the types of dirty jokes that are construed as being degenerate and definitely NOT family and child appropriate.  They are juvenile at best, and disturbing at worst.  All of this is bad enough, but when the same three logo signs released by the FBI as coded signifiers used by the pedophile community are to be found prominently displayed on the front of three businesses located within yards of each other on the same block, incorporated into the logos of these businesses on menus, websites, and signage--people see this and again wonder what the hell are you thinking, and what the hell are you doing?  Coincidence?  Maybe they are completely coincidental, but what an outrageous coincidence, what are the odds that three businesses on the same block use these logos?  A zillion to one?  So add that to the social media that YOU put out there, and yes, people have flipped out.  But don't blame THEM, or try to act like they are crazy.  You are an adult, and you should have been circumspect, shown some restraint and dignity, and had the good sense to realize that overtly sexual content in post after post, when juxtaposed with small children featured online in your restaurant, was INAPPROPRIATE.  Does Hooters market themselves as family-friendly and base their business on breasts--AND children's entertainment?  Does a strip club that hosts private parties also have a playground and jungle-gyms in their buildings?  Would the average person find something like that freaking insane?  You could have set your posts to private to share amongst your friends and co-workers.  You could have made it clear that while you and your circle might have a gay/kitsch/provocative/dirty sense of humour and shared jokes, that they should have respected the business and kept them off and away from anything to do with the ping-pong and birthday parties for kids.  This is common sense, and YOU failed to use it.  Host drag acts, have private parties, do whatever you want--it is your business.  But put it together in your mind that you are also claiming to be a family-friendly establishment where babies are welcome and little kids are running around, and the two things do not mix.  Surely you realize how sensitive it is to most people--adult sexuality and small children--and by now you've seen what people were shocked by and pulled from your wide open social media accounts.  Use your fucking head and get your act together.   But don't dare blame others for causing a freak out and don't dare imply that they are the crazy ones.ï»¿

       He has no choice. If he acts suspicious or incriminating it wouldn't look good for him but he also thinks he's untouchable which you can tell by his body language.

       I give him props for his acting, but he still has many questions to answer.

       He has no choice in how he appears. Yes he didn't have to give a guided tour or even approach these men, what I'm saying is he has no choice in his act and has to be careful how he appears.

       I'm sure other redditors have questions but here's some of mine
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         what does the photo mean of you and the child with the hash tag "chickenlover" which has been declassified by the FBI as a code name for boy lover
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         why does your name mean young lover in French
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         why does your statue you had as a display photo on your Instagram page depict a statue made after a guy that loved young children?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         why is there another photo of a young baby on a hammock and you standing nearby with the caption #whatwhatinthebutt
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         why do you invite grotesque bands that's art revolve around pedophilia into your "family friendly restaurant" even though they display themes of violence, crude behavior, hyper sexualization, and pedophile insignia?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         why did you personally threaten and harass the fellow that was talking to you about Pegasus museum? You personally attacked him and threatened him and his family. Why did you do that?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Those are just a few of my questions and I'm sure others have more.

       From what i've seen, the sexual imagery posted online is from after hour and when children aren't present.

       Before it was set to private on 11/7/2016, public activity was dominated with references to obscene art, sexual activity, in combination with images of children, joined by derogatory/sexually suggestive commentary from various users. Some posts are evidence of the ties between James Alefantis and prominent figures.

       James Alefantis used the term #chickenlovers which is slang for a homosexual attracted to young male children in this Instagram post. The New York Times intentionally ignored this and other very damaging Instagram posts which contain obvious references to pedophilia/pederasty.

       Great write up! Very common sense and to the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one actually knows if the whole pizza gate thing is true, but no one can say it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       This write up puts it perfectly in perspective as to why people have a suspicion. It's all very common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't know what the truth is, but to everyone out there who has an opinion, the people who say pizza gate is false are just as bad as those who say it's true. No one knows, but based on Alefantis actions and his known connections, it's not crazy to have a suspicion

       Exactly!

      <p>
       I've been on the side lines watching this and it's obvious there's some suspicious things going on but it's sickening how quick people want to shut this down because "there's no victims" that's such dangerous thinking and if anything an open investigation needs to take place, especially after James threatened someone.

       This response was very level headed and strikes on all the points people are scratching their heads over, which is why I wanted to share.

       I might talk a lot of shit and act all angry on here sometimes, but I am really not, I am always willing to go way too far giving people the benefit of the doubt, or try to put myself in their shoes to excuse the things they do that are bad. But, it doesn't work with this stuff. I just can't find even the most outside hypothetical context where this would fit with inside joking. It is mean spirited, and almost aggressive(?), like they want us to know what it is.
