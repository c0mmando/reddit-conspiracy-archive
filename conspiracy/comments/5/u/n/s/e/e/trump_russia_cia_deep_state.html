       To recap:
      </p>
      <p>
       The war on terror has been an excuse for the US, with Israel and Saudi Arabia's coordination to wipe out countries that A) don't have central banks, B) have oil not controlled by OPEC or sell their oil for currency other than the dollar, C) have abundant mineral resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was prompted by the heavily coordinated events of those countries, which resulted in the terror attacks of 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton foundation was key in setting up and granting contracts for oil, mining, and child care, and moving that money through HSBC and through military contractors. Meanwhile Dyncorp, a major military contractor set up policing and underground trafficking operations  for opium, organs, children, and sex using the CIA. With every country invaded, terror cells have been set up and trained, I.E. the countries in Trumps travel ban list.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe this, Russia is an obvious scapegoat to get Trump out before he guts the deep state and takes out the Military Industrial Complex.  The Military Industrial Complex exists as long as the US is campaigning for the "War on Terror" - it's driven by the  Continuity of Government, an emergency government function that supersedes the constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this is driven by the UN's 2030 Agenda, which use to be called Agenda 21, which was motivated by a report in 1980 called the Global 2000. The Global 2000 report urged the population to be significantly decreased and the earth's resources controlled.
      </p>

       Only the redditors of
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/">

       can defend Trump's character, but he really is the only hope the US (if not the world) has for getting shit straightened out.

       Malthus lost a fortune when he'd been part of the panic selling of British bonds caused by Nathan Rothschild convincing the traders that Napolean had won.
      </p>
      <p>
       Malthus was the founder of Malthusian economics; population will outstrip resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been reasserted by many major players in more recent history with the Rockefellers creating the Population Council, funding Ehrlich's work, work in birth control and eugenics.

       The sooner this sub can get away from the Clinton, Bush, Trump circle jerk and come to the realization that they are all pawns to the same major players the better. If we could focus all our efforts on the global elite instead of the low hanging fruit the sooner shit will get done. I reject nationalism and the amount of unchecked nationalism in this sub is just plain ridiculous.

       I am not exactly a "nationalist" minded person. I don't see any reason to worship a piece of dirt I happen to be occupying at the moment. Or some colored cloth that represents that patch of dirt.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I am kinda pro-nationalism right now because of the power of its unifying force. People need to be together more right now than they ever have before, and that is a framework upon which some unification is possible. We are at eachother's throats so bad right now, anything that would improve that is alright. The more we argue the more they win.

       Agree with above posts. But why do you think Trump is any different? Why do you think he is waging a war on DS actors? I am going to read your previous post later, but at a quick glance it doesn't tell me either.

       I'm still skeptical of Trump and of what he can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think his craziness might be his biggest asset, because it potentially disorients his enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       He aligned himself early on with Gingrich who's largely criticized Agenda 21, Robert Kennedy who knows there's something up with Vaccines (and probably population control), and Bannon (I question that guy a lot too) who's aware of all the things Andrew Breitbart knew about shady Whitehouse activity. Also, Trump eats McDonalds, so he has no idea his government has a continuous initiative to trying and slowly kill him like the rest of the elite.

       I think if we can all agree that something horrible is happening then we should be able to get together as a global community to expose it. We don't need flags to do that and we don't need unfettered devotion to leadership that would downplay our rights to demonstrate that we don't approve acts of atrocity that take place in our name and with our blood soaked tax dollars.

       In an ideal world I would agree with you. But the world we got is run on symbolism. Or I should say it is easier to manage large groups of people with symbols rather than dry logic.

       The Nation is a collective of the tribes though, perhaps it varies from some points of view, but nationalism to me is the people of my country and the desire for them to still have their sovereign rights to independence and freedom, two things the Deep State and the Globalist are hell bent on taking. Maybe you see it differently, but I don't mind a little nationalism towards these bastards.

       What other alternative do you envision to a globalist, one-world-government, or is that your preference?  Having one unified power over the whole planet rather than multiple competing powers that keep each other in check sounds rather totalitarian and short-sided to me.  NWO is how you enslave the world.

       Lol, no man. I was commenting on the fact that that phrase actually means something right now. Nothing should supersede the constitution, and yet here we are.

       What the fuck... I get it now. A few years ago I blew off Agenda 21 because it sounded nuts, but through my personal life experiences (and you guys, thank you so much) I've realized that you don't need to control other people. You don't know what's best for them, unconditional love with boundaries of protecting yourself is where it's at. But so much of the entertainment industry puts out bullshit ideals on how people should be in their personal relationships, and this factor helps justify their agenda to the public. They seriously created a bubble for people to live in so their work as individuals will go towards the main goal of these agendas.

       It makes sense now why they don't care about investing in human capital to keep up with technological advancement, it makes sense why cannabis is a schedule 1 drug while pharmaceuticals, alcohol, and cigarettes are legal and kill you. So much makes sense now. Fuck this, those dumb fucking idiots. They think they have all of the answers to continue human beings, but they're too deluded to see past their own ethnocentrism.

       Every president since Reagan(at least) has been involved with CIA. What's trumps connection to the Deep State? His uncle that analyzed Tesla's research.
