        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To recap:</p>

<p>The war on terror has been an excuse for the US, with Israel and Saudi Arabia&#39;s coordination to wipe out countries that A) don&#39;t have central banks, B) have oil not controlled by OPEC or sell their oil for currency other than the dollar, C) have abundant mineral resources.</p>

<p>It was prompted by the heavily coordinated events of those countries, which resulted in the terror attacks of 9/11.</p>

<p>The Clinton foundation was key in setting up and granting contracts for oil, mining, and child care, and moving that money through HSBC and through military contractors. Meanwhile Dyncorp, a major military contractor set up policing and underground trafficking operations  for opium, organs, children, and sex using the CIA. With every country invaded, terror cells have been set up and trained, I.E. the countries in Trumps travel ban list.</p>

<p>If you believe this, Russia is an obvious scapegoat to get Trump out before he guts the deep state and takes out the Military Industrial Complex.  The Military Industrial Complex exists as long as the US is campaigning for the &quot;War on Terror&quot; - it&#39;s driven by the  Continuity of Government, an emergency government function that supersedes the constitution.</p>

<p>All of this is driven by the UN&#39;s 2030 Agenda, which use to be called Agenda 21, which was motivated by a report in 1980 called the Global 2000. The Global 2000 report urged the population to be significantly decreased and the earth&#39;s resources controlled.</p>

<p>Only the redditors of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/">The_Donald</a> can defend Trump&#39;s character, but he really is the only hope the US (if not the world) has for getting shit straightened out.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll talk about The Illuminati later...</p>

<p>Malthus lost a fortune when he&#39;d been part of the panic selling of British bonds caused by Nathan Rothschild convincing the traders that Napolean had won.</p>

<p>Malthus was the founder of Malthusian economics; population will outstrip resources.</p>

<p>This has been reasserted by many major players in more recent history with the Rockefellers creating the Population Council, funding Ehrlich&#39;s work, work in birth control and eugenics. </p>

If we could focus all our efforts on the global elite instead of the low hanging fruit the sooner shit will get done. I reject nationalism and the amount of unchecked nationalism in this sub is just plain ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not exactly a &quot;nationalist&quot; minded person. I don&#39;t see any reason to worship a piece of dirt I happen to be occupying at the moment. Or some colored cloth that represents that patch of dirt.</p>

<p>That said, I am kinda pro-nationalism right now because of the power of its unifying force. People need to be together more right now than they ever have before, and that is a framework upon which some unification is possible. We are at eachother&#39;s throats so bad right now, anything that would improve that is alright. The more we argue the more they win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still skeptical of Trump and of what he can do.</p>

<p>I think his craziness might be his biggest asset, because it potentially disorients his enemies.</p>

<p>He aligned himself early on with Gingrich who&#39;s largely criticized Agenda 21, Robert Kennedy who knows there&#39;s something up with Vaccines (and probably population control), and Bannon (I question that guy a lot too) who&#39;s aware of all the things Andrew Breitbart knew about shady Whitehouse activity. Also, Trump eats McDonalds, so he has no idea his government has a continuous initiative to trying and slowly kill him like the rest of the elite.</p>

<p>What other alternative do you envision to a globalist, one-world-government, or is that your preference?  Having one unified power over the whole planet rather than multiple competing powers that keep each other in check sounds rather totalitarian and short-sided to me.  NWO is how you enslave the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck... I get it now. A few years ago I blew off Agenda 21 because it sounded nuts, but through my personal life experiences (and you guys, thank you so much) I&#39;ve realized that you don&#39;t need to control other people. You don&#39;t know what&#39;s best for them, unconditional love with boundaries of protecting yourself is where it&#39;s at. But so much of the entertainment industry puts out bullshit ideals on how people should be in their personal relationships, and this factor helps justify their agenda to the public. They seriously created a bubble for people to live in so their work as individuals will go towards the main goal of these agendas. </p>

<p>It makes sense now why they don&#39;t care about investing in human capital to keep up with technological advancement, it makes sense why cannabis is a schedule 1 drug while pharmaceuticals, alcohol, and cigarettes are legal and kill you. So much makes sense now. Fuck this, those dumb fucking idiots. They think they have all of the answers to continue human beings, but they&#39;re too deluded to see past their own ethnocentrism. </p>

<p>Wow. </p>
