I believe they pushed her out because she was concerned about Flynn back in January. Trump was not concerned, for reasons that I won&#39;t speculatehere, UNTIL the news came out to the public. The furiousness of the &quot;leak&quot; is misdirection. You would have been furious about it before we all found out.  He&#39;s tweeting about classified documents like he&#39;s mad that we know now because the information was classified aka free ticket to lie. His ticket was taken and he threw Flynn, who he has been keeping safe from being reprimanded, under the bus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how he was pushed out after two years. Why didnt they do it then in 2015? He resigned because of the lie I believe. Either that or to help Trump save face he took blame.  I&#39;m just drawing similar lines of conversation between the situations to promote similar discussion. If He&#39;s being pushed out she could have too if your evidence is the persons viewpoints and other people not liking them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s provably false. Judges can act however they like, it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re right. Here&#39;s the law bc I know you&#39;ve never actually read it, tell me what part of it Trump broke:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(f) <strong>Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.</strong> Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attorney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United States (including the training of personnel in such detection), the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all aliens transported to the United States by such airline.</p>
