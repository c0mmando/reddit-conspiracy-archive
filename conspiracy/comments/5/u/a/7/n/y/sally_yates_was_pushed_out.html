       I've seen plenty posts claiming Flynn was pushed out due to his views and actions. Why is it not being discussed that Yates might have been as well? Its obvious she was pushed out due to disloyalty to the Trump administration. 
I believe they pushed her out because she was concerned about Flynn back in January. Trump was not concerned, for reasons that I won't speculatehere, UNTIL the news came out to the public. The furiousness of the "leak" is misdirection. You would have been furious about it before we all found out.  He's tweeting about classified documents like he's mad that we know now because the information was classified aka free ticket to lie. His ticket was taken and he threw Flynn, who he has been keeping safe from being reprimanded, under the bus.

       It's public knowledge that she refused to move forward on the whole immigration ban. Rather than do something illegal, she refused and was let go. Pretty controversial situation, but not secret.
       <br/>
       I don't see the connection to how Flynn was pushed out by the intelligence mafia bosses, though.

       I don't see how he was pushed out after two years. Why didnt they do it then in 2015? He resigned because of the lie I believe. Either that or to help Trump save face he took blame.  I'm just drawing similar lines of conversation between the situations to promote similar discussion. If He's being pushed out she could have too if your evidence is the persons viewpoints and other people not liking them.

       Okay that's new to me. But I was going off info from a post of documents from 2015. If he was already handled for that it had no factor here. Which was another point of my post, that that time frame and this event are likely unrelated.

       As I understand it, the ban isn't illegal.

      <p>
       Certain judges have said it was unconstitutional, and now it needs to be decided by (supreme?) court whether it is or not.

       </a>
       , that is not an argument for this topic. If the AG won't defend Trump's order then he has every right to put in place someone who will. If she didn't agree with the order, she could've resigned.

       Jesus, this is why liberals shouldn't be in charge of public education. Say it with me now: The constitution doesn't apply to people who aren't citizens of this country. It's not unconstitutional anyways, law clearly states the president can ban any class of aliens from the country he or she deems inadmissible. It's been used multiple times in recent history by democratic presidents.

       That's provably false. Judges can act however they like, it doesn't mean they're right. Here's the law bc I know you've never actually read it, tell me what part of it Trump broke:

       <p>
        (f)
        <strong>
         Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.
        </strong>
        Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attorney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United States (including the training of personnel in such detection), the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all aliens transported to the United States by such airline.

        <strong>
         Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.
        </strong>
        Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attorney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United States (including the training of personnel in such detection), the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all aliens transported to the United States by such airline.

       I have, the judgement doesn't reference any law at all and you know that's true if you've actually read it.  It's literally all based on his own opinion, that's why it's pure obstructionist bullshit.

       Never said he broke any law. Just said it was ruled against, which is a fact. And on record. Not from the Supreme Court but a court nonetheless. If it was clear cut he would have won there as well as the Supreme Court and any other court

       Because people are motivated by their politics? Because people get things wrong? Because he knew he had the support of the establishment media and his colleagues in dark blue Seattle?

       Not what I'm saying. I'm saying those powers can clearly be debated depending on the form of their implementation. Clearly its a power he has but he clearly used it wrong because clearly if things were done right nobody would be able to question him using it. That's what I'm saying. Not saying its unlawful, just that he did it how he wanted to and everyone doesn't agree with that. Sally was one person who didn't feel that was the way to use that power. Those select judges who don't seem to matter don't agree either.  The Supreme Court may! But there is also the chance they won't agree either, if there was no chance it wouldnt even make it there.

       Their you are making that claim again. You are literally saying "because he saw a problem with Trump's EO the EO must be unlawful", it's demonstrably false and I already proved it to you. A judge can rule on a law based on his own personal opinions and they do it all the time

       What are you even saying? Nothing has to be "in front" of him, he can literally just declare it illegal. Trump could of said fuck you I'm going to keep doing this see you at the supreme court, but he chose to respect it.

       That's what I'm afraid of and the point of this post. Thanks for that insight. I'm more in the middle on most of these things here. I don't discount stuff unless it doesn't make any sense. I'm just spurring conversation from both sides, similar conversation. If it can be said that Flynn was pushed out we can discuss the possibility of others being done similar.

       "Found unlawful" but one judge. It's being fought in court and Trump will win. Here's the damn law, just read it for yourself:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (f)
        <strong>
         Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.
        </strong>
        Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attorney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United States (including the training of personnel in such detection), the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all aliens transported to the United States by such airline.

       They needed a reason. Her refusal to uphold the ban gave them a reason they could use. I said the same thing about Flynn yesterday and someone responded to me "because its the cia"

       Yes, you literally commented:

        4-4 split along party lines means the lower court ruling holds

      <p>
       When was there ever a 4-4 split on this issue? When was this EO brought into the supreme court? You're making shit up and you know it.

       I agree with you. Never disagreed. Only disagreeing about what you're saying I'm saying. Because I don't feel like I'm saying that.
