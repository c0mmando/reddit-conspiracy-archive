        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">52</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/applextrent.html">applextrent</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Been tracking the Oroville dam situation since someone mentioned it here on r/conspiracy about 3 days before the evacuation on Sunday. At a press conference about 20 minutes ago they just lifted the evacuation order, but there&#39;s a massive storm front moving into the area Wednesday night, that should bring near continuous rain to the area for at least <a href="https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/USCA0818:1:US">7-days according to current 10-day predictions</a>. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/qci1D">Forecasted weather for Thursday</a>.</p>

<p>They&#39;re attempting to lower the dam level by 50ft before the next storm hits, but so far have only lowered it about 12-15ft. They&#39;re lowering the lake at about 5-inches per hour right now. It will start raining around midnight tomorrow night.</p>

<p>The river below the dam is already near capacity, and is flooding near the tops of levees down stream as much as 25-miles away at Yuba City.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m not a construction or weather expert, I&#39;ve been fascinated by weather prediction since I was a child and have gotten pretty good at understanding weather forecasts. It is absolutely going to rain considerably in that area in the next 7-days, and given the temperature of the storm front it will be rain, and not snow in the mountains nearby. Which means the runoff from the surrounding areas will feed into the dam eventually and create another situation like the one that caused the evacuation in the first place.</p>

<p>At this point if the dam reaches capacity again and the emergency spillway has to be used, the odds of the spillway failing is significant. Meanwhile, the fact the river is already near max capacity for the levees means there will be flooding simply from the upcoming storm front alone. So even if the dam and spillways hold, there will still be a significant probability of flooding in the area.... yet they just lifted the evacuations despite knowing all of this.</p>

<p>What the hell is going on?</p>

<p>The evacuation was the right call, they safely got everyone out of the area. Why the hell would they lift the evacuation with less than 36-hours before the next storm front? Are they seriously setting this up to be a false flag type event?</p>

<p>The original predictions from r/conspiracy claim the spillway is a distraction, and the dam itself is failing. I haven&#39;t seen or heard any evidence for this claim, but it is clear from the visuals that the spillway alone is enough of a risk to maintain an evacuation until at least next week. If the dam can hold during this next storm front then things will probably be okay and they should have time to make repairs after this next storm front, but if the dam reaches capacity and the spillway fails Oroville will be under about 100ft of water.</p>

<p>Edit: Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/w/1yNGaPDowWbKj">video footage from someone on Periscope</a> who went to the dam tonight. If you look at his earlier videos he was at Yuba City earlier where the river was at capacity. Based on his footage they&#39;re still actively trying to repair the dam. Not sure how they can tell people it is safe when they&#39;re still scrambling to fix it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100 feet of water?? just imagined that and wow.</p>

<p>anyway yeah this has been weird, i thought a main reason for the evacuation order was that there was a lot more precipitation anticipated mid-week. does this mean people have to leave evac shelters? been following it too, but found it difficult to get an idea of consensus, so appreciate you making this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe evacuation centers will remain open, at least I hope they do. While I understand possibly do a temporary stay of the evacuation order for a 24-hour window, lifting it completely like this is insanity. There&#39;s maybe 36-hours until rain again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in the area. Considering the pending storms, I&#39;m stunned the evacuation order was lifted. I cannot imagine the massive clusterfuck if they reissue the evacuation order within a day or two. And if the spillway or dam fails, well...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m only in the Sacramento area (an hourish away from oriville and other evacuated areas) and there have been mudslides blocking the highways and city floods due to the heavy almost daily rain showers. We are due for a multi day storm on Thursday so I have no idea why they are pulling people out of the evacuation! I am experiencing some of this first hand, and I do not agree with what the media is telling us. It has been raining so heavy that I&#39;m not comfortable with anyone in my family driving to the store. Californians don&#39;t know how to drive in the rain because we aren&#39;t used to it so it&#39;s caused a few highway deaths. how are we supposed to handle mass floods from a dam breaking if we can&#39;t handle rain?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in San Francisco myself, but grew up in the North Bay and have family in the central valley and exactly this. Basically the entire state is at capacity right now, and the ground is still swollen. Any additional rain is going to cause flooding and landslides, and they&#39;ve now flooded the rivers to take pressure off the dam. The rivers won&#39;t be able to sustain both 5-7 days of rain, and 100cfs of water coming out of the spillway at the same time.</p>

<p>This winter reminds me a lot of the 1997/1998 winter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a few theories floated.</p>

<p>1) This is to become a distraction from pending arrests coming from pi$$agate.</p>

<p>2) It is to turn California into a red state. California has been predominately Democrat, and the Democrat&#39;s have been completely ignoring the state infrastructure but instead spending money on all kinds of weird social justice influenced policies (although we still have a huge prison population). This area is already Republican, but the aftermath and inefficiency of the Dems currently in power might lead the rest of the state to swing. If California goes red, the Trump era Republicans will be in power for a very long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the weather forecast for Thursday: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/qci1D">http://imgur.com/a/qci1D</a> </p>

<p>The little tiny indicator is Oroville. The problem isn&#39;t necessarily how much rain Oroville gets directly but how much goes into the mountains that feed into the dam. That&#39;s the real concern here. The more rain those mountains get the more likely the dam will flood, and the emergency spillway will erode and fail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched the live briefing and things don&#39;t add up. They are now claiming that erosion will not compromise the emergency spillway or the dam. No one had addressed the rivers are already near flood level. You can check this weather.com for the areas. This dam sits at foothill of the sierras which already has melting snow. I have an evacuee staying with me and they will wait to see how this all holds up after the series of rains before going back. We were told if  anyone is going back to gas up now because we were told many of the surrounding towns are low on gas and supplies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what worries me. The media is completely ignoring the fact the rivers already at capacity. I was watching someone on Periscope early this morning and Yuba City is nearly flooded over the levees. They&#39;ve maybe got 3-5ft to spare before major flooding.</p>

<p>Even 4-inches of rain is enough to cause flooding, and mudslides. Meanwhile, if they continue to empty the dam the flooding will just get worse and risk taking out bridges which could trap people. They did the right thing by evacuating when they did, but this is the wrong move letting people back in now. I could have understood a temporary get in/out order for 24 hours, but the smart thing is to evacuate again by tomorrow night.</p>

<p>Thursday and Friday are going to be an absolutely mess even if the dam holds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to play down the apparent idiocy of lifting that evac order, but the coming rain is really quite minuscule compared to what got the dam in its situation. The rain will last a very short time </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a long time lurker and never have posted but this one hits home, and have a few things to point out...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This is a holiday weekend.  This is one of if not the busiest weekend of winter travel to and from the mountains from the bay area.  Local passes are blacked out so it drives more traffic east as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Listed on here was a prediction of an earthquake in this region within the near future due to the earth quakes in Alaska and Mexico.</p></li>
<li><p>Today was 50 degrees with considerable snow melt along with tomorrow temps a bit cooler but still in the 40s. The storm on Thursday morning here will start as rain below 8000&#39; and get to 6k&#39; by midday according to a local meteorologist.  Luckily this will be a mostly snow event for the mountains 4-6&quot; of precip thru tuesday i believe , but that still means alot of rain a bit more west down the hill at the damn.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The traffic this year has been unreal even on non holiday weekends due to the good snow. Also the snow seems to always fall for the kooks on the weekend!  That&#39;s the real conspiracy.  </p>

<p>Anyways, this weekend could be a scary mess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there&#39;s something worse. The media is absent. </p>

<p>Why can a guy on Periscope live stream major events and there is no other media around? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a total media black out and the media just keeps showing either drone or helicopter footage that is either not live, or never zooms out to show you how swollen the river is. It&#39;s the subtle things they aren&#39;t showing or saying that don&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>I really want to be wrong about this one, but if these weather predictions hold that dam will likely reach capacity again within the next few days to a week and that emergency spillway or the primary spillway might fail. </p>
