<p>Our mantra should be to think critically, don&#39;t believe something because you want it to be true. Stop blindly acceptting &quot;conspiracies&quot; because the media tells us there true.</p>

<p>No this sub isn&#39;t overrun with T_D or politics, it&#39;s being overrun with people who can&#39;t or simply refuse to think critically enough to come up with a conclusion themselves. Don&#39;t rely on anyone else to tell you your own opinion. See all the sides and make your own conclusions.</p>

<p>Edit: Just want to add an emphasis on blindly. If you think critically and find the &quot;news&quot; whatever site that is to be true, that&#39;s a good thing, that&#39;s what I am suggesting. It&#39;s the people that blindly follow the herd who think, &quot;well the news is saying it&#39;s true so I agree,&quot; that&#39;s the dangerous type of thinking I am referring to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, not really. See my other comment I describe what I meant. And as for advocating the MSM&#39;s credibility, that would be silly because that&#39;s simply too broad a term to have much meaning to me. Do MSM actors spin shit to suit their narrative? Of course. Do they have some amount of integrity in reporting facts? I think so. I think the hyper partisan MSM elements try to spin editorials as fact and work off shaky sources in order to further whatever agenda they are pushing. At the same time, I don&#39;t think all news outlets tell you what to think. In my mind NPR News (only the section of the broadcasts that say &quot;This is NPR News,&quot; not the entirety of the programming on an NPR station) has a good way of presenting both sides&#39; take on an issue and doesn&#39;t force an opinion. All in all I think its way more complicated than just &quot;MSM are all lying&quot; because what else is left? Bloggers? I don&#39;t know the answers to all this shit obviously. Just my two cents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think &quot;all MSM is probably lying&quot; is the smartest position to work from. Their credibility right now is just shot out for me. And NPR was my favorite radio station until a few months ago. Because I take in information from so many sources, they just started sounding as partisan as FOX. They just use voicing that is calmer and more reasoned sounding, but they really are just as crazy as the rest imho.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t point at anything and call it credible. I take an impression from the aggregate of sources, which has its own problems obviously, and work backwards to try to make determinations from that.</p>

<p>But I think the OP is absolutely on point here. If you are posting MSM sources as fact on this sub, you are doing it wrong. Because our MSM right now is out to get us like I have never seen before. And until that changes in some significant way we can all agree on, they have no place here. I am almost more inclined to believe bullshit like beforeitsnews.com or whatever than FOX/NBC/ABC/CNN/BBC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Threads like this make me laugh.  Where do you get your information from then?  How do you know anything is going on around you without seeing it and hearing it for yourself?</p>

<p>Being totally anti-media is counterproductive, not just logically, but because there is no better ammunition against the mainstream than mainstream sources, and the media beats the dog shit out of the government - at some level - on pretty much a daily basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point isn&#39;t even about being anti-media, it&#39;s pro-critically thinking. </p>

<p>This includes asking yourself questions about the news including what is the author&#39;s intention, what lens is this site looking at this even through? Is it possible that the owner of this company might have a political agenda? You might see &quot;news,&quot; or &quot;facts,&quot; but I see a message being conveyed with a certain purpose meant to make you feel a certain way. Blindly accepting the news is telling us only the &quot;truth&quot; is how one becomes a sheep being herder-ed into a certain worldview and I think that is the main point of the sub.</p>

<p>Most people just read the news and accept it blindly hell I beat a great portion of this country doesn&#39;t even get past the first paragraph sadly, my point is that no author writes without a specific agenda and when you start  to get rid of the filters that people put the news through by seeing both sides and removing the unnecessary emotional/political bias aspect, you get closer to the truth. </p>

<p>Go ahead read all the news you want, but ask yourself is this really true, or is this what I want to hear?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if you post washington post you have to contextualize it so that people undersand why you are posting it here.  We know washington compost is fakenews, erm I mean &#39;realnews&#39; (which means its&#39; fake) and that fakenews is sometimes real--like zerohedge for example, very trustworthy imo, those comrades.  same with fakenews james corbett, who is a canadian expat in japan posing as an agorist but we now realy he&#39;s a russian spy because that makes sense to a half baked moron we&#39;ve collectively become, thanks to MSM</p>

<p>Anyway, yes, editorialize i think is ok.  I dont&#39; see why not.  something like &quot;look what washington post said about syria..this disagrees with what was posted by a canadian pullitzer author&quot;</p>
