<p>They&#39;re not 100% unified. He&#39;s at the very outer edge of the establishment. If they had run Jeb Bush there would have been armed insurrection.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It would be a military coup before anything. Trump has the support of the brass. I think an assassination would literally result in US troops storming the CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no they didnt. they looked at him as a joke from the beginning.</p>

<p>Team Clinton and the republicans had devastating oppo research. Bernie made and agreement to concede the nomination if the oppo research never came out.</p>

<p>They had this on video</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1985 rally thrown by the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua where half a million people chanted, “Here, there, everywhere/the Yankee will die,’’ while President Daniel Ortega condemned “state terrorism” by America. Sanders said, on camera, supporting the Sandinistas was “patriotic.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bernie was a hack who did nothing but defraud poor Americans out of there money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you talking about the house that he bought with his wife&#39;s inheritance money?  Or are you referring to the Clinton&#39;s neighboring million dollar mansions on a culdesac that they bought with speech money?</p>

<p>Bernie had flaws, but he legit likes to lead to help people.  He wasn&#39;t in it for power or money.  What other politician can you say the same about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary and Repubs had devastating oppo research. They had Bernie on video at a fucking Sandinista rally in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Bernie made an agreement to concede the nomination and not attack Clinton on the emails  if the research never came out </p>

<p>Tell me, why exactly do you think he went up on stage and deflected from Hillarys biggest issue in the first debate? its painfully obvious that he was controlled opposition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that Trump isn&#39;t establishment is laughable on its face.</p>

<p>A billionaire real estate mogul, himself the son of a real estate mogul, who has his name on Manhattan skyscrapers and casinos, who has hobnobbed with Hollywood types for decades, who until very recently was friends with the <em>Clintons</em> (how soon we forget), and who has ties to business leaders all across the globe?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the very <em>definition</em> of establishment.</p>

<p>The fact that a lot of people think he&#39;s an oaf unfit to serve as President of the United States doesn&#39;t change that.</p>
