       There's one easy critical thinking exercise that proves this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who controls our cultural institutions? The establishment/tptb/cabal w/e meaningless name you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our cultural institutions tell us across the board to hate Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, Trump cannot be establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like the insidious web that's been running our country since at least the early 1900's, support the man, he ain't apart of it.

       Of course he is. He'd be dead if he wasn't. He's trying to do as much as he can to bail water out, but the Swamp is deep.

       If he's establishment why has our establishment told us to hate him and to rise up against him? An outright assassination could very potentially provoke anarchy. That's why he's not dead yet.

       They're not 100% unified. He's at the very outer edge of the establishment. If they had run Jeb Bush there would have been armed insurrection.

       It would be a military coup before anything. Trump has the support of the brass. I think an assassination would literally result in US troops storming the CIA.

       Do you only visit this forum for your information? People like you pretend this satanic Illuminati thing originated here or some other forum full of hoaxers. If you're trying to imply I'm one of the few people convinced that satanic activities are taking place then you're poorly informed.

       I get that, you've stated your position already. What does that have to do with my points? It's weird that you act like my ideas are out of nowhere and I'm the only one aware of satanic activities. It's even more weird to

       For those that have done the research (real research, not surfing r/conspiracy) my clue was sufficient (it wasn't "evidence", you claimed that part). I have to assume you've dismissed all related subject areas or you wouldn't call it retarded. Weak evidence? Of course. I wish I could post better proof that didn't take hours to write and fill up several pages, but even that wouldn't be enough for most people such as yourself.

       Evidence of exactly this caliber is used here to link others to the elite all the time. Loads of regulars are big on symbolism and the idea that the elite put stuff like this out there on purpose.

       What's your definition of constantly? Bernie was attacked every day online and in the media by establishment orgs. That's pretty constant to me.

       I'd love to agree with you but I think the media/ establishment are just trying to divide America. Whether it was Trump or Clinton that won, I have a feeling we'd be seeing similar behaviour from the opposition.

       The idea that Trump isn't establishment is laughable on its face.
      </p>
      <p>
       A billionaire real estate mogul, himself the son of a real estate mogul, who has his name on Manhattan skyscrapers and casinos, who has hobnobbed with Hollywood types for decades, who until very recently was friends with the
       <em>
        Clintons
       </em>
       (how soon we forget), and who has ties to business leaders all across the globe?

      <p>
       That's the very
       <em>
        definition
       </em>
       of establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a lot of people think he's an oaf unfit to serve as President of the United States doesn't change that.

       Bernie was a hack. We know from wikileaks that he was controlled opposition who had a deal with team Clinton.
