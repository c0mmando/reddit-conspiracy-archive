    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no problem criticizing Trump. It has happened heavily on this sub, e.g. when he gave his <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5pd6d3/trump_just_held_a_speech_at_the_cia_singing_its/">speech to the CIA.</a></p>

<p>No, this is about believing Flynn was pressured to leave &quot;because of Russia&quot;. This is transparent nonsense. This neo-McCarthist frenzy you guys are peddling does not rest in fact, contrary to what you say in your comment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worse than a cold war mentality, it is an imperialist one. You have been made to believe America needs to &quot;lead&quot; (dominate) the world, otherwise China/Russia will. Russia (and the continental <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geographical_Pivot_of_History">world island</a>) is the #1 threat to US hegemonists, that&#39;s why they are feeding you this fake outrage.</p>

<p>There are plenty of things to be enraged, revolted about. Flynn&#39;s phone calls, golden showers and pussy grabbing are not among them.</p>

<p>WOAH, a real CT person. You nailed it. It&#39;s like some sort of infiltration to the CT community that effectively leaves out half the argument. </p>

<p>On real CT forums we&#39;d be ripping the Deep State a new one, discussion the exposure of the Deep State in the CIA Torture documents and proof who&#39;s really running things, in fact we&#39;d be suspicious about why they&#39;re targeting Trump but never squeaked a peep over Obama or Hillary.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what real CT people would be digging. I never ever thought I&#39;d see the day when so called CT people would be cheering the Shadow Government. It&#39;s eerie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed signal-to-noise ratio drop noticeably in this sub. Can&#39;t say exactly when, but I see the most far-fetched conspiracy theories upvoted to the top now, trying to make this sub live up to the worst conspiracy theorist stereotype.</p>

<p>Any free thinking person who wants to engage in open uncensored political discussion has abandoned r/politics, There is enough if us in r/conspiracy now to upvote discussions about various power abuses to r/all, and that is a problem for those who want to control the narrative.</p>

<p>The problem with controlling the narrative is that the more it deviates from what common sense is telling most people, the more vulnerable it is even to an occasional dissenting opinion. It takes only a small amount of external validation for a person to trust their own instincts that someone else is feeding them BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pol was mainly what I was referring to I&#39;ve kinda lost hope with reddit for the most part, I only come here because I know what organic conversation looks like its a complete loss for anyone new. As far as them not learning I disagree. They&#39;ve completely abandoned trying to make it look organic, and its fuckin working. The signal to noise ratio has dropped considerably in just a few days and it may be obvious to the senior members but its still effectively drowning out discussion and any new comers aren&#39;t going to see that. The signal to noise ratio is bad itself, we can&#39;t effectively communicate new information with eachother. Sure you and I are having this chat, but getting something across to the hive mind is becoming increasingly difficult and thats all they need to do to prevent us from coordinating. </p>

<p>I feel like were fuckin living Ghost In The Shell 2nd Gig, if you havent seen that its pretty amazing how damn near everything in the show regarding information warfare has happened in the past year. Now we&#39;re at the point where they are jamming our core means of sifting through large amounts of data. Thats the strength of the hive mind, the shit always gets filtered out. Now with the new tactics they&#39;re using the &quot;Truth output&quot; of the hive mind as I like to think of it has been drastically reduced.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re virtue signaling about this forum. There&#39;s actually no free discussions here with regards to Deep State, IC conspiracies at all. It&#39;s we love DEEP STATE when they wound our enemy, not critical questioning of any official stories. IN fact the only questioning happening here is OMG what other crimes did Trump commit.

    <div class="md"><p>Vermonty Python did it to S4P right after the convention, except when they couldn&#39;t ban #NeverHillary Bernie supporters fast enough they just shut the whole fucking sub down. I doubt they will do that here because they have nothing to gain... They can simply flood /new with a million meta posts.</p>

<p>They HAD to shut down S4P because there were so many of us still united against Clinton, and no offense, but that sub had much more credibility than this one especially at the time. I guess Reddit would not allow S4P to actually influence the election. They should have listened to us though... we warned them that Clinton was a liability and now we have Trump.</p>

<p>Then again, I&#39;m guessing that Clinton&#39;s masters (donors) were much more pleased with Trump than they would have been with Sanders.</p>

<p>This is literally something that myself and many other non-shills would write word-for-word on our own accord.  That&#39;s simply because it&#39;s true.  It&#39;s the most concise &amp; accurate way to describe the nature of shill accusations here.  Calling it a &quot;script&quot; is either disingenuous or paranoid - it&#39;s completely understandable that multiple individuals would naturally type that without being told to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ho gawd there ya go on assumptions and accusations. I don&#39;t like defending Trump, but the MSM/CIA/TPTB has created a Russian boogeyman narrative containing no real substance. Please, tell me what crazy awful things could happen by simply communicating with Russian intelligence.</p>

<p>This sub is certainly biased towards Trump, but I think it&#39;s important to know why that is. This is the only place not completely taken over and destroyed by shills, and literally the ONLY place left on Reddit to talk about pizzagate. But just like it&#39;s obvious that this sub is biased towards Trump, it&#39;s obvious how many shills there are. Productive discussion is heavily slid and neutralized by &quot;this sub has gone to shit&quot; and the same stupid reddit loser humor to distract from productive discussion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not pretending anything, but the shilling is really getting out of hand. There is so much to pizzagate, it&#39;s ridiculous that any rational thinker could still disregard it as bs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit doesn&#39;t censor subs. It bans subs when they take a blind-eye to doxxing and that is about it.</p>

<p>Reddit would be a better place with censorship, frankly. If they actually enforced their policies and walled off subs that clearly manipulated votes, ask for upvotes, or didn&#39;t allow open discussion. Namely, if a sub isn&#39;t &quot;neutral and user driven&quot; as is the supposed &quot;nature of reddit&quot; it rightly should be walled off.</p>

<p>If reddit took action earlier then the toxic communities couldn&#39;t get the traction they needed to have a noticable exodus in other subs. Established subs would also be better able to use their tools to stem any potential abuse.</p>

<p>As it is the owners of Reddit are happy to host and promote a bunch of ideological echochambers and note take responsibility when they spill over into other subs or the real world.</p>

<p>Yeah, you can&#39;t even post at TD and go into any other forums. You get banned just for subbing. There aren&#39;t that many forums someone who has dared support Trump can actually post on. Politics should not be biased...neither should All...I can see hilltard forums being biased that&#39;s fine..but not the others.

<p>what sub was that? Usually I&#39;m afraid of posting anywhere else. It&#39;s kind of disheartening. I wouldn&#39;t even bother to post at Hill or Bern. I think the fact that Politics and All had to ban TD posters speaks to the fact they were afraid of a majority.

    <div class="md"><p>The OP posts a lot in guess what sub...</p>

<p>I bet you can never guess! I bet you can&#39;t! These Ronald McDonald idiots don&#39;t understand there are websites that lay out exactly where they post a lot, and what kinds of posts they make. They try to pretend they are fucking neutral and when you look up their name you will see 99% of the time they aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t as crafty as they fucking think they are. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been tagging them all in RES to make it easy for me to see who they are, and they are always posting things like this.</p>

<p>THEY ARE PROJECTING.</p>

<p>There is NO WAY you can see what is happening right now with Trump and tell anyone with a straight face that they wouldn&#39;t be asking for Clinton&#39;s head on a pike if it happened with her. NO FUCKING WAY would they be okay with this if the shoe was on the other foot. </p>

<p>The hypocrisy disgusts me. I&#39;m happy Clinton lost, I&#39;m not happy Trump won but I waited to see how it played out. It&#39;s clear now what needs to be done. What Flynn did was treason, and being very untrusting of anyone in power I would be shocked if Trump is not involved with this. In fact, his campaign aids were. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not humoring any bullshit from right wingers on this. They need to get on board or they are lying hypocrites out to ruin America. Traitors just like those in CTR that pushed the Clinton narrative. The other side of the same coin.</p>

<p>We need to fight them away from here, and these Mods need to be removed as they are clearly compromised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you need to look up the word Conspiracy because you do not know what it means. Oh let me do it for you since I don&#39;t trust you know how:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a conspiracy is when a group DOES plot do something unlawful or harmful, meaning it is fucking PROVEN that this group actually plotted to do this. Things like MK ULTRA are proven fucking fact, and is also a conspiracy and it belongs here.</p>

<p>A conspiracy theory means it is not a proven fact. It&#39;s not rocket science yet here we are!</p>

<p>Which is why there are threads on the exposure of the control of the Deep State over government in the CIA Torture documents, the FBI investigation into the Sikh Temple shooting (I realize that&#39;s probably out of the scope of most people who can&#39;t effectively analyze information that convoluted), or the revelation of the actual existence of Deep State control in the emails between Colin Powell and Hillary. This place is actually more of a Deep State cheerleading section rather than a CT forum.</p>

<p>If indeed this place USED to care about looking into gov. regardless of who is in charge I cannot tell. It&#39;s just a echo chamber for the Deep State IC because so many so called CT people are actually not really CT theorists when it challenges their emotional-based view of government (meaning it&#39;s OK to challenge people we don&#39;t like, otherwise we see nothing.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no they are definitely not the only ones. I think they are easy to spot with the pro russian sentiment, which isnt something youd commonly find. I understand a non confrontational state, but the praise and spinning of stories regarding russia is easy to spot. check out the thread on this sub regarding the latest NYT breaking news about the trump teams contact with russian agents. all the first posts in there are trying to shut it up and promote a pro russian agenda, right out of the playbook</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its ok, theyre not getting paid anything significant, but statistically speaking, a few of them are learning. they will eventually be the missing bricks in the wall that lets in the light and weakens that wall.</p>

<p>these &quot;people&quot; talk to eachother as much as you guys do, infiltration is everywhere, those that speak the truth shouldn&#39;t mind.</p>

<p>whatever the impact of these apes and pigs, the sub is growing like crazy, and the drama ironically helps, and thats the plan.  </p>

<p>the truth and human sympathy are powerful motivators, &quot;the adversaries&quot; use it to great effect but ultimately its a human tool and used by humanity to much greater effect than any underpaid farm animal on a milking machine.</p>

<p>oh and btw, anyph@65 that keep talking about leaving the sub, is either weak, full of shit or &quot;an adversary.&quot; when pests and vermin enter your homes, do you move or run away?  defend your beliefs, eachother and your home.  dont be ph@65</p>

<p>You moderated a political advocacy subreddit that had an official policy of banning dissenting opinions.</p>

<p>Yeah, you can&#39;t even post at TD and go into any other forums. You get banned just for subbing. There aren&#39;t that many forums someone who has dared support Trump can actually post on. Politics should not be biased...neither should All...I can see hilltard forums being biased that&#39;s fine..but not the others. TD is for TD, that&#39;s fine and I&#39;d never complain about Hillforum being for Hill or Bernie.</p>
