        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s been a lot of self-posts implying that the new influx of people since the election are CTR shills, so as a new user I wanted to explain what brought me here. Believe it or not, call me a shill, attack me, whatever, but I think this is an important place and I&#39;m concerned about government malfeasance so I&#39;m going to continue to participate.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t afraid of the establishment. I am afraid of Trump. I think that the old way of doing things was too byzantine and self-interested to really leave an opportunity for true conspiracies like the ones we saw in past decades. I just found it hard to believe that, in a white house filled with thousands of people who had worked their way up from high school president to white house staffer, constantly inoculated on the importance of the Constitution and transparency, that anybody could corral absolute silence on the intentional murder of thousands of americans, child trafficking rings (yes I don&#39;t buy pizzagate, and I know that people are going to attack me for that), and intentional infliction of terrorist attacks. I didn&#39;t trust the government, but I didn&#39;t believe they could seriously harm us without repercussion (look at the WMDs, I didn&#39;t believe that was true when it was reported and it&#39;s falsity was exposed by the federal government <em>while still under control of the people that perpetrated the lie</em>).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that anymore. Trump has built a white house largely staffed with media barons and corporate fat cats and has demanded, and largely achieved, absolute loyalty. Democrats have no power, and their voice has been eroded by constant use (I was a public defender for a long time and let me tell you, the most effective way to silence the people that fight the government is to constantly break the rules; Judge&#39;s never listened to us, precisely because the heard from us so often, so they never took us seriously, and never took our efforts seriously).</p>

<p>This White House looks so much like the Nixon White House (from which so many confirmed conspiracies started), and I am afraid that we&#39;re going to see the same thing now that we saw then. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m here now when I wasn&#39;t before. I think it&#39;s important to keep this place alive, and I think it&#39;s important to speak out. I think r/conspiracy is a good thing, even if I degree with many of the conspiracies. I hope that answers at least some of the suspicions harbored against new users but I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions you have about myself and why others may have started using this space as well (though I&#39;d only be speculating).</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think any media is honest. Everyone is biased and lies to themselves (and therefore others). I dislike the term MSM precisely because it implies that the non-mainstream media gets it right. Everyone (myself included) interprets the facts to fit their own personal narrative, it&#39;s a psychological fact. The only way to combat this is to be aware of, and sensitive to, the bias that exists everywhere. Denying it exists just leaves you open for falling for it. </p>

<p>no no my friend, we resist trump because his actions are revolting and dangerous. the media could merely document them completely impartially-- though they do not-- and we&#39;d still be up in arms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey good shit ! I read the post you made.... even though you used CNN as source. But I think your not going deep enough. Your so close you have the right lanes just go deeper. I mean if vetting and deportation creates terrorist then what do you think happens when we Bomb the shit out of their hospitals, kill their children will predator drones that you never see. What about when we fund them to kill each other and give weapons. If you coming to this sub I sustect you feel like something is fucked up about our GOv. And its is. But its way bigger and started way longer ago then this Duesch. I do have a thick scull... prob from the 8 or so concussions I have had over my life or the thirty or so street fights Ive been in since 10yrs old. But I also have a 134 IQ.

    <div class="md"><p>National security and proper vetting in a time where an extremist islamic group managed to nearly seize control over two countries, has commited several acts of terrorism, killing thousands and thousands of people, is not bad, according to you, it&#39;s terrible! </p>

<p>Is it racist, and does it feel islamophobic? Hell yeah it does, but you need to get it through your thick skull that extremism and terrorism is a real thing, and you need to do racist shit to stop it, seriously. Extreme vetting of people, a temporary travel-ban to implement the system for which to actually do it is completely necessary.</p>

<p>God damnit, do you think IS does not have people all over the world with the insane amount of muslims on the run, and countries left and right accepting them into our countries in the thousands with almost no background checks?</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t even begin to talk about the issues that the fucking muslims from their countries practically live in the stone-age, where use of acid, stoning, rape, marrying children, women not being allowed to drive and all this insane shit is happening.</p>

<p>God damn it, we have a huge population of people who wants to migrate in the thousands all over the world. Are we seriously disregarding the fact that these people literally have a completely different culture than our western worlds? They want to implement fucking sharia laws into a country that already has it&#39;s own laws.</p>

<p>Honestly, if these people cannot adapt to our cultures and laws and leave their laws and culture in their own country then why the hell should any western country even take them in, and this doesn&#39;t even take into account the REAL and very SERIOUS threat of terrorism.</p>

<p>well, saudi arabia, capital of sunni islam and the terrorist ideology of wahhabism (which is the ideology of ISIS, unambiguously) wasn&#39;t banned. lol. osama bin laden was a saudi. he wouldn&#39;t have been caught my this most recent ban. </p>

<p>think about that for a minute: osama bin laden wouldn&#39;t be caught in trump&#39;s travel ban policy. if that&#39;s not a gaping hole, i don&#39;t know what is. the ban also doesn&#39;t cover other countries which are know for having islamic fundamentalist terror groups operating, or even being outright hotbeds for it: mali, egypt, morocco, algeria, indonesia, pakistan, uzbekistan, chechnya, turkey, nigeria... the list goes on and on. all of these countries that i have mentioned here have islamic fundamentalist problems that dwarf the wildest imagination of people in the US-- terrorist militias actually controlling areas of the country, for many of these... yet none are banned. </p>

<p>even on its own terms, it&#39;s a bad policy that doesn&#39;t go far enough to satisfy its own stated goal. that isn&#39;t even starting to discuss the myriad number of innocent people (some of whom i know personally) who got fucked over by the implementation of the ban. these are not muslims who got fucked over, nor from any of the above countries.... nor from any countries with any muslims in any appreciable quantity. these are kids trying to come back to college, or professors doing the same. people of humble means suffer immensely when expensive mishaps like this are imposed on them. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>you&#39;ll find no debate from me when you call fundamentalist islam is a disgrace. again, saudi arabia is the pioneer and intellectual leader in these things, and almost certainly helps ISIS from time to time.  and they&#39;re not banned. and trump is their buddy. sure, hillary was too, but we&#39;re not talking about her right now. </p>

<p>is it really so serious? lightning strikes kill more people than terrorism does on most years in the recent era. this is pre-travel ban, but post-ISIS being a thing.... <a href="https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_AmericanTerrorismDeaths_FactSheet_Oct2015.pdf">https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_AmericanTerrorismDeaths_FactSheet_Oct2015.pdf</a> vs <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/almost-no-americans-die-from-lightning-strikes-anymore-why/283046/">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/almost-no-americans-die-from-lightning-strikes-anymore-why/283046/</a></p>

<p>I hate to brag, but as an ex-public defender I am very used to this, and very familiar with the ways that politics works to fight the truth (I have a whole long rant about this that ties into why I don&#39;t buy into PG--and most modern conspiracy theories, and perhaps some day I will write it up, but now&#39;s not the time)</p>

<p>The NK stuff is very interesting to me. I don&#39;t know how they possibly could have identified two asian women as NK spies in malaysia (no, I&#39;m not saying all asians look alike :p, but I don&#39;t see how anyone could have agreed as to the country of origin of a spy--I mean presumably they didn&#39;t walk in to the airport in full NK military dress). Honestly the first time I heard of that I thought it Trump&#39;s attempt to shut down an attempt by NK to test the waters. I know that may be showing my bias, but every time a new president comes in NK does something like this to try and see how things are going to work for the next 4-8 years. Honestly I don&#39;t particularly blame Trump for trying a new approach to the NK besides appeasement but I don&#39;t think this one was particularly smart. It&#39;s hard to say though, the NK is not a rational state actor so who knows what will work on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah brother. If you thought that Hillary would have been any better you&#39;re faith is sadly misplaced. Take a look at the executive orders expanding presidential power that Obama put in place after Trump&#39;s victory. Take a look at the defense budget from 2013 when Obama passed the legislation that allowed Cia foreign policy to be used against the American people. That&#39;s how we got to this point in which all news agencies are broadcasting outright fake reports constantly, where as before it was just skewed and misleading.</p>

<p>2 hands of the same body. Partisan politics is the great illusion.</p>

<p>Conspiracies are real. Always have been, always will be. Herein lie the theories. How far do they actually run and what parts are misinformation should really be the only points up for debate, not whether they happen at all or not. They happen on a personal or low level political level, why would you delude yourself in to the illusion that they don&#39;t reach much, much higher? I know one guy harrassed at gun point for voting a certain way at a union meeting. My civics club a few years back had all the people on one side of an important issue get their tires slashed while in session. </p>

<p>As far as the pedos go... ya, I&#39;ve gone back and forth on the comet thing myself but I find the media&#39;s reaction interesting to say the least. The rest? There&#39;s been victims with scars coming out for years accusing some of these people. Australia, Scotland, UK, Vatican... but no... couldn&#39;t happen here. Cuz someone would say something right? Doesn&#39;t help that when people do come out, they are called crazy. Maybe they are, after the trauma they&#39;ve endured. Either way, nobody listens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point with the too byzantine is simply that I generally believe that the government is too complex to hide these things at all. In con-man language there are too many moving parts.</p>

<p>For example, I don&#39;t buy 911 trutherism, especially regarding that Tower 7 was a controlled demolition. Why? you people to plan and put that together, a lot of people. Now if someone were to propose that GWB knew it was going to happen and ignored it because he wanted to consolidate power I would consider that much more strongly for the simple reason than that you he only would need the compliance of 2-3 people to make that happen. Much easier to control, much more plausible deniability (look at the reaction to the CIA memo regarding the attack, he literally was told that an attack was going to happen, and &#39;I just didn&#39;t think it needed to be moved on&#39; was disseminated and ultimately accepted by the general population), and much fewer moving parts. </p>

<p>Same result, less danger. That&#39;s what I mean by less byzantine.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve heard about it, but I couldn&#39;t tell you that I&#39;ve heard everything. I&#39;ve heard the point that jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams and at least a fair amount of the discussion about the manner in which the building fell appearing to be a controlled demolition, I&#39;m happy to consider any other information you have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to have a strong opinion on something you haven&#39;t done alot of research on, which isn&#39;t the way to go about it imo. Save your judgement when you have thoroughly examined evidence from both sides. If you don&#39;t know the details, how can you not buy into building 7 trutherism? </p>

<p>Look into what was in Building 7 and look into what office of the pentagon was destroyed. It appears they killed about 1000 birds with a single false flag stone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feel like this post and many of the responses are trolling, or painfully naive. </p>

<p>OP is like, &quot;I didn&#39;t believe any conspiracies until NOW...Trump an actual bad guy and bad secret things are happening,&quot; but to quote him directly, beforehand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just found it hard to believe....that anybody could corral absolute silence on the intentional murder of thousands of americans, child trafficking rings (yes I don&#39;t buy pizzagate, and I know that people are going to attack me for that), and intentional infliction of terrorist attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, pal. You&#39;re wrong. Have you read Nick Bryant&#39;s &quot;The Franklin Scandal&quot;? Dave McGowan&#39;s &quot;The Pedophocracy&quot;? Did it not strike you as weird that Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert got busted for raping high school boys while a wrestling coach, but nobody followed up on his behavior in Congress? Start digging on those three subjects and get back to us. </p>

<p>As for 9/11 and false flag terrorist attacks, are you aware that the bipartisan co-chairs and a majority of 9/11 Commission members say the investigation needs to be reopened? How about what Tulsi Gabbard&#39;s had to say about ISIS? Are you familiar with COINTELPRO? If not, start digging into those subjects and get back to us. </p>

<p>You might think you&#39;re a liberal, but actually you&#39;re not. You&#39;re a ideologue who&#39;s here now because you&#39;ve bought into the anti-cult of personality and you don&#39;t want to examine or dig into the myths you&#39;ve been swallowing since birth. And your self-embraced handle for excrement suggests it&#39;s all bullish!t anyway from you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry that you feel attacking me is conducive to this discussion. Hopefully you will be able to put that aside when myself and other new users participate productively in this sub. Plenty of conspiracy theorists have been labeled as irrational, so I won&#39;t take it personally. :)</p>
