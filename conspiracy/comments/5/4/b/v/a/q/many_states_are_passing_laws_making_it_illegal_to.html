       We also ALL know that Israel has had for a few decades now, access to a LARGE arsenal of nuclear weapons, with many of them already put in to an "end game" program called "The Sampson Act" which has each nuclear missile/bomb pre-programmed with major cities in all countries. The idea being that if Israel is going down they are taking everyone with them. Fine whatever, that's what they want, then let it be. BUT, they are NOT one of the signed members, that have disclosed their nuclear program and allowed U.N. inspectors. That actually makes ANY money that we are donating/loaning/giving as a gift to Israel ILLEGAL.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is, ever since the email that Biden sent out, that was leaked, where it was revealed the U.S. government officially knows (though they won't publicly disclose) that Israel has a nuclear arsenal. Can individual business's make the case that they won't do business with Israeli companies based on the simple fact that they [the Israeli government] are illegally harboring nuclear weapons and have NOT allowed U.N. weapon inspectors to check their arsenal and program/factories?

       Best option is a silent boycott. Just buy elsewhere. No explanation required. This cold shoulder approach may even be what israel fears most. Everyone just turns their backs.

       I think a better route would be boycotting them on the stance of religion (What they are doing goes against my religious beliefs). I think that would hold more weight, legally. Not a lawyer, just my thoughts in regards to religious rights/freedom we have in the US.

       I haven't read any of these laws, but I'd guess that you're fine not dealing with them for any bs made up reason as long as it's not because you're "boycotting" them. You're probably fine as long as you don't call it a boycott, but people who are boycotting stuff usually want everyone to know that's what they're doing - and in many cases never had any intention of dealing with the other party anyway.

       Look, the US gov't just gave Israel 38 billion USD over ten years for defense spending. That's 3.8 billion per year. They also said that most of the money has to be paid to US defense contractors. So basically it was a HUGE giveaway to US companies. You think any of those defense companies are going to turn away from Israel based on principle even if they could? Not a chance. And Israel isn't really worried about losing business from the types of companies that might boycott them. These laws are really just symbolic.

       QFT... you don't have to look far, how many countries has over 120 pending UN Resolution against them and still allowed to receive this much "humanitarian aid" from "the world police".
