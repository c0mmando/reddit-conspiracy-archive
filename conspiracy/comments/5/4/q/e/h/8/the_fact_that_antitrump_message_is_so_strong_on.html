       Man this sub is fucking hilarious, we're completely anti-war and all about outing realpolitick and similar bad behavior but we have one guy advocating giving and using nukes to/on whomever, yet this is the guy you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not even mentioning the fact that he advocates for more torture, something else this sub flips out about when it comes to Bush and Obama, one of his responses last night alluded to how he would have stolen all of the oil while we were still in Iraq "and that would have solved ISIS" the guy is every bit as bad as Hillary and he hasn't even had a chance to show it yet but he sure as hell will tell us, there is still so much more that he's said himself, or tweeted, and you cucks still want him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm by no means saying vote Hillary but I am saying if you're voting for Trump still you are clearly part of the problem, not the solution, at least vote Gary Johnson, the guy may not know what Aleppo is but at least he's not willing to give the Saudi's nukes or push for more torture and would supposedly work with all of us on the NSA overreach issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just admit it all of you cucks that are still supporting Trump at this point are just concern trolls feigning concern to push your agendas.

       Dude not everything is a conspiracy, have you seen how shitty some of these reporters and journalists are these days? Besides the NY Times were the first to try and cover it to poke fun at him and they couldn't even get the "capital" city of the caliphate right, it's just piss poor journalism, journalism is dead all we are left with are a handful of holdouts and a shit load of wannabe pundits.

       It shouldn't be.  I've known that Reddit's userbase primarily consists of mindless, Godless, Marxist, Millennial cyborgs with mobile phones for the entire six years that I've been using the site.  Just ignore them.  Hillary winning won't mean anything other than more of the same.

       Yes, but if there's a better alternative out there, I don't know what it is, and no one will tell me, because doing so publically will mean that the COINTELPRO will be able to go there as well.

       The fact that Johnson is socially liberal and fiscally conservative is really attracting lots of Liberty loving people to the Libertarian Party.  Libertarians struggle to achieve their goals because people get so wrapped up in ideological purity that party accomplishes nothing.  I for one am glad that Johnson and Weld are the standard bearers of the new Libertarian party.

       It's one thing to be socially liberal.  I'm pretty socially liberal.  It doesn't mean I want to flood our country with poor people.  No country wants that.

       The "no true scotsman" argument is played out and debunked long ago.  Fact is that is no "true" anything.  Libertarian, republican, and democrat are a loose collection of outlines about how government should world.  Not dogmatically defined religions you have to follow ten commandments or go to hell for.

       Illegal immigrant is an idiotic term to use in this country considering our very existence is due to us immigrating here and taking someone elses land.  Undocumented? Yes.  Documenting who comes into this country is important and should be done and the process needs to be improved.  Securing our borders is also important.  But the term illegal immigrant ridiculous and was created by people who clearly don't understand this countries history.  Pretty much like most of the voting populace.

       Yes we were illegal immigrants when we took over the country 400 years ago.  Doesn't mean I want the same thing to happen to us now by current illegals.  CTR somewhere else.

       I don't even know what CTR stands for.

       Either way, documenting them as they immigrate is a better option and in the end nets more taxes and fairer wages between immigrants and citizens.  Taking the stance of "keep the illegals out" is a failed policy dozens of times over.  Since we can't do that, at least we can document them as they come in which is better safety wise and monetarily.  And it starts with not calling people criminals just because they come into the country to work.

       They are criminals if they are here without going through the proper procedures.  We can't very well stroll into switzerland and hole up.  They'd kick us out.  Just like we should be doing.  Uphold our immigration laws.
