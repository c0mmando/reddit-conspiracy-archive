    <div class="md"><p>Man this sub is fucking hilarious, we&#39;re completely anti-war and all about outing realpolitick and similar bad behavior but we have one guy advocating giving and using nukes to/on whomever, yet this is the guy you want. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not even mentioning the fact that he advocates for more torture, something else this sub flips out about when it comes to Bush and Obama, one of his responses last night alluded to how he would have stolen all of the oil while we were still in Iraq &quot;and that would have solved ISIS&quot; the guy is every bit as bad as Hillary and he hasn&#39;t even had a chance to show it yet but he sure as hell will tell us, there is still so much more that he&#39;s said himself, or tweeted, and you cucks still want him. </p>

<p>I&#39;m by no means saying vote Hillary but I am saying if you&#39;re voting for Trump still you are clearly part of the problem, not the solution, at least vote Gary Johnson, the guy may not know what Aleppo is but at least he&#39;s not willing to give the Saudi&#39;s nukes or push for more torture and would supposedly work with all of us on the NSA overreach issue.</p>

<p>Just admit it all of you cucks that are still supporting Trump at this point are just concern trolls feigning concern to push your agendas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even know what CTR stands for. </p>

<p>Either way, documenting them as they immigrate is a better option and in the end nets more taxes and fairer wages between immigrants and citizens.  Taking the stance of &quot;keep the illegals out&quot; is a failed policy dozens of times over.  Since we can&#39;t do that, at least we can document them as they come in which is better safety wise and monetarily.  And it starts with not calling people criminals just because they come into the country to work.  </p>
