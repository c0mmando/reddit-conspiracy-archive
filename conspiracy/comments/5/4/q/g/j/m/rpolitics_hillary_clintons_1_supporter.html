       I want to start off by saying this is in no way posted to support Trump. He has his own issues that I cannot condone, but I am just disappointed that one of the top subreddits is now in my opinion more biased than even mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have honestly never seen a subreddit so slanted in one direction. I realize that Hillary has her campaign workers constantly posting anti-Trump post from subpar sources (ex: Buzzfeed, Vox), but the whole downvoting policy is outrageous.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Do not downvote comments because you disagree with them, and be willing to upvote quality comments whether you agree with the opinions held or not." - Quote from u/AutoModerator in every single comment feed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that not the whole reason people downvote comments?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've learned in the last 20 minutes browsing r/politics that:
A. If you down vote a posting then the font fades.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. If you go to downvote a comment it reminds you that comments should not be downvoted baised off of opinion, but rather that you base it of of quality. I just keep thinking up a senarios where I wouldn't downvote somthing based off of my opinion rather than the overall quality of the comment. I can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       C. The upvote arrow is about twice as big as the downvote arrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is today I lost the little respect I had left for larger subreddits. It seems like if you hold the power you can now even control the internet, a place where I used to find refuge from the overwhelming lies told in the media today.

       I don't remember it being this bad in any previous elections. I guess it just goes to show that if enough people take interest in something then it is worth manipulating in the name of personal gain.

       It has never been like like this. People there had undying support for Bernie, but it's been all CTR since the primaries. It's probably just paid shills complementing themselves now. It'll be a much different place the day after the election.

       Like the Bernie people, the Paul were actually supporting their candidate. Even the_donald people support their candidate, though I travel there. But CTR are paid trolls and it's disturbing the the admins of Reddit are letting the sub be taken over. The reason Reddit grew to what it is now, is because Digg let paid trolls control the content, same thing that's happening over at

       I actually don't remember that sub, but I do remember a lot of Paul spam and a lot of online support. His money bombs brought in a lot. Nothing was ever as bad as is

       Politics is definitely pro Hil but you are missing the point of the voting policy. It is trying to deter those who will downvote something just because it is from the other side.

       More like r/antiTrump I mean it worked didn't it? All the questions where pointed against Donald they Lester didn't bring up jack shit about all of Hillary's faults. Donald Trump is a bigot and a bad business man, But Hillary Clinton is literally a political criminal and this "debate" (it really wasn't debate more like on guy pissing on someone who's reading from a script) I mean I swear if Hillary tried to sell herself for another minute that she was actually a human being I was going to throw up.

       It's also crazy because if you look at all of these polls where people were voting online, there are only a select few that Hillary actually won.

       The results of a poll aren't accurate when the respondents are volunteers. Look up voluntary response bias, you learn this day one of any statistics course. Not to mention multiple votes, the differences in demographic support.

       I think they got rid of most of the content contributors who aren't pro-Hillary. I saw a lot of people complaining of getting baited into calling someone a shill and getting banned. Others complain about the 10 minute limit per comment if you are downvoted too much recently. They lost motivation and left that sub. Couple that with the heavy astrotufing and you get an echo chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a few recommendations: Don't allow them to make you angry. Don't allow them to silence you. All you need to do is use a proxy, make a few burner accounts, and post away. Only focus on the top thread (s) and only focus on the top comments in those threads so that you reach the maximum people with minimal effort. Always switch your IP address when logging into another account, otherwise the 10 minute limit will hit your new accounts as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Option B is to make a very well-placed and well-thought out comment every 10 minutes.
