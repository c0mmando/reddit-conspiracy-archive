        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I want to start off by saying this is in no way posted to support Trump. He has his own issues that I cannot condone, but I am just disappointed that one of the top subreddits is now in my opinion more biased than even mainstream media.</p>

<p>I have honestly never seen a subreddit so slanted in one direction. I realize that Hillary has her campaign workers constantly posting anti-Trump post from subpar sources (ex: Buzzfeed, Vox), but the whole downvoting policy is outrageous. </p>

<p>&quot;Do not downvote comments because you disagree with them, and be willing to upvote quality comments whether you agree with the opinions held or not.&quot; - Quote from u/AutoModerator in every single comment feed.</p>

<p>Is that not the whole reason people downvote comments?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned in the last 20 minutes browsing r/politics that:
A. If you down vote a posting then the font fades.</p>

<p>B. If you go to downvote a comment it reminds you that comments should not be downvoted baised off of opinion, but rather that you base it of of quality. I just keep thinking up a senarios where I wouldn&#39;t downvote somthing based off of my opinion rather than the overall quality of the comment. I can&#39;t.</p>

<p>C. The upvote arrow is about twice as big as the downvote arrow.</p>

<p>Bottom line is today I lost the little respect I had left for larger subreddits. It seems like if you hold the power you can now even control the internet, a place where I used to find refuge from the overwhelming lies told in the media today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The results of a poll aren&#39;t accurate when the respondents are volunteers. Look up voluntary response bias, you learn this day one of any statistics course. Not to mention multiple votes, the differences in demographic support. </p>

<p>Pretending like those polls have any basis in reality is just deluding yourself </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they got rid of most of the content contributors who aren&#39;t pro-Hillary. I saw a lot of people complaining of getting baited into calling someone a shill and getting banned. Others complain about the 10 minute limit per comment if you are downvoted too much recently. They lost motivation and left that sub. Couple that with the heavy astrotufing and you get an echo chamber. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a few recommendations: Don&#39;t allow them to make you angry. Don&#39;t allow them to silence you. All you need to do is use a proxy, make a few burner accounts, and post away. Only focus on the top thread (s) and only focus on the top comments in those threads so that you reach the maximum people with minimal effort. Always switch your IP address when logging into another account, otherwise the 10 minute limit will hit your new accounts as well. </p>

<p>Option B is to make a very well-placed and well-thought out comment every 10 minutes. </p>
