When she asked why he hasn&#39;t released his tax returns, why didn&#39;t he hammer her on the 33,000 deleted emails?  He mentioned it and then dropped it.  </p>

<p>Instead he spent 8 minutes arguing pointlessly that he was against the Iraq war from the beginning. Who cares? He is a private citizen and had no power to change anything.  </p>

<p>In addition, he is propping up lies about San Bernadino and Orlando being real terrorist attacks, and Obama&#39;s birth certificate being genuine.  </p>

<p>So unless he has morons for advisors and did no preparation for this debate at all, he appears to be throwing it deliberately to Hillary.  </p>

<p>If we look at Sweden before the refugees, they were a successful socialist government that worked astoundingly well for such an unpopular system.

    <div class="md"><p>I think its funny how known felons and gang members are using their positions within society to complain about the &quot;unfair killings.&quot; </p>

<p>The vast majority of fatal police shootings were justified, and maybe at tops 35 nationally were not this year. 35 is still a lot, but nothing compared to the 3000 shootings in Chicago (a city not a country). Considering police officers have to deal with this kind of excessive gun violence, its amazing fatal police shooting numbers arent HIGHER.</p>

<p>Drug dealing celebrities and more have come out in favor of Clinton!</p>

<p>No wonder BLM hates Trump so much, he actually wants people to OBEY THE FUCKING LAW.</p>

<p>I understand all too well the Orwellian police state we live in. Does anyone else? How fucking stupid do you have to be to disobey the orders of a police officer? Seriously. You&#39;re arguing with an armed person with the legal right to shoot you in the face, and you aren&#39;t going to obey their commands. </p>

<p>Pretty interesting. Be sure not to phone those &quot;corrupt agencies&quot; when someone is robbing you or stealing your car. Cry to Hillary Clinton about it while she launders your tax money straight to ISIS etc.</p>

<p>It would be great if BLM was a legitimate movement and not a hate group funded by George Soros for the purpose of creating an even worse police state than the one that already exists. Sadly, people are actually falling for it.</p>

<p>Such bigotry!</p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely terrible how Donald Trump has a positive relationship with another super power like Russia, what you should do is take handouts from Israel and Saudi Arabia and then hold personal vendettas against other nation&#39;s leaders for the purpose of private business interests to the point where you demand their death or openly say you&#39;ll bomb their country, see: Gadaffi, Assad, Hussein, and Iran.</p>

<p>In Zimbabwe, as in South Africa, law and order was given up for a false ideal. Whites were harassed, and ethnically cleansed in the case of former Rhodesia. And now what? The former breadbaskets of Africa can&#39;t even get the garbage out of the streets and Zimbabwe is pathetically begging white farmers to return after it figured out it had squandered its colonial infrastructure inheritence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an order of magnitude more difficult to create and maintain a society like ours than to simply let it slide into oblivion.</p>

<p>It is evident that two sets of laws, much like apartheid, are the only real way forward. I know I&#39;ll be downvoted to hell for this, but if you really want to see our cities return to places people <em>want</em> to visit and go, there needs to be stricter controls in place. Far stricter than the kid-gloves approach of our police in the inner cities today if they even bother to keep a presence. Otherwise you&#39;ll just have indigence and violence that no amount of programs can fix.</p>

<p>That <em>is</em> the way it used to be in this country.</p>

The police on patrol, or some bureaucrat trying to make all the square pegs fit into all the round holes of a nationwide curriculum for &quot;de-escalation&quot;?  </p>

<p>They tried nationalizing state curriculum in schools with Common Core and No Child Left Behind and it&#39;s a disaster.  And it doesn&#39;t work.  Communities are different.  Schools are different.  They have different needs and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.  Local communities can decide what to feed their kids for lunch and the states can set standards for HS graduates based on their own state&#39;s needs and priorities.</p>

<p>The fact is policing in Vermont is different that policing in Texas.  Policing in inner city Dallas, Texas is different than policing in rural West Texas.  Do they all need de-escalation training? Maybe.  It can&#39;t hurt, but they can do it at the state or local level.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hillary could not win the election against anyone else.  Trump is also quite obviously trying to throw the election, but with little luck.  Had Bernie Sanders declared himself to be running as an Independent when he took the podium at the DNC, he&#39;d be leading the polls by a clear and decisive margin.  I&#39;m unsure how Trump navigated the primary process this time to be come the GOP nominee.  He&#39;s run for president three or four times in the past and was always among the first people to flame-out.</p>

<p>Why won&#39;t Trump hit Hillary about the Clinton Foundation and her calendar as Secretary of State, and how she spent so much time meeting with Clinton Foundation donors?  Or all the examples of &quot;pay for play&quot;.  Or, the fact that the State Department had to shut off its anti-virus software and spamware software in order to receive emails from her private email server.  Or, how she obviously ducked FOIA with that private email server.</p>

<p>Trump won&#39;t hit her on any legitimate subject.  Instead, he defaults to &quot;Crooked Hillary&quot; and saying things like &quot;she&#39;s crazy!&quot;.</p>

<p>Trump is clearly trying to throw the election.  He doesn&#39;t have the attention span to be president for a month, let alone 4 years.</p>

<p>If you look back at the primary debates, he performs similarly but here he lacks a dozen other candidates to screen him.</p>

<p>If you want to regain living wages, good jobs, and a functioning economy outside of bubble-land; you have to give people like me some freedom.

<p>You try this &quot;muh equality&quot; crap and you&#39;ll send this weak economy straight into the graveyard. I own this business because I&#39;m qualified and I built it. It cost me friends, fun, etc; but I am fulfilled as achieving something bigger than myself and enacting my will in a form that people support.</p>

<p>And before you criticize me as some kind of ruthless businessman, I&#39;m a permaculturist who works with farmers to increase water efficiency, increase yields, and plan property for maximum production in total harmony with nature. I <em>want</em> to create jobs. I want to get more people in on this great trade. It&#39;s bullshit that I&#39;m being kept on the margin because we can&#39;t &quot;disadvantage&quot; people that want to continue to sleep through life. Bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of taxes is that the government shares with you and you pay them for it. Trumps businesses attract greater road traffic, they use public power lines to carry electricity to them, he relies on public pipes to water his golf courses and more. All of those things are paid by taxes yet despite using them and costing the government money, Trump pays nothing. Lowering taxes would mean that you could afford to run those utilities for less, you would be giving away more of your services for cheaper. That sounds like bad business from the government&#39;s point of view.</p>

<p>Ultimately this is because you can&#39;t run a government the way you run a business because a government isn&#39;t trying to make money, it&#39;s trying to provide services and security. If no one pays tax, then it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s absolutely free to open a shop in america, no one will because it&#39;ll have no power, no running water and no street connecting it to the rest of the world.</p>

And some have at the same time a motivation to help society as a hole, so incentive to close the holes.</p>

<p>I dunno what his motivation is, it may very well be as you say.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just trying to give you another perspective.
A rational person uses the system where it benefits him or her, doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t see the ills of it and wouldn&#39;t change it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of his (fan of Ron Paul), but his economics if even only 1/10th will be pushed through would benefit the general public more than any previous candidate i&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>His stance on immigration (as an immigrant) is terrifying, but I think it&#39;s just hot air and negotiation, start with 100 so you can get 60. (there wouldn&#39;t be a wall, no deportation, and muslim ban).
He&#39;s also missing, in my eyes, the benefit many undocumented immigrants have on the economy (unclaimed social benefits on 7 billion *or so paid taxes a year for example).</p>

<p>Bernie was about making Wall St. pay, Trump actually has a transaction tax he wants to put out.
It&#39;s small things.
But he may be the closest thing you have to real change in the financial markets and manufacturing as a whole that we&#39;ve ever been.</p>

<p>These people spend more money and add them back into the economy adding businesses etc.</p>

<p>It all comes around and people pay it back through higher interest rates when you have to reign in the money supply and Treasuries so the government can pay back what it borrowed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not financed by tax revenue since Keynes anymore.
The whole idea of all this QE was adding money into the economy. 
Lower interest rates more borrowing more spending.</p>

<p>and high taxes if you have laws to evade them, or keeps companies from bringing that money home and spending it here doesn&#39;t mean anything.</p>

<p>US has one if not the highest corporate taxes in the world by far, it&#39;s why companies keep their money abroad.
The largest corporations around the world, the biggest profits, all US companies, and the money stays in foreign monetary systems.

    <div class="md"><p>You dont understand taxes, or infrastructure. Police and fire comes from property taxes, which are paid for by the individual owner. Trump has to pay this or he would lose his property. Electric lines are paid for by private companies to bring you power, sewage by the property owner whenever they decide to upgrade. 10,000 dollar assement is not unheard of. Last comment, no offense but you have no idea what your talking about and i have to go to work. Just because he pays no federal taxes and state taxes at the end of the year, doesnt mean he isnt paying sales taxes, real estate taxes, or anything else. </p>

They just wanted the media to showcase a crazy Republican who they could contrast another other crazed Republican against so she would look more electable.

They probably figured Trump would end up losing the primaries despite everything the likes of CNN or MSNBC gave him, and then walk away with a devoted crowd of followers who he could easily monetize. </p>

<p>Now would you say the same for a person who maximizes their benefits from the government? More power to them? </p>

<p>Thats whats happening. I mean I expect to pay <em>something</em> for education and maintaining infrastructure and for every Trump billionaire who doesnt pay taxes to maintain that it gets passed down to people who dont have the resources to legally hide their money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real question is: am I in favor of the current tax system and the answer to that is no. I understand and agree that the current tax system is corrupt and benefits those who have the power to influence it. This is why I am in favor of a flat tax and I am totally against the many ways that the government squeezes money out of us. Having said that, you don&#39;t have to be super wealthy to incorporate yourself as a business in the Caymans and have an employer pay your salary to that business and write off everything you can as a business expense--you just have to take the time to do the research and understand the system. </p>

<p>I also expect to be paying for education and infrastructure and I think any person who wants to see America do well would also expect to do that. The fact is that these are vital things but so little of our tax money is going to them. The way our tax money is spent and the way we are taxed are two separate but massive and important problems.</p>

<p>But that doesnt mean we should reward people for gaming the system which only allows them to have more influence to game the system, it creates a positive feed back loop. </p>

<p>Still unapproachable for 95% of the people in the United States. Not to mention the nightmare in incorporating a US only based company in the Caymans, one of the reasons hedge funds are based there is because they have many customers from many countries. Im sure you also know that if everyone did this then they would crack down on that instantly and I dont have the money to defend myself from an audit. </p>

<p>We are talking about people who make 250k+ yearly and thats on the very very low end to even begin thinking about moving your money off shore. </p>

<p>But are you in favor of people who legally take advantage of the system in other ways including benefits? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with you--I had the same thoughts watching the debate. While I am not a Trump supporter and find him to be extremely poorly spoken and lacking understanding of the issues at times, I loath the corrupt Clinton family and felt like he could have hammered her on so many things but he held back. </p>

<p>I saw many Trump supporters say that he was trying to be presidential and while they wanted to see him attack her on the Clinton Foundation and how she is indebted to multinational corporations, big banks and foreign nationals, they thought he might be saving those weapons for later debates and not wanting to blow his load early so to speak. If he doesn&#39;t attack her on this issues (among many others) in the next two debates, I will be convinced that he is a pawn helping her to win the election.</p>

<p>Compromise?  You mean allowing theft, theft directly from the other taxpayers that have to pay because the congress and senate, our entire government is an oligarchy.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to understand that you can&#39;t force a multinational company to do that. They&#39;ll just relocate in another territory like Burger King did. They&#39;ll just ship the jobs to another country because they can use their foreign money there like Ford did.</p>

<p>And if our government is an oligarchy, what are you doing about it? Gonna go vote for Jill Stein like a good goy?</p>

<p>Good arguments have substance backing up a claim. Good plans are thought through and contain details. You offer neither substance nor thoughtful debate. You think you&#39;re so &quot;woke&quot; working for what has to be minimum wage. Poor, deluded sod. <del>Critical</del> thinking has eluded you.</p>

I feel like he thinks he can just house of cards some scheme to lower taxes for himself and still make all the rules.

<p>Katie Johnson filed to dismiss her current lawsuit just two weeks ago. Likely got paid off. Lawyer promised she would refile later with another witness. Hmmmmm a bit vague. Maybe a signal to Trump to keep losing on purpose or they would refile. If Trump becomes president they definitely would refile. </p>

He could have took her out with emails, Benghazi, her shady foundation etc. Also he went from someone who just a few years ago said she would make a great president, and endorsing her over Obama in 2008 AND donated large amounts of money to her and her foundation to someone who is now on the opposite side of her??? Yeah right. I don&#39;t buy that he&#39;s that incompetent. </p>

Virginia Robertson&#39;s attorney says Trump wasn&#39;t involved with Robertson - my theory is that he didn&#39;t partake of Epstein&#39;s young girls, but would &quot;order out&quot; for his guests - and that&#39;s why so many people are scared to go up against Trump, who seems like a big chickenshit most of the time - he&#39;s got dirt and plenty of it on plenty of people and that&#39;s how he&#39;s managed to skate through as many crooked deals as he&#39;s skated and still not be broke (and also explains other powerful people bailing him out time after time).

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s still two more debates, so let&#39;s see what happens. I have no doubt he&#39;ll spend way more time practicing for the next two. Remember in 2012 when Obama gave the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates, and yet he still got reelected? It was embarrassing at the time, but he bounced back and still won the election. One bad debate for Donald isn&#39;t the end of the world. And one good debate for Hillary doesn&#39;t change decades of corruption and failed policies. </p>

He&#39;s not a politician, he isn&#39;t a professional liar like Hillary is. That&#39;s literally his only redeeming quality, is that he doesn&#39;t know how to cheat and bend the system to his favor the way an experienced politician does. His lacks a filter and tends to say too much, lies come out weak and with nothing to reinforce them, they fall apart almost immediately. He tried to lie about his global warming comment and it came back to bite him immediately.</p>

<p>He never stood a chance, and I think he knows it.
I did <em>love</em> him trying to bargain his audit in exchange for Hillary&#39;s deleted emails, though. The look on her face, lol. Must have not been part of the plan. Atleast he makes it an entertaining puppet show.</p>
