       My crazy wacky wild conspiracy theory that actually helps make sense of Islamic terrorism. If you look at Ireland and the IRA the purpose of terrorism in that conflict was to wear down the population of England to make them tired of conflict while promoting a political path to independence through shinn fein. Islamic terrorism isn't just anger being acted on there is a political agenda behind it. Saudi Arabia hopes to unite the entire Arabian Peninsula under their rule and they're not too far away from accomplishing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saudi Arabia financed September IIth as a means to get the US to invade Iraq and take out Saddam Hussein. We were glad to do it. Gave us an excuse to pass the patriot act and build a means to spy on the entire world. Its even plausible that corrupt members of the intelligence community knew about it and facilitated it. This would explain the entire weapons of mass destruction. Can't believe I'm saying this but Bush was a patsy. Those same individuals fed the Bush administration false information about there being weapons. Keep in mind September 11th took years to plan, meaning that the planning was all done during the 8 years Bill Clinton was in office and then executed less than a year after Bush was sworn in as president.
      </p>
      <p>
       2003 the US invades Iraq and ousts Saddam Hussein. After 10 years of fighting the US breaks the backbone of Shi'a warlards and then retreats from the area creating a power vaccum. This vaccum allows Sunni wahhabist fundamentalists to come in and start seizing control of Iraq and setting converting local populations over to Wahhabism. Keep in mind that Isis and the Saudi Royal family practice the same form of Wahhabism and are backed by the same strict islamic clergy. At the same time Arab Spring pops up and Gadaffi is quickly disposed of so the Saudis see this as an opportunity to quickly oust Assad. With him gone Isis would be able to quickly seize control of all of Syria leaving only Jordan and Israel as the only countries that would offer any real threat to plan on the peninsula. So they call their buddies in the west and we come through and supply arms to freedom fighters (Isis) in the name of democracy, Unfortunately Russia stepped in with aid to Assad so that derailed their plans somewhat and its turning into something of a stalemate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately I see the plan as using Isis as a means to hammer the local populations of those countries down and get them to either convert to Wahhabism or learn to accept it. Once that happens Saudi Arabia with what is now the sixth most powerful military in the world (compliments of the US and Britain) steps in and says hey we can put a stop the the terrorism and conflict. They then pull support from the leaders of Isis, while quickly taking them out because they know who and where they are because they've been funding them. They then step in and take control of a region that now shares their faith and is happy with the slightly more tolerant rule the Saudis offer over Isis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton's get to go home happy hundreds of millions of dollars richer with two presidencies (possibly the beginning of a dynasty) and the support of the United States Military industrial complex behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said crazy wacky conspiracy theory.

       Completely agree.

       If you believe in biblical prophecy, this links up very well with the concept of the Antichrist ruling from Jerusalem. It's also a stated goal of Soros to create Greater Israel.

       If it were structured correctly on their end, they could also likely fulfill prophecies regarding the fifth imam to tie in Islam and if they claim he's the messiah, fool the weak western church into believing he's the real christ.

       I think it's both.  I think isis is a merc group hired by cia to get rid of the establishment control of Syria so that we could take it over and then spread out the fleeing syrians all over the globe so they abandon any notion of becoming insurgents and taking back their country.  Then america gets to 'manage' syria, acting as an interim political DMZ between the two raised up powers and we can build a pipeline between the two where they get to split syria's cheap oil, and when syria runs dry, Israel has an agreement to buy cheap oil direct from their historical enemy saudi.  In other words, syria was a business deal between israel, saudi and us/britian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our plan to cannabalize them, split it up between the two, and eliminate all the other 'lesser countries' constellated around them (and Iran--whom we aren't going to touch), including palestine, iraq, jordan, lebanon.  It's all going to become the united prefects of Saudrael or they will do the opposite and balkanize into quibbling microarab nothingstates, like arabistan, arabizistan, arabonistan, araboctostan, arabrababbabastan, lesser blabrael, rachael, east florida and glormex

       I don't see how. The world would never condone or accept that from Israel. They won't even tolerate Israel getting actively involved with Isis at the moment. However, If friends of the West Saudi Arabia got involved and quickly shut down Isis bringing peace to the region the US and EU would celebrate it as a victory never realizing that they had been conned.

       I think the neocon/likud reasoning is that, if someone else isn't made a regional power, Iran will become it by default. The intention isn't for Arabia to actually become that power, however, but destroy itself trying to, while Israel gradually comes to rule the region militarily, and, through organized crime, the world economically.

       Close, but not quite. SA is just a stop gap to assure that oil trade continues to use the us dollar as a reserve currency while simultaneously acting as a pipeline to funnel resources into all of the terrorist groups we've seen. Their ultimate purpose being to destabilize the region highlighted here:

      <p>
       Eventually, once they cease to provide that service, "the 28 pages" of 9/11 report which "prove Saudi involvement" will be used as a rationale to destabilize saudi Arabia/Iran and give Israel control of the region encompassed by Iraq, syria, Iran, and Arabia...giving them all the oil and land necessary to complete the Zionist agenda of establishing the kingdom of israel.

       I think oil is quickly on the way out, though, and everyone knows it. Saudi Arabia needs the US more than the other way around, especially now that the US has an abundance of natural gas via fracking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The relationship between the US and the Saudis was of mutual interest: destabilizing the Middle East helped improve SA's geopolitical position, and the US's coffers (at least, Clinton's and in the case of Bush, the various corporations who stood to profit tremendously from war).

       Oil is quickly on the way out? Really? Tell that to all the burgeoning developing nations in Africa, Asia, and the middle east that are about to enter their stage of fossil fuel use explosion (similar to China).
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides that though, you should look into what the petrodollar is. Long story short, since Nixon took us off the gold standard, the value of our US dollar is utterly reliant on nations around the world trading oil in USD...so while we can dominate oil trade and for us "oil may be out the door"...our economy is completely reliant on all these other countries continuing to us USD to trade their oil..... that's why the fed feels it can print unlimited debt with no recourse... because oil is most definitely not on the way out, so nations will be forced to buy our debt for the foreseeable future.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why we invaded Iraq and lybia---both Gaddafi and Saddam tried to take mid East/African oil trade off the USD and use the dinar/euro within months of those invasions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that happens, our economy collapses...it is 70% service jobs/consumer products--once people don't have money to waste, and we can't sell our debt (i.e without the petrodollar arrangement) that whole 70% goes away overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we used 100% renewable energy in this country and exported all our oil---were still totally economically dependent on keeping all those other nations under petrodollar hegemony

       Resettling refugees is a way of ensuring the conflict continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       99 out of 100 refugees can be every day people trying to get by, look after their family, and adjust in their new society. Good apples. But all it takes is one who is enraged by what the West did to his homeland to become "a terrorist" and do something like set off a weapon in a public space.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what does this do? Justify more bombing overseas.

       Exactly. It's not some "unforeseen eventuality", it's demographic engineering and Balkanization.

      <p>
       It's a critical part of the plan.

       Do you mean displacing them to western Europe? That's intentional to foment unrest in those nations (ala race baiting in America). When those people are distracted by "the refugee problem", it makes it far easier to remove individual liberties and adopt fascism (like how 9/11 allowed the patriot act or Reichstag Fire and the rise of hitler). It also distracts everyone and allows mass media to completely ignore what western nations are doing in middle east altogether

       If you're implying their resettlement in Syria that's just a short term, symbolic gesture. That country will soon be completely uninhabitable...look at Aleppo now, not even running water, it's going to get a lot worse

       Nearly everything I've seen so far points to fanatically protecting the petrodollar, while encircling, isolating, and neutering Russia/China.  The petrodollar is the only reason America is the lone "superpower", and they're fighting tooth and nail to enforce it.  If it collapses, hyperinflation will destroy us.  Combine this with several important nations defaulting on their dollar debts, and it's game over.   I expect the U.S to act increasingly desperate as they inevitably lose grip on their currency racket.  Obviously, geopolitics is more nuanced than
       <em>
        just

       this, but it seems to be the driving motive behind our seemingly "irrational" obsession with war.  I think this entire "strategy" plays into a larger and more sinister global agenda, though, but I can only type so much at a time...

       I know the feeling. I agree with you, I think there will be a false flag nuclear showdown, false aliens as well, with a false east versus west paradigm, the globalists along with I.m.f and the b.I.s. will bring the U.S to its knees economically. 'good guy' putin will be in the mix in all of this as well.

       Lawrence of Arabia, the seven pillars.

       a pan Arabic nation was the goal for Lawrence and the house of Saud back in 1918, the allies screwed them over and partitioned Arabia into petty kingdoms.

       Israel is the driving force, Saudi Arabia is just the local Arab partner who shares an interest with Israel in destroying Iran, and has been a reliable friend in laundering petrodollars.

       Other than that, the plan to go after Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Iran, etc was laid out prior to 9/11 according to Gen. Wesley Clark.

       I think Libya was for two reasons. First, open up air space for air operations into Iraq and further destabilize the region. Second, squash any chance of Gaddafi's wacky gold for oil ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Syria is Iran's ally they had to be destroyed or destabilized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ukraine, if we helped instigate the revolution there and if we provide them with support, it would be to spread Russian forces thin (this is where I am getting into iffy stuff for fun, the Arab Spring stuff is a no brainer).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then if you have Libya's airspace, no support from Syria, and Russia spread thin, we can go to Iran for Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is US instigation in all of the arab spring revolutions. Also very likely the Ukraine revolution that led to the Annexation of Crimea.

       We have been working towards getting all the countries all those military dudes and conspiracy theorists listed off back at the start of the new millennium. Iran has not been checked off.

       I don't see how. The world would never condone or accept that from Israel. They won't even tolerate Israel getting actively involved with Isis at the moment. However, If friends of the West Saudi Arabia got involved and quickly shut down Isis bringing peace to the region the US and EU would celebrate it as a victory never realizing that they had been conned.

       Completely agree.

       If you believe in biblical prophecy, this links up very well with the concept of the Antichrist ruling from Jerusalem. It's also a stated goal of Soros to create Greater Israel.

       If it were structured correctly on their end, they could also likely fulfill prophecies regarding the fifth imam to tie in Islam and if they claim he's the messiah, fool the weak western church into believing he's the real christ.

       I think it's both.  I think isis is a merc group hired by cia to get rid of the establishment control of Syria so that we could take it over and then spread out the fleeing syrians all over the globe so they abandon any notion of becoming insurgents and taking back their country.  Then america gets to 'manage' syria, acting as an interim political DMZ between the two raised up powers and we can build a pipeline between the two where they get to split syria's cheap oil, and when syria runs dry, Israel has an agreement to buy cheap oil direct from their historical enemy saudi.  In other words, syria was a business deal between israel, saudi and us/britian.

       Our plan to cannabalize them, split it up between the two, and eliminate all the other 'lesser countries' constellated around them (and Iran--whom we aren't going to touch), including palestine, iraq, jordan, lebanon.  It's all going to become the united prefects of Saudrael or they will do the opposite and balkanize into quibbling microarab nothingstates, like arabistan, arabizistan, arabonistan, araboctostan, arabrababbabastan, lesser blabrael, rachael, east florida and glormex
