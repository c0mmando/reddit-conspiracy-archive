<p>I recognize that being an officer of the law is difficult position that requires quick thinking and snap decisions (combined the gradual accumulation of mental and physical fatigue). With this is mind, it also leaves them to make misjudgments on what it and is&#39;nt a dangerous situation. Why not use other devices that at worse simply subdue said suspect without taking their life. If the technology is not there, invest in it.</p>

<p>I know this may not fix the socio-economic structure of the prison-industrial complex but it may ease the tension between cops and citizens and more than anything else, save lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s lack of training via militarization of police. They are trained we are combatants. They separate us and them. You will notice in the media, FF&#39;s and LEO&#39;s report x civilians dead y officers. Truth is, we are all civilians, unless in the military. They are creating this divide (TPTB). Cops now a days, because &quot;terrorism&quot;, &quot;war on terrorism&quot;, or whatever have you, has them scared of there own shadow. A cops job is (I believe) not in the top 10 deadliest in the nation. It&#39;s an agenda. They want a federal police force, or a standing army of civilians. Police are not military, there is a huge difference. Police are also, no different than us. We both are civilians.</p>

People will be pissed about whatever led to the event that caused martial law to be implemented, and then be mad about the martial law itself.

    <div class="md"><p>Because the system of enforcement hinges upon violence when met with any sort of resistance.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s how a system like this one works.</p>

<p>You have a set of rules, and a group of violent loyalists willing to serve the rulemakers.  </p>

<p>The violent loyalists are there to ensure that the rules are enforced, by any means necessary.</p>

<p>It&#39;s that simple.</p>

<p>This age of decadence and incompetence is ironically <em>descending</em> into a state of <em>honesty</em> as it lets go of its veil in favor of grasping its desires more readily, revealing itself for what it really is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a few things - yes of course there&#39;s some merit to the argument that being a cop is a dangerous job and surely the American public has become more agitated and at times it seems more dangerous. But it&#39;s also painfully obvious that lethal force is often unnecessary.</p>

<p>The cops have been systematically trained to act this way, over several years through various means. As mentioned below, Israel played a part in it. Slowly, cops began gaining immunity from reprehension and the entire police culture started to shift - it was allowed to.</p>

<p>Why? I can only speculate. Is it to normalize it in our psyche? If so why would they want to normalize it? What are their future plans? Or is it done to infuriate the masses in hopes of attaining unrest? Why do they want unrest? </p>

<p>Is it just a dividing/fear tactic? Maybe it&#39;s just because some cops wanna kill people and the powerful just don&#39;t care?</p>

<p>All I can say with certainty is that it&#39;s allowed to happen, and we&#39;re supposed to know about it. And I think it&#39;s part of a bigger agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thank you for sharing that splendid example of occupational responsibility and competency.  If that guy were in America, he&#39;d have been killed the instant the first cop showed up... sometimes the police arrive and kill the person even when they don&#39;t have a weapon; they are murdered just because they didn&#39;t immediately follow police commands.  Here&#39;s an article about an American police officer that was fired from his job. Why? Because he didn&#39;t immediately kill someone that was trying to &quot;suicide by cop&quot;. This shows you how cops are being intentionally trained to shoot first and ask questions later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah many countries handle these situations this way, especially if they have a knife. In America though, if you have a knife in your hand, or any kind of weapon and you don&#39;t follow the command of drop your gun/weapon you will be executed on the spot. Even responsible ammo usage is of no concern. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scumbags that are appointed to public office gave the green light for execution of minorities long ago. The police in the US are mostly psychopaths, or sociopaths, or some kind of creature with sadistic pathology. The scumbags in charge keep their power by leashing the sadistic fucks, and using them as an occupying army. This allows the evil fucking ghouls wearing costumes to kill everybody, every chance they get. 
The police are literally the absolute worst, bottom of the barrel murderers that society has to offer. And that goes for every single goddamn one of them. Because if they aren&#39;t committing murder they are covering for murderers, willingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, being from Chicago and seeing as how they have already had like 500 murders this year, and those are only the ones we have heard about, it&#39;s not a wonder cops tend to be on hair triggers.  However, most of these videos we are seeing are almost plain stupidity on behalf of the cops.  And since we are on r/conspiracy, it&#39;s not a wonder that the media only focuses on these shootings.</p>

With the police if you have a phone and they believe it&#39;s a gun they will fire at will and empty their entire clip. If Police just feel in any way their life is in danger every round at their disposal will be fired. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch L.A. Confidential if you want to know how police culture works. That movie depicted a corrupt police department from the 50s. That same culture keeps getting passed down through departments across the country, especially the big departments. It is ingrained there.</p>

<p>You always hear about a few bad apples and why they are not kicked out of the force?  In police culture there is only one thing on earth lower than a snitch, and that is a police snitch. The good cops put their careers, and lives on the line if they try and cross that thin blue line.</p>

<p>Watch the movie if you get a chance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not complacency, it&#39;s that the idea of caring about others on a racial basis for whites has been systematically socially engineered out of our culture. Whites are only to care about other whites if they are friends or family, not because of racial identity and nationalistic pride, that apparently went out of style in the 40&#39;s. Also, black people have a massive propaganda campaign from the likes of Soros telling them that it is their civic duty and racial duty to tell everyone around them that &quot;black lives matter&quot;. That&#39;s a lot of propaganda, and it works. Whites care too, and they would care just as much if billions of dollars were spent trying to get them to care.</p>
