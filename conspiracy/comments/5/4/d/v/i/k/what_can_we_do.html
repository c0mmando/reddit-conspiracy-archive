        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been realizing more and more every day that I&#39;m pretty sure the NWO stuff is true, but the elites of this country have a hold on the majority&#39;s minds so tightly that they&#39;re making it impossible for people to rally together. They&#39;re systematically keeping people away from each other through all media.</p>

<p>What initiated this train of thought is I went to a football game recently. I don&#39;t go to these things often. Although I enjoy playing and watching sports, the type of gang mentality fans have is off putting and annoying so I stay away. But as I was there I noticed how everyone kind of came together, rooting for their team, celebrating together and being disappointed together, encouraging one another when things weren&#39;t going well. Just some beautiful unity. It seems like <em>this</em> is the only type of solid unity this country has, that is tried and true, and money is made off of it. </p>

<p>The media plays off of people&#39;s emotions, and separates people by color and religion. Even when it comes to the family structure of our country, we&#39;re the only developed nation that doesn&#39;t offer extensive maternity/paternity leave for mothers and fathers. It&#39;s clear the government and the corporations don&#39;t give a shit about families, and I&#39;m beginning to think it&#39;s because any kind of solid unity is a threat to their goals. </p>

<p>The citizens of this country are the only ones that can stop all of this bullshit without WWIII breaking out. There are so many people needlessly suffering all over the world at the hands of greed, they&#39;re not even a blip on their radar, just business as usual. I would be surprised if the elite are even curious how many people they&#39;re killing in a variety of ways (starvation, bombing, etc.). We&#39;re on the inside, there is a lot we can do to stop them, but power is in numbers and we just don&#39;t have them right now. </p>

<p>What is going on is a crime against all humanity. They&#39;re aware human beings need a sense of unity, so <em>they</em> create that unity. They have made a little play pen for people to play and quarrel in so the &#39;adults&#39; can take care of what they please at all costs. This is so fucking sick, what the hell can we do? Are we all just fucked or what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried this, just living life, but there&#39;s something inside of me that wants to help. All of the time. I do live outside &quot;the system&quot; I am over all of this bs of black vs white people, cops vs citizens, it&#39;s just dividing nonsense. The truth of the matter is cops kill people of all kinds every day, on purpose and on accident, but lately somehow cops go all crazy on black people when there&#39;s legit information spreading on how Hillary is a puppet. The stories are chosen specifically and then spread through all media so people can get mad and have no resolution. It&#39;s perpetuating, no end in sight. But it redirects everyone&#39;s attention to a social flaw that isn&#39;t possible to solve, it just tugs at people&#39;s emotions and makes them irrational. And then they forget about it and focus on something else to bitch about.</p>

<p>I always aim to be better than I was yesterday, I&#39;ve realized I have to be the change I want to see long ago (thanks to this sub!). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve long left the idea of trying to change people, it&#39;s not my place to determine how other people live their lives. BUT it still doesn&#39;t change how people in other countries are being effected by the lack of self worth or imagination here, and since I see it and the majority of others don&#39;t, I feel obligated to help do something about it. It&#39;s not being taken care of, it&#39;s not being addressed, and the longer this goes unchecked the more powerful and interconnected through out the world it&#39;ll become. </p>

<p>When you&#39;re at a point of elevated emotion yet feel the need to bring about resolution, the first thing you should do is bring about a resolution to your elevated emotion, which stems from your strong attachment to the <em>ideal outcome</em>.  </p>

<p>Letting go of the outcome allows you to address the problem.  In addressing the problem with as much consideration and effort as possible, without the distraction of desire for the immediacy of results, one addresses the problem as best as possible.</p>

<p>What more can one expect of oneself than doing everything possible to address a problem?  </p>

<p>Many problems are larger than a human life.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a human&#39;s job to solve everything.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s our job to do everything we can.  </p>

<p>Each of us has our weight to carry.  </p>

<p>Those that resist their responsibilities and refuse to carry their weight will eventually come to find a future of equal resistance.</p>

<p>&quot;Evil rules the world but it does not control it,&quot; a friend of mine said his pastor told the congregation one Sunday. This sounds right to me -- they may hold the reigns of power, but they do not control our behaviors unless we allow their brainwashing to take hold. </p>

<p>&quot;You can&#39;t force salvation on people.&quot; That&#39;s a line from the movie &quot;Heaven&#39;s Gate.&quot; We aren&#39;t going to be able to save people who don&#39;t want to listen, who don&#39;t want to be &quot;saved.&quot; </p>

<p>Or pushing the revolt rather... Why though? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because if you violently revolt, it will give them pretext to murder you, which is what they want.  They know that revolt is unavoidably going to happen; so rather than try to avoid it, they are trying to channel said revolutionary energy along a path that they have complete control over.</p>

<p>They want you to riot, because they can use that to claim justification for swapping rubber bullets with real ones.  They want you to kill police, because that allows them pretext for more and more police militarisation.</p>

<p>Protest ultimately isn&#39;t the answer.  Things like permaculture and urban farming are; just creating the civilisation we want, instead of screaming at governments to do it for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! There is a lot going on! I&#39;ve been pondering that there&#39;s no way anyone could anticipate what the internet can provide and what it&#39;s capable of, (including the elite) so this is like an experimental phase. They&#39;re trying out different things to see how they can control people and what&#39;s most effective. I think this is the closest our population has ever gotten to the truth since whoever&#39;s behind all of this has started. The narrative <em>they</em> want people to focus on is always being pushed front and center by all outlets, and it&#39;s usually stupid shit that has no conclusion, it&#39;s just something for people to be mad about. </p>

<p>Why are they trying to make everyone so angry? Cortisol, a neurotransmitter in your brain, is what makes people angry. Once it&#39;s released in your brain, it floats around in there and coats all of your experiences with it. Even if you try your hardest to not focus on how angry you feel, 9 times out of 10 you&#39;re still going to be upset about something for a while - it&#39;s the cortisol. We&#39;re utterly mechanical when it comes to emotions, it is crucial to consciously decide what you want to fill your mind with, how you interpret it, and what kind of people you surround yourself with. </p>

<p>Edit: I wanted to point out that living a normal life, you don&#39;t have to consciously decide so much, but in this society it certainly is beneficial if you don&#39;t want to be another slave. Your emotions are meant to guide you, but with how insanely abused media is your emotions are always being jerked around all over the flipping place. We&#39;re shaped by our surroundings, we adapt for survival. But our surroundings are being deliberately shaped for a desired aversion, aka the &#39;play pen.&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>a}  The NWO is currently in the process of falling apart.  More and more people are realising what is going on, and they are not willing to follow along with the deception any more.  Look at any recent American poll on faith in their government, media, or other institutions.</p>

<p>b}  Feminism and the social justice warriors were started by the same people who run the NWO, for the purpose of destabilisation and creating chaos, but social justice ultimately has very little to really do with the NWO, and will continue to exist after the NWO has been completely abolished.  Social justice is a manifestation of the Age of Aquarius, which we have recently entered.  This is also why the SJWs can not and will not be stopped, no matter how much some of us might wish they could be; because the full force of Aquarian energy is behind them, just as Christianity had Piscean energy fully behind it up until around the eighteenth century.  Anyone who tries to stop them, will be doing the equivalent of urinating into the path of an oncoming class 10 hurricane.</p>

<p>The NWO is not a genuine correspondence of Aquarian energy, so it will be stopped.  Sadly, however, the SJWs <strong><em>are</em></strong>, so they will not be stopped.  Contrary to what the SJWs themselves tend to believe, this isn&#39;t because they are genuinely morally right in any objective sense of the word; it is simply because they are one of Aquarius&#39; manifestations.  Aquarius is not necessarily Utopian, contrary to what some people think, either; it is not right or wrong, it just is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just some beautiful unity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unity is only beautiful when the unified group in question consists of less than ten people, and when said people are genuinely of like mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s clear the government and the corporations don&#39;t give a shit about families, and I&#39;m beginning to think it&#39;s because any kind of solid unity is a threat to their goals. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any form of individual or group empowerment that exists outside of corporate control, is viewed as a threat to corporate power.  Corporations make money from deficiency, vulnerability, and helplessness.  If you are self-sufficient, you don&#39;t need to buy crap from corporations; so more than anything else, they want to destroy any capacity that anyone has to be independent.  </p>

<p>They want you to be a miserable, enslaved cyborg with a mobile phone, so that you will continually need to pay them for another thirty seconds of their artificially produced relief from said misery, and they want said relief to be very short in duration and precisely controlled, so that you need to keep putting coins in the slot to get more of it.  They don&#39;t care if you die, because there are another nine billion of us left for them to make money from if you do.</p>

<p>The fundamental, irreduceable motivation behind corporate power, is a need to rationalise their perceived superiority to others.  More than anything else, money is an ineffectual substitute for self-worth, and that is what really drives them.  They need to view themselves as Gods, but they can only do that if they can keep you face down in the dirt, so that they have you there as a basis for comparison with them.  You can&#39;t have Gods without mortals, because without mortals there would be no way of telling that said Gods <strong><em>were</em></strong> Gods.  Nothing has definition except in comparison with something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a) I hope you&#39;re right on this! I mean, I know more people are beginning to see, but with all of this dividing crap lately they&#39;re really pushing people hard to hate. </p>

<p>b) Feminism and SJW are good imo! It&#39;s good that as a society we strive to be better than we were. We do have awful issues regarding racism and patriarchy that can be improved, but what the media&#39;s been doing lately is they focus on only one aspect of a problem and act like it&#39;s the whole - that&#39;s where it becomes ineffective, and they don&#39;t have to worry too much about people really doing anything. </p>

<p>I disagree with your definition of unity being beautiful, but of course we&#39;re going to have difference in opinion because we&#39;re different people. </p>

<p>I agree they try to squash anything that promotes independence, any time something independent gets highly successful they buy it. And if they&#39;re not for sale, it&#39;s very easy to get rid of them in a variety of ways through all types of media. </p>

<p>Your last paragraph, I&#39;ve never thought about it like that, you&#39;re definitely right. I wonder if they really see themselves that way? They would have to be terribly ignorant to think they&#39;re any better than anyone else. It doesn&#39;t matter how much control they have, they just happened to be born into the life they&#39;re in right now. Chance is all it is, they&#39;re not special in any way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in a place where you say Hi to everybody you pass on the street, you hold the door open, you make eye contact and thank someone for holding the door for you. You shake hands and talk to the people on the bench, share your stories. Nobody does that here anymore, so I upped the ante and do it even more today. I probably look like an idiot to some people several times a day. Went out yesterday and a man asked me how I was doing as we passed one another on the street before I could say anything. Simple little things like this have a huge impact on my life. It takes the tiniest shred of effort and brings such great happiness. More of this please.</p>

<p>However, I won&#39;t even try to engage somebody with their phone out, which seems to be almost everyone these days. If you find yourself out in public, resist the urge to pull out your phone for distraction and try to talk and interact with your community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in those conditions as well! My family is still like that, some have adjusted well while the older ones are still clinging a bit tightly to how things use to be. They think people are just raised spoiled these days, it&#39;s sad it brings them so much pain because they don&#39;t know how to make other&#39;s actions make sense to them in a non-offensive way. </p>

<p>I am so glad that happened to you! I also enjoy those types of moments quite a bit. The other day I was in a store getting some food when a lady told me she went up and scared a person sleeping in the lawn and garden section (they were in a chair). We both laughed and chatted for a bit, she was a pleasant surprise! I try to be that kind of person. Where I live is very conservative, so you have to talk to people in a certain way for it to go well. It&#39;s so ridiculous and draining, but when I&#39;m feeling good and have lots of energy (which is rare) it&#39;s effortless and I&#39;m glad to do it. Or there are people that you just feel comfortable talking to right off the bat, that is pretty rare too (like the lady at the store). </p>

<p>I&#39;ll take your advice and try to stay off my phone. When I feel uncomfortable is when it comes out, it&#39;s not too often, but I agree it&#39;s a better choice to try to socialize than to box myself away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have a ton of friends and are fairly active it can become even more difficult, to the point where I would just turn it off so it couldn&#39;t vibrate in my pocket and distract me. Not necessary anymore since I have only kept a small group of close friends. I was on a date once and this girl had her phone out the whole time. I&#39;m sitting there just desperately trying to make conversation with a brick wall, asking about everything under the sun so she would talk about herself or just say... ANYTHING. After I paid I excused myself to the bathroom, collected my thoughts for a second and just walked right out of the place. I wonder if she even noticed.</p>
