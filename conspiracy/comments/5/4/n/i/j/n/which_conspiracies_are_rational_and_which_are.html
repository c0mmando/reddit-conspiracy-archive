       Some people believe all conspiracy theories are faulty, others accept many of them. Which do you believe, and which do you think are lies or misunderstandings?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I believe many of the stories related to business (Big Pharma mostly) coverups and exploitation, but none about 9/11, alien contact, or disease creation.

       There is no earth technically. This is a virtual reality, Earth as a whole only needs to be rendered if someone is viewing it. It's all just 0s and 1s though. Earth is about as real as the planet in world of warcraft.

       I agree about the flat Earthers. I mean, wtf? That stuff is easily dismissed with an ounce of logic and science. I agree that the 9/11 conspiracies are more likely, but I don't believe them. Bush was too dumb to plan that out so perfectly, and there would be more whistleblowers on the issue if the government did it, and I mean a lot more.

       Personally i dont think bush had anything to do with it. I believe it was a secret military coup to get us into a war. I think george bush was under threat of secret assasination if he didnt go along on the day of. But now i sound like a goofy tin foiled hat wearer ;)

       I don't know how anyone at this point couldn't at least admit something was fishy about 9/11.  I mean it goes much deeper than that, but your average person on the street probably doesn't even know a third tower fell that day, let alone that it was obviously a classical controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not quite ready to say no planes were used that day yet as some people are. But it's fairly obvious no plane hit the Pentagon for example.

       I'm entirely uncertain about the third tower or the Pentagon aspects of the attacks, but I believe that there would be a ton of whistleblowers if the government really did the attack, and there are there are very few, and the few who mention it are usually ex-government for a long time beforehand. If Snowden, for example, were to expose it, I'd believe it, as he's shown himself trustworthy in the past and was freshly ex-government (I think, can't remember) whenever he exposed the NSA.

       Definitely some bad ingredients, but many things which are poisons in large quantities are useful in small ones: arsenic has anticancer properties in minuscule doses.

       I think ISIS and al Qaeda were created by the US indirectly, through interference in the Middle East beginning with the Cold War.

       Interesting. I would like it if they did a study of those who hear the voices claimed to be caused by microwaves, and put them in Faraday cages and see if it has any effect.

       It was tested on prisoners in Arizona during the 1990's and from a C5 over Afghanistan before our invasion.

       If anyone ever thinks it's happening to them, the first priority would be to find the source.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the source should suspect anything like a Faraday cage it would be a simple thing to turn it off.

       We armed jihadis to fight the soviets in the 90s. Look it up. They kept the weapons and spread from there. They were no threat until we dropped in crates of AKs and bombs.  There even a video of Shillary admitting that we did.

       For me the rational ones would be the major terrorist attacks in the world that where heavily televised on MSM networks being False Flag's to garner support for Military invasions of the middle east and reduction in Civil Liberties (11/9 New York, 7/7 London, Paris Attacks, Tunisian Attacks etc); Agrochemical &amp; Pharmaceutical dickery (not GM ... but definitely the pesicides used, also lobbying to get Ukraine into EU becasue Monsanto wanted their land (they have really rich soil in parts of Ukraine with is amazing for agroculture)), CIA fucking up shit with assassinations, drug smuggling &amp; money laundering. ... and maybe little less know John Titor (seriously, the science checks out (scientist myself [Phys/Chem]). Oh and this Hillary Clinton BS ... she is going to ruin the world if she gets into power ... but I also think Trump will too, but for different reasons. NASA hiding some really important information (whether it be terrestial or extraterrestial), and active use of cloaking technology.
