       I would have bet all my money that Hillary would have been brought down by now. But she's not, is anyone else freaked out about this? We have proof of voting fraud, significant gov. corruption, media corruption, etc. However, all we care about is BLM, police shootings, etc. 
AND on top of that, all this shit is going down in the middle east, our relationships with China and Russia are really bad, two countries are threatening nuclear attack and the UN is warning about economic collapse....And our government is heading to a government shutdown because we cannot agree on a budget before we reach the spending cap. 
Outside of any wild conspiracy theory, if you look at just simple facts, we are headed or are currently at a really scary time and our future, no matter what route (Hillary or Trump) our future will be much different than we have known.

       This is intentional; George Soros is a major financier of BLM, the DNC, and Clinton.  He's also got a lot of ties to the media.

       It's an example of vertical integration.  Pay actors to enact the news story to put it onto the news to manufacture the outrage needed to push your agenda to get your bought politician elected so you can ultimately turn your will into political policy.

       .   Soros isn't even a Zionist, so what does it matter if he's Jewish?  If he's doing bullshit then call it out.  His ethnicity doesn't matter.

       Only idiots who still trust these psychopaths to tell them the truth when they write their biographies. Soros leads anti-zionist groups so that he can continue running them into the ground. It's called controlled / manufactured opposition. You want your opposition to fail, and the only way to ensure that is by running it yourself and making sure it fails. It's amazing how subversive these people are, and how trusting idiots like

       are that they just trust them when they say they are anti-zionist. Gosh, damn, zionism is not just about Israel, it's a world-view. it's a psychopathic, lust for power that extends far beyond Israel.

       I say they're awesome and we need more of them speaking out. However, I don't mean people like Soros, who say they're Anti-zionist but are clearly lying. That's just manufactured opposition, and it's working really well because of your ideology, that Judaism doesn't matter, that it's Zionism. Now, I've heard these people described as "Rothschild Zionists" because it's a more clear distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I appreciate your question, because I completely understand where you're going with this, because I've had these same questions myself. You're wondering if I'm racist. I don't hate any group of people, I only hate the people who are doing certain things that are really awful. Then you study this group and find that they all support Israel above all else. Then you look into the Israel / Palestine conflict and look at how it is portrayed in American Media, then you look into how they have compromised the media by condensing thousands of companies into 6 media companies that own 99% of all media that reaches your computer, phone, or television. Then you look into that all of these people are heavily invested in ousting Assad, then you read Oded Yinon's
       <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/greater-israel-the-zionist-plan-for-the-middle-east/5324815">
        "A strategy for Israel in the Nineteen Eighties"
       </a>
       . Then you look into the FED and realize all the owners of the FED are zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's a lot to take in, but, there's simply so much they own. Before you say it, obviously poor Jews like myself have no part in this, and I'm only talking about the top 1% of the 1% of zionists who are running things, but let's be clear, they are running things.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I should also mention, that Christian Zionists are a very real thing, and they have played a huge role as well. So, when people say Zionists own America, they don't even mean Jews, they mean Zionists including every religion, as long as they pay their allegiance to the state of Israel and fully support giving them billions a year in weapons, munitions, letting them rule our country via shadow government entities and NGOs like Council on Foreign Relations.

       What I said was that if I believed the people including him that say he's not a Zionist, I would have to believe that he was just a true humanitarian, as in he is just doing all this open borders stuff because he's Mr. international benevolent billionaire or something.

       sorry sorry I misunderstood you, I completely agree with you. His anti-zionist claims are just a front, and I can't believe people buy that.

       Calling it just "the truth" is being disingenuous.  There are a million truths you could mention for any situation or person, but you choose only a few to mention.   Why don't you write ***obama*** for black people and ///bush/// for whites or )))Huma Abidin((( for muslims or ^^^Prince^^^ for people who like to wear purple?  There is some implied meaning besides just the person being jewish with the parens.  Can you tell me what that is?

       Any set of truths or facts can be curated to push a certain point of view. I get what you're saying, and I agree that sometimes it can be used in a disingenuous fashion. But not on this case, not on this sub.

       I guess that's my point.  It's just stupid to categorize people.  I am FAR from an SJW, and in fact loathe them.  Go ahead and look at my comment history.  Creating these gross categories for people and judging them based on that is just dumb and inaccurate.  Just because stupid ass SJWs latch onto ideas and take them to the extreme doesn't mean they are completely without merit.   You are right that we shouldn't get caught up in taking sides on some narrative that others have created.  This isn't about that.  I am not Jewish, but I have plenty of Jewish friends that are certainly benevolent kind compassionate fair people, so I don't see the point in putting parens around their names, so I'm trying to understand why you do it.  How about just making some marking for assholes in general rather than an ethnic group?  Mind you, I don't like the religious side of Judaism, just like I'm not a fan of christianity or islam.   I hate Zionism, and fuck most feminists, just so you don't get confused and throw me in the wrong category with all your pigeon holding.

       Friend, I don't think "SJW" means what you think it means. The concept of "social justice" is derived from Cultural Marxism. Just as (economic) Marxism attempts to tear down all socio-economic barriers, cultural Marxism attempts to tear down all "cultural" barriers (as in organizational culture). Thus we have such maxims as:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        All genders are equal and thus indistinct from one another.
       </li>
       <li>
        All races are equal and thus indistinct from one another.
       </li>
       <li>
        All tribes (gentiles and jews) are equal and thus indistinct from one another.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Do you agree with the statements above? Then you're a SJW.

       And why should you not categorize people? It's a very useful tool in analyzing the state of the world, if you're not noticing patterns out of the apparent chaos, then you are a blind fool and I have nothing further to gain from speaking with you. You have to be a detective in this world -- you have to comb things twice over, you have to inspect and investigate and archive and must PERCEIVE, and most of all, you must think. I am always investigating now because I look at this like I am a detective, and why would it be politically correct to do what is the absolute worst thing as a detective? Simple, because they don't want you seeing the truth, they want you to be a passive and blind sheep, and if you're too busy worrying about offending people and categorizing, then you're not busy investigating their crimes and noticing obvious patterns. You're buying right into the big lie, and worst of all, you're doing it because you think it's helpful. Well, it's not. Start using your God-given brain, be a damn detective and stop censoring your own thoughts because of some guilt-complex that was instilled in you when you were in Kindergarten.

       If I have a box of balls, 30% have spikes and 70% do not, and I want to play catch, I can just say "the whole box is bad" and not play, or I can inspect the balls individually and know exactly whether I can use a particular ball to play or not.  Now, you could say, this box has a lot of sharp balls, just forget the whole thing.  The problem is, every box is like that.  If there aren't any boxes with only good balls, why would you single this one out to categorize?  I find the categorization useless, as it doesn't affect me in my daily life.  Personally, I've found more often than not that the Jewish people I interact with are good people, and that is true of every other race or creed.  Doesn't mean that there aren't Jewish people with a tribal agenda, but the same goes for muslims, germans, football players, and physicists.  I don't see the point.

       Of course there are Jewish people without a tribalist agenda, and that you think that even needs to be said tells me you think I'm some sort of mongrel who hates blindly and recklessly and would be an exterminator if I could just get the opportunity, but this is not so. I am not hateful, and you do not need to be filled with hate to see what is real, and to know it to be true. One does not have to hate something in order to understand the negative reality about it. The reality of the zionists are that they see goyim as cattle, and I need only point you towards Palestine as proof of this. I do not see the need to constantly pain me as the evil person even though I demand human rights for Palestine. Why am I evil? Aren't you evil for consigning the Palestinians to a destiny of genocide at the hands of the zionists? Shouldn't you too, be angry at them for what they continue to get away with, in this modern era of supposed generosity and courage and humanity? Why are we in the Middle East, don't you wonder? Do you do research? Why am I the hateful one for wanting to understand how certain people are getting away with literal genocide? If this makes me hateful I'm proud to be a hate-filled degenerate.

       On the contrary, I think you are the one overly emotional and not being rational about this.  I haven't used the terms evil, or hateful, or racist, or any of that.  In fact my last comment is an attempt to use a mathematical argument to describe my stance on how I decide to judge a group of people.  In fact, I don't think you are insane with your argument and I can see how people can fall in to that line of thinking, but I simply believe it to be inaccurate.  I am not judging you personally, just the argument itself.

Psychological programming perfected to a science; we are aware we are always being monitored, illegal surveilance etc. This has been shown to increase docility and compliance of citizens. We are being funneled into this default compliance mode by more methods than we can reasonably keep track of; some more concrete some more conspiratorial. IE; fluoride in water, feminization of men, 'security state' mentality which leads to more support of government, and so on.

       In terms of government corruption, I believe it's always been this bad. This is just the first time the citizenry has been able to discover it with such ease, thanks to hacking, the Internet, alternative media streams, social media, etc. We're basically peeling back the walls of the government and seeing the cockroach infestation.

       It's gonna take a while to fumigate the place but I think we're on our way.

       In terms of the future, not to be condescending but we're not as bad off as other times in history... think WWII, or in the 50s when students practiced crouching under their desks because it was assumed nuclear war with Russia was inevitable. Or the 70s, when a single piece of paper in the mail practically sealed a person's fate to go fight and die in a humid jungle across the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot that needs fixing but I don't see this time as being so dark.

       Beautiful way to describe the current despair I feel about the system. So corrupt. So hopeless. Even if we manage to fumigate thousands of cockroaches, another thousand will come to take it's place in a short time. It's no wonder James Comey can't indict -- how can the FBI alone go against the

       Because the average person is brainwashed. I've been following the US election since the beginning of summer (Hi from Canada) because of the corruption that is surfacing and the current direction of the world. I discussed what I read with my roommate and in turn in one of his university class and that day talked about Hillary's health being bad and he got laughed at by the whole class. Week later she fell on 9/11 and he brought it up again, the professor and the class went quiet and promptly changed subject haha

       if anything truly bad happens it won't be for long and will usher in a new era of society. the truth is that being in America what you should be freaked out about is the limits that are placed upon you by the people who are in control. For those in the middle East, they definitely have a lot to worry about for the future as it will only get worse. In this world we no longer have full scale conflicts between super powers, instead we fight proxy wars in developing countries by manipulating the people in those countries.

       It's ironic. Your post is why things will never change. You complain about Black Lives Matter and police shootings, but these things are significant; they are a prime example of our government's keenness to beat us and use us. This is a class struggle, and your disregard for other issues is why we'll never break free of this capitalistic mess.

       That's the way I see it as well. The complexity of building a global economy while still ensuring they an their buddies make 90% of the money it produces ended up being too much for them. They failed to ensure 1st world nations that had the most to lose kept their standard of living. So now those nations are starting to turn against globalism. That's all it will take to sink their system as the need the 1st world military to enforce their rule.

       Indeed. At a grand monetary/macroeconomic view, money was handed out by the central banks to the banks, and the banks lent the money out to their preferred sectors/borrowers. Investment capital was not allocated based on local/bottom-up needs of each community/country, but instead, financial capital chased after investment returns to be found wherever the oligarchs were making money. Financial capital piled onto things like real estate, emerging markets, tech industry, biotech, etc etc etc. Financial capital barely flowed down the feeding chain to local small businesses and in general to worker wages. It doesn't help that politicians truly don't give a shit as long as they feel they can get enough votes in their district to keep their jobs.

       the most (including TRILLIONS in stock buy-backs in the last 7 years), and NOT what services/goods are needed the most to support a growing economy. It's a mess, and it is hard to summarize into words.

       The misanthropic response would be that it is because people are stupid and/or lazy, but although that is part of it, it isn't the real reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for a civilisation to survive, it is essential for the people living in that society to have basic faith in the society to be able to protect them and meet their needs.  You will tend to find that people also insist on having that faith regardless of evidence to the contrary, and that is because they have no belief whatsoever in their own ability to be self-sufficient.

       As bad a person as Hillary Clinton might be, most of the American people are emotional and psychological children, even though they might be chronological adults.  Being physical adults, though, they have outgrown the possibility of having their own parents continue to look after them; so they look to government as a replacement for their parents.  This is not intended as misanthropy, because innocence, which is a
       <strong>
        <em>
         good
        </em>
       </strong>
       thing, implies and requires being childlike as a prerequisite, and a characteristic of infantilism is uncritical deference to authority.  A baby views its' parents as the equivalent of God, because they provide everything for it.

       This is also what socialism is, very directly; and you can see how popular that is at the moment.  The people want Hillary to act as their Godmother; feed them, clothe them, act for them, think for them.  They do not believe that they have the ability to do any of those things for themselves.

       Pretty obvious by now that this is all being set up to fail to usher in something else.  Majority people too scared and weak to do anything.  The reason nothing happens to Hillary is a testament to the corruption at hand.  She will be the next POTUS.  It's all an act.  It's all a distraction away from true natural mystic and wisdom that we all posses yet do not know how to use.

       Because everyone is too busy trying to scrape together a semblance of a living while being overworked, sleep deprived, stressed, drowning in debt, trying to raise a family, you name it. Everyone is already pre-occupied dealing with their own intentionally manufactured issues to the point where we don't realize that many of our issues are one and the same.

       <p>
        Why are we allowing all of this to happen?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is a good question; the answer ultimately lies with each of us. Some of us are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       allowing this to happen unsaid, we talk amongst the people who follow the mainstream narrative and point out what's actually going on. We link articles, make arguments, kibitz here and on other forums. Perhaps we attend protests and marches, perhaps not. But the heart of the question is what each of us is willing to do - I know that after the 2000 election debacle, I am not willing to risk my own happiness taking on our entire state as long as 90-95% of my countrymen are unwilling to even vote third party, much less engage in a general strike. I left corporate America, I got a job helping people, and I advocate for people to participate in a meaningful way in the process to try to reverse some of the stupidity and corruption. I speak truth and I don't hurt/exploit nobody - that's my bit for King and Country(and society) as far as I see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that the people who are supposedly our "masters" and are running this system lead incredibly stressful, empty lives and die just like everyone else - frustrated, alone and in their case probably filled with regrets and self-loathing. Life doesn't keep score. We each decide for ourselves our goals and level of involvement reaching them. Remember what Achilles said in Hades; he wished he's lived a long life as someone unimportant. Hell, even with all the power the factions behind these two fuckwits wield, they can't keep the electorate from 70% hating Trump and 90% not trusting Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my question for you all becomes this: You're part of the whatever small percentage of the population with their eyes open is - what are YOU going to do to stop it?

       I've tried to organize all the people I know in order to get something done about everything that's happening a few years back, and everyone is basically freaked the fuck out scared, apathetic, or basically 100% wrapped in ignorance. Those who do want to help, say they don't have much free time because 50+ hour debt slave job, raising new born slaves, and life stuff.

       You know, I tried watching this video but it immediately claimed that cultural Marxism is the same thing as political correctness. Which is bullshit, because PC isn't a left wing phenomenon. I know this because when people complain about PC, 9 times out of 10 they get very offended when I tell them that American soldiers rape women in every war we've ever fought. Some people just don't want to hear the truth when it hurts their fee fees; it's an authoritarian trait. This has nothing to do with Marxism inherently, except that Marxism can be authoritarian.

       Except when they aren't. I grew up in a religiously conservative community.  I know from experience that right wingers will censor your speech just as much, if not more, than others if given the opportunity. I saw a young man get physically assaulted for claiming that Jesus was a commie, so please quit your bullshit I will never buy it.

       First I'll provide some perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry about the president. They don't actually do very much. They are just a face to put on a faceless bureaucracy to make it relatable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voter fraud has been happening since voting. Of course there's proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       The middle east has been shit since colonialists went in there for the oil around WWI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Superpowers never get along. There is always going to be threat of nuclear war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry. If you have internet, chances are you won't suffer mortally from an economic collapse. The government will always agree on a budget at the last minute, they been doing this last minute game every year since 911.
      </p>
      <p>
       The future is always going to be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I know what you mean when you point out all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we allow all this to happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mostly because we don't believe that we can change things. Or we believe that it would be too much of an inconvenience to our comfort. Or there's the less accusatory, things are changing for the better they are just happening incrementally. And that just happens to not be fast enough for everyone.

       I don't know how you specifically want the world to change. Narrow that down for me and I can make some real suggestions for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me that means working in education, because it allows the opportunity to call out the oppressive aspects of the education system at the source, even though in some degree I'm enabling the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Working on opening my own school &amp; living space. Also working on a mass production solar distillation design.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it wasn't education it would be working for a local non-profit or charity. That may mean being homeless because I'm not getting paid enough. Not that education pays well. All sacrifices I'm willing to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means growing my own food, purifying and filtering my own water, creating my own power, maintaining my own network, using alternative currency, and helping others to do the same and related things.

       No reason for anyone to "do anything". Police shootings, threat of nuclear attack, government corruption, are all issues that don't really have a direct obvious affect on anyone. Choosing what to eat for dinner literally has a bigger affect on my life than the rising threat of nuclear war. Until it happens, of course.

       Not to mention that most people doubt they can actually change anything. There are way more incentives to do other things like worry about your career, etc.

       Its all because Soros social engineering works. He manufactures consent in the news to fool the average joe that this shit really is tolerable. Its not. We need to kill about 10 people and all this nonsense will be water under the bridge, and we can all move on as a human race.

       The ultimate conspiracy is the one where you think someone is in control, when the reality is that no one is in control of shit. But nobody pays attention to Greek myths and dramas and their awareness of the hubris central to being a "civilized" man. Nature, the contingency of the universe, time are all more powerful than any cabal of people playing at puppetmaster.

       Not sure your age range but this pretty much has been happening most elections since I was old enough to vote. It's always the same shit and then we get a new president and some new toys or scandals and everyone is fine. I mean some of the worst shit already happened a president or two ago. Why everyone is working themselves into a frenzy I just don't know. It's like everyone has amnesia. Scary.

       If it wasn't education it would be working for a local non-profit or charity. That may mean being homeless because I'm not getting paid enough. Not that education pays well. All sacrifices I'm willing to make.
