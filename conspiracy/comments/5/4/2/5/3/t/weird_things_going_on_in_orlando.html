        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys,
I&#39;ve been noticing, over the past 8 days or so ridiculously heavy chemtrails, and heavy air traffic. The air traffic doesn&#39;t usually concern me as I do live by an airport. But these planes are flying low and fast. These planes are big like military transport carriers.</p>

<p>It just feels eery out here. I wanted to put this hear just I case something does go down</p>

<p>Have any of you been experiencing this?</p>

<p>P.S. This is my first post to this subreddit, but I have been reading it daily, constantly refreshing between hot and new.</p>

<p>Edit: I will attempt to get a picture of what I am going to say next. This happens in the morning.  A low flying plane that looks like one of those drones I see them using over in the Middle East. It doesn&#39;t fly parallel to the ground.  It looks like it&#39;s flying upwards at an angle, like this / , but it&#39;s actually flying straight.</p>

<p>Again I will try to get a picture of this tomorrow. I have seen this plane for the past 2-3 days.</p>

<p>Edit 2: i believe I have figured out what type of plane was flying over in my last edit. It looked exactly like an E4B.<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4</a></p>

<p>I saw a picture of it while looking at defconws Twitter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right.</p>

<p>According to the live flight tracker, there are several aircraft flying over Orlando without call signals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/AS50/b16be2d">https://www.flightradar24.com/AS50/b16be2d</a></p>

<p>No call signal is often military or security.  FBI is usually registered through a private company.  HSA is generally registered directly.  Sometimes high profile aircraft will be spoofed and you&#39;ll see it jumping around on the map.</p>

<p>edit:  here&#39;s a jet that appears to be spoofed.  probably military: <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/RDDL437/b16c5b9">https://www.flightradar24.com/RDDL437/b16c5b9</a></p>

<p>it&#39;s cool to watch them overhead.  you can see exactly where the should be, but the secure ones are intentionally untrackable.</p>

Two nights ago 3 helicopters flew over,in about 20 minute intervals. I think they were military because of the &quot;thwump thwump&quot; sound they make.Kinda Curious now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Port St Lucie and work in Riviera Beach. There is the usual air traffic because I&#39;m in between Miami and Northern big cities with airports. However the past few months I have seen military grade choppers flying in formation, very low flying jets, and at least a handful of single prop planes (don&#39;t see many single props here). The scariest was when I saw 3 military choppers (looked like blackhawks) hovering over a forested area as I was driving down i-95. I&#39;m with you man. I really really am getting an eerie feeling lately. I&#39;d post videos or pictures but it&#39;s never a good time for me to be blessed to take a picture or they go out of view. Honestly the the planes and stuff I&#39;ve seen I couldn&#39;t really care about. Yeah it&#39;s more traffic than usual for my area but, choppers? THATS when I know one thing is up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the time there&#39;s not two psychopath&#39;s running for president though.</p>

<p>There&#39;s obviously tensions with foreign countries, there&#39;s racial tensions, people in the military are reporting Martial Law training, there&#39;s an excessive amount of jets in the air over certain cities, both the presidential candidates are horrendous, one of them is basically immune to laws. We have also had consecutive record temperatures this year, and it repeats every year.</p>

<p>You honestly have to be pretty blind to think that this year is normal.</p>

<p>I was just talking about what ideas people are throwing around. I didn&#39;t say all of them are going to happen, in fact the only ones likely to happen are either a war of some sort, or tensions get so bad from things like lack of gasoline or food, or racial tensions, or even under the guise of a &quot;imminent attack&quot; of some sort, that we get put under martial law.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just entertaining the idea and saying what is most likely out of this list. &quot;Most likely&quot; doesn&#39;t mean 100%. It means it has the greatest chance. That chance is still really low. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m dropping out of college and selling all my belongings because of this, and it&#39;s not like I recommended it.</p>

<p>Like I said, something is happening. We should all know the US is fucked with either president.</p>

<p>Study that graph and realize why xkcd started at the absolute minimum in earth&#39;s history. Hint: propaganda.</p>

<p>If this time it was industrial revolution, what was the reason last time it spiked similarly? Or before that when there were hundreds of millions of years where it kept warmer than today, significantly warmer even after &quot;industiral revolution spike&quot; we currently experience?</p>

<p>After this is clear to you i recommend you go and research measured temperature vs. published temperature (after it is massaged through their climate model).</p>

<p>Gun confiscation is one of the first things you will see once martial law is declared. Probably in sync with a mobile&amp;internet outage so that you cannot inform others that they are doing it.</p>

<p>Protesting does nothing, we have become to lazy and have allowed our government to become too big to control. We have no power atm, voting doesn&#39;t matter and protesting doesn&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>I am honestly scared that America might be headed toward civil war along with ww3. Actually that brings up a great point. I remember hearing the other day how our military is so weak that it cant fight wars on two fronts. At the time I was watching it, I didn&#39;t think anything of it. Until I made that statement. Maybe they are worried about WW3 and a civil war at the same time?</p>

<p>Who did you hear that from?</p>

<p>When they want to initiate marshal law, it will cause a huge amount of caos and violent clashes in just about every city. But trust me when I say this, the US government is not at all worried about having enough military personnel to suppress outspoken citizenry. When the White House declares a state of emergency, citizen rights are totally forfitted  (curfews, financial limitations and rules will be announced and enforced). Martial law would be instantiated. </p>

<p>At this point, the military and police partner up. About 80 - 100% of all police officers in every town and city will work on behalf of the military -- depending on domestic policing needs. These morphed agents will likely wear &quot;military police&quot; outfits, or at least military uniforms with the Police label on the front and back.</p>

I won&#39;t try to say that the government wouldn&#39;t stoop that low, because they absolutely would, but just from a purely logistical viewpoint, using a crop-dusting method for dispersing any sort of chemical to affect humans would be extremely ineffective. There would be way too many things that could go wrong: different people need different levels of dosage, there would be different affects on plants or animals, there would be physical residue on surfaces that wouldn&#39;t absorb the chemical, and more. </p>

<p>A few far more effective methods would be to simply add the chemicals to any food or beverage to your target group. You could get very specific dosages, you wouldn&#39;t risk it affecting the surroundings, there would be almost no physical evidence. It&#39;s just way more logical.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got a small airport (nearby US airport destinations only) and there are no bases in the area. In the past month we&#39;ve been buzzed by jets and low flying craft, and the hills have pulsed and echoed with the unique WumpWumpWump of low heavy copters as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Space Coast resident here. I also live in South Florida part time. Lived in Orlando for a year too. Can confirm, huge increase in military traffic (both armored vehicles and [mostly] aircraft) over the past couple months. I live near a Pratt Whitney plant, and, let me tell you, they have Blackhawks flying in and out of there like taxi cabs. 10+ times daily a Blackhawk will fly over my house. Patrick Air Force Base loves flying their huge cargo planes (like the C-17) and Blackhawks (in low altitude formations of threes or fives) all over Melbourne and the vicinity. A couple weeks ago when that SpaceX rocket shit itself, I heard sonic booms from jets travelling up/down the coastline. </p>

<p>Regardless of why, there has been, and still is, a very noticeable and ever increasing military presence in Florida. But that&#39;s nothing (although very close) compared to the presence found in New Mexico. Let&#39;s not forget about Jade Helm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  A lot of the traffic of the low flights I&#39;m coming up with are a company here that offers flight lessons, call signs CONN then a number. They might be offering flight graduations today or something, I&#39;m not sure how that works.</p>

<p>But there are also some that are flying the telltale infinity loop of FBI domestic surveillance planes. They&#39;re a prop plane that just keeps infinity looping Sanford and Lakeland.  Might still just be training planes. Still a lot more low traffic than I&#39;ve ever noticed.  At one point 4 out of the 5 planes just northwest of Orlando had no destination assigned.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last Night, air space was completely clear except for a single AS350.  No call sign, no destination set, and no airport set for takeoff (but tracking the route it&#39;s out of Sanford). Flying very low over and over.  </p>
