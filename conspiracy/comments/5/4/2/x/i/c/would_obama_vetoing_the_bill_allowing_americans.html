       ,
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/53zwfp/president_obama_will_veto_bill_allowing_911/">
        President Obama will veto bill allowing 9/11 families to sue Saudi Arabia, White House spokesman confirms
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it mentions Saudi Arabia in the story, but when I dig a little it doesn't seem to be specific to Saudi Arabia. Indeed, the subtitle points at this: "Josh Earnest says the bill will open up US citizens to lawsuits from all over the world"
      </p>
      <p>
       So does this effectively kill the legal threat of any kind of truth movement? Did Obama just act to protect the real perpotrators of 9/11?

       Obama is trying to protect the US and its people from massive amounts of frivolous suits and/or being held to the laws of other nations. Its smart. If we can sue Saudi then whose laws apply? What court is it held in? Who is the judge? What punishments can be carried out and by whom? Can the ruling be appealed? These are all questions out legal system answers, but in a multi national lawsuit the US may be held to standards we don't even hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole argument is pissing me off. It has nothing to do with 9/11 except that some PEOPLE want to sue another NATION. How would those people feel about a counter suit for all the damage we caused their nation during war(s)?

       I don't think AE911Truth has any interest in bringing lawsuits against foreign countries. Their interests lie mainly in the science of how and what happened on 9/11.

       From my understanding, that was true prior to this bill being discussed here. I don't have a link to the new bill but I'm sure it's easy to find for anyone interested.

       The fairy tale that those "money and power" people told you is the lie.  You don't matter.  It's all random.  Few people speak the truth.  Why do you reject what they stand for but believe every word they ever told you?

       I'm telling you that your notion that "when you die you just cease to exist" has been hammered into your head by a controlled culture of a satanic nature.  The elite know the truth and they are satanists.  You've been hoodwinked since birth.

       Actually i was indoctrinated into a religion since birth and snapped out of it over time through logic and reason. You can base your life around something that has zero physical evidence all you want. I believe what i see in front of me. Until there is physical evidence that you go somewhere after you die then i will continue to deny the fairy tales.  Do you believe in unicorns and leprechauns too? What about the tooth fairy and santa clause?
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly have i been force fed to make me believe there is no "god" or "afterlife"? I believe they dont exist because there is zero evidence that shows they exist. Science is my religion. GTFO.

       Remember when people used to think witches were real and would hang people who they thought were witches? You probably think those people were crazy nowadays. Well in 100 years we will look back at people like you as the crazy witch hunters.

I don't know if your reading skills are sub par or what but I just want world peace so people can do whatever they want. Good job inventing fairy tales.

       "Started to see this big picture" Big picture of what? An invisible man in the sky who watches everything you do? Do you go to church on Sunday, hold hands and sing songs about world peace and think it's altering reality? GTFO. Religion is their #1 tool for controlling the population. Anyone that thinks otherwise is a brainwashed sheep. Label it whatever you want, Atheist, Agnostic, Science whatever. Truth be told humans need compassion, humility and sincerity. That's it, that's all. We dont need fairy tales to tell us what to do and what not to do.

       "Blind Faith is cute." I would say you opened up the can of worms right there. See what you believe in is not based on any facts. You are just assuming you have all the answers when you dont. If i come across as a dickhead it is most likely because you had very poor wording had me thinking you meant "I used to be Atheist but i was saved". I have no problem with anything that anyone chooses to believe. Whatever gets you through the day without dieing or living in pain, go for it. I feel like we got off on the wrong foot and are probably somewhat similar minded in many aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say science is a religion? I was not meaning it is an actual religion when i made the reference. When i say science is my religion i am saying I believe in what i see, hear and feel. I believe in what we can prove. I'd say i believe in spirituality but that would be a lie. The truth is I dont know. I dont have the answers. Neither do you. I am ok with not knowing. When we starting thinking we have all the answers we stop looking. We are at a point in history where people need to snap out of it and look hard at what is going on in the world. We can change our course but not if everyone thinks about some mind over matter bullshit.

       Ya no shit they've taught people tons of beliefs that make people act like fools. How can you say mind over matter isn't the key when you're saying everyone should "snap out of it" is that not using your mind to defeat the matter? lmfao. The holes in your logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is one piece of knowledge that removes all doubt and makes you not care and it has to do with God. It's not blind faith it's knowing in intuition. If you follow the facts it all comes to prove it. I am showing all how to beat it read my facts. Fruits and veggies cure all. There are inter dimensional beings in our reality. I don't know a lot but what I do know is the one truth. There is no reason to fear or doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe what you perceive is off base because you haven't contemplated other possibilities. I was saved. The imaginary big man on top let me into the highest perspective of the world. Spirituality is the only thing you have to believe in to figure it out. Spirituality, how the world makes you feel, pull a bunch of facts together. You say you perceive the world as "i see, hear and feel" No you're wrong because that's how I perceive the world. You perceive the world based on what other people have told you. I do agree people need to snap out of it but I am telling you mind over matter is the way you figure it out. If you beat your mind you realize the matter is nothing. What do I need for happiness? Marijuana and food. What does the world teach I need for happiness? All of this bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love how you talk down about me in numerous ways and don't attempt to see it from a higher perspective at all. I pity you sad fool. Everything you perceive you like, everything you perceive that you don't like you perceive as "lesser." You talk down nonstop.

       I just sent you a picture of space aliens all around us, yes I ignore all facts. No what I did was follow my intuition to see if what I felt the world was, was true. Turns out all the facts are all around us they are just labeled as "pseudo science" or thrown off by mainstream. All the facts are everywhere just open your mind. We are all knowing Gods you just have to stop perceiving the illusion and get past all the crap you're currently stuck in. I don't give 2 shits about any part of the world, you can't change corruption trust me you can't. You can shine light on it for the masses because they have to really wake up, but judging by the masses I don't think they will. I think that the world is going to change itself tbh. The new world order is going to come out good.

       You can only come to the one understanding by following intuition, facts, and logic. You can call what I know a coincidence it doesn't bother me. I realized all the holes in my own logic to reach the only one true piece of knowledge, the one piece of information destroys all others. You say you don't believe in spirituality or mind over matter yet you say things like.

       So basically all I'm getting from all of this is you live in some fairy land you invented where you think all the things you think because your mind over matter. You just use mind over matter to win your argument and then bash mind over matter when it takes you to a place you don't want to go.

      <p>
       To me you are a weak minded coward. You think people are scared of thinking that there is nothing after death. I think the latter, you are a scared person for thinking there is nothing after death. You are scared of thinking we are the only thing in the universe and everything else is just a part of ourselves. That's the truth. In spirit form we can go to any world we choose. When we get there we may or may not remember what we are. We are everything in different forms experiencing reality in different worlds in different bodies and in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say I'm wrong but to you I'll go back to the first point. You don't believe mind over matter yet you use mind over matter to justify all those first points.

       You are completely twisting what im saying to make yourself feel "right". You cant just pick a term like "mind over matter" out of a sentence then criticize it out of context. Are you a fucking politician? You're a politician arent you lol.

       People need to mobilize, not pray to whatever the fuck god they believe in or whatever sort of spirituality belief system is hindering their vision. I honestly dont think it's possible at this point because too many idiots are praying and singing songs or meditating and doing Yoga instead of rallying and marching on the white house. Gathering and marching on the whitehouse is not "mind over matter" lol.

       No but that will only be a band aid fix. You say I am twisting but you fail to understand that everything you are saying doesn't apply to me. I can't pick out anything you have said to me that describes me or things I do. For that matter I think you're an idiot. Still once again everything you just said doesn't apply to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't do yoga. I don't meditate I think. You think spiritual belief systems are hindering, such a joke. You think I am twisting things out of context but you fail to understand everything you have said, all the comments you have written attack me in some way. Every time you attack me other than calling me names you haven't described any of my beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       First you said shit about free will, then you said shit about you smoking weed, cool I smoke weed. Then you talk about church, cool I don't go. Then you talk about praying and chanting to God, cool once again I don't. Then you talk about all the other shit you talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you say anything with any spiritual significance can't be used as a source. You are like the master hypocrite. Laughable. Destroy your ego you'd wake up to a way higher reality, trust me. Do magic mushrooms and think. You have so many contradictions in your head. Then you say things like

        Gathering and marching on the whitehouse is not "mind over matter" lol.

       Actually yes it is. They are sacrificing parts of their day, parts of their lives to have a better life. If you think it's matter over mind you'd keep the enslavement going and take the material goodies they hand you. You have decided with your mind to sacrifice things to create a better tomorrow. That's entirely mind over matter. Those mind over matter decisions are premeditated and controlled from the outside is what you fail to do. Why don't people do that? Because the people manipulating reality from the outside are saying it's not time yet. One day they will decide it is time and make it possible for you all. Only a person who believes mind over matter would be able to manipulate you all like this. Even though you believe yourself to be awake until you unravel society and see how we live in a dream, within a dream. Maybe even within a dream again. The dream the world is living in, is manipulated by the second dream you are slightly accessing. The dream you are accessing is manipulated by another dream. I see it as like 3 main dreams the world is in. The 4th dream is the infinite others would describe as God. There you learn we live in all possibility and are infinite souls.

       I dont understand what this proves? It proves you fall for bullshit click bait. The fact you base your entire life around one "news" article accompanied by your own intuition kinda boggles my mind. Please keep digging yourself a deeper hole, this is hilarious.

       If you get in touch with the Aether in the air it'll teach you things. Perceiving the world with the mind is nothing compared to perceiving it with the spirit. I can't tell you because you perceive the world with the mind. If you perceive it with the spirit you will see how we live in a massive machine and controlled from the outside.
