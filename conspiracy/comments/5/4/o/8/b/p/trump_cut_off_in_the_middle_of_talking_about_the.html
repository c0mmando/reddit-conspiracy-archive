    <div class="md"><p>I was watching a local CBS affiliate on DirecTV, and mine did not cut that I noticed. He said the fed is basically keeping rates low artificially for politics and that as soon as Obama is out of office they&#39;ll adjust and it will be a shit storm (paraphrasing) that the economy can&#39;t currently bear without a leader with business sense. Did anyone miss any of that, or was there more that I didn&#39;t notice was cut?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I missed everything from &quot;as soon as Obama is out of office&quot; forward. I was watching the live stream on Trumps own website too lol. So was my brother and it cut off for him in the exact same spot on that question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which isn&#39;t exactly true. I though the FED was keeping interest rates low because if they raised them even just 1% no one would lend money. Pretty much from what i understand a company can go to a bank, loan as much as they want (interest free) and with quantitative easing put everything they loaned as an investment in their same company which shows an increase in their stock and subsequently pay back the loan with the stock profits they themselves propped up. The FED then prints more money to justify the practise. This has left the bond market in ruins (as no one in their right mind would buy a bond that has no interest when it matures). The theory is that the FED has to raise interest rates so people will buy bonds again. The fear being once the interest rates raise the propped up economy will equalise and crash the stock market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What Trump said was true. The fed is keeping rates low so that the government and business can borrow as much as they want without that much debt and financial repercussions. If they raised the rates it would be less than 1%(.25-.5%). Quantitative easing is used by the fed to buy federal bonds and they aren&#39;t exactly interest free. Fed is keeping rates low to keep our economy on life support. It allows them to print more money which will lead to inflation. Low interest rates only help the government and large corporations. The fed(under Yellen) does not want to raise rates for political reasons(make obama look good and help him squeeze as much money/tax dollars out of our economy to enrich his friends/the elite).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did say &quot;acting political&quot;. He went on to mention that once they start raising the interest rates we will have a shtf scenario. It&#39;s funny that Hillary is trying to make trump ramble and look like a buffoon but it just makes him look like a more powerful speaker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I heard. I didn&#39;t notice any lost time however and I watched an online stream.</p>

<p>I think Trump was implying the Fed was supporting the Democrats by propping up the economy with crazy low interest rates and as soon as the election is over they hike the interest rates and SHTF.  I think Trump is right on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree he was spot on. Shill and Holt were trying to gang up on him but I gotta give trump props he stuck to his guns and I saw a person in control. You can say what you want about Trump but hes a business man at the end of the day. He doesnt sugar coat I can respect that.</p>
