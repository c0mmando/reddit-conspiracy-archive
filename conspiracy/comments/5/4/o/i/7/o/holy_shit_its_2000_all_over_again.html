    <div class="md"><p>Yah I agree. I couldn&#39;t believe Hillary had the audacity to bring up the tax return and accuse him of hiding things and say that we need to be worried about what Trump would hide as President once elected, and he didn&#39;t even make mention of the massive team Hillary had hiding her official business, emails, burning calendars, failing to report foreign donors, I mean he could have turned that one on her so hard it would have created its own gravity. That was the most blatant projection I&#39;ve ever seen in public and although he did repeat the sound byte about I&#39;ll turn it over when you turn over your emails, he could have made it much, much worse for her than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it, sort of. Cooperation with Israel means that the US doesn&#39;t necessarily have to scramble jets from an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, which would be less cost effective and have a longer response time (badically). Mutual enemies ensures that the nukes will land where they want them to.</p>

<p>But Israel is not an ally, it is an opportunist. The majority of the American people do not desire death and destruction in the middle east. Israel is a rogue waiting for the perfect opportunity to place a dagger in the back of the US military machine, which is why they get their dicks sucked so often.</p>

<p>Part of me wonders whether it is possible that all of this corruption is truly in the interest of the peopke, that we would be able to live with the ramifications of the US, and consequently NATO, not being a global force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>Isolationism, nationalism, and xenophobia is starting to sound like a great idea. Unilateral cooperation with Russia is starting to sound like a good idea.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I honestly believe this was all part of the plan. Not his plan or her plan, more likely the Rothschild plan... the master plan.</p>

<p>The office of president needs to be eliminated entirely or seriously reevaluated and amended constitutionally. Congress is corrupt, and should be required to have a 2/3 vote if not unanimous agreement to pass any law whatsoever. POTUS has too much power and not enough. The power to drop bombs on any piece of land they like, but little to no power in the creation of legislation.</p>

<p>My daughter said the other day, she thinks a potato would make a better president than Donald Trump. I tend to agree with her.</p>

<p>A potato cannot make the executive decision to invade or attack a sovereign nation. A potato cannot issue an executive order to drone strike a wedding in the middle east because consistently flawed intelligence implies a person of interest will be in attendance. <strong>A POTATO CANNOT SIGN A BILL IN TO LAW</strong></p>

<p>LBJ vetoed more legislation than any president in history, and I believe that is the most important function of POTUS. We need to stop letting corporatist politicians drive this country off a fucking cliff for the sake of corporate interest, the military industrial complex, and political control of the middle east.</p>

<p>World War III is on our doorstep, and all anyone seems to care about is Colin Kaepernick and whether or not Brad Pitt abused his children (he did, but so do <em>a lot</em> of people.) We need to be worried more about the hundreds of children who were brutally murdered in acts of war in Syria <em>last week</em> that were perpetrated by the two oppositional global super powers.</p>
