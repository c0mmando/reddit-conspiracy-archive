       But you can't find one anywhere - Reddit used to the place to go for this, but now it is an absolute clusterfuck of shills and paid off mods.  We need to find a solution the problem of Sybil spamming as soon as possible, as there is really no reliable place to learn about world left... And it's only going to get worse from here.

       Tbh this is correct. There was no depth what so ever in last nights debates.  It was total and complete political theatre.  Trump did touch a bit on the economy and bringing money back in to the US but did not provide a plan todo so.  Other than that it was just a tennis match of character assassination.

       I wouldn't believe it (because Reddit is mainly young leftists) but I saw it with my own eyes. One day the sub was pro-Bernie, barely luke warm about Hillary, and they called her out constantly. Basically overnight it became a place where criticizing Hillary was tacitly verboten.

       They were clearly trying to force the narrative that bernie supporters moved on to clinton. They tried too hard. The media pushing that narrative along with the censoring of bernie supporters at the convention; clear as day.

       Oh, I actually did. Then Bernie dropped out and to my shock, the sub kept going after Hillary. Then one day, near the RNC I think, it changed almost overnight. I saw weird usernames, the /new page was flooded with repeated articles like never before, and the entire time of the sub changed. I saw I firsthand.

       Yeah, because the political stances we have in high school should dictate what we're allowed to believe 50 years later.  Hillary campaigned for Goldwater in high school.  She's now 68 years old.

       I never even saw that election fraud in Kentucky Post until this morning, and it's because I have visited the Hillary for prison sub. Does cooked mods allowed multiple versions of the same article to get to their front page, they make damn sure they delete anything that has to do with election fraud

       So many angry Trump supporters in conspiracy lately. They can't believe that their imbecile of a candidate propped up by 4chan trolls is going to get beat by a career politician with the support network of the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pendulous nutsack of politics slapping them in the face has them completely blinded and thinking that by relativity Donald must be a good choice because Clinton is so awful. They're both subhuman filth but supporters can't maintain the cognitive dissonance it takes to recognize the farce and keep existing. Challenge their lack of substance and legitimate opinion and you get nothing but down votes and echos of,"REEEE" from across the internet. Because if you hate Donald you
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be shilling for Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       This election is a great display of how fucked we are and it has almost nothing to do with the candidates.and everything to do with the dipshits that refuse to recognize the game and how they're being played.
      </p>
      <p>
       God forbid you try to make it a discussion because the best you'll get is a bunch of clucking and,"lulz idc it's all bullshit."  As though their opinion of no opinion somehow justifies a blind support of whichever fuck head or makes them different from the other side.

       Idc if it was trump or anybody else, the current government is  beyond corrupt and needs to be stopped. If its all a show, oh fuckin well i will still vote against the current administration 100%. Democrats have proven they are corrupt elites so ill give the other side a chance, i really dont give a shit. This current economic nightmare needs to end.

       Donald Trumps campaign is funded by Jews who want you dead and the_donald subreddit was made by Jews in order to scam cucks like you. There is nothing organic about this. And before you say it I don't see why pointing out they're Jewish as being racist, maybe they should stop subverting movements and then begging for money. You think any of this is organic? (((Bernie)))  was just as fraudulent. The whole thing is a puppet show and everyone is just voting on empty speeches not even written by the people presenting them.

       I made an account so I could curate my own front page in effort to cut off all the nonsense. I have no idea what all looks like at the moment. What I do know is 3 or 4 months ago a quarter of the front page of all was cuck cuck cuck nonsense troll posts.

I can tell by all the down votes that noone is interested in any kind of discussion or actually touching on the problems of the ilk masquerading as leaders. You just can't stand the droning sound of your fuckwit peers clucking being drowned out by a real political machine.

       Trump objectively had way more "news-worthy" statements last night. Hillary was very routine and pretty straightforward. You can't make thirty articles about how she was exactly what was expected. You can, however, make thirty articles, each about a different unexpected statement Trump made.

       It was underwhelming, if it makes you feel better. Read my synopsis with the understanding that I loathe Clinton as a candidate, and mildly dislike Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was on the defensive for most of the debate, which surprised me. He spent a lot of time defending his business practices and tax returns. He was pretty short of ideas and actual substance. He didn't call Clinton on a lot of the shit that he could've, and should have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton managed to stand for 90 minutes and not look like a person suspected of Parkinson's. It's sad that's a highlight, but there we go. She side-stepped Trump's quips as if they didn't happen. She also made Trump look uninformed (like when he brought up stop and frisk as a legit policy option).
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched the debate hoping for much more drama, but it didn't happen. I think we've been spoiled by an election full of incredible twists and turns, but this debate wasn't one of them. It was rather boring. Neither candidate made me want to run out and campaign for them, or convince people I know to vote for either one. In terms of excitement and general bombastic rhetoric, this is on par with any election year's debate.

       Still kudos for Trump for calling out the Fed and Yellen, massive debt crisis and looming mega-collapse, the TPP and NAFTA, and name-calling Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Clinton was under much less pressure no questions about; Benghazi, Clinton Foundation, Emailgate, Shwartzmen Conspiring in the DNC, Bill's sexual harassment lawsuits. The best Trump could do was raise these issues in his counter/attacks.

       Almost all of those have been burned out on the American public. No-one cares about Benghazi, Clinton Foundation is easily deflected by counterpoints on Trump's charity actions, emailgate is also overplayed ect.

       As someone voting for Trump, if he wasn't baited by Hillary attacking and lying about his past, and just calmly and presidentially painted the difference between him and her, he would have won. He got too defensive and Hil was counting on it.

       clinton came across completely lacking in personality, however. scripted and memorized speeches, rehearsed rebuttals - all empoty rhetoric, of course. basically much like marco rubio during the primaries.

       To be totally honest, I am biased for Trump, but I feel like I watched a different debate than everyone else. He was active and going hard the whole time which meant he may have misstepped once or twice, but she had nothing, no game whatsoever. He was nailing her to the cross left and right: where's your thousands of emails? You staff was taking the fifth amendment, the guy who set up your private server took the fifth amendment. He even asked her if she's been working in government her whole life, why is she just having all these ideas now? He even said, you've been fighting ISIS your whole adult life, now they're in thirty countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people are just responding to the fact that he came off like kind of a dick, which I'm not saying isn't legitimate. Like I said I admit I'm biased towards him. But if you were to just read a transcript of the debates, he had several complete and total killshots, she did not. Everything they tried to nail him with (taxes, businesses, racism) he had a solid answer to. He dodged the woman issue by talking about Hillary Clinton's stamina, they set themselves up poorly there.
      </p>
      <p>
       My prediction: the moderator is obviously on Clinton's side, and she already has no game. This was the first debate. In the next two we'll see him go in hard and try and end her. This is it, this is the final battle, from the first ten minutes of this debate it was obvious he's putting it all on the line, there's nothing left after this.

       It's an interesting case study because if you can only speak and think in emotional rhetoric, you think Hillary won. If you actually have a philosophical mind and can see when people are sticking irrefutable facts, you think Trump won.

       Agreed, which is why in reality it was close to a draw.  Trump looked worse at his worst and better at his best.  Clinton looked healthier than expected, and sounded better than expected, yet said nothing substantive and offered the same bullshit rhetoric as always.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was mildly surprised at Trump taking the higher road in spots.  He did a poor job turning things around, especially with the birther thing - a ridiculous talking point.

       Want to talk about women?  How about Clinton taking 20% of her campaign funds from a country where women can't even drive.

       The fucking moderator let Trump constantly rant and rave for way longer than allotted while barely jumping in to let him know his time was up. He corrected several of Trump's lies and didn't call Trump out when he said "fuck reality I'm right, reality is wrong." Oh and Lester Holt is a registered Republican.

       Trump was right about stop and frisk, a judge ruled it unconstitutional and it was appealed, and just like he said, the process is still ongoing. Why is DeBlasio talking about stop and frisk if it was ruled unconstitutional years ago? Because it's still being appealed, just like he said. The rate of homicides has also increased in NYC along with other serious crimes, only petty crimes are down. Is there something else he was factually wrong about?

       Also you can cherry pick crime stats all you want but we all know crime is down nationally despite what the media pushes. I mean  gun homicides also include suicides, which make up a huge number of that statistic, it's all bullshit.

       Violent crime is up from last year. Washington Post:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The FBI’s preliminary 2015 data indicates that violent crime rose by 1.7 percent, with murder going up by 6.2 percent and rape going up by 1.1 percent or 9.6 percent, depending on the definition that is used.

       There are a thousand metrics by which to measure crime, if someone says crime is up do they mean compared to this time last year or compared to 1970? I think you can agree that it's kind of weak one, it's far from the flat out pants on fire lie that the Clinton camp is portraying it as. You know, a pants on fire lie like when Hillary said she never dealt with any classified info, or that she didn't have a private server, or that she didn't delete the emails, or like when she lied about her support of the TPP, or like when she lied about collapsing because she was overheated, and then it was because she was dehydrated, you know, like a flat out objective lie.

       Regardless, outside of Trump's idiotic desire to re-instate stop and frisk he and Hillary are both stuck with the non-working "tough on crime" mentality that has us stuck where we are.

       Tough on crime absolutely does work, I'm not sure why you refer to it as non-working. New York used to have way more murders, it has decreased because we got tough on crime. Not being tough on crime coincides with a rise in crime (...obviously?), such as in the Ferguson Effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you one of those people who think that the inner city has a high rate of crime because they're over-policed, or something? Talk about a conspiracy theory.

       Should I be "triggered" that you called it a "conspiracy theory" like many others of this sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       No tough on crime policies don't work, community policing does, tough on crime is all about locking people away, making money off of them if they can, and alienating the lower income areas to continue making a profit and to suppress these areas. You sound like one of these guys who still thinks marijuana is a gateway drug and should be scheduled the same as heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm from the inner city, you know what works? When the cops of the beat you live on know who most everyone is, know who the troublemakers are, and know how to find them. Also working with the community and hosting events does wonders to bring people together. Are there going to still be holdouts like the gangs and the drug suppliers/distros? Of course there will be but the community will be more apt to say fuck the "stop snitching" and actually give a crap about their community and get these pieces of shit behind bars. Also eliminating corrupt cops from being cops is a huge part of this as well, when corruption sets in these POS will work with the POS's in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all about over-policing too, saturate these areas with a police presence that works with the community and you will stop having problems with the community, but show them respect, treat them like people and citizens not like possible criminals, what's the saying oh yeah "innocent until proven guilty" duh. Stop and frisk is unconstitutional, at least until some appeal over turns it (they won't, it's a really shitty policy), and it's disrespectful to those that are law abiding citizens, and it singles out one type of person. I'm white as fuck, I can lawfully carry my pistol with me anywhere I want to go without fear of being harassed by the police, can a black man doing similar do the same under stop and frisk, no of course not.
      </p>
      <p>
       And really honestly I've had this debate so many fucking times I could care less if you agree, my dad is a cop he agrees, my cousin, cop, agrees, half my family are cops or DOC, they all agree on this one, it makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong I realize the lower income communities have to meet the police halfway but the halfway starts when cops stop shooting people, covering it up, and getting away with it, these people are supposed to be trained professionals and most departments these days barely require a high school diploma, the standards have dropped and you can tell that clearly cops are shooting when they don't have to, they're blaming everyone but themselves and most of them aren't held accountable at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that then we can point out to them where they were wrong about someone like Mike Brown and Ferguson.

       And it's called paraphrasing, obviously he didn't say exactly that, but Trump did say he was wrong every time he was corrected, if a moderator in a debate corrects you then you are wrong, not the other way around, that's how debate moderation works, and they wouldn't be trotting out bullshit because of all of the viewers and possible speculation, anyone who would disagree with the corrections just aren't grounded in reality anymore.

       Trump appeared to speak off the cuff with non-prepared answers while Clinton appeared to recite canned answers or be reading from  campaign brochures.   She looked healthy and alert the entire time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Trump lost any voters, Hillary probably didn't gain any. 
She brought up his (six, four) bankruptcies, he replied he used the current laws.

      <p>
       She said Russia hacked the DNC, he countered with "You don't know that"

       She asked about his tax returns, he agreed to release them after she released the 30,000_ emails she deleted.

       I don't completely support trump but I refuse to support a candidate who's attack dogs that's known as the MSM  is attacking a Candidate for having a friendly relations with a leader of a super power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same MSM that won't cover a shooting at a party in the inner city that has 5 dead bodies would use a school schooling to disarm Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same MSM that used the Daughter of an ambassador to plunge the US into a war in the past, is now attacking a candidate for being friendly to Putin as the MSM has been beating the war drums for Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same war that MSM that attacked bush for getting the US into a war, is the same war that MSM used a Little girl  to lie to get the USA involved with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't completely support Trump, In fact I wish Pat Buchanan was the Republican candidate instead of Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just glad that if Clinton does not win the WH it's retirement for her. I'm skeptical of trump like everyone else, but it's obvious  to everyone that Clinton is a monster. The Polls are fraudulent,and nobody shows up her rallies where trump packs stadiums.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet please don't say that the system is rigged because your candidate didn't win . He didn't really confront the corruption whenever she stole has victories from him. Sanders should have been making noise and threatening to shove his fist into her ass when the news came out that Clinton rigged the voting machines. He had the support to make her corruption into a crusade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Jill put up a bigger fight at the end of the day. Trump should had invited Jill to the Debates when she tried to join it. 
It would had certainly boosted his numbers by being nice like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the debate Trump should had  offered to Pardon Snowden &amp; Assange in exchange for community service such as Auditing the entire government with the help of  Rand &amp; Ron Paul. Trump should had stated that he has suspicions of the Obama Admin torturing Bradly manning into becoming a transvestite,and if manning were to be Pardoned he would need to be sent to proper facilities to help him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is begging for Pardons for Snowden &amp; Assange, so let an republican  like Trump who claims to be an outsider offer to give the pardons.
Then Clinton would look bad to the Liberal voters,and then the MSM would be forced to tell to the Liberal voters who want the Pardons to happen why Trump is crazy for offering to give Pardons to the two/three. The Conservatives would raise flags over how a normal guy like Manning wanted to become a transvestite after being held in government facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wish that Trump brought up the fact that there were several hundred missiles in the Benghazi embassy.
Like really. What the fuck? Why were there missiles in a embassy? i wanted Trump to bring up those missiles and how Clinton refused to allow more guards to be stationed to guard the missiles . I wanted trump to bring up how Obama's Admin knew about the Missiles,but stopped an Admiral from sending in help.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted Trump to say the following.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'll persecute the Obama Admin,Republicans,and Dem if there's evidence that they've been supporting ISIS in one form or another as I'm not going to play the political games where I'm biased toward any political party."
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'll persecute Clinton through the court system."
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'll persecute Clinton's daughter for having access to the server that had classified info on it."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll persecute the Obama admin for knowing about  the Email server but he didn't shut it down."
      </p>
      <p>
       "My Admin will persecute the FBI for corruption."

       Prosecute*. Otherwise you're right

       Edit: Downvotes, really? Persecution is what the Spanish inquisition did to non-Catholics or what the Nazi regime did to Jews and invalids, systemic repression due to association with a class or group. Prosecution is pursuing people in court and levelling criminal charges against them... this is an important distinction we should all understand.

       So is it more likely that there is a massive conspiracy involving information control, or is it more likely that the work and money involved in doing what you are expecting from the world is likely to come from someone with a vested interest in one side?

       anytime BLM is mentioned (either that or pasty, angry, racist 4chan virgins with small dicks) the vast majority genuinely like and do support Trump with no ulterior motives outside of wanting a system that is built around the people rather then the wealthy and powerful and stopping a illegitimate  Democratic candidate who is the living embodiment of the corruption that has poisoned said system.

       Yes by supporting somebody that's been gaming the system every bit as much, sure makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I see the people who still openly support Trump as either completely ignorant or they're concern trolls "oh Hillary is going to do this or that" when they don't really care either way they just want to make America whatever their vision of America is and it parallels things Trump has said, completely has nothing to do with Hillary.

       And seriously after all of the bitching about astroturfing and propaganda the collective of r/The_Donald and the 4chinners that have drifted here sure as hell do a ton of it, brigading as well, it's hypocrisy same with their sub being a "beacon of free speech" or whatever yet it's a complete safe space that bans any dissenting thought, but sure let's bitch about the Reddit hivemind.

       And despite all that, the system is playing and coordinating every dirty trick they have from suppression to distortion of the information of Trump and what he stands for. All you have to do is look back at his past stances and you'll find that on trade and treatment of the American middle class, he has consistently been on our side and find a common ground for national stake and shareholders to at least been equally ok with things.

       Trump isn't anymore on our side than Hillary is, he's out to get that nice fat tax break he's been looking for and to get him out of having to pay taxes for even longer, and of course for his stupid ego, you're just another rube that's been taken in by him, because essentially he's just another con/scam artist.

       Sorry man, that's just how I see it, all in all I wish he panned out as a legitimate challenger to Hillary who's policies weren't complete garbage or rehashed shitty Republican policies, I was on the fence with him for a while but I think I've seen enough to figure out he's just another two-bit hustler from the fair city of my birth.

       I think Hillary probably won the debate. I guess it really comes down to how the undecideds feel. But here is my conspiracy theory for the debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at the video of the debate at the 1:02:00 mark, it appears that she is speaking from a manuscript.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryp51N21vOU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a new question on a new subject, so there shouldn't have been notes already written. And she looked down like I do when speaking from a manuscript. At the end of nearly every sentence and when she kind of loses her thought, she looks down at the bottom right of her podium.

       Hillary mopped the floor with Trump. Are you expecting people to discuss Donald's poor preformance in a positive way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget tho, she's a career politician. She is likely to always 'win' these debates. At the end of the day, remember what each candidate stands for, not their stage presence.

       Edit: It seems people aren't reading my comment fully, so ill dumb it down.

       Hillary knows how to pander to audiences. She did well at that tonight. But you have to look past that.

       No problem! Someone needs to remind this passionate sub that she will win debates with her experience.

       She had me going, untill she defended Keith Scott, then I remembered how far her head was up her ass. Trump really shined on that topic, didn't he?

       See, I thought Trump was winning at first, because he really had her against the ropes on the NAFTA/TPP thing.  She seemed to be trying to blame Trump for the 2008 crisis, instead of, you know, the Republican president who happens to be endorsing her.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.. Trump started strong, and then didn't push things he should have.  And then he completely got too defensive on his taxes, etc.  But I don't think a single person's view was swayed by tonight.

       regardless of whether one refers to HC as experienced or pandering, she could be a dead stick and she'd be preferable to vote for comparatively -- one usually likes to comprehend the words, never mind the meaning, of what comes from the guy you vote for.  DT has the cognitive ability of a French Poodle.

       Yeah, Trump's incoherent rambling often didn't even address the question he was asked. Trumpettes don't want to hear it, but Donald lost this debate hard.

       lost this debate?   The guy's campaign has been a trainwreck enabled by just how disenfranchised his Trumpettes are.

       sadly, the Trumpetter's can't even perceive how much he embodies the exact manifestations which they attest to disliking in "mainstream candidates"

       That is what trump always does and it worked for him this far. Hillery played trustworthy and credibility card while trump went for emotions and stories. They ar both liers ofc.
