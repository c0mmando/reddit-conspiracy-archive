    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.</p>

<p>Tala
(Sanskrit) A word which is largely used in the metaphysical systems of India, both in contrast and at the same time in conjunction with loka. As the general meaning of loka is &quot;place&quot; or rather &quot;world,&quot; so the general meaning of tala is &quot;inferior world.&quot; Every loka has as its twin or counterpart a corresponding tala. Wherever there is a loka there is an exactly correspondential tala, and in fact the tala is the nether pole of its corresponding loka. Lokas and talas, therefore, in a way of speaking, may be considered to be the spiritual and the material aspects or substance-principles of the different worlds which compose and in fact are the kosmic universe. It is impossible to separate a tala from its corresponding loka — quite as impossible as it would be to separate the two poles of electricity.</p>

<p>The number of talas as generally outlined in the exoteric philosophies of Hindustan is usually given as seven, there being thus seven lokas and seven talas; but, as a matter of fact, this number varies. If we may speak of a loka as the spiritual pole, we may likewise call it the principle of any world; and correspondentially when we speak of the tala as being the negative or inferior pole, it is quite proper also to refer to it as the element of its corresponding loka or principle. Hence, the lokas of a hierarchy may be called the principles of a hierarchy, and the talas, in exactly the same way, may be called the elements or substantial or material aspects of the hierarchy.</p>

<p>It should likewise be remembered that all the seven lokas and all the seven talas are continuously and inextricably interblended and interworking; and that the lokas and the talas working together form the universe and its various subordinate hierarchies that encompass us around. The higher lokas with the higher talas are the forces or energies and substantial parts of the spiritual and ethereal worlds; the lowest lokas and their corresponding talas form the forces or energies and substantial parts of the physical world surrounding us; and the intermediate lokas with their corresponding talas form the respective energies and substantial parts of the intermediate or ethereal realms.</p>

<p>Briefly, therefore, we may speak of a tala as the material aspect of the world where it predominates, just as when speaking of a loka we may consider it to be the spiritual aspect of the world where it predominates. Every loka, it should be always remembered, is coexistent with and cannot be separated from its corresponding tala on the same plane.</p>

<p>As an important deduction from the preceding observations, be it carefully noted that man&#39;s own constitution as an individual from the highest to the lowest is a hierarchy of its own kind, and therefore man himself as such a subordinate hierarchy is a composite entity formed of lokas and talas inextricably interworking and intermingled. In this subordinate hierarchy called man live and evolve vast armies, hosts, multitudes, of living entities, monads in this inferior stage of their long evolutionary peregrination, and which for convenience and brevity of expression we may class under the general term of life-atoms.</p>

<p>That is not to say there aren&#39;t many declassified documents that do talk about the very serious and amazing qualities of unknown flying objects.. and many whistle blowers, and many (well documented; radar, f-16 lock-on, multiple witness) sightings and good abductee evidence like analyzed implants, research of Harvard psychiatry professor etc.</p>

<p>Even the chairman of Hillary Clinton, who was the Chief of Staff for Bill Clinton and counselor for Obama openly talks about UFOs and implies aliens <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khqZEXpfwjE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khqZEXpfwjE</a></p>

The entire pharmaceutical world taps directly into it, though it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a lot of medical research on psychedelics there in secret -- you have to look into more or less <em>open</em> (though underground), hobbyist communities instead in order to learn something practical.<br/>
Whatever &quot;data&quot; these people may have on psychedelics is completely irrelevant in the light of empirical experience with these substances of those inclined -- nor does most of it give any novel ideas in the field of embarking on the shamanic spirit-journey without the agenda behind it, but instead purely for healing, wanderlust etc.<br/>
 The exception are those altruistic folks and elders, techno-pagans, old hippies, freaks of all kinds who never really came into it with an agenda of making any of it more politically-integrable than it is necessary in order to free it from the implied care of the urbanized democracies, theocracies, and their seasonal particular neve of fashion against or behind the so-called drug culture. Folk who make successful projects of their own despite the lack of consent from the government, and without the heed of the skeptical appropriators who would rather approve the mainstream &quot;safety&quot; procedures (that are embedded in 90% collective ignorance, 1% corruption, and the 9% of people trying to make positive change in the infrastructure -- the conscious endorses of psychedelics), their information and careful research, though not always intelligible or englishable, should be the only things that are worth any serious attention to a person interested in drugs in general.  But you can&#39;t simply will the 90% into looking at them by merely pointing your finger at some vagrant, outyard, wealthy (more ideologically than financially, since they spend their money on better things than inventing the new <em>soma</em>) maintainers of the status quo. Even if they exist and whether they are actually wealthy. But they&#39;re not intellectually wealthy.<br/>
You can read <em>The Invisible Landscape</em> and discover that a tryptamine molecule has actually a mind of its own before entering the human brain. Whatever happens when it is activated as a psychedelic is a part of a greater being than any ever before examined materialistically by science -- whether an individual human being, or aa  society as a whole. This is why the therapeutic researchers, speakers and authors are the ones achieving most success, attention and support.</p>

<p>Government agencies including FBI have been known to disseminate disinformation.

    <div class="md"><p>DMT.</p>

<p>Other times I&#39;d tried it, it did stuff but not nothing like a breakthrough experience. First time it really worked I was hanging with some friends and was packing them all up decently but always being stingey to myself, concerned that we&#39;d waste it and others wouldn&#39;t get to experience this scarce experience. I had my second round and others had had wonderful experiences but I still didn&#39;t get anywhere. </p>

<p>I went to pack it and pass it on,  but my dear friend who I hadn&#39;t seen in ages and was in town for the weekend was like &quot;no you go again. I want you to experience this&quot;. So I put some more on and had my friend hold the lighter and just puffed on the bong deep and slow. As I realised I was actually going, the track we were listening to in a random playlist happened to have one of my favourite changes in it, my friend lent over and kissed me on the cheek and whispered &quot;goodbye xxxx&quot;, the conversation my other friends were having got to something that synchronized massively with an earlier personal experience that day and all those things together helped to maintain some sense of continuity between this world and some other place.</p>

<p>When I kinda went inside my mind&#39;s eye&#39;s perspective and came to layed out on a table sorta thing, in this trabeculae labrynth of rippling light, with 3 light beings leaning over me and comforting me telling me it&#39;s ok, I&#39;ve been here before and as I thought about those moments before I blasted off, they heard my thoughts n they kinda playfully boasted &quot;yeah, you liked that?&quot;.</p>

<p>They then sorta telepathically told me that a bunch of what I&#39;d been researching was in fact true and there was a massive spiritual war going on between the forces of light and dark that was culminating on Earth at this point in time. They communicated to me that &quot;there&quot; was my real home and I&#39;d somehow transported an aspect of my consciousness to here and now to assist in the liberation of the planet but not to worry because me waking up there in that place in time meant that it had already been a success. </p>

<p>In other experiences I&#39;ve had, I&#39;ve seen my walls rippling in pattern and an insectoid creature emerge from the wall and just suck the pattern off the wall as it&#39;s &quot;skin&quot;, giant hovering craft, had psychic surgery performed on my thought patterns, and continue to have ideas impressed upon me about usbering in a new paradigm of abundance rather than scarcity. </p>

<p>Pretty much all our actions can be broken down as to be out of either love or a lack of love. Abudance or scarcity. There are big interests in keeping the notion of scarcity in the zeitgiest. We really need to ditch that and surrender to the loving grace of the lord and his abundance. Angels and demons, yo.</p>

Literally makes it look like suddenly the glass has a leak once it hits liquid state.  Nobody has ever gotten it to a solid state, but there&#39;s a theory that it would allows perfect flow of electrons to suddenly appear since at liquid states a photon flow seems to appear from the liquid hinting that there is a lot more we don&#39;t understand about it and that perhaps there is a field at play.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fascinating to say the least.  But it&#39;s also pretty old.  Lookup the Bose-Einstein condensate for more info and an idea for how long it&#39;s been around.  But the Bose Einstein condensate is using physical waves as a way to condense the physical aspects of light together (photons). We&#39;ve never actually reached absolute zero, and times where it&#39;s been reported, it&#39;s always come back as not actually zero, but a sort of hacking of the temperature readout system that occurs because of how low temperatures are read (they read pressure differences, and often in these experiments it was possible to have a negative temperature readout which would physically be impossible like dividing by zero).  So we don&#39;t have the tools to even measure it yet.  With proton lasers people have gotten close and Bose -Einstein condensates have been created and recorded.  It even won a Nobel prize in 1995. </p>

<p>But just imagine this, absolute zero means that technically all movement stops since there is no energy available in the system, so all structures are cemented into their perfect state, which means they either break the proton away from each atom, or the structure stays in tact and becomes something new entirely we still don&#39;t know except that it should mean... all movement stops.  Which is also why it&#39;s so fascinating that the closest we&#39;ve gotten, suddenly there was an outflow of photons from the structure.  This means that there could be a field or that electrons actively search for something at lower temperature and bring it to balance with the structure, or that super solids are perfect at transferring matter immediately, which would change a lot of how we even approach physics and makes weird things possible in theory.  But that&#39;s also why it&#39;s so damn hard to get to absolute zero because any movement technically is creating heat.  It would be like trying to get a small amount of water to stop while it&#39;s in a vortex within a vortex within a vortex.  The whole thing is mindblowing.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video of the superfluid flowing.  The full video that it was taken from (the original, not the BBC one) is also available if you&#39;re interested in watching, it&#39;s like 35 minutes and it&#39;s really educating even though it&#39;s quite old).  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the video though of HE4 entering a superfluid state and flowing through
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z6UJbwxBZI">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z6UJbwxBZI</a></p>

<p>And theres a video of photons suddenly appearing in insane numbers on a superfluid, implying that there is somehow a free flow of electrons taking place which if no energy is being added to the system, the next question is...where are these photons coming from?  Huge implications.  I&#39;ll go looking for the video if I can find it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think everyone including the author of this article is misunderstanding where this letter originated. This letter isn&#39;t FROM the FBI, it was written by a former academic and sent TO the FBI. It was in their files, but that does not mean they endorse it in any way. Read the first few lines, in the first the author explains who he is sending the letter to including &quot;aeronautical and military authorities&quot; and in the second he explains who he is, &quot;formerly a university department head&quot;. He also mentions in the 2nd line that he expects the info to be disregarded by everyone he addressed it to, which surprisingly wasn&#39;t the case with the FBI, they deemed it interesting enough to file it anyway. But this letter certainly does not entail any kind of admission by the FBI of interdimensional beings as this author suggests. And to be clear I firmly believe in extraterrestrial life, but we can&#39;t go around blindly making assumptions to try and &quot;prove&quot; what we believe.</p>
