       Is Syria one of them?
I know Cuba and Iran.
Iraq and Afganistan got their in 2001/2003 after we faked a terrorist attack and blamed them. Ugh. It's all starting to come together now.
Apparently Syrian leader used some chemical weapon on their own citizens, according to Obama. But I read something that was quoting a Syrian that said WE are the terrorist and our people did it and blamed it on them to have a reason to go over there.
Not sure how true this is.
Then we accidentally bomb the Syrians fighting against ISIS? 
Can anyone help me understand what is going on more because I could be very wrong.

       The Syrian central bank is owned by the Syrian government it is the actual target. The fighting is between forces paid by the Pentagon vs. forces paid by the CIA. the point is to create massive debt for Syria so they'll be forced to borrow from the BIS,IMF,World Bank cabal who wish to prevent any country from being able to distribute value based currency as opposed to fiat currency backed only by 'good faith'
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are links about what is happening to the Syrian central bank and what has happened so far to the central banks of the other middle eastern countries we have invaded so far. They all had independent central banks and two had said they wanted to trade for gold backed currency instead of the U.S. dollar. That will not be allowed by the banking cabal.

       I saw things that said they don't have Rothschild bank and that they do. Hmmmm.. Who knows but I don't believe Assad committed that on his own people. We obviously either want something they have or want to put something there, because we have no reason to even go there.  Ugh I hate war and this fucking planet

       Syria is not a member of the Bank for International Settlements.
      </p>

       I can't find any information saying the Rothschild family owns any central bank. Only individual banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reportedly, agents of the Rothschild family created the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank of the central banks who financed the Nazi's  but their name is never associated with it. They may be silent partners though.

       This is key. I think the Rothschild thing is in some way chasing ghosts; BIS is what we should be looking at. Are the Rothschilds involved? Yes, to some extent, but I don't think they're the be all end all.

       They decided to call it the "Federal Reserve" instead of calling it something like "Central Bank of the United States" because they knew it would have never been allowed by the citizens back then.

       Non BIS members include, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba and Somalia. recent acquisitions are Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.Curiously, Russia and China are  members of the BIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as they are entangled with the BIS financially, I don't see them in any combat against other members. If either decide to offer value based currency, all bets are off.

       it's a prediction without basis. The problem with a gold standard is there isn't and never will be enough gold for that, however a value based economy is still possible. It doesn't matter to me what they use as the value, Use aluminum as far as I'm concerned,  as long as it isn't debt based and can't be manufactured like paper and computer digits, loaned into existence  at interest.

       The China link is a call for reform rather than a plan to use gold as a standard. They are buying gold. The Russian one doesn't establish  or call for a gold standard  either. They are also buying gold.

       The most likely next reserve currency according to most every knowledgeable person is the BIS's  SDR. That's what I'm saying all along. It's a conspiracy to create a monopoly in the creation of (fiat) money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Special Drawing Rights (SDR) issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is a fiat currency that has only the value of 'full faith and  confidence'  the same  scam that  the FED uses. It's a confidence scam and a Ponzi scheme.

       Buying gold is meant as  a safety measure against a currency  crash but, buying gold, as practiced today,  is a plan for losers.
      </p>
      <p>
       When there's a problem  the banks have all of the gold not the governments or the people, no matter who owns it on paper. Neither has the power to make the banks distribute the gold.

       Watch out for diamonds too. The value is far less than the sale prices because there are almost literally mountains of them but DeBeers has a  near monopoly on distribution  and can manipulate the price in their favor.

       Almost happened with ows. Unfortunately police agencies worldwide saw it wise to share methods of cracking down on protesters, and began training more in Israel with the IDF to teach methods and get them used to new toys.

       Also, it put to the test some new fancy spy networks that they used to infiltrate organic movements.

       I'm afraid we don't have much more time for your proposition. They're about ready to compartmentalize the net, probably country by country, under the name of cyber terrorism. Not to mention the medias job of keeping people divided by hatred.

       People are cracking up though. I just hope we can do it peacefully, but I know we are in for some interesting times. Keep a cool head on your shoulders.

       I have thought to myself a lot about the Internet. I'm surprised they haven't taken it down yet. It has so much info on what is really happening. I know China's Internet is limited and you can't just look at anything you choose.never thought of them blaming cyber terrorist.

       And I don't think it will be peaceful, these mother fuckers think peace is achieved by killing people. They are murders. Corrupt vile murders. I'm kind of scared.
But then I wonder if all this is going to even happen in my time and if I should be worried? I want to be ready, but j don't want to get ready if shit isn't going to hit the fan for another 50+ years.. But I think we can all feel it. Bad vibes.

       it's a prediction without basis. The problem with a gold standard is there isn't and never will be enough gold for that, however a value based economy is still possible. It doesn't matter to me what they use as the value, Use aluminum as far as I'm concerned,  as long as it isn't debt based and can't be manufactured like paper and computer digits, loaned into existence  at interest.

       The China link is a call for reform rather than a plan to use gold as a standard. They are buying gold. The Russian one doesn't establish  or call for a gold standard  either. They are also buying gold.

       The most likely next reserve currency according to most every knowledgeable person is the BIS's  SDR. That's what I'm saying all along. It's a conspiracy to create a monopoly in the creation of (fiat) money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Special Drawing Rights (SDR) issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is a fiat currency that has only the value of 'full faith and  confidence'  the same  scam that  the FED uses. It's a confidence scam and a Ponzi scheme.
