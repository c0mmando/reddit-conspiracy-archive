       Is it just me or do dems seem to be banking
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       on these debates? I don't pay attention to MSM like I did 6-8 years ago, but everything I have seen has been hyping up these debates as though Clinton is about to destroy Trump. It's as if their last beacon of hope left to convince the people of the United States that Hillary isn't a lying un-electable crook is this first debate. I am afraid the following will happen:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Donald Trump either under performs or intentionally says something insidiously inflammatory with not much of a reason for him to say it. (Hinting that Donald Trump has been in on the fix to keep this election close/eventually tip it into Hillary's favor)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hillary Clinton is going to attempt to pull some scandal about Trump out of her ass in front of tens or even hundreds of millions of people.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The moderators will focus almost exclusively on policy that is very dividing and controversial for Trump (VP picks, abortion, immigration, ISIS) and avoid any policy that may be divisive for Clinton (emails, rigging the DNC, TPP, controlling the internet, failed wars in Libya, her other existing FBI investigation, the Clinton Foundation scandals, whitewater scandal, the fact that she is literally a cuck for Bill, the fact that she is actually afraid of a cartoon frog etc). Any negatives brought up in favor of Clinton are hardlined by Trump and then the moderator (or moderators) defend Clinton from "attacks" and label things as "conspiracies"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hillary Clinton will be professed as the next savior of mankind, second only to Christ, and our last bastion of salvation from world ending catastrophe. People will somehow forget that even a couple of years ago being viscerally
         <em>
          afraid
         </em>
         of Donald J. Trump (that reality show guy) would make absolutely no sense, and would be bordering on insanity. Clinton will be declared the "winner" by every MSM station, who will proceed to publish polls (which have had their methodology skewed since the last time they were published) that say that Clinton has received a "post debate boost" in the polls giving her a lead again. CTR and other online projects focus really heavily on things that were planned to have happened during the debates, ignoring and derailing any conversation about Clinton and professing Clinton's win and overall more "Presidential" appearance and verbiage. Focus on any negatives Trump has said (or possibly was
         <em>
          planned
         </em>
         to say) and exclaim that he cannot be President.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I would love to be proven wrong, and to look back at what I've written and say that I'm crazy. Honestly though, I am somewhat afraid that I won't be able to look back at this and think that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's naive not to think that this shit goes all the way to the top, but I really hope this shit doesn't go all the way to the top..

       Exactly.  It's just like pro athletes on gameday.  They'll pump her full of shit to keep her going.  What wouldn't shock me is if she performs very well tonight and crashes in the next few days.

       Eh, most pro athletes are the opposite on game day cause they have to piss clean. Shame we don't drug test our politicians.

       They are still pumped full of drugs they're allowed to use, given epidurals, painkillers, ect.  It's only PEDs that are banned.  And only a select few athletes are 'randomly' tested each week.  It isn't like every athlete is tested every game day.  That's not how it works.

       My prediction is Trump keeps his cool and just lets Hillary be herself.  That's what a pro would do. The bitch is so toxic that the more unscripted exposure she gets the more people realize she's a horrid vomitous criminal piece of shit. Hell, she might even fall down or die from her illness in front of "100 million viewers."
      </p>
      <p>
       If she does dies on stage I win $120,000, If she merely falls down unconscious it's $50,000, if she freaks out, stutters or has a coughing fit I win $5000.  Come on Hillary, win me the big money!!

       Yeah.  If he genuinely wants to win he won't.  But if he wants to throw it to Hillary, if that was the plan all along, he will find a way to either self-destruct or fail.

       I honestly can't see how he could self destruct...His core base are only voting for him because Hillary is so awful. Unless she sprouts wings and ascends to heaven, debates are only a negative for her...much like whenever she opens her mouth her numbers go down...she hides away, her numbers go up...it's lose/lose for Killary, win/win for Trump just for showing up.  Trump is too prideful and has put too much effort into his brand to self destruct at this point. Like I've said a dozen times, he's a fucking douche, but he's my douche to wash out the Clinton rot from America's vagina...that festering shit has been stinking the place up for decades.

      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think many of us believe Hillary could win a debate against Trump assuming:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) he's actually trying
2) she's even the slightest bit medically unstable
3) all the questions aren't exactly like OP said in bullet point #3 (which I think we all very well expect them to be)
      </p>
      <p>
       An attack there would certainly take 100% of the focus off the debate, as there will no doubt be millions of people watching the game. Just wondering.

      <p>
       this is always what they do.  both candidates have way too much in common, so they focus on the identity politics/ single issue voter topics.  Gender, race and sexuality. And they both agree on a a warmongering foreign policy, so they circle jerk about that to make us feel unsafe.  Because the economy is the number one issue- they'll talk about job creation and debt lot, but there's not much substance to it.

      <p>
       they'll address all these things, but she's got a script to spin it.  They're both intentionally wishywashy on TPP- he pretends it benefits china and she words her responses so you question whether or not she's for it (she IS for it).  She'll laugh at the weak toss up she gets about emails.  She'll spin Libya as a success, but ISIS is the problem.

      <p>
       i think you're right.  Holt has spent a lot of time in warzones- he's straight mockingbird.  He'll definitely toss out the word conspiracies and lump "birther", ISIS and 9/11 together to cement that concept that "conspiracy theories" are for "nuts".  I doubt he'll go as far as dropping the reptilian/ moon landing/ flat earth accusation that you're supposed to do online when you make fun of "conspiracy theorists", BUT he'll probably push the "anti-science" meme and say something about global warming and/ or the "anti-vax movement".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Clinton will be declared the "winner" by every MSM station, who will proceed to public polls (which have had their methodology skewed since the last time they were published) that say that Clinton has received a "post debate boost" in the polls giving her a lead again.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       this, for sure.  She'll get 5+ points nationally from the debate.  As far as the moderation goes- pay attention to his language.  Count how many times the moderator mentions derivatives of "woman", and "qualified".  Those are Clinton campaign buzzwords.  Also count "strong", "finger on the button", "sensible ... policy", "experience", "racism" and other clinton campaign memes.

       I think that the Dems have made a huge mistake. Their Ministry of Truth, the MSM, has built her up to be hugely capable and unreproachable on the competence and experience issues. Meanwhile they've vilified and portrayed Trump to be a racist, incompetent loud mouth buffoon.
      </p>
      <p>
       All Trump needs to do is show up, be civil and speak intelligently to knock that whole strawman image down and impress the hell out of everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton, on the other hand, really needs to be on point, on the ball, and not appear to be in any physical distress at all, otherwise she's going down the shitter. There's a reason why they've shielded her from direct public scrutiny. If she shows any cracks at all, she's done.
      </p>
      <p>
       If she pulls it off, I'll be really surprised.

       If Trump can't "beat" Hillary in a 90 minute live debate, what does that say?. As POTUS he will have to discuss a wide range of matters with many powerful people.

       Only to the extent that it keeps Clinton out of the white house. I would actually prefer if Sanders or maybe even Stein won. Voted for Sanders, donated a pretty significant amount to his campaign, phonebanked etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen what one Clinton in the white house was (complete deregulation of the media with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, extreme cooperation with lobbyists and special interests, NAFTA, Clinton crime bill, "assault" weapons ban, pardons for all of their criminal friends, lying under oath, etc)

       I'm not really, I have just noticed how many articles are being pumped out about this, and that the CTR narrative on this site is that Clinton is about to "blow Trump out of the water".
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also seen countless times that the Clinton machine has affected and spun the narrative, or even created narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't been able to shake the feeling that Trump's run is in some way directly related to Clinton's. Though there is lots of evidence that points to the contrary, there are things that have happened that make me think that it is possible.

       Don't worry about it so much. What can you do about it? What if Trump absolutely destroys Hillary on stage? What if she has another medical episode? The questions are endless and can easily be raised from the other point of view.

       I didn't leave anything out. "Beat" doesn't really mean anything. Did he propose slightly less popular policies? Did they perform about evenly but Clinton pulled out some zingers? Did he use the n word and Clinton acted normal? Did he call all Muslims terrorists? Did Clinton bring up some scandal or something? That's a broad question to begin with, then the second portion of your question is "what does that say?"
      </p>

       Like, what does what say? How did he get "beat"? It will say a lot of different things to different people based on a very large number of different variables. The second part of your question doesn't really narrow the question down at all, it is still too broad to answer in a meaningful way.

       I mean, I'm not particularly worried. I'm just mentioning a feeling I have on a reddit post, not festering with anxiety and pulling bugs out of skin and shit.

       I mean, probably not a lot? I guess I could potentially drain my savings, fly out, and complain about it there all day? Wasn't really planning on doing anything about it.

       I understand what you're saying, but sometimes you can consume yourself with something you have no power over, only to find out that most of what you were concerned about was pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at it from the highest level; In a debate any candidate can "beat" another simply because you convince the majority to vote for you. Some people will vote for one candidate instead of another, without even understanding a word of what was said. This can come from body language, tone, crowd response etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some big event might happen in the debate but you can speculate on that all day long.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your voting Trump (so far), you must have some confidence in him. Just be confident he has all bases covered and will deliver the smackdown. If you're concerned, then you need to ask why you're voting for him, since as POTUS he will have many more discussions with many more powerful people and is expected to speak on your behalf and reflect your best interests.

       I feel like a lot of people (not necessarily you) don't understand that a large portion of America, and this community, are 'concerned' either way. Obviously Trump might not be the most experienced candidate...but at the same time Hillary IS the MOST corrupt candidate I could possibly think of, and the proof is there to back that up. So in turn people feel backed into a corner of choosing, as Jill Stein likes to say, "the lesser of two evils".
      </p>
      <p>
       The saddest part of it all is you are right when you say "this is something we have no power over"...Our system has become corrupted to the point that even trying to take part in a traditional way, such as voting, is pretty pointless...Bernie Sanders campaign proved that. I don't know where we would start, if we are talking about a 'solution' to these problems that exist today, but the first step is recognizing them.

       You make a great point but it expands the overall picture even more, outside the scope of the original statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the context of this thread, where the title is "I have a weird feeling about tonight (9/26/2016) And I really hope I'm wrong" I guess I was just trying to say to OP that you can overthink things. No need to be concerned until the debate has concluded and you have your answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the OP had posted a thread saying "I start my first job tomorrow and I'm worried about x, y and z" I would have responded the same way. You can overthink things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I missed something completely but that's how the overall post came across to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       btw, Consider my objective point of view and then look at the down votes. This just reduces my confidence in this sub.

       Yeah.  If he genuinely wants to win he won't.  But if he wants to throw it to Hillary, if that was the plan all along, he will find a way to either self-destruct or fail.
