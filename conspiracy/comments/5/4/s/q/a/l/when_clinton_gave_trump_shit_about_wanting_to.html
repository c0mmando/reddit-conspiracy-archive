       Yeah but that would require him to be more than a false opposition caricature. He's a clinton donor "running against" a clinton, and people honestly expect him to bring things like that up? His job is to make HRC look good, that's all.

       I'm praying but imho he could have buried her in the first one and there would be now way for her to dig out. He hit on some points but nothing that wasn't very damaging. One topic was matters of Internet security/hackers. That alone could have be a kill shot. Hillary again throwing blame at Russia for the DNC hacks ect ect. We all know her win was rigged and Trump should have said something along the lines of "this debate should really be between me and Sanders". He hit DWS on something but it was just looked over. Also did anyone else hear the comment from Hillary about fact checking? Can't remember what they were discussing but it seemed odd for her to call that out.

       And he signed the community reinvestment act which gave predatory loans to low income people areas that the Clinton's friends had already started to design plans for urban renewal projects that lead to gentrification and the death of mom and pop business that had made it decades before they were forced out for cookie cutter corporate shops. Donald Trump was one of these investors that participated. Marc Cuban is another.... they are all friends acting as enemies to trick the people.

       In addition, it was under Clinton that the Glass Steagall Act was repealed. According to him, he said the Act was "no longer appropriate." Prior to this moment in 1999 commercial banking was separate from investment banking. Basically, such institutions couldn't make the types of risky investments that led to the housing collapse.

       You know I've come to a conclusion with Hillary Clinton and her scandals. The fact that we can come together and figure out what laws were broken but the people who really have the power to do something about it failed to get her prison says alot. The time has come and gone and they had years to piece together the perfect take down and they failed. If these people are too incompetent to create a scenario that would guarantee indictment then they don't need to be managing shit else.

       This is why third parties would be so awesome in a debate (that wasn't rigged, that is). Trump is not and will never be the type of guy to list off very specific facts and figures... Whether he's being paid to do so or it's just his personality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stein is brutal in this regard and I think Johnson would do well too, hopefully in a fantasy world if they all debated Johnson and Stein wouldn't focus on the bait (Trump) and will just tear into Hillary like she deserves. Her horrible, terrible blatant corrupt ways should be in national spotlight and more than anything I want to see this. Even better would be after Assange releases those emails he claims he has.

       Watching the debate last night was like watching Rand Paul be a dufuss and squandering his opportunities in the primaries. I wouldn't be suprised if someone made Trump come to keel.

       Is it possible that Trump is just not very good at this whole one on one debate thing?

       Trump is not very good at the whole research and prepare thing (for the debates or the presidency).

       I also thought he went way too easy on her, but maybe that was his strategy. He said at one point "It's very important to me that you're happy". I want to hope he was repurposing the well known internet logic of post the wrong answer to get the correct one, as many will jump to correct you- maybe he's hoping we'll all do the work and write his new talking points for the second debate. Or, it's all a sham.

       Trump took a dive because he is a plant. He had so many opportunities to nail her to the wall.
