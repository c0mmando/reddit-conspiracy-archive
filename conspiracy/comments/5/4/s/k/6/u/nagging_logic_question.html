Would it not be much easier to figure out a &quot;plausible&quot; method of terrorism that they could actually do then go through all these roundabout fabrications that, apparently, anyone with the power of 2000&#39;s Internet and photoshop could figure out?</p>

<p>It&#39;s this blatantly false official story that leads to the &quot;touching the monolith&quot; reading of the event. It was <em>supposed to</em> cause an awakening, but it didn&#39;t. Not for everyone. They even brought down building 7 - and announced it 20 minutes early - and your average fluoride-addled moron still can&#39;t figure it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a calling card. They seem to numerically encode the number 7 into most false flag attacks. The entire World Trade Center complex was wiped out that day, yet all the (controlled) opposition harp on about is &quot;building 7&quot;. This is on purpose.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more likely that they need our permission to abuse us than they are bad storytellers. Like how Dracula needs to be invited in to do his dirty work, these wolves howl to signal their intentions and the sheep are <em>still</em> like &#39;oh, must be the wind&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;They need our permission to abuse us&quot; </p>

<p>Do you know what&#39;s different between the government and a vampire? Vampires are fake so, because of their made up quality, they get to have bullshit rules like &quot;they can only come into your house if you give them permission&quot;. </p>

<p>The government, on the other hand, Is pretty real. Because of this realness they are under no obligation to give you clues that they did something. I don&#39;t know if you know this but having to do certain things as a &quot;calling card&quot; kinda destroys any stealth or covertness that you need when planning to illegally start a war. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m sure you have a marvelously entertaining answer, but who exactly is enforcing this &quot;ask permission/you have to work in 7&quot; criteria?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The (chosen) people to whom the government take an oath of allegiance ritualistically suck the blood of baby dicks. Vampires, in one sense, are real. Another definition is &quot;a person who ruthlessly preys on others&quot;. Again, quite real.</p>

<p>And while you mock the idea of a government &quot;seeking permission&quot; (ahem, &quot;democracy&quot;?), they evidently do. They always announce escalations and intentions of hostilities, and most recently in the case of the Syrian sarin false flag, the people said &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>Or, perhaps, shield the public from the utilization of undisclosed weaponry. </p>

<p>That being said, I applaud you for both thinking critically and never having wondered &quot;If I were to commit the biggest crime in decades, how would I go about pinning it on a someone else and hiding the murder weapon?&quot;</p>

<p>Why massively grow a subculture of skeptics (particularly towards gov and industry)?  Why expose the foundations of corruption at every layer of society across every industry?
