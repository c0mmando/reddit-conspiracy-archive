<p>Predictions are bullshit because markets are nothing more than mass psychology, what we need to focus on is the scale, and that&#39;s pointing to the fact that this bubble is so big were looking at the next great depression once (and it will) it hits</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure the psychology of this has been well studied, likely by more than one three-letter-agency. I&#39;m guessing one relative commonality among &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; is a strong positive response to feeling like one is &quot;in the know.&quot; That makes these prediction events very advantageous memes; they spread effectively because people want to be feel in the know before other people, and don&#39;t want to be left behind, not realizing what other people &quot;know.&quot;</p>

<p>Such prediction dates are ultimately self-defeating. There&#39;s so many, that even if something major happens on one, it likely will be just a coincidence. Confirmation bias plays heavily into this. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t say all of these &quot;doomsday dates&quot; are deliberately planned psyops, yet I immediate question anyone with some standing in this &quot;community&quot; who peddles them. I think it would be very easy to propagate these dates and have the useful idiots spread them further. </p>

Back in 9-4-94 or some strange date, he suddenly maxxed out all his credit cards with fancy things that he just couldn&#39;t afford. He said the Rapture was coming the following month and told me the date. When that date came, I knocked on his door looking for him and when he answered, I pretended he was invisible......the entire day lol. Even when he said multiple times &quot;Very Funny&quot; lol</p>
