       I hate them both. However, I harbor a passionate hatred of HRC. Currupt politicians who intentionally work towards the disadvantage of their constituents are hardly a step above sexual predators. This election is a joke.

       This election is a farce of the highest order.  I do hope the oligarchy is at least sweating while they await the next chosen leader.  They have to know that some day soon, people will be more than happy to climb the walls of their compound.  I hear oligarch tastes like chicken.

       I and a few others have gotten death threats over PM from the same user; but I'm not convinced he's not actually a Clinton supporter pretending to be a Trump supporter. Seems bot-like in that he doesn't actually respond in context...like, he keeps calling me a CtR shill (but refuses to answer as to whether he is compensated for his "work" here)...when anyone could see my post history and figure that one out. But despite the bile he spews at people in PMs, he comments on other places on Reddit like a normal civilized human.

       Whatever it is, it's really lame and I hope people aren't scared off by it. I reported the guy, but the admins care fuck-all about operatives for whoever running around scaring the shit out of people.

       Right but their anti-CTR behavior is basically exactly what they are accusing CTR of doing.  For several days earlier last week the pages of this subreddit were covered with literally 30 pro-trump posts at the top saying variations of the exact same thing.  I get that there is a rich conspiracy history surrounding the Clintons, but again, there is little effort that I see in these posts to get at the truth.  In fact the titles being submitted link to articles with much less provocative titles.

       We know there are companies like NimbleAmerica doing the same thing with the opposite message. I'm pretty sure all anti-trump messages aren't coerced.  What you guys are having trouble with is the concept of bias.  You are so biased that just like the news media that you claim to hate, you spin everything so that it fits your narrative.  This is just being a fan, not objectively analyzing anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean lets think about this, we have two people who have been wildly successful in a rigged system.  One of whom, Trump, who actually says it's rigged.   If this is the case, then they are both profiting from a rigged system.  We hate politicians because sociopaths with lots of money lead them around, and then we go and try to elect one of them?  The Clintons are just as bad, being a large part of this system for decades.  How can anyone think we have anything to gain from this election?

       Have seen it on all sides. If you ask someone point-blank if they receive compensation and they refuse to answer, it's a good indication. Which makes me wonder - they're doing something wrong to begin with by not divulging that they're compensated, why NOT just lie and say, "I'm not a shill, I'm a real boy!" But no, they will refuse to answer and try to turn it back on you, which is fascinating as hell. Like, are they monitored? And if they're monitored, who is it that says "Under no circumstances can you claim you're
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a shill, but feel free to tell your conversational opponent to drown screaming in their own blood." Like, what kind of fucked up playbook is that shit? ;)

       I think it's just a matter of not wanting to work for nothing.  Those particular communications are probably something they don't want to/can't show their "bosses" as evidence of work done.

       I almost want to say "If you're an asshole about it, you're a shill," but I know that's not true. I really do think some kind of material enrichment is necessary to count as a "shill." Being deluded or wrong or not agreeing with me is just being deluded or wrong or not agreeing with me.

       I would say it is the arguements that you put. Are on the left and genuinly support Hillary, you disagree or do you character assassinate people, attack third parties, push the you must vote Clinton, and attack Sanders supporters, 99.99% you are a Shill.

       If they were following FEC rules, every comment left by a CTR user would say "Paid for by Correct the Record" somewhere on the posting. Because it's paid advertising. What they're doing is literally illegal, but good luck having any law enforcement actually do anything about it.

       There are a couple of precedents an enterprising lawyer or AG could use to go against it - the recent Amazon and Yelp cases against paid reviewers could be used, too. Trouble getting an AG to go against anyone contributing to their campaign (see also: every major industry doing this), but a good consumer lawyer would see $$ here because there
       <em>
        IS
       </em>
       a paper/'foundation' trail and the funders have big pockets. What's interesting is the lawsuits re:paid reviews actually sued the reviewers themselves, the individuals, and not the companies who hid back behind them. I think, to be effective, they'd have to start at the plebes on keyboards, but make it back up the chain, through the PR firm, through the tax-exempt 501c4, and straight into the heart of the beast.

       Being upset that people are paid to intentionally down vote posts and comments that rightfully question the many shady dealings of Clinton has nothing to do with being an "entitled millennial." Ease up on the main stream kool-aid. This is a form of censorship that has destroyed many subs of reddit throughout this election cycle.

       That's the thing I don't get about Clinton's campaign - they do that with all the votes they need - millennials, women, black people - like, have they ever taken a psychology class? You need someone to do something for you, you don't abuse them and call them stupid! You don't spend all your energy claiming they don't know what's best for themselves! You court them! You reach out to them, you talk about what it is they want you to do. No kidding, there were CtR operatives in here bending over backwards trying to explain how calling black kids predators wasn't racist. Like, seriously? THIS is how you're going to spend your time? Who are these 'turfers, really, Stormfronters for Clinton?
      </p>
      <p>
       I swear, Trump and Clinton are playing a cocktail party game. Every morning, they must call each other up, and giggle over how they fucked up their campaigns the previous day.

       They thought that a similar tactic would work with women during the primary - women don't like being called sexist, told they are just going with the boys, and that there's a special place in hell for them if they don't vote for Hillary? Weird.

       CTR isn't free speech, it's paid speech. It's advertising, and there are laws in place which ensure that people understand that advertising is advertising. Is requiring political advertisements to identify they're paid advertisements an affront to free speech in your opinion? Because that's what the FEC rules they're breaking say they must do, and that's morally what they should do if they want to advertise on Reddit.

       I'm not gonna lie, I'd probably be a CTR shill if the money was good because here's the thing, CTR shills are way too damn obvious with their agenda and just about anybody on Reddit can see through their bullshit. At this point it's sort of like a running gag, I don't even know why they try anymore. Hillary Clinton doesn't understand the younger generations, we no longer have to believe in a forced mainstream narrative. Her tactics for socially conditioning young internet users isn't working and this dumb psychopathic presidential candidate will continue to waste money on it.

       I've been in this sub for just about nine years through three different account changes, I don't share the same views as most of you guys, about half of the time I propose a dissenting opinion I'm downvoted to obscurity or outright called a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't use this shit to create an echochamber out of this sub, some people simply have different views and opposing viewpoints politically, I am clearly one of those.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go after those that truly seem like they are CTR astroturfers but don't drown out dissenting opinion, because dissenting opinions are what makes each of these topics a discussion, if there is no dissenting opinion then we might as well be lining up for the echochamber circlekjerk of "hey do you hate Hillary because I hate her too."
