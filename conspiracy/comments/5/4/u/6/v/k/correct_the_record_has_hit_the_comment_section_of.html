Seems bot-like in that he doesn&#39;t actually respond in context...like, he keeps calling me a CtR shill (but refuses to answer as to whether he is compensated for his &quot;work&quot; here)...when anyone could see my post history and figure that one out. But despite the bile he spews at people in PMs, he comments on other places on Reddit like a normal civilized human.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, it&#39;s really lame and I hope people aren&#39;t scared off by it. I reported the guy, but the admins care fuck-all about operatives for whoever running around scaring the shit out of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right but their anti-CTR behavior is basically exactly what they are accusing CTR of doing.  For several days earlier last week the pages of this subreddit were covered with literally 30 pro-trump posts at the top saying variations of the exact same thing.  I get that there is a rich conspiracy history surrounding the Clintons, but again, there is little effort that I see in these posts to get at the truth.  In fact the titles being submitted link to articles with much less provocative titles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know there are companies like NimbleAmerica doing the same thing with the opposite message. I&#39;m pretty sure all anti-trump messages aren&#39;t coerced.  What you guys are having trouble with is the concept of bias.  You are so biased that just like the news media that you claim to hate, you spin everything so that it fits your narrative.  This is just being a fan, not objectively analyzing anything.</p>

<p>I mean lets think about this, we have two people who have been wildly successful in a rigged system.  One of whom, Trump, who actually says it&#39;s rigged.   If this is the case, then they are both profiting from a rigged system.  We hate politicians because sociopaths with lots of money lead them around, and then we go and try to elect one of them?  The Clintons are just as bad, being a large part of this system for decades.  How can anyone think we have anything to gain from this election?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have seen it on all sides. If you ask someone point-blank if they receive compensation and they refuse to answer, it&#39;s a good indication. Which makes me wonder - they&#39;re doing something wrong to begin with by not divulging that they&#39;re compensated, why NOT just lie and say, &quot;I&#39;m not a shill, I&#39;m a real boy!&quot; But no, they will refuse to answer and try to turn it back on you, which is fascinating as hell. Like, are they monitored? And if they&#39;re monitored, who is it that says &quot;Under no circumstances can you claim you&#39;re <em>not</em> a shill, but feel free to tell your conversational opponent to drown screaming in their own blood.&quot; Like, what kind of fucked up playbook is that shit? ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a couple of precedents an enterprising lawyer or AG could use to go against it - the recent Amazon and Yelp cases against paid reviewers could be used, too. Trouble getting an AG to go against anyone contributing to their campaign (see also: every major industry doing this), but a good consumer lawyer would see $$ here because there <em>IS</em> a paper/&#39;foundation&#39; trail and the funders have big pockets. What&#39;s interesting is the lawsuits re:paid reviews actually sued the reviewers themselves, the individuals, and not the companies who hid back behind them. I think, to be effective, they&#39;d have to start at the plebes on keyboards, but make it back up the chain, through the PR firm, through the tax-exempt 501c4, and straight into the heart of the beast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been in this sub for just about nine years through three different account changes, I don&#39;t share the same views as most of you guys, about half of the time I propose a dissenting opinion I&#39;m downvoted to obscurity or outright called a shill.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t use this shit to create an echochamber out of this sub, some people simply have different views and opposing viewpoints politically, I am clearly one of those. </p>

<p>Go after those that truly seem like they are CTR astroturfers but don&#39;t drown out dissenting opinion, because dissenting opinions are what makes each of these topics a discussion, if there is no dissenting opinion then we might as well be lining up for the echochamber circlekjerk of &quot;hey do you hate Hillary because I hate her too.&quot;</p>
