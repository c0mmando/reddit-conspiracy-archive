       I've been reading through
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       today.  It's quality.  You've got the list of proven conspiracies, and a large number of intelligent, curious people here.  But a significant portion of posts discuss censorship on Reddit itself.  I don't need to get into Facebook, Google, and Twitter and their censorship, but clearly the situation is pretty dire, if you want to be able to speak your mind, and make inquiries freely.  Furthermore, these sites sap your time, while giving you nothing at all.

       t.com is different.  (oh, yeah... I had to throw those asterisks in there to be allowed to post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you mistake this for spam, hear me out.  First of all, it's tech is different.  It's literally impossible to permanently delete a story on Steemit, even if you the user choose to delete it from visibility on the page.  It's stored permanently on the STEEM blockchain.  Steemit is made by people committed to a better world, and it is entirely open source.  Because our community on Steemit is organized around our desire for a less-regulated, less-governed, freer world, we're a bit like a mutual support organization.  I live in Hanoi, Vietnam as the result of a multi-year quest on my part to make teeny computers that respect the user's privacy and network seamlessly.  Finding steemit has been one of the best changes in my life, ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, the STEEM blockchain ties together all of Steemit's users, and makes us, weather we agree with one another or not, a contiguous economic unit.  Now, I haven't even gotten to the most significant difference between steemit and other social media outlets:  Steemit pays cash-cryptocurrency for your posts.  It's real money, I swear it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no here to screw up your community-- it is already screwed and many of you recognize this.  For the time being there's a genuinely free alternative, and I'd be thrilled to see you there.  The current extractive nature of social media is a conspiracy, in more ways than I can count.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm steemit.com/@faddat
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope to see you there, and discuss the same.

       tl;dr:  The big social media outlets earn huge money and don't cut their users in at all.  They also eat your time.  They also censor you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steemit's kinda the anti-social-media.  Hell, I'm a nobody on Steemit, and I run servers for it.  lots of people do, as it is decentralized to prevent censorship and control.

       Fair enough. It could be good. Personally I don't have that hard of a time sifting through the bullshit on here and am not looking for an alternative yet. I pretty much use reddit solely for news on relevant current events, aka

       That's cool but I have no interest in being paid for my opinions, all that means is you are inclined and encouraged to post what profits you the most, which according to reddit karma is the blandest most insipid mainstream pap imaginable. My question is
       <em>
        qui bono

       That's the right question, sir!
      </p>
      <p>
       The font of wealth is coming from the creation of a digital currency backed by the content stored on the Steem blockchain and their economic activities surrounding it.

      <p>
       First lesson of Steemit:  Money has value, because we say and think it does, and for no other reason.

       Click the conspiracy tag in my post.  Many of steemit's links are relative to the user account (meaning I did give you the wrong link)

       works fine. It still doesn't appear in the tags search though, granted most people wouldn't be searching for that term specifically however, but I still find that slightly troubling.

       I'll reply to your other comment here for tidyness' sake, so steemit are creating a rival to bitcoin? A steemcoin? "their economic activities surrounding it." doesn't really elucidate what those activities are. Are you sure your not being used as a miner? I freely admit to ignorance of blockchain economies as it's no more real than fiat currency to me. If you're cashing out before the inevitable crash good luck to you but there's always going to be somebody holding the baby when it crashes. I prefer hard assets that almost never devalue personally.

       The STEEM chain is surely risky, so let's get that out of the way real quick.  But I know what I'm risking, and actually my server isn't a miner node.  Here's where it gets quite interesting indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steem is an implementation of the tech being Bitcoin, the Blockchain.  But the STEEM blockchain serves a very different purpose.  STEEM's chain is not just a ledger.  It's full of JSON.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what is JSON?  Glad you asked!
      </p>
      <p>
       JSON is what the modern web is built from.  So,a global, selectively encrypted, verifiable, web-scale content storage mechanism that spawns a currency which is backed by blog posts.  Yep, that's what steemit is :D.

       Oh, and it's just about one of the friendliest communities of geeks out there!

       There's some truth to that.  Also some bullshit.  But surely some truth.  I'm sure that Barry Cooper would love to talk to you about your trip:

       Or maybe, you want to make a post on Steemit, fully tripping face, and see how much it can earn?  My top post was $1900.  I'll help you promote it, because why not? ;)

       Fair enough. It could be good. Personally I don't have that hard of a time sifting through the bullshit on here and am not looking for an alternative yet. I pretty much use reddit solely for news on relevant current events, aka
