    <div class="md"><p>We tried bombing the caves in Afghanistan. There is a reason the most secure (nuclear) bunkers are housed in mountain caves.  You don&#39;t just blow something up that is covered by 200 feet of rock, that&#39;s not how it works.</p>

<p>Their cities are spread out and contain a huge number of non-combatant civilians. In order to be somewhat effective, you need to get up really close and accept many casualties among your own.  No politician is going to take the heat for another couple thousand allied soldiers.</p>

<p>Nobody wants a repeat of what happened in the aftermath of the second Iraq war. Which makes military use limited to strategic bombings of certain key tactical positions.  </p>

<p>&quot;Enemies&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>THOSE ARE NOT YOUR ENEMIES. WE ARE THEIR ENEMIES.</strong></p>

<p>And that&#39;s only applying to Iran or Syria, which had never lost a war against us.</p>

<p>If you say stuff like ISIS or Al-Qaida, it&#39;s because we funded them and used them to murder in hapless european countries like France or Germany or the middle east. And very soon our government will import them to America to kill Americans. </p>

<p>Therefore, the west basically developed ISIS to murder and &quot;us vs them&quot; is nothing more than a sham. Ever heard of ISIS being called &quot;Israeli Secret Intelligence Service&quot;? That is all there it is to it.</p>

<p>And as for this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why cant the worlds most advanced military beat some cave dwellers once and for all?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>AMERICA IS NOT THE WORLD&#39;S MOST ADVANCED MILLITARY.</strong> That&#39;s what the media wants you to think to instill fear. </p>

<p>In fact our &quot;army&quot; is nothing more than a corrupt, foolish, thuggish, and weak mercenary gang that is more apt on killing armless civilians and not against any form of superpower like Russia and china.</p>

<p>That was ever since world war ii, and since then what we try to go against, be it Russia, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Iran....had never lost a war against us before....Only we lose wars.</p>

<p>So, TL:DR Wake up from the dream that america is the strongest army in the world and Iran and syria is our enemy and we are fighting &quot;ISIS&quot;. The truth is reversed; The US army is the most pathethic army possible, we are the enemies of Iran and Syria and ISIS is created by America and Israel and they are supporting them to murder armless meatloafs like us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to be a dick, but America is orders of magnitude more advanced militarily than the next competing countries. That is rapidly deteriorating, but when you look at the legacy systems the US fields: nuclear aircraft carriers, submarines, stealth bomber and fighters, F-22, M1 tank... these weapons systems have been totally unmatched on the world stage for decades. Now Russia may finally have systems comparable or better than the F-22 or M1 tank, but that is small potatoes compared to the larger platforms.</p>

<p>Think that there are 11 nuclear aircraft carriers on the world stage, 1 owned by France, the rest are American. Or that at any given time there are upwards of 2 dozen nuclear subs deployed secretively around the globe. And no country can even challenge American air power on a global stage. Not to mention the American satellite network that links everything together and provides full global intelligence coverage. And these systems I&#39;ve mentioned have all been in place for DECADES. It really isn&#39;t even a close match...</p>

<p>However if the US continues to fuck up weapon system development and procurement like they have with the F35, LCS boats, new aircraft carrier, new destroyers, etc, they&#39;re gonna have a bad time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had you ever heard of &quot;Guerrilla Warfare&quot;? These things are how communists and middle eastern cave countries keep us at bay, and it has been tried in world war ii and beyond by communists and middle eastern countries to great success. </p>

<p>Plus US army is now nothing short of a murder squad whose signature vechicle is the humvee, whose frontlines are now filled with LGBT (Which reduces combat power to ZERO) and women (Which cause love triangles and liasons and prevent the whole squad from working as if it was intended), whose commanders are corrupt and go on random killing sprees, who treats their duty as a job (Which means that they do not put up steely resistance), and finally infiltration by intelligence agencies. </p>

<p>With a rotten army like this, no technology can save you. No wonder America is losing all wars since world war ii.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget the army&#39;s biggest enemy is from the inside, not the outside. They want you to believe the enemy is from outside but in fact it&#39;s from the inside of it.</p>
