I can&#39;t support people who fuck children, use children as sex slaves or support people who fuck children. You have to draw a line somewhere and if you husband fucks children, you won&#39;t get my vote.</p>

<p>*Let&#39;s not forget that only after Donald Trump outed Jeffrey Epstien, Bill Clinton&#39;s buddy and child sex pimp, did anyone investigate and eventually CONVICT the guy of child sex trafficking and child fucking. That&#39;s all just the begining, if you were at all interested in the subject you would already know about <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/pedophiles-fixer-maintains-close-ties-to-the-clintons/article/823759">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, Bill Clinton&#39;s continued little girl Madame...hey, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DmebBgC.jpg">see this chick with the circle at Chelse&#39;s wedding</a>, she finds pretty little girls for old men like Bill Clinton to fuck for a living...it&#39;s all she does.</p>

The more educated see right through it...your uninformed opinion on the matter is of no consequence outside of giving me the chance to talk about Bill Clinton and his best friend, convicted child fucker and child sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein, I&#39;m glad to respond as verbosely as possible. Hell, someone out there might not even know that besides Bill Clinton&#39;s history of sexual assault and rape, he&#39;s also known as a prolific child rapist, so much so that he takes trips(24 verified) on a plane called the &quot;lolita express&quot; (aka, Child fuck express) to an island known for child sex slavery. A fact left out of all media coverage and debates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,&#39;&#39;  &quot;He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, *<strong><em>and many of them are on the younger side.</em></strong>* No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was way before Epstein was convicted for child sex trafficking and child prostitution.  Had it not been for the fake lawsuit brought and thrown out against Trump in California, he would be beating the shit out of Clinton with her husbands rampant pedophilia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being the only guy to out a powerful pedophile pimp publicly a year and half before the guy is busted fucking children takes balls. Probably the reason he&#39;s been audited every year.  I mean, outing Bill Clinton&#39;s personal child fuck slave pimp only gets you a decade of audits, he&#39;s lucky to be alive. In fact, he seems to be the only person to even address Bill Clinton&#39;s child fuck slave pimp at all...strange? You would think the media would at least talk about how Bill Clinton would fly on a convicted child sex trafficker&#39;s plane called the &quot;lolita express&quot;(child fucking express) to Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s private child rape island in the Caribbean...was it 23 or 24 flights? Why would the husband of a presdential candidate be flying on a plane called the child fuck express to an island owned by a convicted child sex trafficker/pimp?

    <div class="md"><p>Trump has his own connections with Epstein that might raise some eyebrows; his name was found in Epstein&#39;s &#39;little black book&#39; with 14 different numbers listed, and in 2009 Epstein&#39;s brother testified that Trump rode the jet called the Lolita Express at least once. I came across this after a minute of searching, you might find it interesting <a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/5556/7-things-you-need-know-about-trump-and-sex-slave-amanda-prestigiacomo#">http://www.dailywire.com/news/5556/7-things-you-need-know-about-trump-and-sex-slave-amanda-prestigiacomo#</a> 
At some point Trump and Clinton might have ridden the Express side by side while sharing a martini. It&#39;s useless to bring up moral criticisms against one candidate while defending the other when both are open degenerates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point, obviously Trump&#39;s one ride on the Bill Clinton&#39;s &quot;Child Fuck Express&quot; seemed to have turned him against Jeffrey Epstein, so much so that he outed him as a pedophile to the world over a year before Bill Clinton&#39;s personal child sex trafficking pimp was arrested and charged with fucking little children and trafficking in child sex slavery. The fact that he seems to be the only person to even address Bill Clinton&#39;s child fuck slave pimp at all...strange?

    <div class="md"><p>When you are at the level of Trump and Epstein, saying that a guy likes women on the &quot;young side&quot; means  he&#39;s a pedophile...and of course, shortly after he gave the pedophile national attention, Epstein get&#39;s busted fucking children and trying to pimp out child prostitutes. There is a good chance Trump outing the guy brought the attention needed to investigate him. I&#39;m not a fan of Trump and you don&#39;t have a leg to stand on in order to argue.

    <div class="md"><p>If Trump was trying to out Epstein as a pedo he wouldn&#39;t have said he &quot;likes beautiful women just as much as I do&quot;. Women aren&#39;t children, and Trump seems to be comparing his predilections with Epstein&#39;s in a favorable manner, which is an odd thing to do when exposing a pedophile. Both Clinton and Trump are documented morally depraved sex fiends but if you want to defend one of them because you think the other is worse for whatever reason, be my guest. You&#39;re not convincing me. </p>

Maybe it&#39;s that Trump has a formal education and you aren&#39;t on the same level?

He doesn&#39;t drink or do drugs. It&#39;s all business. 24/7. Prototypical narcicist...historically a good trait in leaders. His contact with Bill Clinton&#39;s good friend, convicted child rapist/child sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein, was a casual business relationship, he&#39;s addressed it...unlike the Clinton&#39;s who&#39;ve still avoided the subject like the plague...probably because Bill Clinton flew on, convicted child rapist/child sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s plane a minimum of 24 times to his private child fucking sex slave island.

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t surprise me that you don&#39;t get it. I don&#39;t like Trump at all. I was merely pointing out that only only after Donald Trump outed Jeffrey Epstien, Bill Clinton&#39;s buddy and child sex pimp, did anyone investigate and eventually CONVICT the guy of child sex trafficking and child fucking.
