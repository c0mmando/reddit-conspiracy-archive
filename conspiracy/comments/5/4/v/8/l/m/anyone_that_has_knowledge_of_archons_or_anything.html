       they are mentioned in the dead sea scrolls.

       The archons come from gnosticism. There is the demiurge and archons who basically control the illusion of this reality. Just search for gnosticism and archons, and you will find the information you're looking for

       I know a little bit about the Gnostic worldview. Again, The Matrix fits some elements of Gnosticism into it's story.
      </p>
      <p>
       False reality, run by insane false God (closest fit here would be Agent Smith imo). Salvation comes in the form of Gnosis. In this case, Gnosis means becoming aware of the false nature of the matrix... and taking the red pill symbolizes one's choice to start on the path towards awareness.

       Yeah, I would say you're pretty much spot on. The Matrix was heavily influenced by Gnostic ideas, and I thought they did an amazing job of connecting ancient ideas to our modern technological society. This is why it's my favorite movie

       I'm going to assume that you watched the first Matrix movie. The idea behind the movie is that everyone lives in a false reality, while their physical body is laying in a pod in a power plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the movie they mention how a human body puts out some amount of bio-electricity. And this electricity is harvested by the machines as their power supply. I always thought that was a dumb reason to host billions of human bodies when you'd think it would be so much easier just to run a few fusion reactors.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when you think about it, this could be a reference to Archons. It seems like a pretty good match. Archons/machines running our world from behind the scenes. We live in a false reality while they survive by feeding off of our energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So at least part of the story in The Matrix is related to the idea of Archons?

       Yeah.

      <p>
       The archons are now possessing the AI, that enslaving us. Feeding off our loosh.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Matrix is actually a psy-op though meant to make us think of the outside of the Matrix as this fucked up world, but in reality, the fucked up world is here now and the outside of this material world is heaven.

       is a great read.  The Hypostasis of the Archons is a great start, but On the Origins of the World is better, and more detailed.  It's not very flattering to the one who calls himself Yahweh, if you're a churchie, though, so be prepared :)

       Those people don't hold the keys. They are pawns, occult will lead you down the right track but won't show you much. I don't know too much but I know Santos is just a pawn. He says smart stuff but it's not the truth. The truth is getting to the point where you can decode reality and predict the future with ease. What you give is what you get. It's much more, no one talks about opening their third eye and how to realistically do it without already being an evolved soul. People who are figuring this out are already meant to, people on this earth are heaven sent and hell sent. I truly believe that because these people are FUCKED. It's easier for some to get down the path and harder for others. Beating your emotions is one major key. Numbing yourself down to never give a shit and still be happy is another. There's plenty. Numerology is all around. When I read something I think "who's manipulating this, what lies does it tell, what stories does it push?" from that you can tell where society is headed easily.

       Maybe not keys for someone advanced, but for someone new, just hearing about these alternate theories teaches me so much.  I'm just at the start of my journey (too much issues with emotions still),  but I want to someday be an old wise man, and for that, it takes, a lifetime.  I'll be listening and reading more from any source that comes semi valid.

       I'll throw you one of the very biggest keys to it all. It's just how you use this information. The world is a mind fuck. Turn your head to jelly by not believing anything. Nothing at all. Don't believe a hobo has any less worth than a person with a lambo. Don't believe someone who has nothing is any less than someone who has everything. I am not giving you the keys to Archons I'm throwing you keys to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Archons operate like this. There are 2 beings, Archons are the ones being "fed" right now. Archons feed off negative energy. The more negative the better. Our government officials are like spawns to them so they are pedophiles and all that shit. They create wars so that these people who are uncertain what lies for them after death get the most fear possible and the Archons get to feed on it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The God beings give love, give knowledge and that's basically it. The only way you get to them is by loving each other. The standards aren't high today because I've been gifted believe that. I am nothing special but I see the world deeper than the majority here. Reddit down votes and up votes are vastly manipulated so another trick is to look at the unpopular opinions. Nothing is crazy enough trust me. Find the craziest stuff possible that makes sense. Everything fits in somehow. Mandela effect is not the truth just a side note on my username I don't believe in it I just made this account to post this thing about a hidden island.(it was removed before anyone saw it btw so I'm obviously onto something)
      </p>
      <p>
       The way you beat emotions is like I said. Stop believing anything. Personally my trip went like this. I felt like shit about myself even though I was making good money it wasn't enough, I'm 21 btw so this all happened fast to me, I'm a fiend for knowledge. After I felt bad and I was depressed the world really beat me down, people I have listened to say "evolved souls put them into tough situations to see if they can get out of it" and I honestly believe that now lol. My parents and whole family are the polar opposite of what I've become, or what I always was.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are here to evolve as souls to learn lessons. I've learned many lessons and I'm sure I have many more to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember it's Archon feeding season right now though. The entire world has been made to pull all the negatives out of us. The truth is out there but trust me it's nowhere on the internet. You gotta look around and think. That's the only way. The trick is knowing Satan mixes truth with lies. It's always truth with lies, look closely and see where he's lying. If you take psychedelic drugs and do what I say. BELIEVE NOTHING. Once you believe nothing be a skeptic of everything you've ever been taught and take another look. You'll see the picture it paints very vividly. Follow it the whole way and you realize how simple you can really make life. I could get a bunch of brown rice and a fire and I'd be happy, for a given time. We're going through a struggle obviously up ahead so it's best to prepare yourself for anything (mentally) I don't have a food supply or anything. Every part of your emotions are part of the lie. If you find the truth all your emotional baggage gets deleted. You don't even know you have it until it gets deleted and you're like WTF? The higher levels of consciousness are not giving a fuck. The less you give a fuck the more you'll learn. Everything you read everywhere you go teaches the world backwards it's fucked how everyone believes it IMO. That's why humans struggle so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans used to have a world where you could pick an apple, sit with your friends and talk, go to sleep and do it all the next day. There literally used to be trees that grew fruit everywhere. 20 hour work week would be considered a solid work week. Drugs are more than approved of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe nothing, disconnect from society, disconnect from emotion, disconnect from belief. Go from there. Find a new path because wherever your intuition takes you, just always adapt, smooth the edges you'll always be able to figure out what makes sense. Basically there's a master key and if you figure it out you'll figure out way too much. Healthy eating, fasting, those are good things too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the archons are always trying to feed on you. Nothing else do not fear them lol. God is in control of all but Archons are what make people grow. Without struggle comes no change. Look around humans are struggling and everyone who wants to change anything is a crazy conspiracy theorist. That's how complacent humanity is. Get away from the world and their opinions. There are 2 sides to sanity and the second one is a lot scarier than the other but you beat depression and always have true knowledge and keys to find. I am always searching for new keys which is why I like saying they are shills because honestly, David Icke I learned a lot from when I was starting. People bash him a lot but I think he's a good stepping stone. Just know there is even higher than David Icke lol. He's fucking crazy to the average person and I'd say he's only halfway there, he knows it too. There's just so far you can go without everyone telling you you're nuts. He already was called nuts for decades but he has a lot of knowledge I gotta admit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Archons are masters at creating illusions. Sometimes I wonder if the illusion is even bigger than we think it is. When you get that high in the ladder it's weird because I really start to think that it's necessary Evil. It sorta is though because all people are just souls evolving. If that's true then Evil is needed to make them evolve. That's my logic at least.

       Exactly. Never give them any and be open to God and you beat the game. People won't believe you, but fuck em lol. Don't feed the archons by fighting the emotion and eventually God will show you the path on how to get to him. Once you're here you realize we are immortal beings and people on this life aren't made fair. I was already evolved when I got here I just had to remember. I was challenged real hard in life, but I am still good :) I have so much knowledge now I could really do anything. I will probably "sell my soul to the devil" and maybe I'll write a good spiritual book for people. Starve the Archons and you turn into a God if you figure out the truth. People who don't think we are here to evolve will lose the game because they never even started trying.

       is depicted often. Here's what it represents. Archons are the snakes. That scepter is your spinal cord, they feed off the energy. You have 6 chakras and the crown chakra. Your first 6, especially the bottom 3, hold you back. Listen to these people all around us hate, read what people say to me. It's obvious they are still stuck into the lower 3 chakras.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fight all 6 chakras and you realize you believe a lot of lies. Once you realize it that's when God is taking over. snakes on the first 6 chakras, beat the game and you get your angel wings, third eye open, and know the secrets to the universe. People will never believe you either, makes it even sweeter lol.

       Not strictly true; some of them prefer sexual energy. Maybe not fallen as far? I don't know. They have the status analogous to our zoophiles among the fallen.
