       Seems like it. Trump may quite possibly be the only candidate that Hillary actually stands a fighting chance against. Watching the debate last night I just kept shouting when he seemingly made an effort NOT to call her out on anything particularly damning- the emails, pay to play, DNC media collusion, the flip flops... Nothing. That just doesn't happen on accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are saying he was just being easy on her tonight and will pull out the guns next time but come on he literally had to just mention ONE of the billion glaring holes in her fluff, just ONE of the topics off wiki leaks and she would go down burning. He grandstands all this time then suddenly becomes tame as a toothless dog and puts on the kid gloves during the potentially most-watched debate in history?
      </p>
      <p>
       That definitely happened on purpose.

       I wouldn't be surprised at this point if he went on a disjointed rant about "law and order" needing to confiscate guns during the next debate. Especially if we get more manufactured town riots or totally-not-a-cell-guys "lone wolf" mall shootings in the meanwhile.

       Remember this, permalink it, as its very plausible, but the next thing Trump will start talking about is how guns are bad, how they need to be removed, etc.

       He's a scaredycat that wears body armor everywhere. He's also a scaredycat that won't say shit about pharmaco's issue w/people with certain physiologies in overdose and/or withdrawal killing everyone around them. Same with Clinton. No courage, no honor.

       Things are really heated with the election right now. Lot's of zealots on both sides. Most of them clinging to that last fragment of hope within their broken bodies. Lashing out at any perceived threat. It's sad to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realized how serious some people are taking this election the other day. An elderly gentleman threatened to knock me out over some political banter where I dared to question his beliefs. People are really wound up.

       I have a suspicion this might be that phase where people have to find their humility. And nobody likes eating humble pie.

       Do you feel comfortable listing which usernames sent them to you? I just got some...and I'm an Indie, I don't understand what their aim is. Like they threaten me in Trump's name and I'd vote for him? Or I'd decide to switch from third party to Trump because a Trump supporter threatened to shoot me in the face and called me names? I'm one vote, I always vote third party as dissent. Threaten me all you want, I don't give a fuck. It's ridiculous.

       Honestly just reported them and blocked them, wish I had them still.

      <p>
       I don't understand the point of people threatening people, most people aren't intimidated when someone threatens them face to face, what the fuck do they think sending messages on a computer will do?

      <p>
       I never expressed any bias, or any direct correlation with trump or hillary, I think they both fucking suck, and I won't vote. I just know for a fact this entire facade is stupid, they should just state that the highest bidder gets POTUS, or those who have made the most money, who have helped people launder the most money, etc.

       EDIT: Oh fuck yea I would list their usernames. I just don't donate any of my time to them, I will if I receive any more.

       I hate blocking because it's a loss of additional intel. Also, blocking on Reddit is bunk - you block them, but they can still see you and talk shit to you that others see and you don't - wtf is up with that? Block should mean they can't stalk you without you knowing. (Note that I will occasionaly report people that send abusive PMs mostly because they're likely to be abusing others. Only time I ever reported someone on here - one of those GMO-troll-fuckers - was because I clicked on his history and saw how bad he was abusing other people.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what's wrong with too few women in tech - a complete ridiculousness in understanding how to implement blocking tech.

       Huh, the more you know. I honestly don't worry about it, if they were someone to fear, they wouldn't be telling me they would be killing me, they would just do it.

      <p>
       Plus, why would someone risk their lives to attempt to kill someone (it's not guaranteed, for all you know I sleep with a gun on my side of the bed between the mattress and boxspring) over something that they have no power of controlling.

       The thing is, these kids act tough saying things like that, but the second they do it to someone who is truly intelligent (NOT ME!) who knows how to like find people or information and etc, they will shit bricks.

       Just doxx them and report them to the local authorities for uttering threats.  Or don't, that does take a lot of time and effort.

       IDK how to doxx (I am not that smart lol), not worried about it, a real killer will usually give you a warning, a chance to turn around, metaphorically or physically, they will not 'utter death threats', they aren't after normal people like you and me usually, they are after monsters, monsters like to kill other monsters.

       Keyboard courage is an amazing thing. They think their IP is hidden and no one can see them. It can turn a 5'9" 135 lb Poindexter into a 6'5" 265 lb assassin. Just think of it as all they have is keyboard courage.

       Either shills or people who are protecting the view of the world they feel more comfortable with. (That the election is just a reality show and the winner was decided long ago) Seems like a very banal and common perspective on this sub.

       Wow. What a revelation. I myself and countless others have known this from day one. I actually called it when she took the job as Secretary of State under Obama (who she HATES). The only way she would have taken that position under Obama was if she was given a guarantee of being the next in line for the Presidency. When she left in 2012, it only reinforced my belief, because she would need the time to prepare her campaign (and rest, as it would be the last time she would have the opportunity).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's campaign has been nothing but theater from day one. He is a sort release valve for the years worth of built-up angst of the conservative White working class in the US, who have been increasingly marginalized and have not had a voice or any public figure advocating for them since Obama took office. I knew Trump's bid for the presidency was bullshit from day one. Oh, also....it seems as if Trump's campaign has also served another, even more important purpose, the infiltration and near-destruction of nearly all Alternative News ("conspiracy") outlets and messageboards. The Alt-Right movement has been DECIMATED by Trump's campaign, and it will never recover. I do think the burgeoning Alt-Right movement had very real potential and it scared the shit out of the establishment. Now, it is a joke. When Trump loses in November, most of the Alt-Righters who fell for the Trump psyop will be crushed. They will be crawling away with their heads bowed down in shame, their proverbial tails between their legs, and they will hide in their proverbial holes until Good knows when. Trump's loss will create an overwhelming sense of disillusionment, hopelessness and defeat in an already disenfranchised people.
I know you feel pretty sharp for having figured this out, bud, but you're a little late to the game!

       It's great that you can comment, but try to be a little less assumptive.

      <p>
       The only one who wants to project "feeling sharp" is you, your a clown for stating something the community and I have been well aware of, I did not know the death threats were becoming a thing, they are funny as hell, a real killer will find you and kill you, if you get in their way, they will warn you once, they don't need to threaten or provoke, they do.
      </p>

       Seems like you feel pretty sharp for having assumed this, but your stating known facts that no one cares about!

       Don't let him get to you, he's a coward doing the work of fools. I think the purpose is to try to intimidate us into shutting up - interestingly, he targeted me after I posted some stuff about Clinton stealing the Nevada election. He claims to be a Trump supporter, but also claims to be a raging anti-semite - anyone paying attention can see that

       I made the mistake of reporting the PM then blocking the user, I wish I didn't, if a mod could go through my PM's (was like the third last one I received) they would be able to see it.
