       She took millions in bribes from Saudi Arabia while Secretary of State in exchange for arms deals. She did this through her money laundering organization known as the Clinton Foundation and she did this in spite of Saudi Arabia's innumerable human rights offenses and war crimes.

       I think the user is saying that if you look at really any of the major controversies that Hillary has been involved in, there has been a noticeable agenda to censor or mass down vote such stories on the politics subreddit...
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the articles showing clear evidence of election fraud in Kentucky that came out this week? Politics subreddit has a resounding air reiterating very specific talking points if you pay attention to it.

       If you're going to post conspiracies and say, "there are 0 threads on the lies Clinton tells". . . Just search for the posts and you'll find them... Pages of them.  With thousands of upvotes and discussions.  I literally typed in "Clinton wrong" and got pages of relevant content

       Exactly. If anyone remembers the Bern period r/politics made him out to be the next coming christ and had me convinced he would be the nominee. But reddit is a very skewed and small slice of the pie. I'm subscribed to both r/politics and r/the_donald and they are both just propaganda machines and misrepresentations of the rest of the country. Hillary should be in prison no doubt in my mind about that.

       It's strange that it's been like that all day today. All posts on that sub's front page is clearly anti trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump did bring up the Fed and how rigged it is. Pretty cool to hear because the Fed was never mentioned during the Romney and Obama debates....At least from what I remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, I still think we are fucked. Ron Paul talked these same talking points that Trump briefly discussed in a 90 min debate and was black balled from the whole process. There's no shot that anything changed from 2012 to now where Trump has free range on this topic.

       Ron Paul seems like a pretty well thought and well spoken guy, even if you disagree with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump comes off as a raving businessman  who has very little idea what he's talking about. I've met people like this (usually in sales). They are great at sounding good, being friendly and relatable, but they over rely on buzzwords of the day. Generally if you have a cursory knowledge of the topic and ask them any kind of follow up questions it's easy to see they don't know what they're talking about. That's trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       HRC is everything wrong with the government but at least she knows what she is doing and can be fought. Who the fuck knows what trump is doing or what his endgame is. I suspect it's less MAGA and more MATA (make trump great, awesome)

       This is what surprised me. During the Dem primaries, pro-Bernie articles were everywhere. Once the race was over and Clinton was declared the nominee, it became pro-Hillary overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I know all of those Bernie supporters didn't just switch their allegiance to Clinton. Many (like me) looked at what happened during the primaries and became even more disgusted with Clinton.

       So yeah, CTR. No doubt. It's so bad they even implemented a policy banning people from calling out obvious shills (can't interfere with that big fat check that's likely rolling into Reddit or its mods, or both).

       But that is expected.  Just like  most Cruz supporters are now supporting Trump, a lot of Bernie supporters are supporting Clinton.  It happens every election, too many people vote based on party instead of person in the general.

       I was not talking about that I was talking about people that support one candidate during the primary moving their support over to the candidate that won the primary in the general election.

       Again that just gets at what I said above.  Many (not all) people that voted for Bernie were always going to vote for who every won the primary in the general elections because they are life long Democrat voters.  The same goes for right.Most people who voted against Trump in the primaries are going to now vote for Trump in the general because they are life long Republican voters.  Both groups will vote for who ever their party through out there.

       Nah that's where you are wrong. You don't just start a huge movement railing against the establishment and then once you are forced out you go back and vote for the same corrupt establishment that you were just railing against. The dems fucked up, let me deal with the consequences

       I voted for Bernie in the the primaries because he was anti-establishment.

      <p>
       I will be voting for Trump in the General. Worst case, he fucks up so bad that the GOP and DEM will get their shit together.  Clinton represents everything that has been wrong with Washington for the last 26 years.

       That's what paid opposition looks like...it only proves that the Klinton KKlan are very desperate...it's like she has no path to victory. She's killing herself in the polls just by being herself. She was up in the polls until she came out of hiding, now this nosedive started and won't let up. The funny part is it has nothing to do with her criminality, her racist parties leaks calling mexican's "tacos," her hatred of black superpredators,  her collusion to steal the race from Sanders, her hundreds of millions in donations from terrorist countries...no, it's just her unlikable visage that repulses people so much that Trump has become a viable candidate.

       Finland was something of an exception where they reported that Hillary seemed smug and condescending during the debate while Trump held it together. They reported that voters are more sensitive to these attitudes the candidate manifests than what is actually said.

       Right, so r/politics gets to have a page filled with Trump's lies being exposed and Clinton's lies get to skate by completely unchallenged. To say nothing of OTHER THINGS going on in politics not relating to Clinton or Trump's lies, like how the man responsible for destroying government records on Clinton's behalf literally referred to the act as a "cover up" and literally went on Reddit to ask for tips on how to obstruct justice and break federal records laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything going on there in r/politics right now is just super appropriate, you're absolutely right! Nothing untoward going on here with CTR using vote manipulation to take over the subreddit to push their pro-Clinton agenda!

       CTR has been fucking up r/politics since like January or something. There used to be LITERALLY NO ONE in that sub who was pro-Clinton. Then, right when CTR made their first big announcement about a social media push, r/politics got a sizeable amount of Clinton folks suddenly. Then later, literally the VERY NEXT DAY after the Democratic national Convention ended (you know, the convention where half the delegates were protesting the DNC's recently exposed election fraud?), they were able to take over COMPLETELY. CTR now has that subreddit on lock, and even more than this, the mods even ban dissenters too. I was permanently banned from r/politics during the primaries because I wouldn't stop talking about exit polls and election fraud.

       Media lackeys doing legwork for Hillary, I bet. You should have heard the CNN debate panelists last night. They were so quick to crown Hillary the "winner." This election is being driven by dislike of a candidate more than anything else. How many times have you heard the narrative "better her than Trump"? (obligatory fuck them both.)

       "In modern times, an individual finds the abstract form ready made. Let modern man read reviews of works, and even go to the length of reading the prefaces and first paragraphs of the works themselves; for the latter give the general principles on which everything turns, while the reviews along with the historical notice provide over and above the critical judgment and appreciation, which, being a judgment passed on the work, goes farther than the work that is judged. This common way a man can take in his dressing-gown. But spiritual elation in the eternal, the sacred, the infinite, moves along the high way of truth in the robes of the god emperor."

       is a bunch of articles about Trump saying things that aren't true during the debate, with some quotes of his such as "Trump brags about not paying taxes: 'That makes me smart'" and "Donald Trump Is Proud of Raising Questions About Obama’s Birthplace: 'I Did a Good Job’".

       It took the MSM and corporate backing for Trump and Hillary to win the primaries.   So,  this is really insane that people are not going to vote the end of corporate buying of politicians and vote Jill,  that sheeple are going to obsess over the turds that the MSM is pushing.

       I honestly don't understand how everyone doesn't hate them both. I mean come on, did you guys actually watch that debate last night? 
There are children who have more patience and logic than either of those two when debating. 
If any of you need proof of it, I will gladly post a link of children having a more sophisticated debate than these two morons.

       It kind of makes sense seeing as how Clinton won last night.  I'm not going by what the media says either, I'm going by what today's polls say:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/">
        http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Going by most polls, Clinton has broadened her lead.  Hopefully she loses it before Election Day.

       Jeez, I thought no one would bring this up. Every piece is just anti-Russia, anti-Trump or pro-Clinton. The only thing that wasn't Anti is Clinton losing her
       <em>
        lead
       </em>
       against Trump, which is still susceptible to being pro-Clinton.

       But that doesn't mean I think Clinton's better.  If he's a dumb or a coked up as he seems, then he is far less of a threat than Killary's evil backed by smart evil people with a metric shit ton of not only money-- gold.

       People have always hated him. I really don't understand why they think he's magically this amazing savior we've been needing when he's been in the news since the 80s for being a massive conceited asshole.

       I remember once talking about how it would take us voting in Lex Luthor to realize we need to fix our government, but now we're stuck with either Lex Luthor or Sen Kelly from the X-Men and half the country is just has willing to vilify Superman as they are the X-Men.

       I'm no trump supporter, but he shut her down on most everything.. especially the important stuff (her rigging the primary, her support for TPP and the Iraq war). None of that will ever be mentioned again by any reporter. And she herself literally did not respond to those topics whatsoever.

       All credible sources I've seen suggest that he clearly won the debate. Keep trying to push your agenda though, I'm sure someone here will see your mass downvotes and be fooled into not realizing that you're full of shit.

       It's an agenda to reflexively claim Trump somehow didn't look like a petulant child simply because he isn't Hillary. I don't like either candidate, but he looked awful. Sorry.

       Trump was a complete jackass, Hillary rehearsed her pitch, which is good... I don't believe shit she says, but at least she was clear. Trump was transparent and I found it difficult to want my vote on him.
