    <div class="md"><p>I use it as an irony, I figured the name would draw attention here and there as well. </p>

<p>I know that shills might create a new account to get their points across, but I&#39;m also of the mind that OLDER accounts are more likely to be used because their legitimacy is more likely to be unquestioned. A lot of people who aren&#39;t privvy to being traced will make new accounts in order to post sensitive information, and I was just commending the user who was speaking up for them. </p>

<p>Think about it, based off of what you just said in your reply: Are you more likely to be influenced by a six year user/a mod; or a one day old account? Those older accounts and mod accounts are of high value to shills, and therefore someone is willing to pay users who own these accounts high $$$ in order to utilize them and get their point across. </p>

<p>Just a thought, hell this sub has even had their mod team infiltrated before, and I doubt that only ONE mod was a shill, he&#39;s just the only guy that got caught. There&#39;s just too much money in it, and humans are highly susceptible to greed. Especially when it comes to something of seemingly no consequence such as selling a 6 year old mod account. I appreciate the fact that you pointed this out though, because it&#39;s true, but so is what I&#39;m saying/have said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is prism/ echelon. We must rule the world by securing markets and regions for Americans to operate in. Obama knows this global shadow is falling out into the public through unaoil, Panama Papers and such. Their group is colluding to control the world through the American government using the military to secure it. That way we don&#39;t lose a market or area to Russia/ China/ India... he knew he was acting outside of his presidency for personal reasons. Hillary has orchestrated this new model after Kissinger and wants to sit on top of it as the doors will be wide tf open. They know if they can create a safe zone outside of America, they can drop the country, stay wealthy, and be a part of a bigger system backed by the bankers, who i assume are the glue to all the corruption and bribes and global economic manipulation. The network is pretty extensive. Hillary can start a war and can promise payouts upon victory bc their network is huge and rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Webster Tarpley talks about this shift from neocons to neoliberals in his talk &#39;power shift in washington&#39; and I&#39;ve fact checked him and he&#39;s right.  There&#39;s very little diff between neocons and neoliberals, and that diff seems to be a matter of scale and scope: neocons were focused around israel out by 500mi radius whereas neolibs want the whole world.  Basically the sabbatean milenarian freemasons versus the jesuits, they both work for the pope but have different concerns and ways of bringing about the new world...which isn&#39;t so much a thing as it is a process of maintaining citizen control via stark classism and dominance of the 4th world--the mind, through nonlinear warfare such as the turducken of conspiracy fakeouts we&#39;ve been sieged by (flat earth, mandel effect, badselfeater, hillary died, hillary health issues, hillary hologram).  They don&#39;t need to move people around or even lose the concept of countries, they just have to have a system than can achive total information awareness and yet also have influence in every country in realtime...so that means markets..they want to bring the &#39;market&#39; to every country.  </p>

<p>Only problem is, they want to control the market too, which means 2 things: 1) since they are controlling the market, they know what it will do, leading obviously to insider trading, 2) they convince us &#39;moronic&#39; underclassmen that it&#39;s <em>anarcho-capitalism</em>-- espousing the &#39;american exceptionalism&#39; of freedom and opportunity--when it&#39;s nothing of the sort: it&#39;s totally under control.</p>

<p>There are many ways you know this.  First of all, A) if they have money to control the military, they know when conflicts will occur, since they will create them. B) Then they can fund both sides of the conflict which is a type of extortion from the average global everyperson who pays taxes in order to feel &#39;safe&#39; by having a &#39;strong national defense&#39;...they can do this all day and no one picks up on this...they&#39;ve been doing it in fact (google rothschild &#39;demon brothers funding conflicts&#39;) for over 200 yrs;  C) they have historically been caught grooming would-be low-level islamic terrorists into full blown threats when they otherwise would not (FBI groomed bomber of WTC 1993)--many examples of these psyops and blackops exist (see list of confirmed conspiracies on right sidebar); D) they are never punished if the market ruins them (except solyndra), and instead are rewarded for misbehavior by bailouts (except solyndra, which could have changed our country&#39;s political tetherings if it were succesful---the us gov should have taken over their operations and give us free panels, but instead let our taxes disappear in ruin and then we kickstarted the fracking industry...do you think this was an accident?) </p>

<p>Secondly, this ruling class of oligarchs (neocons/neolibs) own the media, so they can brain wash you through propaganda, which the military industrial complex proved via MKULTRA is the most powerful form of &#39;soft&#39; control you can have--the damn television.  <em>They don&#39;t call it &#39;programming&#39; for nothing</em>. </p>

<p>They are going to keep doing this until we figure out their game and stop participating in it, and instead build our own markets that are incorruptible, with tools like bitcoin.  Oh yes, a wall street that&#39;s powered by a cryptocoin that&#39;s not already in use, and has been harded by algorithms that are quantum safe so their retard prisn can&#39;t break it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good response. After many years of looking at everything from different angles, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve come up with. The only way to fix things is to literally round up every banker and current politician and maker manipulators and keep them from having anything to do with money or politics. They can have the island of Lanai in Hawaii and we&#39;ll ship them food, but they can&#39;t access the internet, phones, out any communications and can&#39;t operate outside of that. We are so advanced and smart, yet stiff that&#39;s so obvious continues on. You can kill 100,000 people who have taken control
l of people through money and save the world, or stay fearful and watch hundreds of millions suffer and die around you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>April 22<br/>
     This has been a day of horrible discovery. I explored the cobwebbed attic again, and found a carved, crumbling chest—plainly from Holland—full of blasphemous books and papers far older than any hitherto encountered here. There was a Greek Necronomicon, a Norman-French Livre d’Eibon, and a first edition of old Ludvig Prinn’s De Vermis Mysteriis. But the old bound manuscript was the worst. It was in low Latin, and full of the strange, crabbed handwriting of Claes van der Heyl—being evidently the diary or notebook kept by him between 1560 and 1580. When I unfastened the blackened silver clasp and opened the yellowed leaves a coloured drawing fluttered out—the likeness of a monstrous creature resembling nothing so much as a squid, beaked and tentacled, with great yellow eyes, and with certain abominable approximations to the human form in its contours.<br/>
     I had never before seen so utterly loathsome and nightmarish a form. On the paws, feet, and head-tentacles were curious claws—reminding me of the colossal shadow-shapes which have groped so horribly in my path—while the entity as a whole sat upon a great throne-like pedestal inscribed with unknown hieroglyphs of vaguely Chinese cast. About both writing and image there hung an air of sinister evil so profound and pervasive that I could not think it the product of any one world or age. Rather must that monstrous shape be a focus for all the evil in unbounded space, throughout the aeons past and to come—and those eldritch symbols be vile sentient eikons endowed with a morbid life of their own and ready to wrest themselves from the parchment for the reader’s destruction. To the meaning of that monster and of those hieroglyphs I had no clue, but I knew that both had been traced with a hellish precision and for no namable purpose. As I studied the leering characters, their kinship to the symbols on that ominous lock in the cellar became more and more manifest. I left the picture in the attic, for never could sleep come to me with such a thing nearby.<br/>
     All the afternoon and evening I read in the manuscript book of old Claes van der Heyl, and what I read will cloud and make horrible whatever period of life lies ahead of me. The genesis of the world, and of previous worlds, unfolded itself before my eyes. I learned of the city Shamballah, built by the Lemurians fifty million years ago, yet inviolate still behind its walls of psychic force in the eastern desert. I learned of the Book of Dzyan, whose first six chapters antedate the earth, and which was old when the lords of Venus came through space in their ships to civilise our planet. And I saw recorded in writing for the first time that name which others had spoken to me in whispers, and which I had known in a closer and more horrible way—the shunned and dreaded name of Yian-Ho.
     In several places I was held up by passages requiring a key. Eventually, from various allusions, I gathered that old Claes had not dared to embody all his knowledge in one book, but had left certain points for another. Neither volume can be wholly intelligible without its fellow; hence I have resolved to find the second one if it lies anywhere within this accursed house. Though plainly a prisoner, I have not lost my lifelong zeal for the unknown; and am determined to probe the cosmos as deeply as possible before doom comes.</em></p>
