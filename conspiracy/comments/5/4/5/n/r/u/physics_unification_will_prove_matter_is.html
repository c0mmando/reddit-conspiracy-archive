       Hey guys
      </p>
      <p>
       I wrote this up for
       <a href="/r/holofractal">
        /r/holofractal
       </a>
       but the implications for the occult/spirituality are immense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted to reiterate some very important aspects of this theory that link it to modern physics that I feel aren't spoken on enough
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Lets think about the basics of how relativity and Einsteins field equations link with quantum mechanics.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Einstein wrote equations to describe how the cubic grid structure of space would behave under the influenece of mass. This is simply a coordinate system that fluxes in response to matter. Imagine cubic lines of force, and imagine what would happen if we introduced mass, and the ensuing contracting that would occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've seen depictions of this like so:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/files/2012/07/Curved_in_3D.jpg">
        http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/files/2012/07/Curved_in_3D.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there's something thats not immediately obvious. These equations
       <strong>
        were only solved when an infinity is introduced
       </strong>
       - creating our formal descripion of a black hole. Put simply the black hole is massive or energetic enough for the cubic grid to ultimately become a single point - infinite curvature of space causing 'singularity'.
      </p>
      <p>
       What also is curious about this solution to Einstein's equations is that
       <strong>
        it's the equation used to calculate orbitals for planets/suns/etc - even though it predicts a black hole in the center.
       </strong>
       It's said to be an approximation, but I'll tell you why it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets jump over to the basics of quantum mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantum field theory states that each and every point in space is filled with field energy, such as the electromagnetic field. Therefore, each and every point in of the field must be divided or quantized into a harmonic oscillator, which is a fancy word that just means an energetic oscillation, which can be envisioned simply as a ball and spring. Think of a fractal sine wave. This is what is being envisioned in the 'quantum field' - and since each point must be quantized, the smaller the 'piece' or section of the wave that you quantize, the higer the frequency, the higher the energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads to a formally infinite energy at each point in space.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy">
        Wiki - Vacuum Energy
       </a>
       There is no lower limit on the size of the quanta, thus there is no limit to the amount of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Max Planck figured out that our Universe's energetic fields appear to work on a smallest quanta of a specific length, the planck length. This is how he (Planck) figured out how much energy photons are putting out from light emitters - which was also giving an infinite energy for ultraviolet radiation. This obviously didn't jive. After quantizing the energy into planck length fluctuations of the planck mass energy - so that this light or energy was being sent in planck-cutoff sized packets, he was able to solve the UV catastrophe.
      </p>
      <p>
       This led physicists to put a 'cutoff size' of the harmonic oscillator filled quantum field permetaing all space at the planck length - called renormalization - because we now know that the electromagnetic field is made up of planck-sized packets.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       is absurdly more energy than we can directly observe. Using the planck length quantization you are still left with a harmonic oscillation energy of the planck mass which when multiplied by the amount that fit in a cm
       <sup>

       </sup>
       of vacuum leaves 10
       <sup>
        93
       </sup>
       grams, orders of magnitude higher than what you would get if you smushed the whole Universe into a cm
       <sup>
        3.
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is now said to simply be virtual and unreal - its basically written off.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have an infinity in the predicted field energy of the vacuum, and we have an infinite curvature of space solution to relativity that describes all gravitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Wheeler was one of the first to describe a geon, which is pure field energy so massive that it could keep itself together gravitationally, just like the Einstein field equations predict for a black hole surrounding a physical mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all we need is to change our perspective on a few things to knit this together.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vacuum energy of the planck density IS real, space = the quantum vacuum = 10
       <sup>
        93
       </sup>
       grams/cm
       <sup>
        3.
       </sup>
       The vacuum is a series of overlapping geons, it's made of overlapping planck spherical units (PSU) of the planck mass. Each PSU being a spherical oscillation of light whose simple field energy is massive enough to keep it gravitationally together, it's a black hole made of light. This black hole is a Kerr-Newman black hole, which gives it certain properties, one being that it could have a spin state of 1 or -1, allowing it to essentially function as a bit of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       This black hole is the infinity that links QM and relativities infinities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Space IS the quantum vacuum, and these are not separate, and space is not simply an abstract coordinate system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have placed a black hole at each and every point in space which is what the Einstein Field equations are showing us as the solution for mass/curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       But how can we reconcile the fact that we don't clearly see 10
       <sup>
        93
       </sup>
       grams/cm
       <sup>
        3
       </sup>
       in empty space? Wouldn't that cause all points of space to attract all other points of space?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, we have to adopt Nassim's vacuum geometry, that is - the geometry of these overlapping spherical black holes - which is based on Bucky Fullers work in synergetics. Essentially Bucky knew that energy was going to be quantized spheres - so he imagined how these could pack and what the dynamics of energetic packing would look like.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as to not get too deep into this part of the theory, just imagine that there exists a method of packing energetic ovarlapping spheres so that outwardly their energy cancelled out, and appear as zero-point - infinite potential, but zero output - a sort of crystalline geometry which seemingly freezes the harmonic oscillation to an outside observer - so space is 'frozen' in empty space (except for a tiny amount which we see as the cosmological constant/dark energy causing expansion) - THIS is the geometry of a black hole &amp; singularity, NOT an infinte-point-singularity. The reasoning behind this is that all vectors are of equal length, so equal force, so no vectors of force.
      </p>
      <p>
       The geometry looks like this
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/btQaGYo.png">
        bottom left two
       </a>
       - a vector equilibrium/cube-octahedron.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what your quantum vacuum fractal harmonic oscillations look like, not as fractal ball-and-spring, but as fractal cube-octahedral jitterbug.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the planck unit in a planck mass is energetic enough to make itself a black hole, it
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       creates a formal Einstein Rosen bridge, an effect on the Einstein field equations that describe a wormhole that flattens distant coordinates in the space grid to a single point. Simply imagine the coordinate system being pinched together, like a stretched black hole. The conditions that allow this to arise is called a Bose Einstein Condensate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means the quantum vacuum and space, being made of PSUs, is connected everywhere pretty much like a hyperdimensional overlay that knits all 3d coordiates into a singularity, put simply - all points in space are touching at length=0 geometrically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, we have to re-envision matter as a function of this space/quantum vacuum, not as a particle that gets it's energy from some higgs field.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have described space as a superfluid (Bose Einstein Condensate) of quantized light energy packets, of which fill the entire universe with infinite energy, normally unperceivable but allow an infinite potential of creation at each point, that when 'activated' by simply having multiple PSUs co-spin or co-orbit (jitterbugging of the aforementioned vector equilibrium) at the speed of light - becomes matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next comes the PSU holographic pixelation solution for the proton, which proves by using these fundamental black hole based units you create an even bigger atomic-sized holographic black hole, which contains enough planck spherical units (and their bit 1/-1  / spin) to encode the information/spin information of all other protons (precisely 10
       <sup>
        55
       </sup>
       grams of planck masses fit in the proton volume, the mass of the observable Universe) - which use the PSU bose einstein condensate lattice to exchange information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason we don't see this 10
       <sup>
        55
       </sup>
       grams in each proton is simply due to the space structure that's been elucidated - the majority of the protons holographic mass is instantly transferred out through the PSU lattice. If we divide the surface PSUs (10
       <sup>
        40)
       </sup>
       by the volume PSUs (10
       <sup>
        60)
       </sup>
       and multiply by the planck mass, we yield the standard rest mass of 10
       <sup>
        -24
       </sup>
       grams - proving the proton is a holographic black hole.

       You're right about one thing at least - this is some "kind of shit", but in the way that it is complete guff. Don't get taken in by this nonsense, it is posted in a pseudo-intellectual way using tonnes of buzzwords to make it seem sound but when you look beneath the surface this whole "hypothesis" is gibberish.

       Whilst this quote contains order of magnitude computations, its very logic is deeply flawed and inconsequential - those rough calculations do not, in any way, "prove" that the "proton is a holographic black hole".

       I am a Physicist in academia and I can tell you right now that pretty much all of the OP's post is very much considered fringe-science with no grounding in reality nor any proper experimental or observational evidence to support it.

       If you are yet to see the equation, not sure how you could say this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The equation literally posits a direct relationship between any black hole's radius and it's Schwarzchild mass, and it works on the proton.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are already aware we can calculate the entropy of a black hole by dividing the surface by planck areas?
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the black holes described are made of photons, and the holographic principle states that the surface of a black hole can encode the volume - and we elucidated a wormhole/BEC structure of space that would allow any information portrayed on the surface of a black hole to be non-local, you don't see the logic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the proton charge radius (accepted standard model). Find the volume. Divide by a PSU. Multiply by planck mass. 10
       <sup>
        55
       </sup>
       grams.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calculate the amount that fit on the surface. Since they encode the volume, divide by the amount that fit in the volume. Multiply by planck mass. Standard rest mass, within a standard deviation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also go backwards, starting with the rest mass, to accurately deduce the proton charge radius elucidated via muonic hydrogen in Switzerland (the one thats 4% off of the standard model and they have no idea why?)
      </p>
      <p>
       If we then take THIS new deduced radius, and plug it in to yield a mass, the mass matches 2 more orders of magnitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask you if you can say this is coincidence, considering that we're starting with a number that has 60 zeroes, and ending with a 10
       <sup>
        -24
       </sup>
       number.

        Stephen Hawking just published a new solution to the black hole information paradox - and it involves 'holographic hairs extending off of the event horizon'. "I propose that the information is stored not in the interior of the black hole as one might expect, but on its boundary, the event horizon,"

       I will address your concerns tomorrow, I'm in the pub right now. But it sounds like you need some humility my friend, referring to your own fringe-hypothesis as a "paradigm shifting science theory" will be no way to make the High-Energy Physics community take your correspondence seriously.

       Ever see a TV documentary show (like Unsolved Mysteries) where someone is referred to as "Scientist" ? Yeah. I feel "Physicist in Academia" and "Scientist" are about equally as credible to me.

       This. The whole post sounds great unless you actually have a grasp of physics, at which point it becomes a buzzword filled rambling steaming pile of crap.

       You've got my upvote. For those interested in understanding this topic but wanting to start with more basic ideas, I suggest "The Holographic Universe" by Michael Talbot.   It does an excellent job of introducing this theory to beginners.

       Why does anyone upvote this stuff? Do you guys not understand that the OP literally isn't saying anything of substance at all? He's telling a story about geometries of space, and allocations of energy, and interactions between forces, but the only explanations for why these things matter, or why any of this makes any sense, are the
       <em>
        invented
       </em>
       explanations
       <em>

       Outside of these invented explanations, outside of the story that doesn't actually intersect with reality, none of these things being brought up in the OP mean anything. How can anyone read this stuff and not immediately understand this?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a serious question. Do you guys do this all the time? Do you read things, investigate things, analyze things, and then simply believe them because they claim themselves to be true, even if you don't understand them? Why are you not checking and verifying if the information is true before you decide whether the information is valuable?

       You do realize that you should probably understand the mathematical underpinning of modern physics (smooth manifolds, lie groups/algebras, functional analysis, etc...) before you can make such a sweeping statement as "it's broken"? Now I get where you're coming from, I used to hold physics above all other sciences because it seemed to actually be describing the behavior and mechanism of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day though the standard model is nothing but that, a
       <strong>
        model
       </strong>
       . Very few physicists will tell you that the work they do actually represents the true nature of reality, they just have created the equivalent of a mathematical tinker toy which happens to predict real world measurements to high degrees of accuracy. The thing is this model is intrinsically no different than a predator prey model or the differential equations which model a pendulum. Modern television and pop-scientists like to pretend the world is made of quarks or strings or quantum foam but in the end they're just mathematical objects which unite disparate theories in elegant ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying physicists today aren't locked into the materialist paradigm or that a lot of modern physics isn't just mathematic masturbation (which shouldn't be peddled as reality but is otherwise fucking awesome) but any universe which can be summarized in a reddit post cannabalizing the results of hundreds of years of truly groundbreaking math is a universe I don't wanna live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, look up the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_large_numbers_hypothesis">
        Dirac large number hypothesis
       </a>
       , it may supply you with more ratios to fuel your funky theory.

       I don't want to talk to you, not about invented explanations or about anything else. I have seen you make these threads for years, and every single time, the only way you are able to defend your pet beliefs is with broken logic and mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which do you think is more likely: that you are completely delusional and mentally ill? Or that you have come to a correct, unified understanding of the entire universe that nobody else has been able to devise, even despite using observable, broken logic in all your posts. I think any idiot should be able to figure out which one of these two possibilities is the truth.

       Why would I need some peyote, dude. Real talk, I've definitely done my share of psychedelic drugs, DMT, plenty of LSD, all kinds of obscure tryptamines and 2Cs, yadda yadda. Never did peyote, tbh, but what's the difference? I promise I'm no stranger to that angle, not at all. But that doesn't mean the story in the OP abides by any logic or has any actual explanatory power. It doesn't!

       Yeah, I get your point and all, but having tripped on DMT has left me with a very unique image and feeling, which I barely have words to describe. My experience left me agnostic, and frankly, am hoping for death just to see if i'm right. I've read countless historical religious works and have looked for some point of origin to describe these creation myths, concepts of the afterlife, and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, I found the right word for what I saw when I was looking into some Sanskrit writtings, the divine spark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I always find these posts interesting to see if anyone else has anything to add to it. Also, being agnostic leaves me free to not give a shit if i'm wrong and hold a foot in either camp. But I am curious what happens to dead neurons, those electrical impulses certainly have to be discharged somewhere after the pump stops. The theory that everything is connected isn't a new one, but this certainly is one of the last places you can discuss it.

       Sorry for coming off as a loon, just wanted to add a bit of a historical perspective that spans about seven civilizations between 5000bc to 1500ad.

       no worries. I understand what you're talking about, I'm no stranger to the mysteries either. I've had my own lengthy journey that led me to a lot of the same conclusions drawn by various ancient cultures and wisdom traditions. You might be interested in what I've said about these things

       Enlightenment. That was another word for it, but I preferred the divine spark. Enlightenment was too much of a singular styled entity. What I felt was briefly everything. Zoomed right out, but saw millions of little globes, all with their own languages, memories.. It was very comforting and definitely not on a plane or axis I understood after, but briefly while a part of it.

       I call it enlightenment and illumination just to settle on some common terminology, since other traditions also call it by those names. I don't mean to make any declarative statements about the nature of the thing by using those terms, I just want it to have a name so conversation can be built around it.

       I never had any extremely profound DMT experiences. I've tasted them, I've gotten pretty deep, but I know I could have gone even farther. I have, however, had an extremely profound 5-MEO-DMT experience. I was blessed with a kind of transcendental awareness as it was happening, and the interconnectedness of all things was utterly self-evident to the point that it became intellectually comprehensible even after I came back from the experience. Totally changed my whole life, honestly

       broken logic again! Good job! Yeah I'm really impressed that some fancy folks are helping to produce a documentary. That must mean it's true just like Ancient Aliens is true; it couldn't possibly have any relation to how sensational bullshit gets good ratings and makes money. By the way, I would love to hear an alternate physics model that actually had some value to it; I would be very interested to hear all about it. That's not the reason you're mentally ill - the reason is because your thoughts are incoherent and your arguments are substantiated by nothing.

       To whom would you attribute this theory if not yourself? Or is it simply an interpretation of multiple, interrelated theories? May I ask what your credentials are either way? Thank you and I'm looking forward to part 2.

       “Before the incorporation of essence, so to speak, there were elements of consciousness. You may also term these to be ‘units,’ which others have expressed previously. (1) These elements of consciousness know no limits of time or space. You may think of these as very tiny black holes. You may think of them, if you will, in physical terms as elements smaller than your smallest physical particles; but these elements are that which create all physical expression. Everything within every universe within every dimension is created by these elements of consciousness, and they are everything. They are not only the driving force behind matter and action, but are matter and action also;
      </p>
      <p>
       “Let us view the workings of consciousness – what IS consciousness – and the distinctions of essence and consciousness. You may notice throughout this information that I express a distinction between essence and consciousness. Essence is consciousness, but there is consciousness that is not essence. Essence is also unlimited. This be the area that is very difficult for your understanding within physical focus, for you are so very accustomed to thinking in singular terms. All that you create within your physical dimension moves in this direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       “You create things. You identify things. Even things that you may not see you classify as things, and this creates great difficulty within your thinking and your imagining of how there may be an element that is not a thing and that may be some quality in itself but unbounded simultaneously, that may be thought of in the manner of a distinction but not separate....
      </p>
      <p>
       “In this, I have spoken previously of links of consciousness. Links of consciousness are not things either. They are elements of consciousness, but they hold no form. They are not within what you term to be a time framework, although they may be inserted into a time framework, but the time framework itself is comprised of links of consciousness, and these links of consciousness have no necessary space arrangement. They exist within all space arrangements simultaneously and within all time frameworks simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Now; links of consciousness may group together, and in specific types of groupings together create a tone, and they may choose collectively to be creating in conjunction with that tone what may be identified as personality. The personality is a specific organization of movement within a vibrational quality of a collective expression of these links of consciousness, which in this type of configuration is creating what we term to be essence.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Essence is not separate and apart from consciousness. There is no separate and apart from consciousness. There is no boundary to consciousness. There is no limit to consciousness. Therefore, there is no thing, no element, no action outside of consciousness, for there is no outside.- Within consciousness, the configuration of these links of consciousness creating personality tone is the designation of essence.
      </p>
      <p>
       “These configurations are not separate and apart from each other, for be remembering that I have expressed to you, each link of consciousness occupies all space arrangements and all time frameworks and all of consciousness. Therefore, one link of consciousness may be an element that is within the configuration or grouping that comprises itself to be creating of your essence, and simultaneously, that same link of consciousness occupies all other essences.”

       Let's say what you said is 100% correct.

      <p>
       So?

       We are currently trapped inside a "fake universe". It is a Matrix Simulation located within a small area of the actual "real universe". The beings that run this Matrix Simulation harvest negative human energy, and the Global Elite worship them and promote their horrific agendas.

       If we assume a background field has something to do with differences in mass and how this subsystem pervades and propagates, the source is still in question. The spark, so to speak. If there is a null charge in empty space, could that give rise to something from nothing? Then there was light? Maybe from dark matter leaking from a different universe or some other phenomenon? Light led to x-rays, then to electrons? The 1/100000000 electron then lost it's positron? Poor electron.

       Holistic version: The Universe is just one particle, zooming around, acting like all elementary particles and all energy of those other particles instantaneously making the illusion of matter and all we can see. Amen.

       Physics, like all science, is either wrong or really boring. Actual science involves collecting evidence through experiments and then trying to come up with an elegant model that predicts them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without showing how this model can be used to predict the observable universe, all this is is a bunch of words.

       broken logic again! Good job! Yeah I'm really impressed that some fancy folks are helping to produce a documentary. That must mean it's true just like Ancient Aliens is true; it couldn't possibly have any relation to how sensational bullshit gets good ratings and makes money. By the way, I would love to hear an alternate physics model that actually had some value to it; I would be very interested to hear all about it. That's not the reason you're mentally ill - the reason is because your thoughts are incoherent and your arguments are substantiated by nothing.

       P.S., I'm not commenting to talk to you. I'm commenting to help the unfortunate people you are deceiving. Just a heads up!
