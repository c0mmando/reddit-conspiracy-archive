          Politics in America is identical to pro wrestling.
         </p>
         <p>
          In front of the crowd, in front of TV, they pretend they hate each other. They pretend like they are big adversaries and that’s the sell job they do to us, the citizens. Just like pro wrestling, my job was to go out and piss everybody off so bad they would pay their hard earned money to go out and see me get my butt kicked. Well, the point is, we are all friends in the locker room. We all work together. It’s entertainment. We put on a show and this is no different. They are putting on a show, because behind the scenes, they are all friends. They go out to dinner together and cut their deals together. It’s a show. That’s what I believe. I taught at Harvard in 2004. Do you know what one of my classes was? How Pro Wrestling Prepares You For Politics.

       No, I don't buy this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Realize that one thing Donald Trump had done extremely well  — love him or hate him — is that he's completely discredited the mainstream media.  No other presidential R or D candidate in modern history has ever done that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump has, in that context, actually woken people up, at least the first (and biggest) stage of being woken up, which is to understand that the mainstream media is lying to you. Most people here including OP, have probably been conspiracy theorists long enough to develop a refined view of the world, even rejecting "mainstream conspiracy theory", as oxymoronic as that sounds.  Realize that most people in the United States aren't woke at all, and they've got to get their first dose from someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is breaking the spell that was cast by the mainstream media, and he's doing it nationally in front of millions of people. Is he perfect? Fuck no. But if he does ONE THING, to convince people that CNN is bullshit, to people that previously wrongly trusted it, then he's doing more than anyone here is, posting on the Internet.

       If they didn't like him they'd ignore him like they did Ron Paul. Go on YT and search "how they cheated Ron Paul of the presidency."

       Trump's meetings with the Council On Foreign Relations, AIPAC, and endorsement of fucking Rudy Guiliani as director of Homeland Security tells me all I need to know about the stupid looking fuck.

       They couldn't ignore Trump, he was too popular. Most Americans don't know who Ron Paul is. They tried their hardest to keep Trump from getting the nom. He was just too popular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Trump will sell out in the end, I don't know, but getting endorsements from a few people is not evidence of anything besides his popularity. Fucking
       <strong>
        Bush
       </strong>
       came out and said he's voting for Hillary. What does that tell you?
      </p>
      <p>
       The real idiots are the people who trot out the usual "RNC and DNC are two sides of the same coin" thing. If you believe that's the case right now you're just mindlessly applying the conspiracy theory heuristic. It simplydoesn't apply in this election because Trump was not the RNC pick. He was genuinely the pick of Republican voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying Trump is a good choice or even that he's better than Hillary. But the system really has been challenged this time.

       They want you to think they hate him, but they don't hate him any more than they hate the Democrats or even Ted Cruz. And they hate Osama Bin Laden, does that mean you should support him? You're falling for the narrative.

       I'd just like to point out that back in March/April it felt like the media were not really taking him all that seriously, and conservative talk radio was really, really pushing for Cruz.

       Unless conservative talk radio was pulling some kind of weird reverse psychology, then the whole story arc wasn't entirely orchestrated.

       Jeb spent the most money to get the least far.  I'm sure some of that money went to Shills in High Places (radio, talking heads, etc).

       Trump OTOH baited the media with controversial topics, and used what they said against them later.  People saw this, got energized, and like a turbocharger it fed on itself, until he was the only thing in the news.  All of that cost him $0.00, to live in their heads, rent-free.

       ""I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,'' Trump told New York magazine in a 2002 profile of Epstein written three years before Epstein began to be investigated. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life."

       Morning Joe on MSNBC discussed the Epstein topic on the air before they could censor it,  and before DNC/DWS clamped down on their Clinton criticisms.

      <p>
       They discuss the Trump/Clinton connection with Epstein. And if all true, that means sex trafficking is Epstein's business and Bill has been involved. All while Hill stood by... that's an accomplice in my books.

       Trump and Jeffrey Epstein (not Bill Clinton) are being sued (not indicted) by an anonymous Woman who claimed she was forcibly raped and threatened by them both when she was 13. The original Complaint was filed in California in April but dismissed on procedural Grounds because the Plaintiff's given Address was found to be an abandoned Property. Plaintiff claimed to have subsequently received threatening PhoneCalls. Nevertheless, the Lawsuit was refiled in NY on 20 June but then voluntarily dismissed on 16 September because...

      <blockquote>

        Thomas Meagher, attorney for the Jane Doe plaintiff said they plan to re-file the complaint, accompanied by a new witness affidavit, as soon as the end of next week. The new witness, pseudonymous Tiffany Doe, declares that she was hired by Jeffrey Epstein throughout the 1990s to recruit adolescent women to attend the billionaire's parties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alan Garten, executive vice president and general counsel for the Trump Organization, told Courthouse News via email that Meagher's allegations "are completely frivolous and appear to be politically motivated. Accordingly, we have warned Mr. Meagher that in the event he decides to refile his complaint we will seek to have him sanctioned," Garten said.

       The last true outsider to be president was Jimmy Carter, the system has been rigged for a long time and to assume it's still rigged is imo a safe assumption. Don't be so quick to call people idiots because they have a different outlook, that's a true mark of an ignoramus.

       Also I said it in my previous comment, the media literally built Trumps campaign. All they had to do was ignore him, and he would have poofed away. Nothing he said before this had any weight, the media gave it weight.

       No.  Trump literally baited the media with controversial topics.  They bit every single time, and this gave Trump free publicity (note that
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Committee_email_leak#Media">
        Hillary Clinton, OTOH, literally paid money and favors to mainstream media for her coverage, as the DNC Leaks explicitly pointed out.  We have the smoking gun there
       </a>
       ).  Trump didn't spend anything on this coverage, nor did the RNC, nor did the "Reptilian Illuminati overloards" .. lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media literally hates him, they tried (and failed) to talk shit about him every time they took his bait.  But it failed.  Trump knew this, he played them well, he's playing moves that aren't ever played by traditional politicians, that are quite unintuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scott Adams detailed this going WAY back to when Trump only had a 0.1% chance of winning, before any coverage started.  Read this.  If you can actually read it all the way through and NOT change your stance 180 degrees, I'll buy you a beer and mail it to you, free of charge.

       The part that you're completely missing is that I'm speaking about him in the context of running FOR PRESIDENT.  Being a presidential candidate is a different planet than being the producer and start of a reality TV show (a WILDLY successful one at that, that's been imitated in dozens of other countries.  And they're still running in Trump's absense because it's so successful).  Unlikable people pitch shows to networks all the time, and the networks are just looking at how much money they're  going to make.  That's it.  But a presidential candidate on the other hand, and one that's running against another better-connected candidate that has admittedly (see: DNC leaks) paid money and favors to mainstream media for favorable coverage (and unfavorable coverage of other candidates) -- they have a clear motive to sabotage Donald Trump's personal character and misrepresent his issues.  Which they have.  CNN has blatantly admitted that they're doing everything in their power to get Hillary elected.  Don Lemon personally hates Trump and is very adamant about that. Find me ANYTHING where Lemon is saying something pro-trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it a bit more clearly: Yes, the media hates him, I read the headlines every day.  I have collages of headlines that I can send you.  Specifically when I say "the media" I mean: CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, New York Times, Huffington Post, Facebook (which is probably the largest news aggregator in the world and they've been caught red-handed modifying their ranking algorithms to favor Hillary Clinton -- I can provide links to this), Politifact and Tampa Bay Times, Snopes, Fox News (on occasion), BBC, Business Insider, The Economist, Wall Street Journal, NBC News, Twitter, Google and Google News (again, ranking algorithms and censorship), Time, and Media Matters.  Those are just the ones off the top of my head, I can cite links for any/all of those if you'd like.  Again, those are all media sites that are blatantly posting Pro-Hillary, anti-Donald Trump headlines on a daily basis.  Pro-Trump sites you ask?  Not nearly as many: Breitbart, Info Wars (conspiracy theory site), NY Post (mostly),
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       , and that's about it.

       Compared to Hillary, yes he is.  Follow the money.  Hillary has spent actual money and favors to influence the media, where Donald Trump has paid for a series of TV ads, but otherwise his ability to get his ugly face on the front of every mainstream media program has been through baiting them with controversial topics and waiting on them to bite the line.  Trump played them like a chess board, without paying them a dime.

       Think about it. Election fraud against Bernie. Blatantly pandering Hillary. The FBI shoving the email scandal under the table. The obvious Clinton Foundation collusion and fraud. Donald fucking Trump, who is a Clinton family friend, who called Slick Willy the night before he announced, is running for president. Fox News donating to Hillary's campaign.

       It's nothing but a pony show. They are going to do what they are going to do. This whole year long fucking campaign has done nothing but turn people into a bunch of tribalistic fucks when they aren't actually deciding anything. It's been decided. She has been ordained. It happened when she stepped down as SoS. They just needed to find a "palpable" way to feed it to us.

       I agree... his choice of VP sucks and he's made other decisions like you mention that indicate he has every intention of playing the political game. I think most are supporting Trump out of willful opposition to Clinton and mainstream politics. I'm tempted to do the same thing myself, because I'm so angry towards the status quo. I want to believe Americans still have the power to shape society in ways not dictated to us by the MSM. I only like Trump because of his ability to bring Clinton down, but that's very different from liking Trump himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I look at what Trump actually stands for, the policies he wants to enact... I can't buy into his platform. Donald Trump isn't anything special, he's just the "Not Hillary" candidate. I have to catch myself when I start to think I'll vote for him because invariably, it's out of a desire to give a big "F you" to Clinton.

       Vote Jill Stein. Contribute to the third party cause. The more impact the better. Third parties are essential for progress, even if they are unelected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stein is radically progressive compared to what we face with the Clinton/Trump play. Most of her policies are sound and beneficial to society. She's not anti-vax either, but wants research into them and strict guidelines if necessary. There is NO reason not to vote for her if you care for fighting for a truly progressive society and not the farcical neolib/neocon drama the country is currently infested with. We can only root them out with a progressive vote, the bigger the numbers, the bigger the progressive movement becomes, and the more it concerns the actors and their directors at the top and in the dark. That is essential to the gutting and reshaping of society we are in dire need of today. For the sake of ourselves, flora, fauna and our environment.

       But Ron Paul was an actual threat to their system, and he had decades of political experience. NO ONE could've seen Trump's rise in the horizon. If he isn't controlled then that certainly could explain why he was allowed to garner so much attention, he was seen as a non issue... Just a thought, while I'm over here playing devil's advocate...

       You're missing one key point.  Ron Paul spoke with reason and evidence.  Almost everything that man spoke was true.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT -- and this is a big but -- he DID NOT SUCCEED IN PERSUADING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INTO BELIEVING HIS IDEAS.  Note that I'm using the word 'persuade'.  You can have all of the facts on your side, but that's not persuasion.  Persuasion is more akin to hypnotizing, where what Ron Paul was doing is more akin to reading out of an encyclopedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a persuader.  He used Jedi mind tricks to convince the American people of what he wanted to do and what he hated about the current government and the mainstream media.  He used EMOTION, not logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This worked.  That's because most people in the world are not rational like you and me.  They're not free thinkers and they don't visit free-thinking places like this.  They require a different approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been documented extensively:
       <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/139541975641/the-trump-master-persuader-index-and-reading-list">

      </p>
      <p>
       Ron Paul used a different approach.  I 100% believe that if Ron Paul would have used Donald Trumps tactics (specifically outlined in the link above), he would have won in a LANDSLIDE, and we'd be living in another reality than the one we live in now.

       This is very true. I must admit that when I said that "Trump is either a puppet or the luckiest man in the world." I did him a bit of a disservice. If he is genuine, then it wasn't just luck that got him where he is. Like you said, it was his ability to rile people up based on their emotional disposition. There's an old saying "I'm mad as hell, and you should be, too!" That is very much what he tapped into among other things during this race, and I have no doubt that if he wins there will be political science courses on him for years to come. Perhaps even if he loses...
      </p>
      <p>
       What he did was miraculous (if genuine) if the tables had been reversed and Donald Trump was the Sec. Of State saddled by corruption, with Hillary running as the newcomer business woman, she could not have done what Trump managed to pull off. I have high doubts that many people could've pulled off what he did, but I guess I'm just reiterating myself at this point. Like you said, if only Ron Paul could've seen the efficiency of such a strategy, or maybe if he had Trump as his running mate during those runs all those years ago... (Now, THAT would be an unlikely pairing, but a man can dream.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to say this one more time, but man, you're right! You really put this race, and the issues that Ron faced, into perspective!

       Ron Paul was an intellectual badass, and he did everything within his power to change the world.  I'll never say anything bad about this guy, he helped wake me up and I'm eternally grateful for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is coming to the stage with a different skillset.  Love him or hate him, he's able to say seemingly random and controversial things, which have the effect of manipulating the media into changing the center of the universe to him.  He's not that smart a guy when it comes to policy, I don't like a lot of his issues (torture, patriot act renewal, etc).  But he's good at persuading, he hates the media, and he's a bit of a conspiracy theorist.  Also he's not Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has nowhere near the firepower that Ron Paul had when it comes to policy and strategy that would lead our country in the right direction.  But here we are, we've got 2 (some would say 4 or maybe 5) choices for President of the United States of America.  Gary Johnson is a sellout non-libertarian who's stupid to boot.  Jill Stein (who I voted for BTW in 2012 as a protest vote) doesn't seem up to the job IMO.  Evan McMuffin ("who?" everyone collectively asks...) isn't even on the ballot in most states.  Hillary is possibly the second-most evil person on the planet, being backed monetarily by
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros">
        the most evil person on the planet
       </a>
       .  Then there's Trump.  I think people hate him because they don't like his hair, his orange skin, the mean things he says .. but policy wise, he's 100% right on the important things that our country faces at this exact moment in time.  The fact that he's in a full-out war with the establishment media is icing on the cake.  The few people in this thread saying that he's actually on the side of the media are either (A) shills, or (B) idiots that have no critical thinking ability.

       Why didn't you reply to what I said about Ron Paul? He's my candidate of choice, so I'm quote familiar with his history of receiving bad press... Or no press at all in a lot of cases. They started out by ridiculing him first, which didn't work; that was when they switched to the silent treatment. Which was sadly effective.

       Ron Paul wins the moral high ground.  Donald Trump won on the amount of publicity he got by cleverly baiting the media in to putting his ugly mug on the TV in front of millions, for $0.00.  He's now living in everyone's head, rent-free, love him or hate him.

       Thumbs up for missing Ron Paul.  My god, that make woke me up.  I thought he was batshit crazy when I first heard his opinions.  I talked to a libertarian guy at work over the months leading up to the 2008 elections, and he slowly convinced me that all of my previous ideologies were not consistent, and after that, and lots of research and soul-searching, I became a libertarian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ron Paul might have never became president, but he did have a lot of great impact in the world.

       Again, I don't buy this.  Trump literally wrote the book on 'baiting' the media with controversial sound bytes and then destroying them with their biased response at a later date.  He's in the media because he's playing them like a fiddle.  I can send hundreds upon hundreds of pages of links to back this up.  All of that cost him $0.00, to live in their heads, rent-free.

       Oh, and the Ron Paul thing.  Ron Paul was part of the process of waking me up.  He woke up millions and millions of people, he was the pioneer (him and maybe Ross Perot before that, MAYBE Nader but meh).  Now, 8 (12?) years later, here I am, back armed with all  of the research that he taught me, and I've got an axe to grind against the establishment.  Ron Paul started the process.  Realize that waking up is gradual.  There's not going to be one super hero that saves us all.  That's not how life works.

       Don't you think he would have to support some people that he didn't like in order to get to the presidency? I mean I can't say what's in his head, but say he was against Israel's colonization of the West Bank, you think he would have a chance of winning by advertising that? Part of winning an election is selling yourself to as many people as possible, not just "woke" people like you or I.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Ron Paul, it was easier to write him off because he didn't have the positive image and star power that Trump did going in. Trump was getting support from the get go and they needed to squash him with force. The media's incredible attempt to ruin his reputation along with Trump being the ONLY candidate to ever call another corrupt shows me he's not the typical candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I challenge you to find one instance of the DNC or RNC calling the other corrupt. Bigoted, ignorant, stupid, emotional, yes, but never corrupt even when it's clear as day. All because both corrupt parties need people to believe that they are hones. Trump has is the only one to ever rip at that notion. And he's done it openly. Only one to say that Washington is run by special interests.

       It's not just Trump. Bernie as well. He had a solid, well supported run and it's very obvious that the DNC didn't like it and fucked him in favor of Clinton. And this is only getting clearer by the day.

       Trump was messing them up.
He called the mainstream media out, Bernie didn't, and they were far more biased Bernie vs Hillary than Trump vs all Republicans.

       I've been following Trump and Trump supporters for a while now. Trump is not the perfect candidate, but he just might be the one we need right now to break the system. He gets so much hate from the mainstream media - which is why I started getting interested in him; the lies they tell about him on CNN are just crazy. It just takes a little research to see that the mainstream is almost 100% against him (Stefan Molyneaux has a series of videos that cover the lies the media tells about him). The media can't ignore him because he is too big already, so their favorite trick is to paint him as a racist (like they did with Ron Paul), but they try everything they can to make him look bad. Meanwhile, they do everything they can to run cover for Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump supporters are starting to see how bad the mainstream media is. It is also starting to become apparent that the country is in a bad way - despite what the media tells us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a genuine person on some levels; he is not the monster that he is painted as. He might be a great president or an awful one, but he is the only person I can think of who can beat the system at its own game. Despite his wealth and fame, he is an outsider. The establishment doesn't play games like this with the presidential races - this one is out of their control, which is why it is so entertaining.

       , turn on the news -- your choice as to which one -- and count the number of times you see those techniques pop up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stefan on the other hand, he's not in that business, I've yet to find someone that's more based in truth, logic, reason, and evidence as that guy.  And he's become more popular in recent years than I could ever imagine.

       Holy fuck, seriously?  SERIOUSLY?  You're calling the one guy who's not afraid to piss 100% of people off about SOMETHING a shill.  To put another way, there's not one single group of people that you could ever say that he represents.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can literally link you videos to where he pisses off and says negative things about the following groups:

        women

       Not it's not, it's a pretty shit source.  Some random guy on Youtube said it so you're believing it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think your confirmation bias is showing, my friend.  As to whether or not that's because your linked video was blatantly anti-Zionist or not, I won't speculate.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record I think Zionism is racist as shit, but the audacity of these fuckheads cherry-picking shit to suit their own anti-semitic views just further illustrates my point that they're spreading propaganda, not truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually sit down and listen to Stefan.  Pull up the 'list of propaganda techniques' on Wikipedia.  Try to count how many times he actually uses propaganda techniques.  Just try.  Then do the same with your anti-Zionist garbage and see who's the real bigot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've listened to Stefan for over five years, so I can actually argue this all the way home, I know what the fuck I'm talking about.  His main points that he's been trying to make since the beginning are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">
         The non-aggression principle
        </a>
        , or NAP.  That is, DO NOT INITIATE FORCE ON ANYONE.  Defending yourself against initiation of force, however, is 100% fair game.
        <strong>
         Please explain to me how in the fuck you can support Isreal and Zionism and also support the NAP.  I'm waiting.
        </strong>
       </li>
       <li>
        Trying to get people to realize that philosophy &gt; everything.  Understanding philosophy makes you aware of propaganda, of manipulation, it helps you raise your children well, it helps you be a decent human being.  Lack of philosophy is the cause of all of the manmade problems in the world today.
       </li>
       <li>
        Anarcho-capitalism.  He is 100% certain that government always leads to corruption and slavery (both in the physical world and in the mind).  He does not approve of ANY government in the world.
        <strong>
         ZERO.
        </strong>
        If you'd like to know how he imagines the world workin without government, we can talk about that, but it's tangential to your shilling accusations, so we'll get those out of the way first.
       </li>
       <li>
        Understanding how to use logic, reason, and evidence to enhance your critical thinking capacity, to more finely calibrate your bullshit detector.  This is not easy or trivial.
       </li>
       <li>
        Peaceful parenting (i.e. don't hit your child).  If he was a Zionist shill, wouldn't he be reciting shit out of the Torah?
       </li>
       <li>
        Little-'L' libertarianism, in the Ayn Rand objectivism sense.  I've no idea how your "good source" would feel about Ayn Rand, but I don't really give a shit.  I don't care if someone with a good idea is a Jew, African, Muslim, Asian, or a space alien.  Separate the person from the idea.  If you don't do that, you're not doing it right.
       </li>
       <li>
        Calling out pretty much all "groups".  He's said shit about pretty much all of them, because ALL of these groups are using lies and social pressure to manufacture consent in the general public, for their own personal well-being, at the expense of truth and free will.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       tl;dr: The non-aggression principle and libertarian objectivism is INCOMPATIBLE with ANY group or cause that your "good source" is accusing Stefan of shilling for.  Unless you've got leaked emails and documents proving that he's getting paid, then back off and listen a bit more before you go start accusing people of shit like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you still feel really strongly that he's a shill,
       <a href="https://freedomainradio.com/callinshow/">
        call into his show, say that you disagree with him, he will put you to the FRONT OF THE LINE (he's normally booked months in advance), to go on the air and tell him how he's wrong
       </a>
       .  Go ahead.  What do you have to lose?  You can cite your "good source", there's no way that he'll be able to shoot that down!

       Hey, first cool off a bit, I understand it can get heated when someone is criticized. Secondly, I will admit, I'm wrong in several aspects since I have not watch all his videos, nor will I admit I know everything that you mentioned in your post. So thanks for explaining to me, I understand much better.

       I don't know much about the "lies" he's talking about. But winners write history and will always make themselves look good. Out of principle, if I see something being pushed and used as justification as much as the Holocaust is I would doubt that all the facts are being stated. It is far from being the worst genocide of the past century and is being lobbied to be taught in more and more schools, I just had an ex-Auschwitz prisoner end her speech by saying she sees the hate the guards had for her in people that don't support Israel and with a petition to make public schools devote even more time to teaching the Holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I wouldn't deny that it happened but based on it's political utility that many have taken advantage of  I wouldn't be surprised if stuff like the degree to their claims were stretched. It just seemed ridiculous to me to end your speech like that, as if someone could not be against anti-Semitism while being against the settling of the West Bank.

       It can be tough with these things because the holocaust is such a big lie and a lot of the little basic stuff don't always feel very convincing at first. Claims like there were no gas chambers and no mass graves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more convincing when you start to learn about how they lie about this stuff. I'm not the biggest expert so like I said before you should do the research on your own and see what you think. There's a lot to dive into.

       People are afraid. They hear me questioning the holocaust and they imagine some weird neo nazi skin head that they've seen in their Hollywood movies made by Jews. I actually look a lot more like the guy that uploaded this movie. I bet most people on r/conspiracy have enjoyed his content from time to time.

       I agree. This is how it normally is. But this time, they got someone who isn't quite a member of their club--maybe he should be, but for whatever reason, he never quite made the cut.

       CNN convinced people they were bullshit. People were slowly waking up and the strategies were getting very bizzare of late. Its just the first time that other proffessionals within the industry are pissed off about the lack of actual news. This is the first time two states have issued emergency status and there was barely any coverage. Its things like this that are completely independant of his sphere of influence. He didnt bring to light their bullshit. He happened to be there when it was brought to light. This wasnt a power move by a candidate by any means..

       I kinda disagree that the media this year was the only year they spewed bs during a presidential campaign. It happens every year, but Trump is the only one to really ever call bullshit I think is his point. I will say it was by far the worst this year and CNN has literally became laughable.

       Anecdotal evidence is worthless here.  There are large pockets of stupidity throughout this country, and yes, they watch the mainstream media.  They're not rational thinkers, they're not free thinkers, and they're certainly not spending their free hours doing their own research and posting here.  Just because you've never met these people (which completely depends on where you live and what the demographic is), doesn't mean that they don't exist.  Look at opinion polls.  Look at mainstream media ratings.

       It was going that way already, people not trusting the MSM. What Trump did was tap into that for support. That's why he is known as a classic demagogue. There's nothing spectacular about this and it's no reason to trust him. The powers that be are more than willing to expose themselves just to create continued confusion. Trump is your Emmanuel Goldstein.

       Great suggestion - I fully agree with the OP. However know that vote suppression runs rampant in this sub and moderators are likely finding it very difficult to keep control. Post any story that is unrelated to Clinton or Trump, and you'll notice the number of votes it receives is about 1/10th.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you submit a "fringe" topic, for example Illuminati, Council on Foreign Relations, or the Bilderberg Group, you'd be lucky for it to stay on the first page of this sub for more than an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll point out here though that what seems like a fringe topic for this sub is the DEFINITION OF conspiracy topics, yet redditors in this sub have been conditioned to just keep interacting with the highly controlled political threads here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is doing this? Likely political shills being paid by PR firms. How are they doing this? On one powerful PC, one user can run several virtual machines, and in each of those, they log in via VPN accounts and then into unique Reddit accounts. VPN allows for IP masking and no therefore location is proxied to any other country in the world. (Edit to add) Reddit will not give your vote the same weight if it's multiple user accounts from the same IP address range, so to control votes, all you need a different user accounts that appear in different locations. (I do not do this btw. I just know the technicals behind it. Also, taken a step further, those same accounts could argue with one another, but it's ONE person controlling the narrative by literally repressing comments that are "alternative", for example maybe a comment favoring Bernie Sanders is getting traction so the political shill wants to slide that down the page.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Whistleblowers are welcome to chime in by the way to back me up, but it's blatantly obvious this is happening when you frequent this sub for more than a couple of weeks. I warn you as well, it's likely only a matter of time until those proxy accounts get accepted as moderators, and comments like mine here ban me, but that's for another thread.

       I'm gonna weigh in here for a second as someone who uses both VPN's and virtual machines all the time; you're talking theory vs practice. Yes technically one person could do all of that but large scale shilliing/vote manipulation is run by teams and teams of people who have a bunch of paid shills that do this kind of thing in a simpler way via VPN.
      </p>
      <p>
       The VM's are not only overcomplicated the setup a bit but if you wanted the same result (multiple IP's via one desktop) there are other ways to do it with significantly less resource drain and significantly faster switching over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to add slightly to your theory, there are several programs that can automatically simulate physical key-pressing so you could mass produce accounts almost instantly and again, hide it via VPN. Furthermore as with the Saudi cables wikileaks detailing, media control is even easier via the "contain+neutralize" method, where let's say news you don't like isn't directly suppressed but you simply simulate more attention to less important/meaningless posts which is sort of a longer version of what you guys are saying. If that's the case however it would make sense to decentralize the conspiracy subreddits, split them up into a web focusing on an assortment of topics, making it far more difficult for shilling to take place and making shills extremely obvious.

       CTR are so obvious on Reddit, they must have incredible funding, whereas the Trump pushers are genuine posters who are against the establishment.

       It wouldn't surprise me on the default subs, and I guess it wouldn't surprise me here either, but the manipulation on this sub strikes me as coming from from votebots and users more than from mods. Mods aren't deleting the fringe posts; the political ones are just flooding the front page, pushing the fringe out.

       It's actually way easier than running virtual machines. You can use Python PRAW to interact with the reddit API and upvote specific posts and proxy each different python process through a different proxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick would be to get a few accounts set up that look good (or just buy some accounts, pretty cheap) and then write up a script to use each of their credentials and invoke the script with something like proxychains. Then you have them watch some task queue or something and pick up the comment IDs they need to upvote, or just watch for new comments by a specific user (your user) and do
       <code>
        time.sleep(random.randint(30, 720))
       </code>
       then upvote after some random period of time, each through their own proxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, not very hard at all and the more accounts you bought the more power you have. You don't need a fast computer, you don't need to run VMs, you just need accounts and some proxies.

If you're sincerely after the truth, what our reality truly is, then you quickly find out that information is so highly controlled and compartmentalized to the point where you need to learn by listening to stories, read blog posts by whistleblowers, who might not have documents or video as proof, but their own good word analysis and reputation.

       Not even Lenin or Marx would argue that. Capitalism is a necessary and superior step forward in history compared with what came before. Doesn't mean it's the end of history and it shouldn't be criticized. The country was also built on extreme violence, does that mean I can't have a problem with it in other contexts?

       What is today known as the "Council on Foreign Relations" started as a policy study group called "The Inquiry," by President Woodrow Wilson. Though Wilson was (on the surface) the man who invited various "captains of finance" and political insiders to act as his advisory board, Wilson was little more than a Rockefeller puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quote about Wilson's run for the Presidency: "Wilson's main financial support came from a group of directors of the House of Rockefeller's National City Bank including: Cleveland H. Dodge, J. Ogden Armour, James Stillman, and William Rockefeller. Otto Kahn, and Jacob Schiff of the House of Kuhn-Loeb &amp; Co. provided additional financial support."
      </p>
      <p>
       Wilson's "handler" was a Rockefeller insider named Edward House.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was House who actually founded, first, "The Inquiry," and then its offshoot "The Council on Foreign Relations". House was the puppet-master behind a string of US Presidents, and it was actually House who came up with the idea of the "fireside chats" that FDR came to popularize.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Wikipedia page says, "In the late 1930s, the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation began contributing large amounts of money to the Council." The article adds: "CFR publishes the bi-monthly journal Foreign Affairs, and runs the David Rockefeller Studies Program, which influences foreign policy by making recommendations to the presidential administration and diplomatic community, testifying before Congress, interacting with the media, and publishing on foreign policy issues."

       This is very much of what happens and it's been getting progressively worse and worse as the world's conspiracies are bleeding further and further into the mainstream. It more than just PR firms though, the intelligence war is being fought everywhere, by major powers of influence....

       In the 90s it was very easy to have small BBS groups, IRC chats, &amp; boards dedicated to conspiracies without being overrun, but as the agenda has moved forward, today it wouldn't surprise me if the majority of people posting are either doing so with an agenda to suppress information, or unwittingly becoming a tool of the agenda (useful idiot).

       Message control and suppressing the truth is so bad, that anything goes. Whatever you can imagine, including mind control techniques, has been happening for decades. Even those who are strong willed can be overcome.

       In a sense, everything they do works because you can't talk about the really deep down &amp; dark stuff without it being totally ignored or attacked. People don't want that 'crazy' association. However, there's too many people retiring, too many people used to instant communication, that they cannot hold down a number of the really revolutionary secrets. A Copernican revolution is coming, next 1-5 years. Possibly the end of this year if it progresses as it has been.

       Although that sounds good, I fear Copernicus' revelations come nowhere near the realizations of a full disclosure. There will be a massive amount of pain and benefits for each of the some 7 billion on our planet. I really don't think there's a comparison for what's about to be revealed within our biblical cycle.

       Just want to address your ideas from a competing perspective. Like a lot of people, I started frequenting this sub recently because it's a rare and honest source of political information, if not a little biased. I don't believe everything I see here (like the Hillary greenscreen rally,) but I value this sub's perspective and I want to consider as many facts as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not an active voter, but I would much rather read about politics than the Illuminati, aliens, etc. I believe in all that stuff, but i am not that concerned about it because it is generally not falsifiable and it is of little consequence to my daily life. If you follow the money, politics is the most "hard evidence" topic there is as far as dead to rights collusion impacting millions, and that's the definition of a conspiracy

       You are watching the American equivalent of Putin's wife being set up to "run against" Putin's billionaire friend and campaign donor who has been cast as "her opposition", it's such an obvious charade that it's hard to believe there's still anyone who can't see it for what it is ....especially since they do this every election cycle.... presenting false
       <em>
        caricatures
       </em>
       of political "opposition" and "extremes" like Obama/Romney, Trump/Clinton, Bush/Gore (who were frat brothers and fellow bonesman who happened to be set up to "run against" each other) to disguise the actual political realities facing society.

       I'm just trying to understand your reasoning. Your original comment was basically telling readers how to counter "the system" in a way that you believe is effective. I'm trying to figure out your logic as to why this is effective over other methods. I just want clarification which you aren't giving, for whatever reason.

       What? You're getting defensive and we haven't even had any intellectual discussion. I'm completely uninformed on the subject but if you're not confident enough to even help me understand your logic then I don't know why you'd assert your opinion in the first place.

       He's pretty well established within the present system and I imagine he intends to stay that way.

       A Trump vote is a Trump vote, and it's significant systemic cooperation because you're choosing one of the two "valid" options presented to you.

       So do you suggest that we just stop posting about Hillary's corruption?? Does that count as Hillary vs Trump propaganda??
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of what you answer with, Hillary simply cannot be allowed to take the presidency; surely you agree, no? Whether Trump is bought out or not, which he very well may be, Hillary cannot be allowed to win. Sure, you can say "But, Will, vote for Johnson." Which is seemingly the go to in this sub, but he stinks of bullshit as well. The guy wants to legalize weed, but keep privatized prison around, the same private prisons that have profited off of the illegality of marijuana this entire time. Sure, we can vote for Stein, but if everyone in this sub was allowed to vote for Stein twice; she still wouldn't beat Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll say this again, Hillary can't be allowed to win. The only option is to have millions of people protesting in the street, but I don't see any mods posting about organizing such a rally. I'm honestly a little concerned to see a mod making a post like this at all. I'm certain that you're making this post with the best intentions, but if you don't want to see a legacy of Clinton's in the White House; then you'll have to vote for Trump.

       I can't stand either of them, but Hillary's rampancy must be stopped, she's been at this shit for the better part of 20 years now, with many people losing lives as a direct result of her decisions and recklessness. I'm certain that loss of life will be increased ten fold if we allow her power to increase ten fold due to becoming president.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've said this before, but Trump is either a puppet or the luckiest man in the US. No one could've made the come up that he did with the ridicule he received around the WORLD as he first announced his run for presidency. Hillary is also a puppet, but a puppet who will drop executive orders to clear her sordid past and drop plenty of pardons for any of her crony friends implicated. If Trump gets elected, he will not pardon Hillary. She'll have to escape prosecution in some other corrupt fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I also particularly enjoyed how you called anyone who says anything along the lines of "vote for Trump" regardless of reasoning or content, "Shills." Declaring with one fell blanket statement that they are useful idiots, with a statement about Shillary supporters tacked on at the end. A regular user would have the post removed, but you're a mod and used quotation marks, so your post stays. Quite an interesting dichotomy if you ask me...

       I'm afraid I have to agree.  While Trump may or may not know the real ins and outs of politics, he is nowhere near as bad as Hillary is in regards to her sordid past.  I would say "alleged" sordid past, but let's not fool ourselves.  She is guilty of many, MANY criminal transgressions, including extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering, murder...the list goes on and on.  The Clinton Foundation is their free ticket to have access to as many funds as they could possibly ever need and also use it as a means to make promises to the special interest groups who wish to buy in their policies and practices.  She has no transparency and is the
       <em>
        worst
       </em>
       possible person we could place into the White House yet over FORTY PERCENT of this country is so blind or straight up ignorant of her crimes that they'd just assume vote for her for the dumbest of reasons like "first woman president" or "she can fix things" and then the most ridiculous reason of all "She's not Trump".  Anyone who votes for Hillary will be sending this country deeper and deeper into the clutches of special interest groups, banking regimes, one percenters and those who want to control the masses.  They do NOT want a free America, they want a slave race and we're close enough to that now as it is but she will only make it worse.  At least with Trump we'll be able to see if he really can do what he says whereas with Hillary, her past clearly dictating what it will be like with her as President, it'll only get worse and truly give us another TWO terms of Obama...or much, much worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other candidates...all they do is steal votes from the main two.  You will never see an Independent, Green, Socialist, or any of the other non-Democrat or non-Republican party candidates win the Presidency.  The system is set up the way it is because it works for those who would control the masses and will never change unless we can come together as a people and put someone in charge who has the potential to go against the powers in place but even then they will be risking their lives because money talks and bullshit walks.  It's been that way for years and isn't stopping any time soon.

       He wasn't meant to be the Republican candidate, that's for sure. But what makes you think that he's "anti-establishment", or at least that the establishment won't be able to handle him?

       But the party he runs for is establishment.  I actually like Trump.  I watched/listened to  Imus for many years, and Trump was always a regular and great guest.  Now, I'm not saying that he will bend over if elected, but if he's gonna have to battle impossible odds with a juggernaut.  He's got  fierce opposition from both sides of the political court.  I can't help to wonder how any person would fare in such a hell pit.

       The establishment members of the party he runs for aren't happy at all, the Bushes say are now voting for Hillary.  Trump is not meant to be there, he's no puppet, he's there out of duty to fix the mess of the last 30 years.

       I seriously don't get this whole "submissive" notion that is tossed around this subreddit on occasion. There's a HUGE boundary within the word. We don't want fuckin anarchy, it won't work. We submit/yield to others when they speak and they, in turn, submit to us when we speak, what's the problem with that? I swear, some members of this sub are control freaks.

       I wouldn't say they are raised from birth to submit. Submission in response to fear is instinct (fight, flight, surrender) but governments take advantage of that on a large scale. I guess you mean to say governments normalize this submission?

       That's the problem with third party canidates, people don't believe they have a chance so they don't vote for them. Do you see how that is the problem?

       Third party can't even debate on the national debates. The system is rigged against them. Until then you are left with the guy with enough money or following to infiltrate his way into one of their parties.

       Yeah, it's certainly getting less subtle today, yet I think historically, Americans were less aware of propaganda because it didn't come directly from their government.

       I agree, it is a shame that political stories are foisted onto this sub. I confess i am an offender there. The direct cause is CtR though. If Reddit admin were better that would not happen. R/politics should be a "Switzerland" to allow both sides to argue back and forth. But that has been thoroughly suppressed by CtR.

       I apologize and look forward to a return to standard fun r/conspiracy once this terrible election cycle had wound down.

       Both Trump and Clinton are the antagonistic and mendacious heads of the same neoliberal dragon, whose single heart beats to the rhythm of plutocracy itself. A vote for one is a vote for the other, or rather for the same predatory and rapacious heart that keeps both (and a thousand other) heads alive and growling.

       Ok I dont get how this is helpful at all tbh. The definition of a conspiracy is something done in secret. My entire family and I have known since the inception of the trump campaign that he was friends with Bill Clinton for a while. He openly mentions his daughter being friends with Chelsea Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone at any time can say "Oh neither of these choices matter it's all the same" and perhaps it is the same. BUT the fact of the matter is we have a fuckton of a lot of uncovered conspiracies on Clinton and Obama, and as Assange says "We don't have anything on trump that is worse than what he says on a daily basis". So why the fuck is Anti-trump content verified conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say he's a dick or obnoxious, but everybody with a brain and ears knows that. Similarly, everyone with any amount of media awareness knows that he was friends with the Clintons. Anyone who's been to his rallies knows that his daughter is friends with Chelsea Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone had good dirt on Trump I would be all ears, despite my own political leanings. Don't get me wrong, I'm open to ideas, but the whole point of a conspiracy is actual evidence of plotting, not hard conclusions from very very vague evidence. Like can anyone please give me actual data of a conspiracy on trump? With clinton for comparison, she had a private email server to keep her communications secret and went to lengths to destroy evidence so had something to hide. Trump on the other hand had previous public friendships with the clintons and has openly stated on national TV that he has bribed politicans to get favors and things done before, but that its a broken system, and he wants to try and stop that. Can someone please give me something non-public about trump? And I know that he "raped" a girl (if you believe the anonymous source that came up after countless cases against Bill) or whatever, but that's still the worse I heard

       I mean you are right to a degree but you are also very wrong if you think there aren't strong rivalries and opposing ideologies present across the parties. I'm pretty sure Trump vs Clinton is one of those rivalries and I think they do truly dislike one another. They have good reasons to. My uncle was a congressman for two terms. I bet he fell in line to a certain degree as all the new guys seem to do but I also know he genuinely disliked most republican ideologies and would have fought against them to the best of his ability that's just who he was. Its not one team putting on a show together.

       The establishment members of the party he runs for aren't happy at all, the Bushes say are now voting for Hillary.  Trump is not meant to be there, he's no puppet, he's there out of duty to fix the mess of the last 30 years.

       I'm someone who had previously given up on the two party system and would have told you all not to bother, but this time it's different, yet /conspiracy keeps getting these weird posts telling us not to bother, when the only person that will benefit is Goldman Sachs sponsored Hillary

       CTR are so obvious on Reddit, they must have incredible funding, whereas the Trump pushers are genuine posters who are against the establishment.  Fortunately that shines through, people are realizing that one side is propaganda and the other side is a man who is there out of duty to fix the mess

       Holy fuck, seriously?  SERIOUSLY?  You're calling the one guy who's not afraid to piss 100% of people off about SOMETHING a shill.  To put another way, there's not one single group of people that you could ever say that he represents.
