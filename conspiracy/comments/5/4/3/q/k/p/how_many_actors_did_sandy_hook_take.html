        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I recently found out that Sandy Hook was 100% fake.  I&#39;m not really huge into &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, but I like to keep an open mind, and anyone who&#39;s not clinically blind can see that Sandy Hook was fake.  A quick google search showed me that this forum is already aware of that, but I do have one question about it all, which is - how many actors were used for Sandy Hook?  Obviously these crisis actors have been reused for multiple roles inside the same event (David Wheeler as the FBI sniper and father, several interviewed POIs and the photoshopped kids, etc), but the random, mindless wandering in the aerial footage from the fire station shows at least 40-60 actors.  A bit of searching the internet also proved that there are internet users who say they &quot;know someone&quot; etc who was killed, who worked there, whatever, which means that they spoke to an actor, or they are actors themselves (of course this could all be the same 40 people if it&#39;s really efficiently run, but the idiotic interview behavior makes me believe that they are less than professional)</p>

<p>TL;DR: How many actors were used in the fake Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting?</p>

<p>Also, please share any lesser known facts about this event, my knowledge is only about 3 hours deep on the subject</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP. Get your head out of your asshole.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook was very fucking real. Around the time it happened nutjobs like yourself started harassing the husband of a friend because he looked like someone you wackos thought was at the scene and he happens to be an actor. Turns out he lives thousands of miles away and you&#39;d know that if you people weren&#39;t so stupid.</p>

<p>Want to prove it to yourself? Why don&#39;t you go up to connecticut and meet some of the families. Why don&#39;t you go visit the graves of those children you stupid fuck.</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly annoyed that I even have to say this shit. You people are complete and utter lunatics who shouldn&#39;t be allowed near computers.</p>

Look at the Boston Bombing.  There are photos of victims and hundreds of YouTube videos claiming all the injuries are fake and they think they see blood packs near the bodies.</p>

<p>So with regards to your point that &quot;[boston bombing] happened&quot; here&#39;s proof that people, even when presented with pictures of gore and victims, will still find a way to deny the event. So it&#39;s not at all unreasonable to think the same would happen with sandy hook.</p>

<p>Shit son people are denying there were planes flown into the WTC on 9/11 and that was televised live (2nd plane onwards)</p>
