       I'm not discounting the theory but thinking it's like GMO's. Not good or bad as a rule but simply dangerous in the way it's pushed through regulatory committees and not heavily monitored or adequately researched.

       Start with the CDC's list of vaccine ingredients:

       Decide whether you want those shot into your bloodstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, if you feel like questioning
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       they're being shot into our bloodstreams, there's a whole world of research awaiting you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up vaccines &amp; fertility, population control &amp; Bill Gates, polio vaccine in India, vaccines &amp; autism... That will get you started. Stick to studies done by medical professionals, avoid blogs. Though studies and results are bought for $ these days, so don't believe them all either.

       One of my friends said that his wife, a nurse, was against getting
       <strong>
        multiple vaccines
       </strong>
       at once. I asked the reason for that and he said that in order to get multiple vaccines in one shot, they have to use heavy metals. Cant confirm though, I cant find anything on it.

       Also aluminum isn't considered a heavy metal by all, but is by some. Either way it shouldn't be added to my bloodstream.

       I think I remember that problem was that in order for the vaccines to be injected in a single shoe additional ingredients had to be mixed in which included a metal.

      <p>
       But, if you already have mercury in the vaccine and then add more chemicals to the injection ... that doesn't sound safe.

       Formaldehyde is a preservative. It's small enough to where it won't hurt you. Mercury isn't harmful if it's been incorporated into a stable molecule. The amount of aluminum in vaccines is around the same as in one liter of infant formula.

       Uranium is a very much different chemical than what is included in vaccines. You're pretty much confirming you just think metals sound scary.

       The amounts of formaldehyde in these vaccines vary from 5 µg per dose (Fluarix) to 25 µg per dose (FluLaval)

       For reference, a pear contains about 39 to 60 mg/kg of formaldehyde

       This is a collection of my research which I delved into heavily while pregnant. Very happy with my decision and have the healthiest 2yo ever (NEVER sick, incredibly intelligent)... a lot of it is copypasta from different sources - I hope I've given all credit where credit is due... For what it's worth, prior to pregnancy I was training in the medical field, had excelled writing the mcats and gone to a top school in my country for life sciences specializing in molbio and orgchem... My research has opened me up to the fraudulent medical industry - and I seek to heal not harm, so I will not be returning to that pursuit and intend to take my knowledge elsewhere.... Like you said - in the same way that gmo's haven't had proper scientific scrutiny over a long duration before introduction into the ecosystem (and our physiologies), vaccine (and big pharma in general) science has been muddied by profit-potential and shareholder stakes... When you examine the research, it becomes clear that we have been intentionally manipulated towards particular belief systems which immediately creates distrust... if you can't trust them, why would you let them inject you with a chemical cocktail on the basis that they say it's safe? And that's without getting into some of the more controversial extreme views of intentional malevolence towards populations (like bayer "accidentally" infecting 20K people with HIV...) which don't particularly interest me... The science is polluted with money and that's enough to tell me my highest interest and wellbeing is probably not at heart.... However I think the real danger comes from the combined environmental toxicities disturbing our body's balance (e.g. glyphosate targeted spraying of gmo crops is killing our gut microbiota, creating celiac symptoms in a lot of the western population, but also our ability to properly digest) with the damage done on our early immune systems by overloading them with heavy metals.
      </p>
      <p>
       all you really need to know is:
       <strong>
        THERE HAS NEVER EVER EVER BEEN A CONTROLLED STUDY OF VACCINATED INDIVIDUALS COMPARED TO UNVACCINATED INDIVIDUALS!!
       </strong>
       (refer to Mennonite communities etc for comparative health...SIDS is practically unheard of...)
      </p>
      <p>
       Vax additives:Edited for Clarity--
It is a scientifically established fact in literally hundreds of studies that the preservatives and chemical additives in vaccines damage cells. Neurotoxicity, immune suppression, immune-mediated chronic inflammation and carcinogenic proliferation are just a few of several effects that have been observed on the human body. See a list of chemicals in vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, the drug companies still tell us the damage vaccines have on the human body. People just don’t read them. All you have to do is look at the insert for any vaccine, and it will detail the exact ingredients, alerts and potentially lethal effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any medical professional who believes that it is justified to inject any type of neurotoxin into any person to prevent any disease is completely misguided, misinformed, deluded and ignorant of any logic regarding human health.
      </p>
      <p>
       An Example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Arepanrix H1N1 Vaccine Arepanrix™ H1N1 (AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine) is a two-component vaccine consisting of an H1N1 antigen (as a suspension), and an AS03 adjuvant (as an oil-in-water emulsion).
      </p>
      <p>
       The virus is inactivated followed by formaldehyde treatment and disrupted with sodium deoxycholate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Preservative content: 5µg (micrograms) Thimerosal USP per 0.5mL dose or 2.5 micrograms organic mercury (Hg) per 0.5mL dose
      </p>
      <p>
       Adjuvant: The AS03 adjuvant system is composed of DL-α-tocopherol, squalene and polysorbate 80 in a 3mL vial: DL-α-tocopherol: 11.86 milligrams/0.5mL dose Squalene: 10.69 milligrams/0.5mL dose, Polysorbate 80: 4.86 milligrams/0.5mL dose
      </p>
      <p>
       Analysis of Ingredients Formaldehyde According to the Australian National Research Council, fewer than 20% but perhaps more than 10% of the general population may be susceptible to formaldehyde and may react acutely at any exposure level.
      </p>
      <p>
       More hazardous than most chemicals in 5 out of 12 ranking systems, on at least 8 federal regulatory lists, it is ranked as one of the most hazardous compounds (worst 10%) to ecosystems and human health (Environmental Defense Fund).
      </p>
      <p>
       Formalyn a 37 percent solution of gaseous formaldehyde which includes methano (used in vaccines as a tissue fixative) is considered a hazardous compound, and its vapor is toxic.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the body, formaldehyde can cause proteins to irreversibly bind to DNA. Laboratory animals exposed to doses of inhaled formaldehyde over their lifetimes have developed more cancers of the nose and throat than are usual, as have workers in particle-board sawmills… Formaldehyde is classifed as a probable human carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and as a known human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sodium Deoxycholate
      </p>
      <p>
       Sodium Deoxycholate is a water soluble ionic detergent/bile salt which causes cell death and symptoms such as burning, redness, and swelling. It has been shown to weaken the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and subsequently activate seizures. It has demonstrated synergistic toxicity with antifungal drugs. Detergents and emulsifiers promote tumors and cause cells to leak or explode by weakening their walls, with no mechanism for regulating destructive activity. These chemicals are not completely purified out of the final vaccine product, so they enter the body at the time of injection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Detergents are used extensively in cell research precisely because of their ability to break cells open for further analysis. This catastrophically mimics the membrane attack complex (MAC). Detergents hit cells at random and continue destroying cells regardless of which call off the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sodium Deoxycholate is completely foreign to the relationships that define and make up the delicate balance of the immune system. It systematically disrupts these relationships to negate the optimal function and design of immune responses. Thimerosal Note: 10 Times More Thimerosal in the Canadian Non-Adjuvanted H1N1 Vaccine recommended for Pregnant Women
      </p>
      <p>
       Thimerosal has powerful and damaging effects on cells of the nervous and immune systems in mammals including humans. Its effect may vary depending on the dose, the genetics of the individual, and the timing of exposure. The mercury dose from thimerosal produces acute and often deadly ethylmercury blood levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organic forms of mercury are well-known neurotoxic agents and far more dangerous than inorganic mercury sources. Exposure to organic mercury produces predominantly central nervous system (CNS) effects that are commonly severe and can induce prolonged unconsciousness, coma and death. (See: Acta Chim. Slov. 2004, 51, 361-372)
      </p>
      <p>
       -After only 2 hour exposures, thimerosal at micromolar concentrations causes neuronal membrane damage and alterations leading to cell death in immune T-cells.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Thimerosal alters the functioning of critical neurotransmitters necessary for proper brain functioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Thimerosal causes DNA fragmentation of neuronal cells and disrupts neuronal growth factor signaling at micromolar and even nanomolar concentrations. It also causes DNA methylation and attentional pathways at nanomolar concentrations, leading to alterations in brain function.
      </p>

       Squalene Too dangerous for human use, Squalene is not officially licensed for use in the United States or Canada. Oil adjuvants like squalene have been ordinarily used to inflict diseases in animals – for experimentation and study. According to anthrax vaccine expert Gary Matsumoto and other reliable sources, the US military used an unlicensed, experimental anthrax vaccination laced with squalene, with disastrous consequences, including Gulf War Sydrome.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There are now data in more than two dozen peer-reviewed scientific papers, from ten different laboratories in the US, Europe, Asia and Australia, documenting that squalene-based adjuvants can induce autoimmune diseases in animals, observed in mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits. Sweden's Karolinska Institute has demonstrated that squalene alone can induce the animal version of rheumatoid arthritis. The Polish Academy of Sciences has shown that in animals, squalene alone can produce catastrophic injury to the nervous system and the brain. The University of Florida Medical School has shown that in animals, squalene alone can induce production of antibodies specifically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus" writes Matsumoto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oil-based vaccination adjuvants like squalene have been proved to generate concentrated, unremitting immune responses over long periods of time according to a 2000 article in The American Journal of Pathology. The study demonstrated that a single injection of the adjuvant squalene into rats triggered a chronic, immune-mediated joint-specific inflammation, also known as rheumatoid arthritis. The researchers concluded the study raised questions about the role of adjuvants in chronic inflammatory diseases.

       Polysorbate 80 Polysorbate 80 is similar to Sodium Deoxycholate in its ability to increase cell permeability, damage, and bursting. After injection it can rapidly metabolize into sorbitol and ethylene oxide which is much more toxic than the original chemical. When Polysorbate 80 breaks down there are 20 moles of ethylene oxide for every mole of sorbitol. These polysorbates have been shown to cause dangerous, sometimes fatal effects, when given through a needle. Changes in heart function can occur immediately. The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) can be weakened and penetrated, followed by seizures and even death. Polysorbates demonstrate synergistic toxicity with a wide range of chemicals.

       Polysorbate 80 has been found to negatively affect the immune system and cause severe anaphylactic shock which can kill. According to Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, Volume 95, Number 6, December 2005 , pp. 593-599(7), "it is of current relevance as a 'hidden' inductor of anaphylactoid reactions", and "Polysorbate 80 was identified as the causative agent for the anaphylactoid reaction of nonimmunologic origin in the patient. The study included a pregnant woman who suffered anaphylactic shock after being given a IV drip of multi-vitamins containing polysorbate 80. In addition to this, there have been studies in Food and Chemical Toxicology which showed that Polysorbate 80 causes infertility. Baby female rats were injected with polysorbate 80 at days 4-7 after birth. It accelerated the maturing of the rats and caused changes to the vagina and womb lining, hormonal changes, ovary deformities and degenerative follicles. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, which is part of the United Nations, scientists from the organization are developing vaccines specifically to damage fertility as a method of contraception. A suggested ingredient for the vaccine is Polysorbate 80 (also known as tween 80). As it is a preferred ingredient, scientists are obviously aware of its ability to cause infertility.

       The bottom line is that nobody actually knows what causes Autism yet, and if they did, we'd know they did, know what caused it, and know who's working toward a cure or preventative.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do! There is already a good understanding of what autism is and how to treat it. Autism is heavy metal and chemical poisoning of the brain. I'll let the MIT scientist explain:

       Chelation therapy is an effective treatment/cure of autism and has been reversing the symptoms of autism for thousands of kids all over America. Proof:

       Wonder why we haven't heard much about Chelation out of the mainstream media huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever heard of Dr. Bradstreet? He was all for vaccines until his son got autism from one. Instead of going on TV, he doubled down on his research and came up with an effective Chelation therapy that he had begun giving to hundreds of autistic kids. He reversed many of his sons symptoms and his practice was just beginning to take off in a big way.

       2 weeks ago he was found dead in a river with a gunshot wound to his chest. Of course he committed suicide though right? (right as he had made the biggest breakthrough in his life's work). His family says he would never have committed suicide. Funny how that works isn't it? Cite:

       "the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children."

       A CDC whistleblower recently admitted that he was part of the vaccines/Autism cover-up, they deliberately hid the data showing the dangers.
"My name is William Thompson. I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I have worked since 1998.
I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism."

       Key quotes below:-
Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: "The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”
Dr. Weil, pg. 24: "There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem." .... "the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”
Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: "we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes."
Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: "Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”
Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: "So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information."
Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: "This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... "I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on."
Dr. Weil, pg. 207: "The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.
Dr. Brent, pg. 229 "we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits"
Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: "that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed"
Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: "just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information"

       Quotes from the former head of the UK Department of Health on vaccines/Autism, Dr Peter Fletcher has had access to documents which are not available to the public, he is a distinguished man with over 40 years experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr Peter Fletcher, former UK Chief Scientific Officer at the Department of Health said
      </p>
      <p>
       "it is the steady accumulation of evidence, from a number of respected universities, teaching hospitals and laboratories around the world, that matters here. There's far too much to ignore. Yet government health authorities are, it seems, more than happy to do so."
      </p>
      <p>
       "the refusal by governments to evaluate the risks properly will make this one of the greatest scandals in medical history"
      </p>
      <p>
       "There are very powerful people in positions of great authority in Britain and elsewhere who have staked their reputations and careers on the safety of MMR and they are willing to do almost anything to protect themselves."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Clinical and scientific data is steadily accumulating that the live measles virus in MMR can cause brain, gut and immune system damage in a subset of vulnerable children,"

       These following doctors were not content with half-truths, propaganda, and lies. They did their own research:
Nancy Banks, M.D.
Dr. Banks earned her medical degree at Harvard Medical School. She also earned an MBA in finance from Pace university. She completed her internship and residency at Saint Luke’s Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital and Medical Center. She is a board certified ObGyn.
If you look at the ingredients of vaccines you’ll find that they have mercury, and they have aluminum and the vaccines are polluted with other kinds of viruses and the vaccines are grown, sometimes on human tissue. So these are vaccines that have elements that are neurotoxic and then of course they have other elements that can set up autoimmune reactions. So those are the kinds of things that we’re seeing in the children; we are seeing autoimmune reactions.
Toni Bark, M.D.
Dr. Bark has earned a B.S. in psychology from the University of Illinois, and her M.D. from Rush Medical School. She completed her Pediatric Residency at the University of Illinois. After directing the Pediatric Emergency Room at Michael Reese Hospital, she began her study of homeopathic medicine. She has also earned a masters degree in healthcare emergency management from Boston University. In 2012 she became Vice President of the American Institute of Homeopathy. A highly educated physician, she has done the research.
…The kids that come to me from other practices and are fully vaccinated often are the kids, well they are the kids in my practice with asthma, panic disorders, OCD, PANDAS [pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections], autism, Asperger’s. My kids who never have been vaccinated in my practice, I don’t see those issues. I don’t have one child who was not vaccinated who also has asthma or food allergies or Asperger’s or autism or Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis. 
Meryl Nass, M.D., ABIM
Meryl Nass is no stranger to research. She earned a B.S. in biology from MIT. She worked as a lab technician for two years in the Immunology Department at John Curtin School of Medical Research. She earned her medical degree from the New Jersey Medical School and the University of Mississippi Medical School. She completed her internal medicine residency at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Afterwards, she worked as an emergency room physician for 14 years. She also taught internal medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. She currently works as an internist and hospitalist at Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar Harbor Maine.
Prevnar was licensed with a big clinical trial conducted at Kaiser in Northern California with 38,000 children. Half received the Prevnar 7 vaccine, and half received an experimental vaccine for Neisseria meningitidis type C – type C meningococcal vaccine.Now, that seemed a little odd to me. I mean…the control was another vaccine. That’s a problem. But that’s pretty common, because you don’t really know what the side effect profile is if you compare one vaccine to another, because each causes side effects. You don’t have an inert placebo for comparison.
…Children don’t usually die suddenly when they’re healthy; and you have to find a reason for that. There are certainly lots of teenage girls who have died relatively suddenly after Gardasil or developed severe neurological reactions.
Jack Wolfson, D.O.
Dr. Wolfson earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Illinois. Afterwards he earned D.O. at the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine. He is board certified in cardiology. Before meeting his future wife, Heather, he began to realize that conventional medicine was not preventing disease or curing disease, but merely treating the symptoms. Heather, a chiropractor, brought him into the world of holistic healing. He and Heather are now married with two kids, and neither of them are unvaccinated..
A prestigious journal reported that men who had measles and mumps as children suffered 29% less heart attacks and 17% less strokes! Women with a history of both infections had a 17% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and 21% lower risk of stroke. The journal Atherosclerosis recently published these shocking findings in the June 2015 issue (1).
By my calculations, natural infection with the measles and mumps will prevent millions of heart attacks and strokes. Why is this information not all over the TV and Internet? I will tell you why. Because mainstream media is in bed with Big Pharma who pay their bills. The politicians are slaves to their corporate masters. Our children should be exposed to every virus and bacteria for which a vaccine exists.
Lee Hieb, M.D.
Dr. Hieb received her undergraduate from Grinell College and the University of Iowa. She earned her M.D. from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. She did her orthopedic surgical residency with the U.S. Navy. She is a former president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, and she frequently speaks out against the perils of government-run health care. She ran for Governor in 2014 as a libertarian. Unfortunately, she lost the election.
Since 2005 (and even before that), there have been no deaths in the U.S. from measles, but there have been 86 deaths from MMR vaccine – 68 of them in children under 3 years old. And there were nearly 2,000 disabled, per the aforementioned VAERS data.
In countries which use BCG vaccinations against tuberculosis, the incidence of Type I diabetes in children under 14 is nearly double.
As reported in Lancet in 1995, inflammatory bowel disease (i.e. Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis) is 13 times more prevalent in persons vaccinated for measles.
…In 1982 William Torch, a prolific researcher and publisher on Neurologic topics, presented a paper (later published) at the American Academy of Neurology reviewing SIDS deaths. He reported that in 100 consecutive cases, 70 percent of SIDS deaths occurred within three weeks of pertussis vaccination.

       2 ways Vaccines can cause brain damage: Aluminum Adjuvant Toxicity and
Immune System Activation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Aluminum Adjuvant Toxicity
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Aluminum (Al) adjuvant is a vaccine ingredient used for stimulating the immune system. It is used in many vaccines. Infants in the USA receive dosages of Al adjuvant that cause brain damage in animal experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dosages of Al adjuvant received according to the CDC vaccine schedule are:

      <p>
       In scientific experiments, dosages of
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114826">
        100mcg/kg
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740540">
        300mcg/kg
       </a>
       , and
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23932735">
        550mcg/kg
       </a>
       Al adjuvant cause neuron death, muscle weakness, learning and memory impairment, and pathological behavior changes in animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dosage of 550mcg/kg also caused excessive weight gain (a sign of metabolic disorder). All 3 dosages (100, 300 and 550mcg/kg) also caused numerous signs of nerve damage (observable by microscopy and biochemical changes) and/or abnormal anxious behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these results together are conclusive evidence of brain damage caused by the same dosages (mcg/kg) human infants receive according to the US vaccine schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccine advocates argue that injected Al adjuvant
is safe, based on studies of ingested Al salts. This is unscientific because ingesting Al salts and injecting Al nanoparticles present very different risks.
       <strong>
        Both the route of administration and the chemical forms are different.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557144">
        Recent experiments
       </a>
       prove that Al adjuvant is transported into the brain by white blood cells. This explains why injected Al adjuvant can be more dangerous to the brain than ingested Al salts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccine advocates like Paul Offit make false statements about Al toxicity studies. The studies show that ingested Al is harmful at dosages less than half of what advocates claim to be safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Immune Activation
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A developing brain can be damaged when the immune system is activated by a vaccine. Immune activation has been researched extensively and is proven to cause autism and other brain damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       In early life, the brain and immune system develop together. Communication chemicals (“cytokines”) used by the immune system also guide brain development. Immune activation causes surges in cytokine production; cytokine surges during brain development cause permanent brain damage and mental illnesses. The brain-damaging effects of immune activation have been studied extensively.
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25311587">
        The science is high quality and there is a lot of it
       </a>
       . It is well-known that vaccines cause immune activation and can cause surges of many different cytokines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Research has identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) as the specific cytokine responsible for autism; IL-6 is stimulated by vaccine adverse reactions (fever, seizures). IL-6 causes all three autism traits (social impairment, speech impairment and compulsive behavior), and damage to specific brain structures (e.g., the cerebellum) known to be damaged in human autism. Both

        postnatal
       </a>
       surges of IL-6 can cause autism.
       <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23907982">
        Immune activation during brain development has also been shown to cause schizophrenia, seizure disorders, and ADHD.

       Precisely. I find it strange that if you propose that gravity isn't real people will chuckle but listen to what you have to say but doubt climate change or vaccines with good evidence backing you up and you are the scum of the earth and the reason the children (Oh think of the children!) will die terrible deaths.
