        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Aside from the supposed vote rigging and poor freedom of the press, I think he is an extremely smart and reasonable man. Every time I hear him talk in press conferences or meetings he just makes sense and I am all ears for what he has to say. I love hearing him talk. For instance, in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD8lIdIMRo">video</a> of him warning the press about major conflict if the US does not stop its aggressive foreign policy he mentions that &quot;major global conflicts have been avoided in the past few decades due to the geostrategic balance of power which used to exist&quot;. If you think about it, he is completely right. When major countries are all similarly powerful there is a sort of stalemate that kind of keeps things at bay. But when one tries to expand and get more power then things become problematic. He also talks about in some other videos how the US accuses Russia of being aggressive yet we&#39;re the ones that have hundreds of military bases all over the world and spend more money on the military than the next 15 countries combined. We also do shit like put &quot;missile defense systems&quot; close to Russia&#39;s border and claim that it&#39;s only for defense yet they can easily be a modified into attack systems that can send missiles all they way into Moscow.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying he is perfect, just like the US is not perfect, but honestly we are no better than they are if you take a look at what has happened this election cycle. Hundreds of thousands of people have their party preference changed without notice just days before their election, polling stations dramatically reduced and filled with Hillary shills who low-key (or blatantly in some cases) electioneer for her, and all of the other things that went down that scream fraud and corruption (DNC leaks, FBI not pinning her, you name it). We have a lying, decrepit, corrupt criminal and a baboon with the vocabulary of a ten year old as our two choices for president. This nation is wearing a thin, frail mask that we like to call democracy and it slowly slips away as the years go by. My biggest fear is that the people with be so sedated and distracted by the time our government finally takes its mask off that they won&#39;t even care anymore.</p>

<p>Putin is a smart man who is more than capable of leading a country and I think he gets too much bad press from the western propaganda machines. I hope I&#39;m not the only one who thinks this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes it&#39;s very difficult for people to step back from their learned nationalistic behavior and take a very hard OBJECTIVE look at their countries role in the geopolitical landscape.</p>

<p>As an unashamed American, I admire Putins  No Nonsense approach to world problems. Seeking out root cause and addressing it in a straight forward manner. Then, he informs the world on what is actually going on...I say this in reference to the US, Israel and Saudi involvement with ISIS in Syria.</p>

<p>I can also take an honest look at what the US is doing around the world, especially in the Middle East while they hand hold with Israel, and I call BullShit. BullShit on terrorism, BullShit on Bashir al-Assad being a &quot;monster&quot;, BullShit that the US is actually fighting ISIS...as Russia had finally proved to the world. BullShit that Israel needs 38 Billion dollars of hard working Americans dollars. And especially BullFuckingShit on Hillary and her corrupt fraudulent campaign to be the next fake president of the USA! ....and there&#39;s so much more...not saying Putins Russia is perfect either, but unlike the US, they don&#39;t have 800 military bases in other people countries around the world either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  It is not easy to get people to judge America by the same standard they judge Putin and Russia.  If they do, then America and Russia are very similar, but America is much worse in certain areas.  </p>

<p>Like Putin said when asked about Russian aggression, America is the one with the huge military budget and military bases spread around the world.  Not Russia.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a saying which taught me something.</p>

<p>&quot;You can measure the state&#39;s success by the fact that the word &#39;anarchy&#39; frightens people, while the word  &#39;state&#39; doesnt .&quot;</p>

<p>What it taught me or made me realize was, that &#39;they&#39; can easily produce negative feelings for words. By funding educational authorities (schools, teachers, ministries) the growing up kids get conditioned quite easily. </p>

<p>Plus the media outlet. &quot;Nationalist Party.... ramble ramble.... bad.&quot; (Shit&#39;s funny in Germany btw. Generations of Germans are guilt tripped by their schools into being super liberal. Everything else is nazi or antisemitic or hatespeech or whatever. Also frequently portrayed by the media) </p>

<p>What the word nationalism means:</p>

<p>Loyalty. Loyal to one&#39;s country. Cultural basically. </p>

<p>&quot;Also, the belief that a people who share a common language, history, and culture should constitute an independent nation, free of foreign domination.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together. This can be expressed as a belief or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with or becoming attached to one&#39;s nation. Nationalism involves national identity, by contrast with the related concept of patriotism, which involves the social conditioning and personal behaviours that support a state&#39;s decisions and actions&quot;</p>

His answer was direct and on point, and it made a lot of sense.  </p>

<p>We would be lucky to have a President of his caliber.  I was hoping it would be Obama, but he turned out to be another corporate shill.  Trump and Hillary are not even close.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you know Putin very well.  It&#39;s highly probable that Putin ordered the FSB to blow up several apartment buildings with people in them on the outskirts of Moscow to win his first election when nobody knew who Putin even was. He needed the PR and everyone votes for the strong leader in times of terror...he got to send in the troops and flatten Grozny completely.</p>

<p>Or the Putin that is estimated to be worth $40 Billion by the CIA who built a palace that is most likely the most expensive building on Earth currently.</p>

<p>Or the Putin that ordered Polonium be used to kill a defected KGB agent who was shutting down the Russian Mafia in Spain? </p>

<p>Or the Putin that squandered the best period of windfall profits from Oil modernizing his armed forces while the economy sucks and remains backwards?</p>

<p>Or the Putin that bans food imports to punish the West when in fact it hurts his own people more than the West?</p>

<p>Or the Putin that sent a BUK missile system into Eastern Ukraine to shoot down a passenger jet?</p>

<p>Or the Putin that has committed so many atrocities in Chechnya to tame the population?</p>

<p>Or the Putin that stole government money that was intended to buy food when people in the city were starving? <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/brave-unyielding-critic-cited-putin-role-in-massive-fraud-20120412-1wwk1.html">http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/brave-unyielding-critic-cited-putin-role-in-massive-fraud-20120412-1wwk1.html</a></p>

<p>Sure he answers questions directly...because he doesn&#39;t have to worry about bad PR or democratic voting. The State controls all the TV and Radio and pesky elections are so rigged he need not worry. When getting governors of areas elected become a problem he simply stopped them being voted in and started appointing them himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s an effective leader, but he&#39;s also a brutal tyrant.  And that may be more Russia&#39;s fault than his. Still, Russia is a chekist shit hole where torture and murder are necessary to maintain order.  A bunch of drunks who need to be terrorized to be kept in line.  It&#39;s shitty.</p>

<p>That said, the globalists are no better and Russia has every right to resist them.  And in foreign policy Putin has been very professional.</p>

<p>Point is: Russia doesn&#39;t need to be so shitty because of foreign politics, it&#39;s their domestic clown show that make Putin so brutal.  Something they need to pay attention to.</p>

<p>Even if they are justified in foreign policy, their chekism will destroy them.</p>

“You know that I, like millions of Soviet citizens, over 20 million, was a member of the Communist Party of the USSR and not only was I a member of the party but I worked for almost 20 years for an organization called the Committee for State Security,” Putin said, referring to the KGB.</p>

<p>“I was not, as you know, a party member by necessity,” he said. “I liked Communist and socialist ideas very much and I like them still.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin is just a puppet for the NWO. He is just playing his part as &#39;good guy&#39;  right now, in this false east verse west dialectic the globalists have constructed to bring about a &#39;multipolar&#39; world, which is doublespeak for one world govt. Under the U.N. Please do not be deceived. Here is a link to digest, it is rather long but full of good info.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  It is not easy to get people to judge America by the same standard they judge Putin and Russia.  If they do, then America and Russia are very similar, but America is much worse in certain areas.  </p>

<p>Like Putin said when asked about Russian aggression, America is the one with the huge military budget and military bases spread around the world.  Not Russia.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly didn&#39;t read my comment very well.  Go back, read it word for word, and understand what I am saying.  I did not once say I explicitly wanted Putin as an American leader.  Nor did I even hint at it.</p>

<p>Let me make it clearer for you.</p>

<p>The alt.media, Trump supporters and truthers seem to like to make Putin <em>seem</em> like he is a great guy.  But Putin, like any other American official, is <strong>corrupt</strong>.</p>

<p>And never make assumptions about people&#39;s family, that&#39;s just low.</p>

<p>Think before you fucking speak.</p>
