       Aside from the supposed vote rigging and poor freedom of the press, I think he is an extremely smart and reasonable man. Every time I hear him talk in press conferences or meetings he just makes sense and I am all ears for what he has to say. I love hearing him talk. For instance, in a recent
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD8lIdIMRo">
        video
       </a>
       of him warning the press about major conflict if the US does not stop its aggressive foreign policy he mentions that "major global conflicts have been avoided in the past few decades due to the geostrategic balance of power which used to exist". If you think about it, he is completely right. When major countries are all similarly powerful there is a sort of stalemate that kind of keeps things at bay. But when one tries to expand and get more power then things become problematic. He also talks about in some other videos how the US accuses Russia of being aggressive yet we're the ones that have hundreds of military bases all over the world and spend more money on the military than the next 15 countries combined. We also do shit like put "missile defense systems" close to Russia's border and claim that it's only for defense yet they can easily be a modified into attack systems that can send missiles all they way into Moscow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying he is perfect, just like the US is not perfect, but honestly we are no better than they are if you take a look at what has happened this election cycle. Hundreds of thousands of people have their party preference changed without notice just days before their election, polling stations dramatically reduced and filled with Hillary shills who low-key (or blatantly in some cases) electioneer for her, and all of the other things that went down that scream fraud and corruption (DNC leaks, FBI not pinning her, you name it). We have a lying, decrepit, corrupt criminal and a baboon with the vocabulary of a ten year old as our two choices for president. This nation is wearing a thin, frail mask that we like to call democracy and it slowly slips away as the years go by. My biggest fear is that the people with be so sedated and distracted by the time our government finally takes its mask off that they won't even care anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin is a smart man who is more than capable of leading a country and I think he gets too much bad press from the western propaganda machines. I hope I'm not the only one who thinks this.

       Sometimes it's very difficult for people to step back from their learned nationalistic behavior and take a very hard OBJECTIVE look at their countries role in the geopolitical landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an unashamed American, I admire Putins  No Nonsense approach to world problems. Seeking out root cause and addressing it in a straight forward manner. Then, he informs the world on what is actually going on...I say this in reference to the US, Israel and Saudi involvement with ISIS in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can also take an honest look at what the US is doing around the world, especially in the Middle East while they hand hold with Israel, and I call BullShit. BullShit on terrorism, BullShit on Bashir al-Assad being a "monster", BullShit that the US is actually fighting ISIS...as Russia had finally proved to the world. BullShit that Israel needs 38 Billion dollars of hard working Americans dollars. And especially BullFuckingShit on Hillary and her corrupt fraudulent campaign to be the next fake president of the USA! ....and there's so much more...not saying Putins Russia is perfect either, but unlike the US, they don't have 800 military bases in other people countries around the world either.

       I agree.  It is not easy to get people to judge America by the same standard they judge Putin and Russia.  If they do, then America and Russia are very similar, but America is much worse in certain areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Putin said when asked about Russian aggression, America is the one with the huge military budget and military bases spread around the world.  Not Russia.

       I don't disagree with anything you said but what is this "learned nationalistic behavior" you speak of? Nationalism is basically a bad word in America. Globalism is being rabidly promoted instead.

       There is a saying which taught me something.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You can measure the state's success by the fact that the word 'anarchy' frightens people, while the word  'state' doesnt ."
      </p>
      <p>
       What it taught me or made me realize was, that 'they' can easily produce negative feelings for words. By funding educational authorities (schools, teachers, ministries) the growing up kids get conditioned quite easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus the media outlet. "Nationalist Party.... ramble ramble.... bad." (Shit's funny in Germany btw. Generations of Germans are guilt tripped by their schools into being super liberal. Everything else is nazi or antisemitic or hatespeech or whatever. Also frequently portrayed by the media)
      </p>
      <p>
       What the word nationalism means:
      </p>
      <p>
       Loyalty. Loyal to one's country. Cultural basically.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Also, the belief that a people who share a common language, history, and culture should constitute an independent nation, free of foreign domination."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together. This can be expressed as a belief or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with or becoming attached to one's nation. Nationalism involves national identity, by contrast with the related concept of patriotism, which involves the social conditioning and personal behaviours that support a state's decisions and actions"

       I was very surprised when I heard him being interviewed.  It was a female British reporter that was not showing him any deference.  She was asking him some very difficult questions thinking he would not answer.  I was waiting for his non-response, which is what you would expect from an American politician.  His answer was direct and on point, and it made a lot of sense.

       We would be lucky to have a President of his caliber.  I was hoping it would be Obama, but he turned out to be another corporate shill.  Trump and Hillary are not even close.

       I read that Putin banned Soros from Russia, and will not have anything to do with the international bankers.  He can't be all that bad, right?

       His failure to kneel to Soros and conspire with the bankers is exactly why he is being demonized by the corporate owned media and our puppet politicians.

       I agree with you. I know a lot of Russians who respect and admire him. From what I understand, he is very well liked in his country. Our mainstream media goes out of their way to make him look like a bad guy, and tries to convince us Russia is still communist.

       most putin bashing i see is about his election scandals. i personally think he loves his country and his efforts to stay in power are out of distrust for anyone else. for all we know he has intel on running mates and knows they will sell russia out to corporate interest aka american imperialism.

       How else would you protect your country against the SAME SHIT that is currently being pulled in America and across the globe? How many countries do you think have been compromised by elite globalist puppets? Can pretty much guarantee every NATO country and most Southern American countries.

       You're right, the USA has its own propaganda machine which spreads out to Europe as well. They've taken the PR style practices of corporations / Hollywood and converted them into government style spin machines.Putin understands that he needs to do what he can to keep Russia afloat. As a former KGB agent, he knows USA's CIA covert ops take place around the world, so naturally, he uses his own types of tactics as well. Russia first is his motto.

       Well, if there is no Truth, then there's not much to criticize anybody else with.  You might as well as go along with Putin and whatever he says because it's pretty obvious you don't have any ideas of your own.  You think Mcdonalds pays bad here, talk to the russians.

This is a Jupiter class evil corrupt Dictator with the souls of thousands of children to his credit and Murican's are thinking he's fucking Tickle me fucking Elmo.

       Fuck yeah, Dumbass! You were just sleeping through the killing of innocent women and children part right?  Refer to comment above.   Putin is a ruthless fucking Dictator.  But if you don't believe me, I've heard about anal keigals.  Yknow, to get ready for Prez Putin.  There you go, now squeeze...Good job.  Seriously, if you are a russian or russian sympathizer, my apologies.  But if you are an American born citizen, then refer to comments above about getting on your knees and apologizing to the American people each and every day for the rest of your life.  Seriously, WTF is wrong with you?

       Yes.  He might be essentially a dictator and former KGB, but he is a skilled diplomat, (or his scriptwriter is) and he has been unbelievably patient with the American government's constant attempts to provoke him into war.

       Smart yes, reasonable no. He is a powerful dictator trained by the KGB who knows exactly what it takes to gain power and hold onto it. He knows how to manipulate the media and which stories will play well with the audience at home and which ones play well with the international audience.

       but he loves his country and does what is in the best interest for his country. for all we know he has intel on potential candidates and knows they are american puppets so he does everything he can to ensure they dont take his place and sell their country to corporate greed. people need to look at the big picture.

       What would you do if you knew your opponent was an American puppet? I'm not saying its true all im saying is it's a possibility. There is so much more we dont know that you have to consider everything. But I've never heard Putin speak where i dont nod my head the whole time all like "Yup...Yup...He's right....Yup..."

       Sparky, U mean Kraftwerkd.  In your greatest imagination? Do you think the American people want Putin as a leader?  Your Grandparents would be turning in their grave.  Unless of course you are from Russia, then my apologies.  But as an American someone who is saying they'd prefer the Russian leader over one duly elected in a Democratic election should be told each and every day that they are crazy.  Shut the fuck up

       You clearly didn't read my comment very well.  Go back, read it word for word, and understand what I am saying.  I did not once say I explicitly wanted Putin as an American leader.  Nor did I even hint at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me make it clearer for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alt.media, Trump supporters and truthers seem to like to make Putin
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       like he is a great guy.  But Putin, like any other American official, is
       <strong>
        corrupt
       </strong>
       .

       Chechnians are tough,  smart,  and ruthless.  Sometimes you gotta play dirty to win.  Maybe rockets are what it takes to win against the chechnians.    If anything,  that's a feather in Putins cap and a great bullet point on his resume.

       I don't think you know Putin very well.  It's highly probable that Putin ordered the FSB to blow up several apartment buildings with people in them on the outskirts of Moscow to win his first election when nobody knew who Putin even was. He needed the PR and everyone votes for the strong leader in times of terror...he got to send in the troops and flatten Grozny completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the Putin that is estimated to be worth $40 Billion by the CIA who built a palace that is most likely the most expensive building on Earth currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the Putin that ordered Polonium be used to kill a defected KGB agent who was shutting down the Russian Mafia in Spain?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the Putin that squandered the best period of windfall profits from Oil modernizing his armed forces while the economy sucks and remains backwards?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the Putin that bans food imports to punish the West when in fact it hurts his own people more than the West?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the Putin that sent a BUK missile system into Eastern Ukraine to shoot down a passenger jet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the Putin that has committed so many atrocities in Chechnya to tame the population?
      </p>

       Sure he answers questions directly...because he doesn't have to worry about bad PR or democratic voting. The State controls all the TV and Radio and pesky elections are so rigged he need not worry. When getting governors of areas elected become a problem he simply stopped them being voted in and started appointing them himself.

       I don't care about what any of these people say to an audience in front of a podium.  I've been around long enough to know that talk is cheap and people are fucking liars anytime it suits them, and they mostly go unpunished for it so they have no incentive not to lie.  If you look at any politician and judge them based on things they tell you, you are a fool.  Look at someone's actions if you want to know who they really are.

       The proxy war in Ukraine, for starters.  We could also talk about the one in Syria; not to mention the fact that ISIS are nothing more than an American front group, and Putin would know that.

       He's an effective leader, but he's also a brutal tyrant.  And that may be more Russia's fault than his. Still, Russia is a chekist shit hole where torture and murder are necessary to maintain order.  A bunch of drunks who need to be terrorized to be kept in line.  It's shitty.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the globalists are no better and Russia has every right to resist them.  And in foreign policy Putin has been very professional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is: Russia doesn't need to be so shitty because of foreign politics, it's their domestic clown show that make Putin so brutal.  Something they need to pay attention to.

       Even if they are justified in foreign policy, their chekism will destroy them.

       Lol no. He's an authoritarian mobster. Only thing is, he happens to be on the right side of history in 2016. All he has to do is act like a sane person, and everyone loves him simply because he's not the US. Reminds me of how people like Hillary simply because she's not Trump.

       No, it is just Putin came from the old communist era of the USSR, and wants to move Russia back to it. Many Russian are with him on it. The economy of Russia is failing in many areas, and often citizens in these poorer areas would like to return to the state giving everyone a job and a place to live.

       “You know that I, like millions of Soviet citizens, over 20 million, was a member of the Communist Party of the USSR and not only was I a member of the party but I worked for almost 20 years for an organization called the Committee for State Security,” Putin said, referring to the KGB.

       Putin is just a puppet for the NWO. He is just playing his part as 'good guy'  right now, in this false east verse west dialectic the globalists have constructed to bring about a 'multipolar' world, which is doublespeak for one world govt. Under the U.N. Please do not be deceived. Here is a link to digest, it is rather long but full of good info.

       I agree.  It is not easy to get people to judge America by the same standard they judge Putin and Russia.  If they do, then America and Russia are very similar, but America is much worse in certain areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Putin said when asked about Russian aggression, America is the one with the huge military budget and military bases spread around the world.  Not Russia.

       I don't disagree with anything you said but what is this "learned nationalistic behavior" you speak of? Nationalism is basically a bad word in America. Globalism is being rabidly promoted instead.

       You clearly didn't read my comment very well.  Go back, read it word for word, and understand what I am saying.  I did not once say I explicitly wanted Putin as an American leader.  Nor did I even hint at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me make it clearer for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alt.media, Trump supporters and truthers seem to like to make Putin
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       like he is a great guy.  But Putin, like any other American official, is
       <strong>
        corrupt
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And never make assumptions about people's family, that's just low.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think before you fucking speak.
