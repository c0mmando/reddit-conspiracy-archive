       I contacted Francis Richard Conolly through his website EverthingIsARichMansTrick.com -- he finally emailed back to me today and offered to answer 20 Questions from our sub (quote):
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "I suggest the best thing to do with this would be for someone from your team to gather together what seems to be the most popular questions; say 20 of them, and I'll write a piece you can use detailing what I think of contemporary events and the most urgent political issues."
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       He is currently trying to get funding for his a JFK to 9/11 Part II...Unfortunately, he never made a cent from Part One--even though it has over 3 million views on his youtube channel).
      </p>
      <p>
       I will send him the Top 20 Questions in 24 hours--he does sound like a pretty busy man (so it may take him a few days to respond).

       Uh.  That's pretty damn awesome actually.

       Here's a question:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        What exactly do you think we we as citizens should do/can do to reclaim our sovereignty against the malicious overlords that stole this country, civilization, and planet?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        I mean a lot of us here know things are pretty horrible and that, generally speaking, there is a covert power above the law and government responsible for it.  Many of us KNOW this at this point.  What many of us need at this point is a real PLAN of action.  What do you think is a good step in the right direction that we citizens can move toward to help begin bringing this civilization away from the manipulation it has been subject to?

       Thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we all know things are fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And honestly?  I personally feel that we all - at some level or another, some of us deep down inside, some of us pretty directly - know what it is that we have to do to overcome the manipulation we are subject to on this planet:  We have to put aside all the indoctrinated racism we've been brainwashed with from birth - that separates us and keeps us antagonistic toward one another - and we need to come together and unite as the one human species that we indeed are.  We need to do this, and move forward
       <em>
        together
       </em>
       AGAINST these global oppressors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is the answer, in all honesty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to A) know what Mr. Conolly might think about this issue, and B) I'm wondering if perhaps he might have some other more pragmatic, practical suggestions with regard to how exactly we could take these ideas to the next level as a people and community.  He might have some valid ideas in terms of exactly what we can do in the way of coming together and making
       <em>
        actual change
       </em>
       .

       The world isn’t like that though.  We’re not a small bunch of little pods.  We’re a multi
       <em>
        billion
       </em>
       citizen strong population now.  No turning back to any sort of “clique” like tribes.  We have to learn to work together
       <em>
        globally
       </em>
       .  That’s the only way - especially since TPTB have a manipulative foothold on the citizenry that itself is globally strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but the idea of having tiny separate tribes invites a type of xenophobia which is just NOT good at all in any way for the human species as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to keep from being nefariously manipulated and controlled, little tribes aren’t going to do it.  We’re going to all have to come together and unite because TPTB are that strong.  They’re not stronger than
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of us together and united as one, but they are indeed stronger than any one small tribe of us as individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that’s the way they want to keep it - separated - because they can control us a lot easier that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can’t do it if we all come together, however.
      </p>

       Not everyone.  You've got a green "+16" mark by your name when I see you, which means that you're one of the people (few) that I generally agree with often enough.

      <p>
       Because this planet is not
       <em>
        OURS
       </em>
       .  Earth does not belong to humans alone.  We are not the top species on this planet - and even if we were (which we, again, are most definitely not) there are many,
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       others intelligent species on this planet that will not be allowed to be overtly harmed by our moronic ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the
       <em>
        Earth HERSELF
       </em>
       wouldn't appreciate getting overrun by
       <del>
        this disease
       </del>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfGMYdalClU">
        humanity
       </a>
       , and there are various other non-terrestrial species not from this planet that don't disagree with that feeling.  They don't give af about humans themselves, so we can blow ourselves tf up if we so chose, but they don't want to see the
       <em>
        Earth
       </em>
       harmed more than she has to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if we get
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       out of hand, there are powers that will see to it that we are stopped.  Dead.

       I believe it’s a function of the “reddit enhancement suite” or whatever it’s called that I put on a while back.  It puts the number of upvotes or downvotes that you give users next to their names.  There are some morons in this site that I’ve given over 100+
       <em>
        downvotes
       </em>
       , and they’re colored in
       <em>
        deep red
       </em>
       . lol
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sure I’m pretty low down in the ranks for many others as well too.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re in green.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you
       <em>
        don’t
       </em>
       have the reddit enhancement suite, I don’t think you’ll see the upvote/downvote numbers next to the names of the users on here, however.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        who do you think are the top speciies here

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, I happen to think that pretty much
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       species are worthy and are all part of that Great Whole some called “God”, so I don’t tend to focus too much on who or what species is the “best” or “top” species.  Every species has abilities that are at different levels than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some species are stronger, some faster, some have better eyesight, some are smarter in
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       category, some in
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       category.  All kind of depends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, take Chimpanzees, as one example.  Most people like to think that chimps are “stupid” compared to humans or whatever.  Well, how many human beings ever in the history of EEEVVVEER do you think could accomplish a feat of spacial recognition (which takes intelligence, mind you) like
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkNV0rSndJ0">
        this?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean does one even realize what this chimp is
       <em>
        doing?
       </em>
       He’s actually being able to accurately list the range of nine numbers
       <em>
        in order
       </em>
       after seeing all of them simultaneously for only a
       <em>
        fraction
       </em>
       of a fricking second.  How many humans do you know can do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       None?  Yeah.  Me either.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah.  I don’t know who exactly I’d classify as “the smartest” or “best” animal on the planet.  I’ll say that, “traditionally” speaking - i.e. by human standards of what “intelligence” is - it’s a toss up between something like…humans,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea">
        Cetaceans
       </a>
       , and some Reptilian species that various sources have talked about existing on this planet - underground and elsewhere.

       I think we just have to do our best to move

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, there’s evidence that some of the aliens
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the psychos - which is a bit of a problem.
       <a href="http://whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">
        The pdf of this book
       </a>
       talks quite a bit about a lot of evidence that exists indicating that much of our civilization - including a lot of the manipulation and deceit that exists in it - is the result of significant ET intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve also heard other sources mention that this planet is like a type of zoo of sorts where a
       <em>
        LOT
       </em>
       of ET species throughout many millennia have come here and influenced the genetics of the human beings here…so we’re essentially a hodgepodge of a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of different ET influences in our blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is to say that there seem to be a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of ETs and a lot of ET agendas working on planet Earth.  Some of those ET agendas might be/are “good” and beneficial for human improvement and evolution, and some of those agendas might be/are more focused on keeping humans as more of a subservient slave race.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it all kind of depends.

       Yeah.  Thinking deep thoughts about unemployment and poverty.  That kind of thing.  :)  I’m not really greatly interested in writing a thesis or a philosophical treaty or anything.  Philosophy
       <em>
        has

       All the art I do (whether in creative writing, or music, or film making, etc) has a philosophical and spiritual core/foundation to it.  Actually having studied Philosophy has, as you mentioned, helped a bit to…
       <em>

       Correct.  We're not being mean or harsh to one another.  We're just, like you said, seeing things from two different perspectives.  Nothing wrong with that.

       How ever so?  Everyone working together globally is the absolute most efficient manner for the entirety of the planet and the human population on it - as opposed to a bunch of separated little pods each doing things differently and sometimes antagonistically to each other.  From the perspective of the small tribe, things might seem like they're working better, but that's only because the perspective is insular, and being a small tribe, one rarely if ever has the perspective of the bigger picture.  There are many benefits the small, closed off tribe more often than not is kept from having because it's not part of the bigger, more communal picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are definitely a lot people and perspectives to handle, but the more hands you have all working together toward a goal, the better that goal can get accomplished.  Having many people working together as one seems significantly more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this being said, the efficiency of a global vs communal model is actually the least of our worries at this point since PTB manipulation is far, far more pressing and concerning an issue.  It's an issue of deep, global manipulation that, incidentally, a globally connected and united population would be FAR better able to combat and defeat than a population divided into a bunch of little, ineffectual tribes.

       I think we can manage all of our individual experiences globally without having to become any sort of stereotypical "gestapo NWO", however.

       Peace to you too .... actually they are realizing that planting food in once place and flying it around the world does not save ok... food resources have to go back to local and in fact most architecture is moving in this direction well green at least so building will also produce food and such .... some of the walls that grow interesting concepts for farming.... i have a friend who imports and she has to be up at 3 in the morning talking to china india what if someone goes out to lunch then you til 4 waiting for them to come back this is not how our bodies were constructed to deal ... sorry i think the concept of global sexy does not work .... but perhaps you will develop something to alliviate these difficulties just to me seems everything works in one direction for THEM and the rest of us be damned dealing with their impossible structures that really do not function humanly

       Everything you talked about isn’t the only way things
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to work, however.  The way your friend’s doing it does sound like it’s taxing and doesn’t really work super well.  That doesn’t mean that that’s the “only” way things would “have” to work globally for “everyone”.  Of course not.  Assessing how a whole would work based on a singular and specific circumstance that’s not doing too well is not a very balanced way of weighing all the options available.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s nothing wrong, for example, with keeping things local at all - just CONNECTED globally.  Those two ideas are not at all mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all this is simply about what would
       <em>
        work
       </em>
       - not about what sounds “sexy” or not - and, again I say, a globally united community all working on a unified goal of planetary cooperation and sustainability seems far,
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       better and more powerful a way of doing things than a bunch of tiny, broken off, insulated pods that are all doing things “their own way” and separated from the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Way too easy to manipulate and rule over those tiny pods - which is pretty much exactly what is going on right now today.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        to me seems everything works in one direction for THEM
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yeah.  Fuck that manner of doing things.  Agreed.  The way things would get done NOW wouldn’t work, of course.  There is simply too much deceit and lying and disinfo.  If things are
       <em>
        united
       </em>
       , however - REALLY united - then the “1% manipulating the 99%” wouldn’t be the case as is most definitely the case now and today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that the world is currently the way it is - being a very manipulated system where the 1%
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       take advantage of the 99% - then it seems that it would in fact be
       <em>
        worse
       </em>
       to separate people into small tribes because (again) a people separated is a LOOOT easier to control and rule over than a people united.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB know that, and that is the very reason why they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       keep us separated and antagonistic toward one another.  Wanting things to remain separated out into little tribes ensures that those little tribes that are apart from one another remain utterly under the control of an overarching level of global manipulation at the hands of the very NWO that a globally united citizenry could actually successfully fight against.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        and the rest of us be damned dealing with their impossible structures that really do not function humanly
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I feel this is exactly what would happen if we remain in small, closed off pods actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me we are definitely both wanting the same things - i.e. a humanity that is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       manipulated and under the control of a nefarious elite.  I just feel that a united citizenry has much more of an ability to actually fight against that nefarious elite than a tiny tribe ever would be able to, is all.

       So then we need to continue working hard at having an extremely well educated society.  Problem with that, of course, is that TPTB work really hard at making sure and dumbing us all down.  We have to work
       <em>
        individually
       </em>
       to make sure and educate ourselves as much as possible independent of what the institutions try to brainwash into our heads.

      <p>
       There’s definitely confusion everywhere.

      <p>
       Sectarianizing the population into small little tribes, however, is most definitely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the way to improve these problems since these problems in part are a result of a large group (tptb) bullying all the smaller groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       One cannot say “Well, we can’t unite, so let’s just go into little, small groups and tend to ourselves.  That’ll fix everything.”  It won’t.  It’ll actually make things worse because that little group will have no power to improve its own standing if a larger groups tries to take advantage of it.  The only thing it will be able to do is just hope and pray that it’ll be left alone and won’t get fucked with by the big, bad PTB - which is really a ridiculous hope for any one group or tribe to have.  TPTB will come knocking down your door and fuck you up and you won’t be able to do a thing about it if you’re isolated into a little tribe and it’s you against a big army.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’re part of a larger group, however, your chances are simply better.

       Why would you think that “going nuclear” is some sort of foregone conclusion?  Things don’t

       Intelligence, will power, stick-to-it-tiveness, patience, perseverance, and unwillingness to give up can help.

      <p>
       We have all that within us if we so chose to manifest it.

       I just try to be as critical a thinker as possible.  I have a degree in Philosophy, so A) I think deep thoughts like...
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the time, and B) being a Philosophy graduate, I (of course) don't have a job, so I have a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of time on my hands. lol  :) so it gives me all the more time to think a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       .  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent nearly ten years just...reading, and reading, and reading - philosophy books, religion books, "deep thought" books, etc, etc, and it's given me a lot to chew on in terms of how to look at the world around me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an ongoing thing.  We're all a work in progress.  I just keep trying to learn as much as possible as often as possible.

       Yes.  Music does indeed make you feel.  To a great extent, it’s all

       ok no1 is beautiful ...
i have to listen to your others but i dont want to rush thru so more later [lee camp is on in two minutes ] you make beautiful music you should be doing sound tracks for movies you have much talent and feel for it
      </p>
      <p>
       me i love to write midi helps set me free.... i play piano [when i was young everyone put me forward to sing but i smoked wayyyyyy to much so no singer here now ;0]

       anyway i usta work at a recording studio for many years and completed 8 demo songs [7 one is two versions] but then had a baby and now am finally mastering my shit this fall ... so i would send you one song [they only just got converted to mp3 and i am really dense and do not quite even understand all that yet so
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

       Send whatever you can whenever you can.  I’d like to hear it.  :)

       I don’t have a dropbox account, but you can send the mp3 to

        no1113@mail.com

       - Let me know when you send it, as I rarely check that email address.

       Namaste is a salutation from the East which essentially means “The divine in me honors and salutes the divine in you.”

       I’m not familiar with that movie, but this sounds like a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       appropriate analogy.  Yes.  Our bodies are merely vessels - vehicles, as it were.  Our souls inhabit and animate these physical vehicles.  These bodies are like cars that we’re stuck inside and have to permanently drive around in for 70, 80 years…
      </p>
      <p>
       but we are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       these cars.  We are not these bodies.  We drive them and move around in them and use them to get to here or there, but we are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       them.  They’re just what we use to move around in for a spell.

       I can be a bit paradoxical at times…I work in the music, film, and television industry, but haven’t actually owned a television in coming on 20 years. lol, so I don’t really know what’s out too much and don’t follow any shows or anything.  The prisoner show you’re referring to?  That

       i figured you would enjoy the full visual it was a smokin show.... very NWO very british invasion ... the actor patrick whateer...[i m bad with names typing and spelling good luck understanding my jibberish ] he did this other show earlier ok secret agent man so when this came out it was like the second tier like he musta wanted out and m15 whatever was not gonna let him....it was real interesting how they set it up week to week slowly progressing the premise you know .... good stuff not like now except for ORPHAN BLACK that show rocks! .... plus that bubble thing if you tried to escape it would follow you and engulf you thats the part that would show up in my dreams ... just weird what infiltrates ....

       Total surveillance perverts the design of power structures - that is to say, if the NSA has all information on judges/elected officials/everyone, they ultimately have the ability to shape our reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is, what is the movement behind the intelligence agencies that conduct/analyze this information? Is there a group directing this growth of surveillance for a purpose, or did the technology just happen to advance while they were in power at their respective agencies?

       Oh good, I can delete my question, since this one covers it. Although I would take the question one step further to the Roman Catholc Church who works through the Jesuits.

       “What if Adolph Hitler was simply a puppet?” The facts are he was born in Austria. His first career choice was as a talented artist. He practiced his dramatic oratory skill in front of a mirror to perfect his theatrical craft. He was funded into power by Rockefeller/Bush with $36 million. He routinely interfered with his military general’s war plans. There is a possibility Hitler was an opportunist who found the golden road to immense wealth and eternal fame as a marionette, who was then given exodus to South America as the curtain closed on his final scene.

        to me we have to go anti global and go back to smaller connected units maybe along the lines of the scots right where maybe 150 -200 sat in acircle and worked things out any bigger and here we are all the colluding and greed....
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The world isn’t like that though.  We’re not a small bunch of little pods.  We’re a multi
       <em>
        billion
       </em>
       citizen strong population now.  No turning back to any sort of “clique” like tribes.  We have to learn to work together
       <em>
        globally
       </em>
       .  That’s the only way - especially since TPTB have a manipulative foothold on the citizenry that itself is globally strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but the idea of having tiny separate tribes invites a type of xenophobia which is just NOT good at all in any way for the human species as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to keep from being nefariously manipulated and controlled, little tribes aren’t going to do it.  We’re going to all have to come together and unite because TPTB are that strong.  They’re not stronger than
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of us together and united as one, but they are indeed stronger than any one small tribe of us as individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that’s the way they want to keep it - separated - because they can control us a lot easier that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can’t do it if we all come together, however.

       Yeah.  Thinking deep thoughts about unemployment and poverty.  That kind of thing.  :)  I’m not really greatly interested in writing a thesis or a philosophical treaty or anything.  Philosophy
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       helped me to “think better” so to speak, but yeah.  I’m not too interested in actually being a formal teacher of it or anything.

       All the art I do (whether in creative writing, or music, or film making, etc) has a philosophical and spiritual core/foundation to it.  Actually having studied Philosophy has, as you mentioned, helped a bit to…
       <em>
        organize
       </em>
       my thoughts a bit more accurately perhaps.
