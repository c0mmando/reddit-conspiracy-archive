       They are wiping out the bees so as farmers will have to buy genetically modified insects from Monsanto, it's all part of the same plan, breaking free natural stuff so as you have to buy expensive genetially modified alternatives.  You can bet that the genetically modified insects won't breed, so as you have to keep buying them every year.

       Genetically modified insects? Like OH MY GOD, there are millions of bugs! You don't have to manufacture them.. Makes me wonder about those Japanese hornets that can wipe out hundreds of millions of bees with only less than 100 hornets in a couple of hours  ...

Not needed or wanted.

Pretty sure someone should look away further into that?
Any body see any of their shyt oozing around?
Maybe under the filth we are all looking at.
Shrugs....
Someone prolly got careless and greedy,

Maybe a leak here somewhere.

       For that sweet $$$. It's possible though they didn't know the impact the chemical would have on the bees. They replaced arsenic pesticides with nicotine based pesticides. It could be that they thought they were doing a good thing.

       (CTR) Just to correct the record, this is a
       <strong>
        Clinton conspiracy
       </strong>
       not a Bayer conspiracy.  Bayer was involved, along with Baxter, Cutter and a few other pharma companies.  Blood was collected from prisoners in arkansas, shipped to bayer in canada, it was disbursed from there.  A large part ended up in iirc germany, switzerland or austria and the plasma was extracted, and all the plasma was mixed together to standardize it into a hemophiliac product called 'factor 8' (a blood clotting factor).  Mixing them together stupidly also meant that hep C, Hep B and HIV in the blood were 'standardized' as well, thus weaponizing this product to give hemo kids nasty coinfections.  800 died right away, and up to 60,000 (not 20,000) were infected with various coinfections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Clinton was governor at this time.  He knew the guy running the program and he signed off on it, after having learned that the blood was tainted.  They were both involved in getting the blood a certification of quality, and that's why Bayer, Baxer, Cutter were thrown under the bus.  The final product should have been checked, but wasn't.  No one has been arrested, or assassinated over this.

        I was told that film in its entirety is available on freenet and cannot be removed from there without bringing the whole system down.  They won't because freenet is used by these occult aristocrats to peddle snuff films and pedo.  I haven't verified this but you can.

       Shouldn't that forfeit their rights to property or any operating license?     So,  any decent country would not allow them to operate in their territory,  and would have open source to any of the so called private rights of that criminal institution.    Ecuador?   Iceland?

       Not just Bayer.   Artificial entities of all kinds,  corporations,  churches, nations,  all should be subject to an especially rigorous annual review,  because they are given special privileges of personhood and they also can so easily accumulate power that is in excess of the individual citizen.    The progress of the individual citizen over the last 1000 years,  for example the Magna Carta,  the Bill of Rights was to counter what the artificial power of the personhood of state power,   and now that the corporation has evolved to usurp state power,   it is high time to revisit the protections of the people against these institutional powers that are becoming so Borg like.    Its really the whole point of 1984,   the shift in the balance of power to faceless unaccountable institutions that are headed by lying corrupt criminal psychopathic elements by their very structure and reason for being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern day "democracy" and "capitalism" is a sham,  and the failure of Soviet communism has been used to make the principles of corporate greed non-negotiable.    Well,  they are negotiable,  but only with the recognition that artificial persons only exist and have rights at the whim of the people.

       No such thing as HIV, but yeah, they are bastards nonetheless.

       I have hiv so that offends me.  I wish you could borrow my last 8 yrs, my hearing loss, vertigo, stroke, etc to know how wrong you are.  Sorry that's kind of mean spirited.  Never mind.  I hope you go well but at least adjust your knowledge at some point

       Thanks, but the upside is after the stroke and other problems I'm now disabled so jokes on the hiv.  I get to get paid by myself (what I paid into fica last 15-20 yrs) to sit here and complain about uncle sam.  Isn't that ironic?  I mean since, if they didn't engineer hiv itself, they certainly have done nothing to cure it and instead have highly profitted from the treatment, which itself gives people autoimmune disease, strokes, and crushes their souls in ways regular folk can't imagine.  For example, google "terrifying dreams sustiva".  You  get hiv, get put on antiretrovirals and then lo and behold you realize : oh, the drugs themselves are dissociative hallucinogens. But not the good kind that raise your awareness like cannabis and mushrooms; more like the bad kind, the narcotics that make you a dull and stupid young lad.

       At night, an hour after you take them for 3 hrs or so, you are in a fugue state where you start to lose touch with who you are, morality, and life seems so empty and meaningless.  It's the perfect drug for nihilists who don't like using their brain or creative capacities because that's gone also.  Luckily they have newer drugs that don't do this, but still the most prescribed is still Atripla which is a one-a-day pill (like a multivitamin that costs 60-=80 dollars a shot); Atripla is 1/3 sustiva.

       Anyway, I'm not on anything now.  Which people in my family think: oh no he'll die of aids.  Not going to happen.  I've figured out an alchemical secret that keeps it in check. I've already posted it to conspiracy and it did not receive much attention but there were people who were quick to discredit even though the 'secret' is right there on nih.gov. I'm really not afraid of aids, but some will attempt to say I'm a denialist. I'm not.  It's just my unique physiology makes me allergic to the treatment so Im in a quandry and have to come up with alternatives myself.  This is why I push for natural treatments, not only have they proven to work for me, they are sometimes much better than what pharm has to offer.

       I know a guy with mantle cell lymphoma, a death sentence in 6 months...he forewent chemo and is on his fifth year, using yoga, tai chi, chi kung, acupuncture, vitamins/minerals, changing diet, and smoking and eating lots of pot.  Yep.  pot.  Hes in CO so its legal for him to save his own life.  He's done all this while working for a company to finish a project that inspires him, because that project is the business he created.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is chemo is a death sentence as much as the diagnosis.  He took his chances on himself, said f you to chemo,  and yes, fortune did favor the bold.

       No you don't my friend. You've been lied to. Hearing loss vertigo and stroke have nothing to do with a virus. The human immune system can fight off viruses using a simple fever.

       Genetically modified insects? Like OH MY GOD, there are millions of bugs! You don't have to manufacture them.. Makes me wonder about those Japanese hornets that can wipe out hundreds of millions of bees with only less than 100 hornets in a couple of hours  ...

       GM ants
Not needed or wanted.
Really.
Pretty sure someone should look away further into that?
Any body see any of their shyt oozing around?
Maybe under the filth we are all looking at.
Shrugs....
Someone prolly got careless and greedy,
      </p>
      <p>
       And how could that not possibly go wrong?
Maybe a leak here somewhere.
Any body seen anything?

       I have seen way to much broken,
Kinda need to get back to fixing things.
This might help
