<p>btw mossad, cia, fbi and cass sunstein ofc have realised the dangers of truth so there are disinformation shills theories and documentaries out there to discredit the most rational explanations (this include the saudi government angle which has been created to misdirect from israel)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are all good...and while not exactly necessary for an introduction to 9/11 truth, there is good reason to state that we don&#39;t know every type of explosive that was used. </p>

<p>While there is plenty of evidence that would indicate thermite or nanothermite(&quot;NT&quot;) was used (as A&amp;E911 maintains), we can assume that some amount of conventional high explosive such as symtex, C4, or RDX was used. However, there are numerous reasons to suggest that other more exotic high explosives were used, including possibly some type of unknown 3rd generation nuclear device. </p>

<p>One reason to conclude an exotic explosive can be seen when watching the North tower fall in the video above. As the building falls, there are huge sections which are ejected from the sides that continue to disintegrate (or evaporate or &quot;dustify&quot;). Also, whenever there is a controlled demolition of a building, there always remains a debris pile that is around 22% of the height of the original building. So for the WTC buildings 1 &amp; 2, we should see a debris pile over ~23 floors. Instead, the debris pile is approximately 3 stories. And, as many have mentioned, as with any normal controlled demolition, you&#39;d see office furniture, and <em>some</em> remains of human bodies. But there are none (none inside the rubble pile). There are also strange craters under WTC buildings 1,2, &amp; 6 which are a minimum of 30&#39; deep. These craters remain filled with hot melted steel for several weeks; there is a hotspot under WTC 1  as long as 5 months later!</p>

<p>It&#39;s tough to find information on this aspect of 9/11 because a large faction of people believe that the notion of any explosive other than NT is disinformation. However, making this assumption is actually the opposite of keeping an open mind about 9/11, since even A&amp;E911&#39;s theory of controlled demolition doesn&#39;t account for many oddities or anomalies witnessed during and after the collapse— therefore, <em>we don&#39;t yet have an answer as to precisely what brought these buildings down.</em></p>

<p>You can spend time researching and eventually find some good info. Here is one <a href="http://www.usavsus.info/WTC-MoreEvidence.htm">good article</a>.  Unfortunately it only goes into a partial list of reasons to suspect  some kind of exotic explosive was used. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a good observation instead.  There are no trailing vortices that appear in the immediate smoky aftermath of the collision.  This indicates there were no planes.  I doubt grassroots terrorists  a) have the ability to project holographic planes, b) use energy weapons (as per Dr. Judy Wood&#39;s observations) to cold melt/bend steel in spots whilst leaving material beside it untouched, c) can turn off the mil response, d) are on the inside of NIST providing bogus FEA models, e) can promulgate the fiction of the &quot;official story&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did the vortices go?  Why does the video evidence show a moving bulkhead beneath one of the planes?  How does a plane maintain its 600 mph speed if the engines will steadystate at 200 mph at that altitude - what is the likelihood of the maneuver to achieve that speed considering the performance envelope of the plane itself?  Why does the video of the impact look like it was CGI&#39;d instead of real?  Why aren&#39;t there any plane parts at all?</p>

<p>There are lots of reasons supporting the thesis, and none debunking it.  </p>

I have no idea about the other two planes but I lived in NY at the time and there were countless people who watched the planes hit the towers. I don&#39;t believe they are what took them down, but I honestly have not seen anything to make me believe there weren&#39;t planes. I heard them hit the towers, but did not see.

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at a blueprint of the World Trade Center, there were many support columns in the core, Plus many closely spaced columns on the outside. The jet fuel was traveling at 520 miles per hour and that that speed would have had the kinetic energy to pass through the building itself and even been able to sever the thinner (at the top) steel columns on its way out along with the other debris. It would have been extremely agitated and mixed up by its Transit through the building, and that is the fireball that you see exiting at both impact sites.</p>

<p>Where you should be concerned is the conspiracy theorists pushing the official story that somehow, all this jet fuel defied physics and stopped and poured in an orderly manner down the fire shafts and dribbled down into the basement and cause the towers to melt and fall into their own foot print.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are mixing up your physics. </p>

<p>Two things allegedly happened: (i) a plane traveling 550+ knots made of 80% aluminum broke through the exterior columns, which were comprised of 18&quot; I-beams that were made from 3&quot; thick steel, and (ii) the fuel tank filled with kerosene exploded. Kerosene is highly flammable, but it&#39;s not considered a true explosive. There was a fireball upon impact, however, fire does not have any mass, only the fuel does (until it is ignited). Notwithstanding the mass of the fuel, it&#39;s still a liquid so it can&#39;t contribute to the tensile strength of the plane. </p>

<p>Further, adding the mass of the fuel to the mass of the plane and combining it with the kinetic energy of the moving plane, still would not break through the building, and <em>certainly</em> not like a road runner cartoon.</p>

<p>If a plane hit the WTC, the nose and the fuselage would collapse, until it got to the wings, whereupon  the wings would have folded back. Although I highly doubt it, the only thing you&#39;d see if a plane hit the WTC would have been a circular dent in the building  roughly the shape of the body of the plane— or it could have punched through, but it would have never entered the building, 90% of the plane would have fallen to the ground. </p>

<p>It could not have broken those steel columns the way it is down in the video. The tensile strength of the steel columns is too great compared to the aluminum of the plane, no matter how fast it&#39;s moving.</p>

<p>The fireball is irrelevant as it happens after collision, so it would have very little, if any, effect on the those exterior steel beams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fine. The second aircraft that I witnessed is a 767. I would know it by heart because I am a planespotter. You are right, however, and all fairness to your point, I would not be able to recognize the landing gear or a 757-767 on sight. I did however see it before the police had wrapped it with crime-scene tape. But I&#39;m not sure what that would indicate. Just letting you know what I saw. Ultimately, for me, the point is that someone with your convictions will refuse to ever be convinced by the evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is saying there were no planes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if I buy into the hologram theory, but there is evidence that is pretty conclusive that there were no planes (or, at least what we see in all the MSM broadcasts were manipulated videos with planes added).</p>

<p>One good resource regarding the planes is a book found in <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/34dhyd/excellent_book_hijacking_americas_mind_on_911_by/">this thread</a>.</p>

<p>Also, there are a lot of great videos that prove the videos were altered, but this one is great for its brevity. It relates to Flight #175 (second plane which hit the South tower):</p>

<p>First view the video <a href="http://youtu.be/sPqq9r8mPi0">as broadcast</a></p>

<p>Then watch the same video <a href="http://youtu.be/GCypcBYUt10">slowed down and narrated</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not invested in the outcome.  The process of elimination does all the work.  Put all of the facts on one axis, put the theories on another.  Go down the list and mark whether the theory is consistent with the facts, or not.  Let logic be your guide.  </p>

<p>The vortices would have, however.  Notice in this video how the vortices follow the trajectory of the plane, passing through the same spot several seconds later. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy0hgG2pkUs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy0hgG2pkUs</a>  The vortices from the plane&#39;s flight were still in motion prior to the point of impact, and would have continued towards that point.  The wake, essentially, that&#39;s left by the plane, would have run through the smoke that was wallowing out immediately upon &quot;impact&quot;.  This did not happen.</p>

<p>Also there are multiple video artifacts from several vids showing a moving pod, a strange line bisecting the length of the fuselage, and weirdly inconsistent impact points by the engines between 2 different vids.  Surprisingly there&#39;s a lot of confirming video evidence to the thesis.  There weren&#39;t any plane parts with the exception of the engine (which was never in those planes) so it was a plant, and another section which also had atta&#39;s passport, which turned out to be of questionable sourceage as well.  </p>

<p>John Lear&#39;s explanation of the event is an accurate one, imo.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQBlv7sZGVE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQBlv7sZGVE</a></p>

<p>The vortice wake will continue for a while - an explosion is brief.  The effects of the wake should have been visible through the smoke.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was lots of debris.  There were even faux parts (like the engine which wasn&#39;t a pratt &amp; whitney but should have been).  I don&#39;t know if there was anything definitely found to be from either plane.  If you have evidence to the otherwise, please share.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is irrelevant to the hologram thesis.  The hologram would look like a plane hitting the tower.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is not inconsistent with the hologram thesis.  But we do know there were and are efforts from the mainstream and establishment to promulgate false theories.  The official narrative is one example.  The impossible NIST FEA models are another.  The freefall speed is yet another narrative being widely ignored.  The fused and bent metal right beside material that is completely unaffected - indicative of energy weapon use - also widely ignored.  There <em>is</em> an effort to put forth narratives that don&#39;t map with the known facts by mainstream actors - this is observably true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did the vortices go?  Why does the video evidence show a moving bulkhead beneath one of the planes?  How does a plane maintain its 600 mph speed if the engines will steadystate at 200 mph at that altitude - what is the likelihood of the maneuver to achieve that speed considering the performance envelope of the plane itself?  Why does the video of the impact look like it was CGI&#39;d instead of real?  Why aren&#39;t there any plane parts at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is saying there were no planes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if I buy into the hologram theory, but there is evidence that is pretty conclusive that there were no planes (or, at least what we see in all the MSM broadcasts were manipulated videos with planes added).</p>

<p>One good resource regarding the planes is a book found in <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/34dhyd/excellent_book_hijacking_americas_mind_on_911_by/">this thread</a>.</p>

<p>Also, there are a lot of great videos that prove the videos were altered, but this one is great for its brevity. It relates to Flight #175 (second plane which hit the South tower):</p>

<p>First view the video <a href="http://youtu.be/sPqq9r8mPi0">as broadcast</a></p>

<p>Then watch the same video <a href="http://youtu.be/GCypcBYUt10">slowed down and narrated</a>.</p>
