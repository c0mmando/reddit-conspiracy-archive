<p>this is exactly what they are doing. Creating an army of autists via vaccines, glyphosate in the food/water/air, chemtrails, literally dumbing down everyone through mass poisoning.</p>

<p>The best health I&#39;ve ever had was the 2 times I hiked the Himalayas and drank the mountain water there and ate the 100% organic food there with zero chemtrail planes. But back home in the U.S. my health turns to shit</p>

<p>Both times that I have been there has been for 50+ days. I notice the difference in my health there by then end of the first week, all my problems disappear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like what was so different about the food there that you can&#39;t find here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The food I was eating in India never tasted like what I eat in U.S. Everything tasted richer, many of the foods were organic straight from farm to table. Nothing came wrapped in plastic containers nor was my mountain water source processed with fluoride or anything else like that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When I get back to the U.S. my health goes from 100% down to 65-75%, the tiredness comes back, the pain/back issues come back, and many other things</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To all the folks who honestly believe no planes hit the towers that day:</p>

<p>Russell (my cousin; MMC employee) was in the North tower on floor 100 something eating breakfast with coworkers at Windows on the World. After the plane hit further down the building, he called his wife and explained to her that he was okay. Even after 30 minutes from impact, there was no smoke on 100 and above, but the air temperature was excruciatingly hot (this is why we had people jumping from floors with no smoke. Something in that building was making the air temperature rise and cooking the people inside)</p>

<p>Anyway, he happened to be looking out the window, and his exact words were &quot;Shit, here comes another one.&quot; and the call was disconnected.</p>

<p>So yeah, there really were planes.</p>

<p>Bonus: Willie Rodriguez &quot;The last man out&quot; is a hero; I&#39;m not trying to take away from that. But he wasn&#39;t the only employee in the building that day with a master key. There was a man who went all the way down to floor 80 something to pinpoint where the fire was, and then returned back to inform the others that they were trapped and that their best course of action was to stay put and wait for FDNY to arrive. We all know the rest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was about a lot more than insurance money and war. It was the destruction of mounds of evidence that would have cast serious doubt on the inner workings of the intelligence community and the government in general. </p>

<p>Look up the Hammer fund. Back before he was president, Bush 41 purchased approx $250B in covert securities that were scheduled to come due on Sept. 12, 2001. The SEC would have red-flagged this immediately. Instead, after the attacks, the SEC invoked its emergency privileges, allowing all securities to be electronically cleared upon maturity for 15 days without the standard procedures surrounding authenticity and ownership checks. In fact, a branch of investigators called the El Dorado Task Force were already suspicious of the &quot;Hammer fund&quot; before 9/11, but after all their evidence was destroyed in the attacks, all personnel originally involved were redirected to investigate terrorist financing. This fund went on to finance the rise of 2 presidents, and countless black operations. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just one example of something that&#39;s public knowledge. Imagine how much stuff was destroyed that the public has no idea about.</p>

<p>Among the items missing from the US Customs vault below WTC building 6 was a sizable amount of gold bullion. </p>

<p>This took an immense level of planning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone had doubts before Iraq was invaded. Since the ulterior motive was pretty clear from the start, I don&#39;t really think this can be called a successful conspiracy. Too many people were aware or concerned that the invasion was based on lies.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people knew it was a scam, but the events of 9/11 made them blood thirsty for &quot;terrorists&quot;. Creating the illusion of fake terrorism to subdue and manipulate an entire country more fits the definition of &quot;conspiracy&quot; to me.</p>

<p>If it was a conspiracy, it was poorly hidden. That&#39;s why I classify that instance as deceptive military tactics and not a large scale secret.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more like, &quot;well, it&#39;s yellow and circular. It could be a banana... but it smells and tastes like a lemon. It&#39;s probably a lemon&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be more sophisticated than most people and recognize the obvious truth, but i could tell you that Sandy Hook is also obvious (to quote one example - please focus on the dynamic not the example now) and they were just having fun with us putting such an obvious plan in our faces, which i think they do. So that&#39;s not a conspiracy to me, it&#39;s a joke on us in plain sight. If we want to get rethoric.
The key there is that there is a plan, which is to our demise, being not recognized. On absolute grounds, if everybody recognize it, but still can&#39;t do shit about the fact, then there&#39;s still a conspiracy on closed doors where everything was plotted to be like this.
And if there wasn&#39;t and it was just all about plain sight (which i deem impossible), then there have been already pretty successful conspiracies that got us there.
Call it a conspiracy, call it plain evil, it&#39;s just about where your knowledge stands, end result being the same.
Anyway thank you for the reasoned response to my mockery, it says atleast you are there to be constructive, thank you.</p>

<p>To sort it out in my words, conspiracy means &quot;a reaaaaallly bad joke on someone&quot; which usually require more than one actor or producer. Also you must... should ask yourself: is this a minor or a major joke? could it be that iran destabilization, even if i don&#39;t think was a bad joke on my society, was a necessary part of a major worse joke later? was it there because we just thought it was the right thing to do, or because it was needed later to pull off a bigger scam (thus making it a scam in and of itself)?</p>

<p>Not every part of a good plan may be good in nature, but every part of an evil one is such. That&#39;s my take. If it was in plain sight then it means they could just allow themselves that, it doesn&#39;t diminish any of the evil. To call it a conspiracy it&#39;s about calling out evil reasons for such actions. And i bet nobody on TV went &quot;i feel like genocidal today, i think ill go to iran huehue&quot; but find all other different reasons to do that. Wether people see or not beyond it it&#39;s pretty much indifferent.</p>

<p>Then you have <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/abu-nidal-notorious-palestinian-mercenary-was-a-us-spy-972812.html">Susan Lindhauer</a> and she puts it all together. She was a CIA asset, sent to the Libyan &amp; Iraq embassies to get information (before 9/11 happened) on the attack.</p>

<p>Both told her no one in their countries were planning anything. They then put her in jail, labeled her crazy in the media &amp; attacked her character.</p>

<p>To be honest I don&#39;t think you need to look any further than her, (along with all the other evidence)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I stated above, the Iraq invasion was dishonest and manipulative, but the true intentions weren&#39;t very well hidden. This is more of an instance where people chose to ignore the true reasons because 9/11 (the real conspiracy here) made them want revenge.</p>

<p>This point is relevant to the discussion. It illustrates that many people will believe deceit when legitimate proof exists (like with the Iraq Invasion), but will be cautious or wary with a lack of such (like 9/11 being an inside job). </p>

<p>All of my comments are disagreeing with the assumption that non conspiracy theorists are all insufferable morons who can&#39;t decipher obvious wrong doing when presented with evidence.</p>

<p>There was talk of some obscure agency called the NSA and of course the more well known CIA, pointed at by the hardcover conspiracy theorists. Of course, given this hero of a whistleblower, the NSA is now world famous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are people in this sub that still think Snowden is a plant and that whole thing is a false flag. This is why conspiracies are difficult to ever truly, &quot;confirm&quot; unless the actions have been witnessed personally. </p>

<p>For all we know, the NSA doesn&#39;t even exist and the government created them so no one realized an Artificial Intelligence is constantly watching us. So, while it&#39;s very probable and likely that the NSA exists, we&#39;re still just relying on spoken word and documents (which can both be fabricated). Human understanding is not like a science. We can&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; deception of reality empirically, we just come to a mutual agreement of what to perceive.</p>

<p>My point has been a response to the original post; if enough reputable evidence exists, people will believe it. A word like &quot;confirmed&quot; is not realistic unless you personally saw the source of every piece of information.</p>

<p>The best example I give to counter this are the Police. A police officer does not have to see each crime first hand. They can put you in jail without ever seeing what you did directly.

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying that everyone has to see everything to make reality true? Yeah I&#39;m not arguing with you there. </p>

<p>But for a society to function, you need proxies, you need people to represent others on their behalf. There&#39;s a hell of a lot of gray areas in this life, especially war and the counter intelligence game, so &quot;action by agreement&quot; is sometimes what&#39;s needed. </p>

<p>Getting back to the OP, the problem is that the mainstream media isn&#39;t even talking about what&#39;s happening. You&#39;re talking about a ball game, but the media hasn&#39;t shown up.

<p>And if 2 or more people act in collusion to FALSIFY such documentation, they would be guilty of the crime of CONSPIRACY.</p>

<p>Before you embarrass yourself further - from Cornell University Law School:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/conspiracy">Conspiracy:</a></strong> <strong><em>An agreement between two or more people to commit an illegal act, along with an intent to achieve the agreement&#39;s goal.</em></strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It cannot be &quot;confirmed&quot; because at some point you&#39;ll have to take someone else&#39;s statement as truth. This does not mean that I think conspiracies don&#39;t exist. It means <strong>we can&#39;t prove them scientifically beyond a doubt</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can anything be proven <strong>beyond doubt</strong>? No, it can&#39;t, because all it takes is for ONE IDIOT to &quot;doubt&quot; it, and it is not proven &quot;beyond doubt&quot;, is it?</p>

<p>I believe that is why in the legal system, they used the phrase &quot;beyond <strong>reasonable</strong> doubt&quot;, don&#39;t they?</p>

<p>In several of the links I cited above, the accused have admitted, and plead guilty to the crime of CONSPIRACY. </p>

<p>Beyond reasonable doubt. or no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree 100%. It&#39;s not even that &quot;the majority of America would still believe the official government story&quot;. It&#39;s that they don&#39;t care and they genuinely don&#39;t see what difference it makes now that it&#39;s been so long.</p>

<p>If a new study revealed that birth of Christ was in, say, June, would westerners rush to change the date of Christmas? Of course not. They don&#39;t care about that sort of historical accuracy and causing a fuss over changing the story would be said to <em>ruin the spirit of Christmas</em> or something of that nature. Once a history is written and accepted, it tends to stay fixed regardless of whether new information comes to light.</p>

<p>In similar way, 9/11 was/is lodged in all of our brains as a historical event with certain facts and figures pre-ordained. It&#39;s been the basis for our foreign policy actions ever since... so, to pull down the 9/11 official story would also require us to re-frame our actions in the 15 years since as being based on falsehoods. That&#39;s a LOT of cognitive dissonance. There would (and should) be consequences.</p>

<p>I know quite a few ordinary, non skeptical friends who think the official story is total bullshit, but there&#39;s really nothing to be done. If the media caused an uproar over this, people might begin to care enough to demand answers... but for so long as the media carries on with the official narrative, it just takes too much energy for anyone to resist.</p>

<p>The actual planners of 9/11 will grow old and die and no one will care because the alternative of having to go back, investigate, prosecute the guilty, apologize &amp; pay reparations for all the shit we started is simply not something we&#39;re interested in doing as a country. It&#39;s much <em>easier</em> to just go with the flow. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s right (in fact, I&#39;m saying the opposite), but you and the OP are right - after a certain amount of time and decisions, the truth begins to matter much less to your average person for a variety of reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I am very mad at them, and it comes out on Reddit the most. I am mad because they fiercely and proudly defend their &quot;rational skepticism&quot; when it comes to scientific endeavors, but immediately upon leaving the realm of the scientific, their rationality and skeptic tendencies turn into blind faith and irrational observance of social norms. It really makes me laugh, go into <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> and you will find an unending stream of self-congratulatory posts lauding eachother for how open-minded they all are, yet when I assert something that is clearly provable that goes against their preconceived notions, they balk as if I&#39;ve insulted their mother or something. These people are fake ass skeptics, fake ass philosophers, fake ass intelligencia, fake as fuck and they&#39;re encouraged by the even MORE fake frauds like Bill Nye who pushes vaccines on everyone even though there is proof now of the scientific fraud concerning the CDC reports. </p>

<p>I mean, these people don&#39;t even realize how fucking brainwashed they are, so I do get mad, I get really fucking mad because I want so badly to think of the right words I could communicate to convey the idea that there is legitimate evidence that us in the truth community have to show that everything about our society is fraudulent, down to the very historic events themselves being manufactured by intelligence. But no, they don&#39;t want to hear it, and can you blame them? I&#39;m sure I sound insane, and if you told me two years ago that I would believe this I wouldn&#39;t believe it, but it&#39;s true, and truth is the most important concept missing from culture today. There is no value in objective truth because the owners don&#39;t want to be revealed, so they prop up intellectuals who push a constant stream of &quot;moral relativism&quot; and other intellectual sins that only a hefty dose of propaganda could turn into an attractive philosophical paradigm.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing that the vaccines conspiracy is false because doctors don&#39;t believe in it. I am arguing that it&#39;s false that people don&#39;t believe in conspiracy theories because they&#39;re not skeptical enough or because they won&#39;t even consider them. Doctors are my example for people who undoubtedly looked into a conspiracy and don&#39;t accept it, since doctors regularly read researches and I doubt there&#39;s one who has never heard of Wakefield.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are intact windows exactly where the wings would have hit.</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t know basic physics, namely Newton&#39;s 3rd law. If a plane hits a light pole going several hundred mph, it would have the same effect as a light pole hitting a stationary plane at that speed, which would obviously rip apart the plane and cause it to cartwheel all over the front lawn leaving wreckage everywhere.  </p>

<p>You could apply the same Newton law to the WTC buildings too. The planes simply melt into the buildings at the same speed as they were traveling in air rather than being crushed like tin cans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the WTC towers had been solid blocks of reinforced concrete, the planes might have crumpled and dropped. But the towers were mainly empty space and the outside of the towers was fairly thin so momentum carried the planes through that &#39;skin&#39;. </p>

<p>You can see how effectively the &#39;skin&#39; of 1WTC was penetrated by the plane in this image, which more or less preserves the impact profile of the aircraft: <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cmh/simulation/phase3/Run11/NorthFaceWTC1.jpg">https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cmh/simulation/phase3/Run11/NorthFaceWTC1.jpg</a></p>

<p>Once the planes struck the far more solid inner structures of the towers, they did crumple, and did very little damage - but they exploded at the same time, which is why the crumpling was sort of irrelevant and totally invisible. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some great mystery, specialists understood the mechanics of the situation almost immediately. Here&#39;s a brief summary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The early news reports noted how well the towers withstood the initial impact of the aircraft; however, when one recognizes that the buildings had more than 1,000 times the mass of the aircraft and had been designed to resist steady wind loads of 30 times the weight of the aircraft, this ability to withstand the initial impact is hardly surprising. Furthermore, since there was no significant wind on September 11, the outer perimeter columns were only stressed before the impact to around 1/3 of their 200 MPa design allowable. </p>

<p>The only individual metal component of the aircraft that is comparable in strength to the box perimeter columns of the WTC is the keel beam at the bottom of the aircraft fuselage. While the aircraft impact undoubtedly destroyed several columns in the WTC perimeter wall, the number of columns lost on the initial impact was not large and the loads were shifted to remaining columns in this highly redundant structure. Of equal or even greater significance during this initial impact was the explosion when 90,000 L gallons of jet fuel, comprising nearly 1/3 of the aircraft’s weight, ignited. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what if you are not? What do you do? that&#39;s the real question. What can you do that will CHANGE things? that will not just give you the relief to say &quot;jeez, i tryied&quot;? Few people can stand the trial of death and not change their mind, and even then they die unknown, because well, they are alone in their path. Theirs it&#39;s at best a spiritual success and not much else.</p>

<p>My answer is nothing. Either the mass get desperate, or you won&#39;t hear a fly buzzing about this.</p>

<p>But if you have a better idea please practice it.</p>

<p>My opinion if that if people thinks this is all ok, and then they get their way because some fucking christ (and i love christ) saves them, what is going to happen? are they to wake up if they didn&#39;t suffer absolute loss? i don&#39;t think so. I think the world needs to see the grown seed of evil before it can start having rational discussion about planting it. Else it&#39;s just going to happen the generation after.</p>

<p>A rational society where people worship a fucking goat should understand the worshippers should only be allowed to fuck goats and other people that fuck goats because that&#39;s their mental capacity for goodness (none). Else we should accept our society is getting fucked by an imaginary goat, because we think worshipping one is like, O.K.
A nation culturally divided by principles is not a nation at all. It&#39;s a geographic region where i/you just wouldn&#39;t want to be.</p>

<p>Life is merciless and cunning, and so they are, and here we are, little white rabbits eating grass. I see no chance until a really big mass of people understand that&#39;s not the way.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is we have no power and humanity will need to get really lucky to be somewhat free in a hundred years. Perhaps they</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Official Story was hammered into the American psyche while they were in shock. It was a form of brain washing. The MSM showed the planes slamming into the towers over and over while chanting the Official Story over and over for about a week straight.</p>

<p>It is fact that the mind is susceptible to suggestion while in a state of shock. The engineers of 9/11 had also planned the engineering of the American mindset. They backed it up with public shaming a chastising of anyone who would dare question the official story. </p>

<p>About a year later, brave individuals stepped forward to declare that all three buildings came down because of controlled demolition. The MSM&#39;s response was that these people are &quot;mentally ill&quot; and should be put in a psych ward. The MSM acted angry and upset that someone could actually believe that and that they must be evil to even say &quot;it&quot;, Controlled Demolition. The brainwash of 9/11 runs very deep. And now the indoctrination has begun and the Official Story is being taught in public schools in America. Someday questioning the 9/11 official story will be met with the same appalled outrage as if you had questioned the official story of the holocaust. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. As I said earlier, when you suspend skepticism for emotionalism, you open yourself up to being fooled. America was fooled in those crucial days. Most will never break free of that brainwashing.</p>

<p>As for your holocaust comment--it most certainly happened. What most Americans don&#39;t know, however, is the the answer to the question &quot;Who benefited from the forced labor in the concentration camps?&quot; The history books would have you believe that the work was done to supply the German war machine with supplies to wage war. This is largely incorrect. The biggest beneficiaries from forced labor in the camps were American industrialists. Just like the American oligarchs financed Hitler&#39;s rise to power. </p>

<p>A famous scene from WWII is that of Hitler&#39;s convoy of trucks arriving in Paris just before the famous photo was taken of Hitler standing on a balcony overlooking the Eiffel Tower. What they don&#39;t tell you about those trucks, is who made their engines. Let&#39;s just say (and I&#39;m not joking) that Adolf Hitler so admired Henry Ford, that he kept a life-size portrait of him in his office.</p>

<p>In addition, the German Luftwaffe would have been unable to operate, had it not been for a special fuel additive, patented and sold to the Hitler regime by JD Rockefeller&#39;s Standard Oil. </p>

<p>There is a whole secret history of this country not printed in any textbook. It&#39;s out there, if you&#39;re willing to research it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy is correct. You would have NEVER seen a drill taken &quot;live&quot; in order to advance an agenda the way you do now. Not sure where you stand on Sandy Hook, but I&#39;ve spent thousands of hours researching it, travelled to Newtown a handful of times, and let me tell you definitively--that school was not in use on that day. The media was complicit in reporting it as a real event. I&#39;m sorry if it sounds insensitive, but no one died in that school. It was a drill taken live. If you are repulsed by what I&#39;m saying, please do your research. It&#39;s a hard truth to stomach, but a truth nonetheless. And the trail of deceit goes all the way up the chain, right to the oval office.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done a little exploration of the subject. The false flag/drill gone wild/MKULTRA/gun control theories are all ivory towers built on foundations of sand in my opinion (to mangle two metaphors).</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are some inexplicable and ropy-looking things about the way whole affair was presented to the media that lead me to believe that something controversial about the incident hasn&#39;t been made public. I have no idea what that might be, if that suspicion is correct, and there isn&#39;t enough information to speculate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so. The reason people believe the official story is because it&#39;s believable. There is more evidence that there were no explosives in those buildings then that there were. I myself do not believe the official story but there just isn&#39;t any SOLID proof that bombs went off. And yes, I&#39;ve seen all the videos for the last 10 years including firefighters talking about explosives and how the towers do look like they had explosives and of course, tower 7. </p>

<p>But if dick Cheney said that, I am 100% sure people would hear it and get outraged. Shit like that wouldn&#39;t just fly. No pun intended. </p>
