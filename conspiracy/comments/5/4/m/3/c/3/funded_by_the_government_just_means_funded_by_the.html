       The USA borrows money from the privately owned (not federal) Federal Reserve (no reserves required) in exchange for treasury bonds. So the bank makes money out of nothing in exchange for debt, the treasury certificates of debt to be paid back by the taxpayers.

       It should be the government issuing money. We believe it so strongly that we think they are when they're not. We're being suckered. It benefits those who make the money, as we should expect. Money cannot be created without diluting the value of existing money while taking some of its value. Bankers would have us believe otherwise, because they are the beneficiaries.

       I'm aware of the conspiracy of clones.  There's actually some really, really strange videos for anyone else reading that are floating around.  Can try to find some if any readers here are curious.

       Theres another option for Shillary though.  Some type of modern psychological warfare gone (partially) wrong.  Shillary haters are jumping on board that she might have some illness, alzheimers, or worse etc.  But we must always be aware of (kind of mainstream by now) ideas that
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       serve as distraction from the truth.  In this case, perhaps particularly important ("non clone") politicians are literally brainwashed and controlled (think MKUltra,) Hillary being one test subject.  One side effect might be glitches similar to those seen in "naturally" brain damaged individuals.  She does tend to have a uniquely bipolar temperament; sometimes appearing sane and coherent, other times a bumbling, coughing/sickly ignoramus.  In this case, I actually agreed when Trump said he has a much better temperament.  Maybe he's hinting at something.  Overall, Trump is at least much more consistent.

      <p>
       Just some thoughts I just had.

       Note that although I have been known to defend Trump (mostly in person, I haven't been doing much Reddit or other forums lately,) I support neither of them.

       Tesla is a scam, is a theory based on these things:
      </p>
      <p>
       Tesla is yet to make a profit. Tesla's Gigafactory makes cells that there is currently no use for, and whose chemistry will necessitate the rise of prices. Musk assumes that his capital will last longer than his competition, and he can enforce a new (larger) cell standard that will lock out anyone who isn't using it due to multiple lines being inefficient. It just means the US would control a strategic resource, rechargeable cells.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tesla cars use a cooling system due to the cells being used being packed so tight, and doing so much. It also extends their lifetime to automotive standards. However this cooling systems energy draw is not being figured into the power needs of the system. This is "vampire draw". Figuring in "vampire draw", transmission losses of the power grid, and who is making that power, and how we end up with the same emissions as any equivalent gas powered car, however with better acceleration. As such the main savings of a Tesla, are the favored classes being exempt from fuel taxation, that is for slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Untold environmental damage comes from the quest for more cobalt, and lithium, but these costs are ignored in considering the validity of the Tesla.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such Tesla is an offensive boil on the ass of the state playing favorites, and the working class can eat a dick.

       Yes, to all of that.  Especially the rare earth elements required to build each car.  The environmental and human cost (child-slaves in some cases) required to get the materials is horrendous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore I think the fact that Tesla receives considerable amounts of tax money and tax breaks from  State and Federal governments is appalling (something close to 3-5 billion dollars depending on what you read).
      </p>
      <p>
       If Tesla products were practical and could stand on their own two feet in the market place then I would have no problem with Musk.  But he is a snake oil salesman telling the public all of the politically correct things they want to hear about "saving the world with electric cars" and raking in tax $$ to keep the clown ship afloat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't even get me started on Solar City.... Talk about holes to throw my tax money in.

       We once had an Airship company near where I was born, and all they did was take investor money, and tax cuts. When they got their assets seized it turned out they had never planned to build an Airship, they just really wanted to to fuck up some investor money. That was during the post DotCom, bring back manufacturing phase.

       I'm very familiar and have a lot of experience in the field, however I was wondering if you had any more information on the cooling system and vampire draw? I'll look for myself as well. --EDIT: Roadster and the S are using glycol for cooling and thermal balancing of the cells, mostly used during charging.

       Not only that cells get up to 80° Centigrade with 100° being right before cooking off just by being used to their fully ability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alright let's do the math:
      </p>
      <p>
       Each Tesla S comes with 7104 individual cells each cells has the following watts according to the spec sheet:
      </p>
      <p>
       3.6 V * 6 A = 21.6 Watts
      </p>
      <p>
       So that means we just Multiply since the configuration doesn't matter all that much:
      </p>
      <p>
       7104*21.6W = 153.5 kW peak output of all cells within safe uncooled parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering that this is the maximum output of the cells we know that thing needs cooling, and a lot of it, because pushing it further means a lot of heat which also quickly degrades the cells. If you've ever made a mistake with a laptop cell, and it heated up (fast, and hard) you know that these things are not be trusted, or abused.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the cooling system, well to understand this you have to know that lithium cells can double, or triple their output, if they just get some cooling. Which requires the following the energy needed to cool that, and the chemical energy for the heating. Let's assume we are doubling output, likely since anything else would be to dangerous, and would get up to 120 ° Celsius.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's assume all 18650 cells weigh 50 Grams, some are lighter, some heavier. Now that requires a specific heat capacity, and a starting, and ending temperature:
      </p>
      <p>
       W*S = 0.8 * 50 * (120° * 26°) = 3.7 kJ
      </p>
      <p>
       Cool now that times all cells in the pack 3.7 kJ * 7104 = 26.7 MJ.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put that into perspective one Kilowatt hour of electricity is 3.6 MJ, which means that all this heating up is removing power, as in Chemical energy from the cell, which can't be directly converted, because conversion to heat is more efficient than direct energy conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we are 7.4 Kilowatt shorter going from top to bottom by really heating that thing up going over it's power supply ability by doing stuff like going on highways.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's "vampire draw's" source the fact that all this energy needs to be dissipated, and there is a separate cell bank within the Tesla to do just that, and also the fact that power is evaporating in the form of heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there is also just plain old self discharge from Lithium cells not being able to store more than 3.6 Volts reliably, which accounts for part of it, but the main issue is the shitty parts used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Half a Kilowatt hour per mile (So like what 150 miles peak?) plus losing six, miles every time you let the car cool down (less chemical availability of energy, and having to reheat) is the result of shitty design, and overspeccing your stuff like you are a Chinese graphics card manufacturer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fool me once shame on you, fool me - you can't can't get fooled again.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does all of that mean? Limit the Tesla to it's maximum output according to spec sheet, and it's a fully functional electric car.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has something like 100 KW output (safely) which is more than enough to drive around, and do things. It costs 80.000 Dollars. Nice right? If you were getting paid like in the fifties you'd love one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problems start happening when the demands of rich idiots meet the demands of somewhat rich idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tesla is the AMD of car makers.

       Great post. I think we are missing some key specs to really get a whole picture but overall it looks to me that using Lithium based battery chemistry is worse than using the Deep-Cycle Lead Acid, provided we are using a certain percentage of recycled lead and charging slowly overnight.

       Well the issue is weight, vs. energy density, vs. draw.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do have a technology that can do all of that it just requires twice the space A123 (a lithium cell company) made lithium Phosphate cells that fit the bill. The issue is that they didn't get Tesla as a costumer (who wanted to put the highest possible specs on their car), but rather Fisker automobiles. They went bust, and Fisker followed suit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Classic really the guys who follow the plan couldn't keep up in a market of uneducated easily conned consumers, and investors (read rich people).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now both A123, and Fisker are owned by Chinese businesses, and the geniuses at Tesla are building a plant in China. Essentially all tech will be combined into one electric car to be used by China, because they don't rely on easily conned favored sons to guide their economy.

       at least 50 cents of every tax dollar collected goes to the defense department, the greater military industry complex and the costs of running many foreign occupations around the world. so keep telling yourself its all about building the roads and giving us modern conveniences all you want, even if its actually all about maintaining our empire by killing darker skinned people on the other side of the world.

       voluntary commerce between free people has delivered more advances, conveniences and efficiencies than any government, period.
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, the epi pen pricing scandal. government regulations prevented any competitors from entering the market (which would serve to keep the price of epi-pens down) for years and years (cuz politicians are corruptible). once the scandal hit, liberal politicians lectured them about fairness and promised to create more regulations, and leftists celebrated. then a group of anarcho capitalists simply ignored the IP laws being used by the company for their own protection against competition, and released the specs for a DIY solution that costs $30.
      </p>
      <p>
       which is more likely to solve this problem, more gov regulations (which the largest corporations always find ways to duck anyway, while their smaller/startup competitors usually must honor) based on the notion that a DC bureaucrat knows what the price of a good or service "should" be, or a market of competing solutions allowing for real price discovery to happen naturally?
      </p>
      <p>
       taxes are part of the "big lie" of modern western governments. the team on the left is the major enabler of the “big lie” - that it is morally acceptable to steal from the productivity of future -sometimes un-born - generations in order to make promises to the current electorate that are either absolutely financially untenable ("free" college or healthcare) or fraud to line the pockets of donors/backers (obamacare, most of hrc's promised policies, Bush/Cheney war contracts, etc). in reality, however, more than half of the tax money collected just pays for war and imperialism, and since the vast majority of Americans aren't actually in support of the reality of our foreign policy, it means that those social programs and other promises are just lies used to justify the taking of their money. If a group of people wanted to pool their money together to build a road, it would be way more efficient to simply do so and then hire workers to do the work directly than to give it to govt to reallocate on our behalf, since we know that they're gonna take at least half of the raised money and use it for war.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the team on the right is the minor enabler of the big lie by accepting the premise of it, and arguing only about the specific amounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       anarchists and the anarcho-capitalist movement started by BTC's birth reject the lie entirely and are arguing for a world where we conduct voluntary commerce with each other, without being coerced or forced by bureaucrats to spend our money on things we find morally reprehensible.

       think of any significant invention or innovation in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       now ask yourself if it was created by an individual/corporation with a financial incentive (the intent to sell it), or by a government-contracted inventor with a make-the-world-a-better-place incentive?
      </p>
      <p>
       for a few examples, the automobile, airplane, the computer, the internet, the world wide web, the smart phone, the telephone, the steam powered engine, the telegraph, the printing press, the cotton gin... i could go on, for quite a while.

       Automobile: The automobile was first invented by private enterprise as was the engine, however all parts that make it worth it come from Nazi tank designs. Things like turbo chargers, hybridization, and the computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Airplane: The Jet engine was developed by (again) Nazi Germany, and all Boeing models worth a damn had a government contract riding on it. The 747 was constructed of leftover Knowledge/Money gained from the failed "American Concorde".
      </p>
      <p>
       The Computer: Nazi Germany, while the electronically assisted filing systems that IBM Germany (under state supervision) was making were impressive, it took government funded inventor Conrad Zuse to make the first actual computer, and create the first actual programming language. It's just that a war came in between him, and being remembered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Internet: Cern get's government funding, and provided all all the underlying technology. The free Market failed to generate the technology able to make the DotCom boom be anything, but a disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steam Powered Engine: Yes true, but at the time the government kept out of the economy, which gave us destitution, and sweat shop working conditions for all, but the rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       Telegraph: The Telegraph networks were a Government initiative, with government Standards, nobody else could have built it, unless you are talking wireless which suffered limited bandwidth, due to congestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The printing press: Mostly popularized by the incentive to the government to print laws, and public orders in order to really stop the proles from eating each other. That, and porn, but it was a risky way of getting money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cotton gin: Funded by slavery, and already invented in China. So again this was back in the "low intervention" years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop it with the slave mentality, and go pay some taxes your corporate masters will get richer without your shilling.

       As the population grows the internal tax and the tariffs on customs increases so it isn't viable to compare both. Conditions were worse years ago just because thats the way it was. Technology has helped to make society cleaner for example, years ago, they were throwing shit out of windows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your income tax goes to the federal reserve so it makes no difference on todays society. And the federal reserve has just helped to enslave countrys and people to massive, generational debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Internal taxes and tariffs were used to pay for all the things that income tax supposedly pays for now (even though America is crumbling).
      </p>
      <p>
       Income tax, the IRS and the federal reserve all became in effect around the same time because they are all linked. The IRS collects the tax, the tax goes to the fed.

       Or one could become a citizen of the Cayman Islands, which have roads, schools, infrastructure,  and a British based legal system, but no income tax for citizens. They do however tax purchases heavily, and they have a high source of tourism dollars. Still it shows that it is very possible to be both civilized and not have income tax
