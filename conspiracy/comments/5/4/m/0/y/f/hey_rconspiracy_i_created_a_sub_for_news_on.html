       There's a lot of good news out there that occasionally hits the front page from here that is actually quite relevant and real. But coming from a place called r/conspiracy might turn a lot of people off from the validity of the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hoping I can build this sub to be the next r/uncensorednews, but with less racism and bias. I want this place to be THE place for all news on Reddit, no filter, no bias, no secrets. So hopefully when news breaks out and r/politics or r/news is removing posts again our sub will show what they've been trying to suppress.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please join me in supporting this endeavor. We need numbers to make an impact.

       Were more of an r/politics and r/news competitor. Whole r/worldpolitics deals with international politics strictly, our sub will provide the same content but with more wide ranging topics from technology, to finance, to US news and current events, etc. that's the difference.

       World politics was created especially to counter the mod abuse in r/worldnews and r/politics and is not or never was limited to international politics or news. I remember quite well when it happened.

       I was just going by he name alone. It seemed like it was dedicated to specifically world politics. They can do their thing and we can do ours. There's countless subs for porn gifs. No one makes a fuss about that. It's all about what people want to sub to or read. Choices are good. So r/worldpolitics can do their thing, while we try to build and do our thing. Both can coexist and even help each other.

       r/altnewz was supposed to be exactly what you propose. It was busy  during the first few months but then the participation dropped. The mods took the banner down and it now looks like a neglected barely used sub. There is participation...but it became like many other hopeful alternatives, they kind of just fade after a while.

       Don't we already have a shitload of crappy wannabe r/news or wannabe r/uncensorednews all over the place? Like r/inthenews, r/betternews, r/truenews there are about a billion of them by now, and all of them were created with the same exact goal, at least until the owners bias or mod bias creeps in. Also any Alt-Right fuckhead is just going to argue that their racism/sexism/islamophobia/etc. is their freedom of speech and the next thing you know you're a "shill" "SJW" "Cuck" "Leftist""Libtard" etc. for not allowing it.

       So what's the road to heaven paved with? I never liked that phrase. It could also be paved with bad intentions. There's any number of paths someone can take regardless of intentions. We can't generalize the mistakes of others with the ambitions of others.

       Why isn't racism/sexism/islamophobia/etc "free" speech? Offensive ideas, ideas that are "wrong", speak for themselves and shouldn't be censored. If someone wants to deny the Holocaust happened, fine, good for them, because the same right that allows them to deny the Holocaust allows me to explain to them why they are wrong. By censoring "offensive" and racist ideas we force them underground and allow intolerance and hatred to breed behind the scenes. These ideas fester, they become like an infection, and the corruption spreads. By keeping them in the open, where the sun can shine on them, we insure the infection doesn't spread.

       You don't combat it. You just don't make it the focus. There will be views like that expressed by members, but not by the mod. It seems like most of r/uncensorednews stuff deals with Muslims doing bad things. Those posts are fine if they're true, but it won't be the core of this sub like it seems there.

       That's a good answer, just focus on the truth, including good solid sources, and limit bias and you'll already be ahead of the shittier news subs like r/uncensorednews and maybe even r/news.

       Hopefully, I'm tired of the hivemind in r/news and r/worldnews but the worse alternative is definitely places like r/uncensorednews and their racist hivemind mentality, I mean one of the mods told me I was a nigger and should hang in PMs, wonderful place there.

       Well, technically he WAS uncensored with his views toward you.. However that behavior is inappropriate for a mod. Won't happen here.

       That would be appreciated, yeah really shitty, I know I'm not always the easiest to deal with but all I was trying to do was point out that the story was fake but they couldn't be bothered because they are purposely pushing that kind of shit there.

       Yeah if a story is verified fake I'll remove it and make a post regarding what was removed, with the evidence given to me as to why it was removed, and what the facts really are. Complete transparency is the only way to do this.

       What are you stances on bias? I mean there can be a lot written to slant things Left/Right/Alt-Right. That gets a lot harder to enforce especially if certain users/mods believe in the bias slant that is being enforced in the article, I think that's why r/news has found itself in the predicament it found itself in now, the mods started letting their bias or their avoidance of certain topics creep in and now the sub is crap.

       Like all things we have to take what we see at face value. My goal is to set up a platform for free sharing of news stories, and leave it up to the community to decide what they accept. I won't let my personal biases lead to the removal of posts. We just hope the story is good enough to create discussion among the comments to provide a vocal narrative for or against the issue. If that's enough to make someone challenge what they're given and research on their own then the sub is working. We can't knowing everything as right or wrong. But whether we understand it or not and agree with it or not. If you aren't convinced hopefully you find the answers you're looking for and post them here for everyone to understand and agree/disagree with.

       I'm convinced, sign me up! Seriously though it sounds like you've been seeing the same things wrong with the other news subs that I have, hopefully you can build a big enough userbase that we can have something good going.

       This right here is the problem. You don't need to combat anything, simply ignore or downvote and move on. You don't feed the trolls, nor do you censor people's opinions simply because they don't follow your narrative, ignore, downvote, go on with your day. Unfortunately all Reddit is is a corporation that will bend over backwards for their master, or whoever has the deepest pockets.
