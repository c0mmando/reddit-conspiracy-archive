        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There was a committee hearing scheduled for Tuesday at 11am over the weekend. What happened to it? It&#39;s now missing from the official calendar. Anyone have any screenshots of it being there before? I tried using the Internet Archive, but it doesn&#39;t have any trawls after September 10th. It was definitely there, there was one on Tuesday and one on Wednesday. The one on Tuesday was specifically about the FBI.

    <div class="md"><p>I just called the Oversight Committee (the number is publicly available on their website) and spoke to a very nice lady on the phone.</p>

<p>According to her, the hearing has been postponed &quot;indefinitely&quot;.  She clarified that isn&#39;t to mean that it&#39;s being put off, but she told me specifically that some documents were delivered to them recently (most likely the Comey/FBI subpeona&#39;d documents) and had content in it that was causing them to look over it extremely thoroughly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take that as good news.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I talked to staffers with Rep. Gowdy as well, and they told me that the Judiciary Committee will be asking many of the questions that the Oversight Committee had been wanting to ask. Many key members of the Oversight Committee are also on the Judiciary Committee which will be having a hearing tomorrow at 9am, including Chairman Chaffetz and Rep. Gowdy.</p>
