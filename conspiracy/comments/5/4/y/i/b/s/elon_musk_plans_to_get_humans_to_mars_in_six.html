<p>I understand the guy, though. He&#39;s fooling gullible investors to make money for himself. Nothing wrong with that. I respect him. He&#39;s a smart man. But he&#39;ll never actually send anyone to Mars in his lifetime. </p>

<p>This requires that the theory of relativity be a working theory.  Sadly, this theory is not entirely true and does not work other than to cement Newtonian theories, which have also been proven to be false or tenuous arguments at best.  Also, this secret would require a destination, not simply luminous bodies that you cannot visit.</p>

<p>For various reasons, I do not believe the pictures that we have been shown are Earth in its entirety.  Additionally, experimentation does not seem to conclude without a doubt that the Earth is spinning, weaving and bobbing through &quot;space&quot;.  Auguste Piccard, the first person to travel miles into the atmosphere before NASA/Operation Paperclip said it was flat.  Perhaps Auguste was a liar but he did not have a reason to lie - or perhaps NASA is a liar.  I do not have solid, conclusive proof either way.  Therefore, I will suggest that my senses are correct:  the Earth does not move because I cannot feel it moving; the moon does not move either because I cannot see it moving.  I would rather take the lies of my own senses than believe the lies from &quot;experts&quot;.  I have no expectation of convincing you of anything or of converting you to anything.  You should examine the research, the evidence and the theories yourself; come to your own conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find the Newtonian explanation for the reason why the moon appears stationary (i.e. does not rotate) unsatisfactory.  If you want to believe that the diameter of the moon matches perfectly with its 27 day rotation, which coincides perfectly with the rotation of the Earth to make it appear stationary go right ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are being lied to, you should not take some lies as true and other lies as false when they come from the same lair.  Modern science is lying when it says we are all alone and this is all an accident.  How do I know they are lying?  Because of the perfection - perfection modern science tries to disregard as accident.  Now, I am not going to say, sure, modern science, I believe in evolution, I believe in the big bang, I believe in outer space and fantastical places when one or any of these ideas is an apparent lie.  Instead, I am going to throw it all out and go to a different barber, as it were.  You cannot really believe all of this bullshit they are feeding us without questioning it.  Once you start asking questions, you should see that these are mostly theories being passed off as fact.  To assume one is true, you must assume them all to be true; likewise, to assume one is false, you must assume them all to be false.</p>

It is not incumbent upon me to find a solution for the answer as to why this is not an accident; neither have I attempted to offer a reason.  Only, I have pointed out the obvious: that the proofs of modern science are inconclusive at best and blatant lies at worst.  Now, you can believe what modern science has to offer; I am not even trying to convince you otherwise, but I would suggest you make careful study.  Is there petrified wood on the moon?  Because that&#39;s what the &quot;spacemen&quot; brought back.  Are there million mile radio signals?  Because I have trouble getting TV reception and I&#39;m in line of sight of the tower.
