       This is why I find it so ridiculous that so many of those who watch Alex Jones support Donald Trump.  Two years ago--Jones was ranting about the corrupt nature of both parties...now he's all on board the Trump train!!!

       You are 100% correct.  Alex Jones was ranting on about this as he usually does about everything.

       what happened to alex jones being anti-tyranny and police state?  now his listeners are so scared of blacks and mexicans, they'll say anything to support "hero cops" including advocating for stop and frisk?  it's a creepy role reversal...

       i don't think it's necessarily the long con, but alex jones is heavily invested in the police state becoming a thing.  he's got a lot of money in gold, seeds, guns and canned foods.  race baiting and ushering in the police state validates what he's been saying for 2 decades.

       Boiled frogs. Have a lot of friends and family like this. Years ago, they touted the Constitution and its importance, crowed about love of country, but it's like they've forgotten everything they've ever known and claimed to believe in in their blind zeal to follow a Jabroni.

       I've been listening to Alex Jones (until recently) since 2007. I was a die-hard. Well, over the past couple of years something with Infowars changed. Actually, I'd say it went back to 2012. I've read rumors that he divorced his wife, etc. I don't give a shit about that but something changed. Regardless, he woke me up. Sad to see him and Infowars move in a different direction.

       We may have no choice after todays hearing with FBI director Comey.  He has pretty much sealed the deal that he's covering for Hillary this whole time. Hillary is out. But I doubt this will be the end of it. This is literally the biggest, widest scandal in our countries history and we just found the tip of the iceberg. The rest will go down in history.

       The mic drop ruined this. It was valid political speech until you got all arrogant and proud about it. Now, no one wants to listen to you. (Get rid of it; this isn't about you feeling right).

       Vote third party. If everyone who didn't vote instead made it a point and vote against the crooks, a third party candidate could actually have a good chance. In 1992, Ross Perot got
       <em>
        18.9%
       </em>
       of the popular vote! I imagine we have a far larger segment of people who consider themselves disgusted by the choices, the challenge is to get them educated and keep them from falling for the duopoly propaganda Trump and Clinton people are pushing.

       That's a planned strategy. In reality the opposite is true. Fact is the election is rigged, HRC will win. If HRC doesn't win the popular vote and still wins the election, it's going to rise questions. Those questions will lead to yet another investigation. You can just throw that investigations documents on top of the mountain of evidence already against her. The fact she is going to be president, when by all rights should be in federal prison is a testament to just how fucked the system is.

       Isn't Alex Jones supposed to be a member of some intelligence agency who came in to mess up with the truth movement?
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard that he refuses to talk about Jews either; That should be a dead giveaway since Jews (Or to be more exact talmud-worshipping luciferians since they are not limited to (But are mostly) khazars, they can impose themselves as anything else) run the oil of the world conspiracy. Anyone who does not talk about this tribe should be dead suspect for a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, the Alt Right i am sure is another major operation trying to discredit the truth movement and to pretend that this false opposition is the cure to the cultural and societal decay which is worshiped as a type of god by "SJWs", the "Red Guards" of the modern era.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Alt right:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Worships a specific politician as god (Politicians are most or all illuminati slaves and a politician running as the president should be dead giveaway)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Blames everything on "Muslims" "SJWs" or "Women" instead of the Illuminati/Zionist Luciferians/World Mafia trinity which controls the 3 groups above, and directly
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Does not have a solid concept of who should be going against; Is it the SJWs? It is women? Is it the muslims? Is it the Jews? Or is it Hillary? Or is it all of the above? Many of them fail to deliver this point and seem to wander from concept to concept without a solid goal. But it is for sure that they will not target Trump or the Illuminati/Zionist Luciferian/World Mafia trinity which is also a fatal giveaway.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       None of these traits make them, or make them look like legit opposition. They are more like a type of false opposition which is the chemo which pretends to be the cure of the cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       So right, the fact that opposition begins to propagandize for various politicians or presidential candidates should be a dead giveaway that they aren't real and are easily purchased.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the end times begin, expect opposition corruption to be more and more realistic and poisonous.

       You hit it here.  Most in the supposed 'truth' movement are really scared to just go straight at this with facts, historical evidence etc., which is all out there.

      <p>
       Even in the Talmud it talks about how everyone (except for them) is to be utilized for their gain.  Rather even it be for sexual exploitation as long as it benefits the Jew.  Also, in the Talmud and the Zohar there references to this very strange god that they give reverence too.

       It's a tough thing to learn but we all to learn it: in this system no president will ever improve the situation. I've been frustrated for months watching this sub fall for the lies of this system, that there's more than one side to it. It does feel great to feel vindicated, though.

       No one is organizing a mass movement. There's small groups of people expressing they won't vote but unless it's millions of people that represent a majority of Americans, it just hurts the process and one of them will end up getting into office.

       Yeah I agree, even though have a psycho-sociopath in office doesn't regardless if you voted or not.

       Exactly. It's gotta me a mass movement. Not just one or two people because then those are wasted votes. I mean, since the election is rigged they're all wasted votes but since no one is doing anything on a global scale to disrupt this system I rather make sure my wasted vote goes towards the candidate I think is less shitty.

       Already, 30-40% of the population don't vote. No one cares that they don't vote. If that 30-40% went out and REALLY said fuck you with a third party or coordinated write-in vote, tptb might be forced to pay attention.

       Then I'd have to agree with dejeneration and say that there should be a movement for people to write in or elect a third party candidate. An actual candidate. The two we have right now just aren't enough.
