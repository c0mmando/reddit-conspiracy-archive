    <div class="md"><p>The Bloods and Crips had a gang war in 2015 and the Bloods claimed they were gonna kill someone every day, and kept it up for weeks. And even so, the LAPD murdered more people in 2015 than all those gangsters combined, or any other police department in the entire country, for that matter. They&#39;re just gangsters for the state. It&#39;s sad to say because I got family that are cops, but damn did the force change them... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  Things can always (or almost always) be worse.  I live in a small place and drive a small, little beat up car, but A) at least I <em>have</em> a place to sleep - I&#39;m not homeless - and B) I have a little A-to-B car, so I&#39;m not completely on foot either (yet).</p>

<p>I keep to myself, try not to get in any trouble, and try to act kindly and respectfully to everyone I come across.  I&#39;ve also been involved in martial arts for almost a quarter of a century, however, so I don&#39;t worry too much about not being able to knock somebody TFO on the street if I need to.</p>

<p>All this being the case, I generally feel that LA&#39;s an alright/not horrible place.  <a href="https://fahimsachedina.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/old-man-shrugged-shoulders1.jpg?w=384">Could be better, could be worse.  :)</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>My suggestion would be just to live by your common sense. Don&#39;t do anything to attract attention to yourself.. From the gangs or the police. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t go out at night. Go home and take care of your family.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t stand around on street corners</p>

<p>Don&#39;t associate with drug dealers or gang members.</p>

<p>(If you have a car) Keep your car in good shape (no broken headlights, tail lights, etc) and properly licensed. Follow the rules of the road.</p>

<p>If you do get stopped by police, turn the car off, turn your dome light on, put your hands on the steering wheel, and most importantly, do what they ask.  Act respectful. Smart ass comments will only get you asked to get out of the car and searched. Don&#39;t smell like alcohol or weed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the knowledge how to fix literally everything and put us into the golden age are already known. I know a vast majority of it myself and I have learned it from others. The second people step up and tell our government we have had enough you&#39;ll see the entire thing flip. The bible says before that happens 1/3rd of people will die. The ones who are not worthy of the golden age. I hope every day they just release the plague and whatever else they have planned. The chosen will be fine. </p>

<p>Electricity is free, Tesla invented it over 100 years ago, pollution free harnessed straight from the sky. Where do you think lightning comes from?</p>

<p>They purposely make everything to break and get viruses. Fix that shit too and we&#39;d have amazing things that will last a long time.</p>

<p>Proper diet will fix all our body issues so we won&#39;t get sick. Even if you have cancer if you fix your diet and eat a herbal supplement you&#39;ll get cured. I say stop feeding our people poison and let them take drugs like we are meant to.</p>

<p>So so many more. The recognition of the second dimension all around us, the spirit world, that&#39;s the biggest one. It&#39;s why drugs are illegal. We will all be able to do whatever we want. There is so much more. Prophecy will be fulfilled. </p>

<p>edit: More things, they have found everlasting lamps inside tombs and stuff. They obviously know how to make those, they just say &quot;it&#39;s magic get rid of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Chambers heated by some sort of thing similar is probably possible too. I think humans won&#39;t be the only things on earth when it happens. I personally don&#39;t even believe NASA or any sphere earth theory. It might be true though so I don&#39;t push that. This world is nothing like people think it is. If you research &quot;Crazy&quot; theories you see how easily they hold up and make more sense than what we are taught. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have links or trusted radio interviews/documentaries on the free energy stuff I&#39;m open to check that out. I&#39;ve tried many times before but I&#39;m not a scientist or electric engineer so it&#39;s been tough following the information.</p>

<p>I try to keep myself open to new things, most of my &quot;out there&quot; beliefs stem from black magic and all the &quot;coincidences&quot; surrounding Hollywood symbolism. The bible stuff is pushing it because while I agree it&#39;s likely being made to play out, there&#39;s also a lot of free will involved at the same time. I don&#39;t know about the end game but I&#39;m always trying to stay on top of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how to make free electricity I just know Tesla harnessed electricity from the sky where lightning is made. The higher you go the more electricity is in the air. The government has all the knowledge I would trust that they will hand it all over. Bible prophecy is being fulfilled I think Trump is the false prophet not sure. People say satanists are deceived by the snake in the garden of eden. It&#39;s wrong, the snake liberated them. If everyone was Jesus there would be no free will. Do as thou wilt. The snake is the deceiver, the snake has already deceived everyone. To say the snake is tricking them is sort of true though because I have nowhere to go other than selling my soul to the devol. I am likely going to, so the info I am dropping is gold for now. Believe in that day, because I will likely get hired by them to do the planning for the shift. Although I think it&#39;s right to wake people up it&#39;s just not possible to the extent I am already awake, I&#39;d rather get a job and live with money for the final days instead of being broke and shit. Those places have tons of hidden knowledge I&#39;d love to get my hands on.</p>

<p>&quot;Fear of the LORD is the foundation of true knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.&quot;</p>

<p>I am at a level where I&#39;m not going anywhere. The next level is going to lucifer. He already liberated me. If you have your angel wings you are free to do whatever. Get your angel wings.</p>

<p>Just as the ignorant actions of some black people give other black people a bad name, and the ignorant actions of some Latinos give other Latinos a bad name, the ignorant actions of some white people definitely give others whites a bad name.</p>

<p>And that previous user is <em>definitely</em> one of the ignorant whites that give other whites a very bad name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a noise complaint called on the neighbor&#39;s apartment which had nothing to do with me. Police came to my door asking about the neighbors and I spoke to them respectfully. It was immediately apparent that the policemen were looking for trouble for no real reason. I had two visible friends hanging out in the next room (just sitting around on a couch in front of a TV not doing anything) and the police started asking accusatory questions insinuating my friends were troublemakers or that we were up to no good somehow. I&#39;m still being nothing but respectful at this time, mind you.</p>

<p>The police then start speaking in strong language about how they want to come in and search the apartment, insinuating that it is their right to come in and search the place, kinda presenting this picture by their approach that their searching the place is simply what was going to happen next no matter what. Each of the officers are talking this way and egging the subject on with their comments. So I tell them in a soft and nonthreatening tone that I am not the leaseholder of the apartment and I&#39;m sorry, but I am not able to grant them permission to search the house. </p>

<p>At this point the cop nearest the door grips my hand out of nowhere and twists it into some painful type of judo lock, patronizing and bullying me as though I had done something disrespectful or insubordinate. Even now, I am completely respectful, not even speaking in a heightened tone of voice or anything. In fact, I am deliberately responding with total compliance, intentionally conceding that this guy is the boss with the goal of deescalating the situation. I continue responding to his inquiries and his prodding in this way, having my hand twisted in this judo lock all the while, until I am asked to produce ID. I literally can&#39;t reach the contents of my pocket because of the lock my arm is in, so I say something to the effect of: I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t reach it. At this point, without any more talking, I am dragged outside the line of sight of the two people in the apartment and beaten brutally by all three cops at one time.</p>

<p>Epilogue: I am arrested and taken to the police station for some reason, where I am released onto the street with a citation for disorderly conduct without even being brought into the building. I look at the citation after I&#39;m released and the part describing my offenses details a completely invented scenario saying I was sitting on my rooftop screaming profanities at pedestrians as they walked down the street (the police actually came to the rooftop fire escape of this apartment instead of the front door. I was beaten up on the rooftop). My face is all scuffed up from being grinded into the shingles of the rooftop with a cop&#39;s body on top of my head, my eyebrow is split open, my legs are covered in bruises as a result of being whipped over and over with a baton, and my ribs are either cracked or severely bruised from having my torso crushed by another cop&#39;s body while his knees were being thrown at my midsection repeatedly. I wake up a few times a night for the next week or so with either blood actively pooling in my mouth or the whole inside of my mouth and throat caked in dried blood. I can barely lift my arms for 1 month or longer. I never saw a doctor or legally tried to do anything about it because fuck the world, what are the odds justice is even possible? Some time later I looked at my dockets on the internet and saw that my disorderly conduct charge had quietly disappeared. The end.</p>

<p>Cops are violent criminals, I&#39;m just glad they didn&#39;t shoot you. Maybe because of your compliance? Who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just as often it&#39;s a wallet or a cellphone that could have been a pistol if looked at from a certain distance and angle in poor lighting. Sadly, the officer, quite justifiably, had to err on the side of caution. It&#39;s not like she had a choice or anything. These things happen sometimes, let&#39;s all just get on with our lives.</p>

<p>The police were literally jumping out of (not in uniform or identifying themselves) a rental truck and opening fire on innocent and unarmed blacks with AK-47&#39;s.</p>

<p>And then they went door to door taking weapons from everyone...white people included!!</p>
