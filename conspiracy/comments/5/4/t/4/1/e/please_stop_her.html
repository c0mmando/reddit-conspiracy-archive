       I live in sweden, and the hillary brainwash here is insane. I can't even talk about it with my wife. Really losing it. Even my closest friends who otherwise are up for conspiracy talk look at me a little uncomfortable when I bring it up. It's like being in the closet, but no one but me wants to step out.

       I can't imagine what Trump would do as potus but I do know that clinton would drag us to a third world war.

       Let your fellow countrymen know that the United States of America no longer belongs to its citizens and is now completely controlled by a small, evil group at the top of its financial ladder. Whatever comes henceforth is no action represented by the countries people, but by the invisible hand above, and the President we are being given was not at all the peoples choice.

       at this point, its starting to look "too late." the numbers aren't on our side yet. the mass majority is still asleep. a small handful of pump shottys and "assault" rifles means slim to none against a fleet of mraps and drones. truth is, we never had a chance. they rigged this game a long time ago

       I think it's rigged both sides, and South Park hit the nail on the head of Trump seeming to want to throw the election so I think the puppeteers and maybe by Hillary's demand will force the eviler of the two evils upon us still. But not even rifles or shottys but a handgun across the street from a gangbanger that already knows he has no life to due us all a favor

       It is the same in Denmark - Despair not my friend, it is not you that is going crazy, it is the going crazy world! The journalists and opinion makers are Astroturfing the corporate message, favoring their own candidate and demonizing any alternatives. The masses has been bashed into submission, most are woefully misinformed, ignorant and turned into moral cowards. Clinton is unbelievably corrupt, inept and is utterly unfit to serve as USA president.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't support any of the candidates, they are both bad, but Hillary is worse than Trump. The whole charade is fake, fake, fake, staged from start to end! I couldn't care less if my neighbor farted in his bedroom.

       Sorry. Nothing we can do. Hillary is the next president. Trump is just in it for fame and the money he will make from the alt right consumer base he has created. Hillary didn't have Bill getting people on international election boards, and have the DNC rig the primaries to lose. Her friend and former donor Trump isn't the other party's candidate against their own wants for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump had to be the other party candidate because Hillary is so disliked and corrupt that she had to have someone that would act insane and would be hated and play the part in order to scare voters her way. The election is rigged for her, but still have to scare votes her way so people can buy that she was elected and won't question it out of fear of the alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we can do is vote third party and hope we can get out of this two party system. Blame the people who have been voting the lesser of two evil forever. Your wife and friends won't understand that Hillary is actually very much disliked. That's why Trump is the only person she would have a chance of beating.

       She will continue the wars, she may take that final step towards Iran, it will provoke Russia.

       who do we suspect among the 3rd party candidates to get the most votes?  the best strategy as I see it is to all mass to one of them regardless of policy discrepancies so that the numbers will speak for themselves most noticeably.

       Well Johnson. I think this year 3rd could get as high as 20% 25 for Lib and Green.
I don't know if they would ever admit that, but I expect high numbers.

       Why should we be outraged over just one of these scapegoats.  They've got scapegoats for everyone.  And trust me.  They will get you to hate one of them so much that you will vote for the other one.  You've been corralled and they can go home and count their fat stacks.  I kid, they have people do that.

       I completely relate to this. I have to stay silent now. Even my wife - who was a hardcore Bernie supporter - has fallen for the fear tactics. I only know one friend that's still as outraged as I am about the election fraud and he's looked at as insane by everyone around him. I feel like I'm living in an alternate reality.

       Lets be honest though. Sweden's current problems are a direct result of NATO's invasion of the middle east. The cabal is destabilizing the entire world right now.  This election is simply a charade to bring absolute chaos to America. Alinksy's order out of chaos is being played out across the globe. People joke about the NWO but it's happening as we speak.

       I honestly dont know. When i go to work every day i look around me and realize everyone is completely oblivious.
      </p>
      <p>
       If i talk about it around people its like a record skips and everyone stares at me with this "You're a lunatic" look on their face. I could say something as simple and factual as "So NATO just bombed a Syrian base allowing for the advancement of ISIS forces" And people will say "Ease up on the crazy pills there bud, did you see the football game last night???" So needless to say i have become sort of hopeless. There are a few people i have got thinking a bit and it was not from directly talking to them. It was from merely mentioning stuff over a long period. Sort of talking to myself about things i read on my phone making sure others hear what i say. When you do this you spark their curiosity. Best case scenario people ask questions to further the discussion. Worste case scenario people ignore you and talk about sports. The latter happens more often. I usually get a "Wow you are really into that conspiracy theory stuff there arent you pal?" Meanwhile it's no fucking theory anymore lol. But i find it very hard to get people to open their eyes and see the direction we are going.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record i am not even American. I am from Canada. I honestly have no idea what is in store for us up here in the north. I can only assume a lot of the same mess America will suffer.

       Yes prepare for that to continue. God opened your eyes wake up to the higher power. Spirituality is what you're into you just don't see it yet. I had a massive debate with you over "mind over matter" go into spirituality. You are obviously already very advanced. Stop talking about it to strangers though I already did that enough to know it's fucking pointless. Figure out the end for yourself and when the day comes teach them all. Until they come to you though they'll never listen. It will lower their quality of life because they don't have the sufficient spirituality. The entire world is a spiritual war zone. You have won if you have figured all of this out. Evolved souls who have lived for a long time have a harder time with the world on purpose because evolved souls need a harder challenge. Likely our parents in the golden age had a very low level of spirituality and did not learn much of anything. When the world pushes you down and you keep rising above it that's when you're the master. If you keep rising you get finished school and into the work force and you realize it's a fucking joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       People won't wake up. They really won't. Unless the power goes out completely and war ensues and they want to know what happened, then you can tell them and they will finally listen. Even when they do want to listen they can't. Imagine the information you were told over the years. I never put it together or anything I never understood until one day. Same with them, their day hasn't come yet.

       Well idk. Like i said I've reached a few people. You are spot on about older folks. They are completely gone. The only ones i appear to be able to reach are the younger minds. Older folks, specifically baby boomers are lost in a sea of brainwash and indoctrination. I wont even attempt with them. But im tellin ya, the younger folks are a lot more open minded. You just have to ease them into it and force them to ask questions.

       Yea exactly I find it's a big division. I said "economics are a joke" one time at a party and this guy went 0-100 on me real quick LOL. I still remember what he said "I learned about economics in college GRR" lmfao. A lot of kids will wake up, a lot of others are too indoctrinated. :)

       You mean well, but this is utter BS and is a huge part of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never, ever shut up about this stuff. Scream it from the rooftops. It isn't about spirituality. If you aren't slowly but constantly waking people up, whether it be online or the people around you, you are not doing your job. If posting as some pseudo-sage on the Internet is enough for you to be satisfied, all the power to you. But don't go around encouraging people into inaction and infecting others with your lack of hope.

       I'm with you on this. Agree that you don't win, it can be attributed to getting blood out of a stone. People in general don't want to accept the truth, and will fight it in order for them to keep that disillusioned veil over their eyes. It is as you said a spiritual path we walk, to rise above and transcend this realm.

       Agreed, once you acquire enough spiritual knowledge you really couldn't care what other people have to say anyway. I have seen the world as Gods side/Devil side, that's really the only division there is, Devil is winning hard right now but there's nothing wrong with that I guess, you have a short amount of time now though. No one knows the day or the hour. Take psychedelics.

       Spirituality is the key. Religion is it's poison. Good knowledge comes from the Quran and from the bible and others. Don't obey it as religion though. Times were different back then and today it's a white wash. If we all took Jesus' path we'd lose our free will. The snake has opened my eyes and I've eaten from the tree.

       You don't know what the man who has already been telling countries that they should invade others and telling other countries he will force them to pay for a border wall will do? I would think in Sweden you'd be more concerned with being told that your country is forever changed and can't go back due to unchecked immigration.

       I mean, Trump would must likely bring us into a third world war too... he pledged our military to Israel (as is tradition with Zionist leaders in America) and he maintains that blasting an Iranian ship out of the Persian Gulf because sailors on that ship made "rude gestures" at one of our ships wouldn't actually start a war (even though Iran has been intentionally trying to goad us into provoking a war for a while now.. they just need us to fire the first shot).  I dunno if it's ignorance on Trump's behalf or if he knows what he'd be doing but counts on his supporters to be ignorant.  Israel wants us at war with Iran and Trump is saying he's willing to order our navy to fire on Iranian ships in the Persian Gulf for making obscene hand gestures at us... it sure sounds like he's looking for a war with Iran to me.

       Trump? That guys as unstable as a 13 year old going through puberty when it comes to power plays, taking offense and being a vindictive little punk.

       at this point, its starting to look "too late." the numbers aren't on our side yet. the mass majority is still asleep. a small handful of pump shottys and "assault" rifles means slim to none against a fleet of mraps and drones. truth is, we never had a chance. they rigged this game a long time ago

       I think it's rigged both sides, and South Park hit the nail on the head of Trump seeming to want to throw the election so I think the puppeteers and maybe by Hillary's demand will force the eviler of the two evils upon us still. But not even rifles or shottys but a handgun across the street from a gangbanger that already knows he has no life to due us all a favor

       Agreed, once you acquire enough spiritual knowledge you really couldn't care what other people have to say anyway. I have seen the world as Gods side/Devil side, that's really the only division there is, Devil is winning hard right now but there's nothing wrong with that I guess, you have a short amount of time now though. No one knows the day or the hour. Take psychedelics.

       Typical socialist response. "Our problems are someone else's fault". Sweden's foreign and domestic policies are causing your problems. EU policies are causing your problems. America didn't create the social welfare shithole you've found yourself in.

       You blame the foreign vagrants battering the door, and those who made them vagrants; but what about the Swedes who opened it for them. Who should hang first?
