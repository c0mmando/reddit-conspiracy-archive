    <div class="md"><p>It is the same in Denmark - Despair not my friend, it is not you that is going crazy, it is the going crazy world! The journalists and opinion makers are Astroturfing the corporate message, favoring their own candidate and demonizing any alternatives. The masses has been bashed into submission, most are woefully misinformed, ignorant and turned into moral cowards. Clinton is unbelievably corrupt, inept and is utterly unfit to serve as USA president.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t support any of the candidates, they are both bad, but Hillary is worse than Trump. The whole charade is fake, fake, fake, staged from start to end! I couldn&#39;t care less if my neighbor farted in his bedroom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry. Nothing we can do. Hillary is the next president. Trump is just in it for fame and the money he will make from the alt right consumer base he has created. Hillary didn&#39;t have Bill getting people on international election boards, and have the DNC rig the primaries to lose. Her friend and former donor Trump isn&#39;t the other party&#39;s candidate against their own wants for no reason.</p>

<p>Trump had to be the other party candidate because Hillary is so disliked and corrupt that she had to have someone that would act insane and would be hated and play the part in order to scare voters her way. The election is rigged for her, but still have to scare votes her way so people can buy that she was elected and won&#39;t question it out of fear of the alternative.</p>

<p>All we can do is vote third party and hope we can get out of this two party system. Blame the people who have been voting the lesser of two evil forever. Your wife and friends won&#39;t understand that Hillary is actually very much disliked. That&#39;s why Trump is the only person she would have a chance of beating.</p>

<p>She will continue the wars, she may take that final step towards Iran, it will provoke Russia. </p>

<p>Sorry, don&#39;t hold it against all of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely relate to this. I have to stay silent now. Even my wife - who was a hardcore Bernie supporter - has fallen for the fear tactics. I only know one friend that&#39;s still as outraged as I am about the election fraud and he&#39;s looked at as insane by everyone around him. I feel like I&#39;m living in an alternate reality.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh and god forbid you mention she who shan&#39;t be name - Jill Stein. Then people look at you like you&#39;ve stomped a bag full of puppies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly dont know. When i go to work every day i look around me and realize everyone is completely oblivious. </p>

<p>If i talk about it around people its like a record skips and everyone stares at me with this &quot;You&#39;re a lunatic&quot; look on their face. I could say something as simple and factual as &quot;So NATO just bombed a Syrian base allowing for the advancement of ISIS forces&quot; And people will say &quot;Ease up on the crazy pills there bud, did you see the football game last night???&quot; So needless to say i have become sort of hopeless. There are a few people i have got thinking a bit and it was not from directly talking to them. It was from merely mentioning stuff over a long period. Sort of talking to myself about things i read on my phone making sure others hear what i say. When you do this you spark their curiosity. Best case scenario people ask questions to further the discussion. Worste case scenario people ignore you and talk about sports. The latter happens more often. I usually get a &quot;Wow you are really into that conspiracy theory stuff there arent you pal?&quot; Meanwhile it&#39;s no fucking theory anymore lol. But i find it very hard to get people to open their eyes and see the direction we are going.</p>

<p>For the record i am not even American. I am from Canada. I honestly have no idea what is in store for us up here in the north. I can only assume a lot of the same mess America will suffer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes prepare for that to continue. God opened your eyes wake up to the higher power. Spirituality is what you&#39;re into you just don&#39;t see it yet. I had a massive debate with you over &quot;mind over matter&quot; go into spirituality. You are obviously already very advanced. Stop talking about it to strangers though I already did that enough to know it&#39;s fucking pointless. Figure out the end for yourself and when the day comes teach them all. Until they come to you though they&#39;ll never listen. It will lower their quality of life because they don&#39;t have the sufficient spirituality. The entire world is a spiritual war zone. You have won if you have figured all of this out. Evolved souls who have lived for a long time have a harder time with the world on purpose because evolved souls need a harder challenge. Likely our parents in the golden age had a very low level of spirituality and did not learn much of anything. When the world pushes you down and you keep rising above it that&#39;s when you&#39;re the master. If you keep rising you get finished school and into the work force and you realize it&#39;s a fucking joke.</p>

<p>People won&#39;t wake up. They really won&#39;t. Unless the power goes out completely and war ensues and they want to know what happened, then you can tell them and they will finally listen. Even when they do want to listen they can&#39;t. Imagine the information you were told over the years. I never put it together or anything I never understood until one day. Same with them, their day hasn&#39;t come yet.</p>

The only ones i appear to be able to reach are the younger minds. Older folks, specifically baby boomers are lost in a sea of brainwash and indoctrination. I wont even attempt with them. But im tellin ya, the younger folks are a lot more open minded. You just have to ease them into it and force them to ask questions.</p>

<p>Never, ever shut up about this stuff. Scream it from the rooftops. It isn&#39;t about spirituality.

I dunno if it&#39;s ignorance on Trump&#39;s behalf or if he knows what he&#39;d be doing but counts on his supporters to be ignorant.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, once you acquire enough spiritual knowledge you really couldn&#39;t care what other people have to say anyway. I have seen the world as Gods side/Devil side, that&#39;s really the only division there is, Devil is winning hard right now but there&#39;s nothing wrong with that I guess, you have a short amount of time now though. No one knows the day or the hour. Take psychedelics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical socialist response. &quot;Our problems are someone else&#39;s fault&quot;. Sweden&#39;s foreign and domestic policies are causing your problems.
