    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       So I was reading a frontpage thread, which brought up the subject:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/54rdib/youre_americans/d84meev">
         https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/54rdib/youre_americans/d84meev
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And I heard the known story that the CIA's MKUltra was to blame for what happened to Ted at Harvard. However, now there is a new story (which is seemingly being promoted as if it had always been the truth) that the experimenter Henry Murray acted alone. You look at the comments in that thread trying to rewrite the narrative, and go to the wiki article and there's no mention:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#Notable_subjects">
         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#Notable_subjects
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       However you google it and there are plenty of mentions, including this reddit thread that links to that very same wiki article from 2 years ago...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/284jcb/theodore_kaczynski_also_known_as_the_unabomber/">
         https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/284jcb/theodore_kaczynski_also_known_as_the_unabomber/
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So let's use waybackmachine to see what that very same wiki page looked like in, let's say, 2012:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120704072137/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#Notable_subjects">
         https://web.archive.org/web/20120704072137/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#Notable_subjects
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       What's this? A new section of text exists on the old version. It says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A considerable amount of credible circumstantial evidence suggests that Theodore Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, participated in CIA-sponsored MKUltra experiments conducted at Harvard University from the fall of 1959 through the spring of 1962.[69] During World War II, Henry Murray, the lead researcher in the Harvard experiments, served with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was a forerunner of the CIA. Murray applied for a grant funded by the United States Navy, and his Harvard stress experiments strongly resembled those run by the OSS.[69]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So the organization that came before the CIA, the OSS, was the one who did this experiment. Murray worked for them, copied their experimental design, and then later they changed from the OSS to the CIA as a rebranding in 1945 after the war ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference [69] comes from this source:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/06/harvard-and-the-making-of-the-unabomber/378239/">
         http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/06/harvard-and-the-making-of-the-unabomber/378239/
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Which quotes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Murray saw understanding the dyad, it seems, as a practical tool in the service of the great crusade in both its hot and cold phases. (He had long shown interest, for example, in the whole subject of brainwashing.) During the war Murray served in the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, helping to develop psychological screening tests for applicants and (according to Timothy Leary) monitoring military experiments on brainwashing. In his book (1979), John Marks reported that General "Wild Bill" Donovan, the OSS director, "called in Harvard psychology professor Henry 'Harry' Murray" to devise a system for testing the suitability of applicants to the OSS. Murray and his colleagues "put together an assessment system ... [that] tested a recruit's ability to stand up under pressure, to be a leader, to hold liquor, to lie skillfully, and to read a person's character by the nature of his clothing.... Murray's system became a fixture in the OSS."
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the tests that Murray devised for the OSS was intended to determine how well applicants withstood interrogations.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So it seems this bit of information is being scrubbed from the internet, and judging by that thread, a new narrative is purposefully being built in its place, partially using reddit forums, that the CIA had nothing to do with it and that it was the Murray guy was acting alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a PR move on behalf of the CIA, but they have access to a lot more resources to manipulate the media landscape than a normal company does.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people are seriously trying to say that the CIA had nothing to do with the Unibomber. They are literally trying to rewrite history for good PR. This is a real conspiracy.

       Yeah I was digging deeper, and I had to do a wayback machine check on theatlantic article archived from 2000 to ensure it hasn't been messed with. I bet they want that article taken down, but it's on theatlantic's servers. Also they apparently haven't cracked waybackmachine, which is another thing keeping the internet honest. I hope that never goes bankrupt or gets compromised... hopefully redundant waybackmachine-like websites arise as well, so the real information can be kept alive without interference.

        As soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of The Times had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead.

Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record.

       Yes.  And it was a pic of him learning (or posing for the camera) how to shoot an AK.  I've searched high and low looking for the photo. It was sometime in the 80s.  MAYBE early 90s.

       Trazadone is commonly prescribed as a sleep aid, but it's classification is technically an antidepressant. I don't think I said it was an anti-psychotic, I mentioned antipsychotics when referencing conversations we were having here - antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-epileptics, and benzodiazepines can cause psychosis in some patients when overdosed or withdrawn from.

       Trazodone is used for a sleep aid, but it's really an anti depressant. Seroquel is also used for sleep but is really an anti psychotic. I took both for years too. Thought everyone who took it knew this.. That's not a bad thing either, but I'd suggest looking into the medication you are being subscribed and side effects they can cause. Remember, medication is all trial and error. The brain is a highly complicated thing, certain chemicals work for some people that don't work on others.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my medication history I've been given things that are completely out of whack, but I trusted the doctor simply because he was a doctor. I'm not saying don't trust doctors, but so your own research and sometimes a second opinion isn't all that bad. I haven't taken medication in about a year and smoking marijuana.
      </p>
      <p>
       I no longer struggle with myself like I had been doing the last 25 or so years being medicated. To give you an example, at one point in time I was taking 50+ medication in about a years time. I didn't take them all at the same time, but they just kept switching between medication, because either bad side effects ranging from double vision to black out violence or it simply wouldn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said be careful friend and I wish you the best with your medication.

        Murray saw understanding the dyad, it seems, as a practical tool in the service of the great crusade in both its hot and cold phases. (He had long shown interest, for example, in the whole subject of brainwashing.) During the war Murray served in the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, helping to develop psychological screening tests for applicants and (according to Timothy Leary) monitoring military experiments on brainwashing. In his book (1979), John Marks reported that General "Wild Bill" Donovan, the OSS director, "called in Harvard psychology professor Henry 'Harry' Murray" to devise a system for testing the suitability of applicants to the OSS. Murray and his colleagues "put together an assessment system ... [that] tested a recruit's ability to stand up under pressure, to be a leader, to hold liquor, to lie skillfully, and to read a person's character by the nature of his clothing.... Murray's system became a fixture in the OSS."
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the tests that Murray devised for the OSS was intended to determine how well applicants withstood interrogations.

       Any possible way we might be able to get an AMA or possibly a few video or audio chats with these nice folks? I'd sure love to hear those conversations. I'm quite intrigued by Ted and his views. Would be cool to hear what the people who hung around him thought of him.. positive or negative.

       They're basically employing the tactics they learned from these experiments through various movements.  4chan is essentially one of the many "laboratories" for this stage of the experiment (large scale), as they're basically hoping to radicalize an entire generation of young men to do the things Kaczynski did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The extent to which the CIA has already revealed and rolled out this stage of the plan says to me that they are acting with a sense of desperation or at the very least urgency, because it just doesn't seem fully baked yet.

       Yeah this is the type of plan that might work for a while, but eventually people are going to tie it back to them and it's going to self-destruct. They're getting too pushy, and when that happens the charade becomes too obvious, just look at the media these days. However it could be a plan to make everyone distrust the existing establishment so they can install a new one, but I kind of doubt that since they seem to have so much control already and who would want their existing empire to be destabilized? They may be trying to reduce the damage or guide the fall/revolution, as the CIA has overseen the overthrow of 53 governments since the end of WW2. They're prepared for whatever comes, but the question is will they be able to keep themselves in check or will they push too hard and shoot themselves in the foot because everyone figures it out? If the pot boils to fast, the frogs may jump out. We will have to see... but the history of organizations like this is they inevitably over-reach until the blowback eventually crushes them.

       But will people actually wake up? I'm becoming more and more convinced that people
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to be led. They don't want to awaken. They'd rather be part of an experiment like whatever creepy experiment is happening in our midst because then they're at least a part of

       I think about 10% of people actually want to wake up ASAP. I think there's about 50% who will want to wake up depending on how bad their circumstances are, they begin wondering why. So as the economy gets worse, these people will begin to question things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's about 25% of people who will literally always believe anything that is told to them by anyone in a position of authority and will actively fight you if you try and burst that bubble
      </p>
      <p>
       So really just keep focusing on making info available for people who might be in that top 10% or 50%, and if it doesn't work then just move on. Spreading info is always useful, but it becomes extra useful when people get economically desperate and start wondering what is actually going on in this world, so that we may begin to fix it.

       I feel down about it sometimes too, but it is what it is. The only reason we feel disappointed in it is because our expectations are too high. This is just a giant rock with a bunch of chemical reactions happening on it, don't think it necessarily has to have some overriding morality or framework to it despite what we were told as children. Whatever
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       happen, can happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans always push back when too many get pushed too far, it's a story as old as time. This system has a certain balance, and it appears pretty sick in a lot of ways, but it works and history shows us that. Information and focus is the key of our day, the reins of culture have to be taken back in to the hands of the people. Every step each micro-culture takes towards focusing on the truth is one ripple that will have repercussions for hundreds of years. This is incredible power, and TPTB wouldn't have to go to all this effort if they weren't genuinely challenged by the public; they're always operating on the border of what they can get away with, but no farther or else they know it can ruin them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over time these boundaries get lost sight of because they're not acted on, but they're still there, and we all know it. I have no doubt there are many on our side who simply lack the courage to speak out, but are waiting for the right moment to do or say anything and have made up their mind on the issue. There is this silent resistance, and it is not small. When the moment is right, humanity will improve this unsustainable political-economic-social pattern we are currently caught in, I have no doubts in my mind. This situation we are in cannot go on forever, it is simply not stable. I have no doubt humanity will settle in to a more sustainable pattern at some point in the future, just out of sheer necessity. Takes a while for 7 billion people to get on the same page about anything though, but the internet has made more worldwide communication happen in the last 20 years than happened in the last 20000. This is humanity's chance to blow the lid off this whole thing. This is a bright moment, a real opportunity in human history for a pivot point, despite all the terrible shit that is happening and will happen. I get a lot of joy out of being able to contribute to that, even if just by a small reddit post.

       Don't worry about what other people want when it comes to "waking up".  When you worry about what other people want, what you're really doing is wanting something from other people's wants.  That means your wants are inherently tied to their wants.  You're now interlocked with the desires of those around you who you cannot get to agree with you.

       I'm going to make a statement that can be a joke to you if you'd like, or something much more somber and real depending on whether or not you'd be okay with that:
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA (as a part of something much larger) has yet to win the war over
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Aakra_%28Buddhism%29">
        Sakka and the
        <em>
         five
        </em>
        heavenly kingdoms
       </a>
       (there was an alleged former-contractor-tells-all hoax wherein the interviewee mentioned
       <em>
        Quintopia
       </em>
       as the name for the "world" parallel to our own... this was a smattering of wildly significant truth mixed in with a number of misleading falsehoods) and, while they have successfully managed to hold the world hostage, Samson Option style, by acquiring nukes
       <em>
        and threatening to destroy the entire populace
       </em>
       if said neighbors attempt to make any meaningful contact with a large segment of the population, they have yet to exact complete control over us, and they are losing their grip.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA is being led and influenced by those from the "other realm" inasmuch as the CIA has come to arm, "lead" and setup these various rebel groups for the purposes of destabilization in various governments (in this case, on a global scale).  The United States is essentially ISIS in that the US has been armed by these "space gangsters" (still funny either way) in order so that we might, through violence and attachment to ignorance, bring about a chaotic state in the world suitable enough for these beings to come in and fully take control (a "new world order").  We aren't playing ball to the degree that they'd like, in the same way that Syria isn't going exactly as planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are basically power-usurpers attempting to get as much power as possible.  It's a motivation as ancient as history itself, but the weapons and tactics of war are constantly changing.  No one wants to think that
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81ga">
        Naga
       </a>
       could be involved because shape-shifting is incredibly morale breaking when you realize the opposition
       <em>
        might actually
       </em>
       have access to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just gopher holes in the yard because the
       <em>
        white rabbit
       </em>
       hasn't even made his appearance yet...
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this can all be a bad joke if you'd like to interpret it that way as well.  Or I can tell you more.

       If you mean in the buddhist sense, then that's a clever answer but not really what I was getting at. Who do you think would be the human front through which all this funding/arming would be happening? That's really what I'm asking of your theory

       Wasn't trying to be clever but maybe that was a happy accident.  You asked me who I thought the

       human organization on the earth was, and I was answering in earnest.

       Highest implies that they aren't equally peered in terms of simply being a still viable bridge for the exacting of further plans, given that the ultimate path to power requires a multifaceted approach.

       Leveraging the enemy's technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time of a full scale invasion, when complete domination and control is the concern and, not merely an acquisition of surrender from the enemy, every single node (person) would be a point of concern.  Every
       <strong>
        traceable
       </strong>
       individual would be quickly and readily located.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leveraging existing human technology, how can you perceive one would easily track the location of as many individuals as possible, as quickly as possible, keeping in mind that during a full scale invasion, many of them would begin to flee and scatter for less populated areas almost immediately?

       Okay so you think aliens are going to use cell phones to track people in a project bluebeam sort of situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, back to my main question, who are the aliens using on earth to interface with humanity? Just a bunch of disparate groups? So you're alleging several intelligence groups around the world have had alien contact? When do you think they made contact, like 100 years ago or like 10k years ago? I'm not very sold on the "aliens controlling humanity" thing, tbh, I don't think we've made contact yet but I could be wrong

       I'm finding your response a bit pushy with an existing viewpoint, which is okay but presently unworkable, so take a step back for a moment.  You're going to have to be patient enough to let go of your existing, heavy terms and these concepts before you're able to move from a difficult position to get away from, because if we aren't going to be sharing the same language it's going to be very hard to be on the same page.

       The problem is, this sort of a mindset makes magic almost inaccessible.  In the words of Helena Blavatsky:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Besides, there are many good reasons why the study of magic, except in its broad philosophy, is nearly impracticable in Europe and America. Magic being what it is, the most difficult of all sciences to learn experimentally --
        <strong>
         its acquisition is, practically, beyond the reach of the majority of white-skinned people;
        </strong>
        and that, whether their effort is made at home or in the East. Probably not more than one man in a million of European blood is fitted -- either physically, morally, or psychologically -- to become a practical magician, and not one in ten millions would be found endowed with all these three qualifications as required for the work. Unlike other sciences, a theoretical knowledge of formulae without mental capacities or soul powers, is utterly useless in magic. The spirit must hold in complete subjection the combativeness of what is loosely termed educated reason, until facts have vanquished cold human sophistry."
       </p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They wanted it all.  They wanted access to earthly power, but they wanted magic along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why not try to open the door to heaven and
       <em>
        go get that magic ourselves
       </em>
       ?!  That's their way of thinking.  That's how a power-hungry being thinks.  When it comes to know about magic, essentially a level of power previously undiscovered and unknown by the majority, it becomes preoccupied with its acquisition.  It wants more.

       I don't think 4chan is a place for radicalization. They like things they can control from top to bottom and 4chan is notoriously libertarian-anarchist. Sure there are neo-nazis on /pol/ but there's no evidence of them actually doing anything in the real world. Only thing I can think of is school shooters who post on there the night before as a warning to their 'friends'.

       The important point is that they performed these initial experiments
       <em>
        looking for a specific subset of individual
       </em>
       where these tactics were especially effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, they already knew roughly what they wanted to do (make someone flip out), they just wanted to figure out who the best people would be to do it to (intellectual loners) and then find key points of exposure for those vulnerable people to become radicalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of what people say on the chans tends to be fabricated for the sake of amusement, but there are enough individuals out there who take what they say seriously enough to actually start
       <em>
        believing
       </em>
       a lot of the jokes and memes are real views and real things.  It's like why a site like godlikeproductions (alt discussion with military roots) pushes the schizo angle more heavily, because they're working with a larger potentially schizophrenic subset of users.  The horror of the situation is that the school shooters are basically the
       <em>
        intended effect
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Each zone is essentially being broadcast with a different channel of propaganda most fitting for the users in that channel to bring about maximum chaos for that group.  Free discussion is unfortunately being relegated to darker and deeper sections of the web, so you're seeing the efforts being pushed there more significantly than in the past because they're trying to cover everyone, but they're having a hard time making it stick with this particular group.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL,DR:
       </strong>
       Radicalization is taking place wherever it can, for the purposes of
       <em>
        making things as radical as possible.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, not in the ninja turtle sort of way.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>
       the difference between isolating someone like Kaczynski and trying to radicalize people in an online group context like 4chan, is that Ted didn't have a group of people to rely on to call the experimenter a "kike shill" immediately upon recognizing the psyop attempt.  I have to think that sent them back to the drawing board, a bit, which is why we're at where we're at right now in this bizarre place in history.

       They're a firehose, and there are many, many people in there figuring out where to point it. When Gamergate went big, it became really obvious every intelligence agency jumped in to figure out if they could point it where they needed to. You see a vast and leaderless army, you get in and try to figure out the controls or you're not worth your salt. See also: Anonymous, Silk Road, Bitcoin.

       Intentional misinterpretation aside, you're basically providing a good case in point example, which is a tactic they used to try to create a false reality around the candidate in such a way as to force their view, no matter how correct or "good" it was, to be abandoned in the face of increasing and unceasing criticism and ultimately ridicule.

       The letdown is that he basically chose to embrace the darkness because
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       (contextually varies depending on which stage of his life one's talking about) broke him.  He had a decent notion of how things work, but he took his own desires and ideals (anti-industrialization, etc.) and then
       <em>
        used violence
       </em>
       as a means of creating
       <em>
        fear
       </em>
       to try to achieve them, which basically made him just another player in the game, and a rather shitty one at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ted Kaczynski squandered a powerful mind in favor of his desires.  He fell from reason with his actions.  He chose to attack a system he didn't fully come to understand because his hate preoccupied him.  If he had chosen a path of non-violence, he could have been another Assange (limited hangout theories aside, take the spirit with which this example is intended) or something similar if he had applied his mind toward solving an obvious dysfunction rather than trying to find satisfaction through escape.

       Not sure about this. Go check the Wikipedia page's history. It will show who made these revisions, and when, and you will be able to view their editing history to see if it is at all suspicious in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       My money is on this being some pedantic wiki-freak adjusting the article in line with the source, which does not actually say that Murray's interrogation experiments were CIA-driven. Not in so many words.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, we all know they were CIA-driven, but the source doesn't say that outright and beyond doubt. So the right thing to do is find a source that states the claim explicitly and add it to the article. And see what happens then: If an editor immediately reverts it without a very good explanation, that would perhaps look suspicious.

       Wow dude, this is some serious synchronicity for me right now. After never seeing anything about him on this subreddit, I see this today after I randomly decided to skim through "The Industrial Society and its Future" and watch a YouTube video on him where some people were discussing this theory (a theory id never come across despite being highly interesting in MK Ultra).

       Interesting, the only reason he came up for me is because there is apparently a tiny guy in the back of the original image post (first link in the OP) that looks like him, and it got this whole discussion started on the original thread, which led to my bit of research and posting here.

       Also worth noting that a radiolab episode was done on this. They cited korean pow's being brainwashed as the catalyst that interested the government in funding murrays research. Not sure if that episode is still up but it documents the government's clear motive in funding the experiment along with the type of abuse 16 year old ted was subjected to. I would link the radiolab but I'm on mobile.

       It seems Wikipedia had a anonymous funky IPv6 user attempt to 'correct' the record on Kaczynski on  02:52, 4 May 2016‎ . On the same day this person scrubbed MKUltra/Kaczynski/Murray references from each other.

      <blockquote>

        ‎ (Removed the assertion that Murray and his experiment involving Kaczynski were connected to MKUltra, this is a conspiracy theory without evidence that is out of line with what actually appears in MKUltra files.)

       That editor is an idiot, since everyone knows that DCIA David Phillips destroyed every MKULTRA document he could get his hands on, when it looked like the scandal was about to break in the 1970s.

       Calling it now, in the near future the way back machine will have some funding crisis which will result in their taking down a significant section of older materials so that things like this can't be dug up anymore. Smaller lesser known outlets will also be bought and/or shut down with other excuses.

       You've obviously got more information on this than I do so maybe you'd be able to answer this question: Is it possible that a participating institution is trying to distance itself from the study? Since there were so many organizations involved, I would wonder if it were one of them that would want to avoid the bad PR. I mean, i know the CIA bankrolled everything but it would seem to me they'd be less worried about the public discovering their connection to the project since they could be provided immunity should any kind of an investigation be started.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Just checked Ted's Wikipedia page and there are still works cited involving LSD and the CIA.

       It's certainly possible, but out of all the organizations involved, I see them as being far and away the most motivated and capable of doing this sort of thing, so it seems like a natural conclusion to draw.

       Sure, things like the dark net already exist. All it would take is an additional website that they don't have access to change, it doesn't require constructing an parallel internet, because that not only limits visibility (since most people wouldn't know how to access it) but it doesn't change the fundamental vulnerability problems that just hosting another website would entail, as far as I understand it

       If you mean in the buddhist sense, then that's a clever answer but not really what I was getting at. Who do you think would be the human front through which all this funding/arming would be happening? That's really what I'm asking of your theory
