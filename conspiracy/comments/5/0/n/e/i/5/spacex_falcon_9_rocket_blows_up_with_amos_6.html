       Yeah....that's a bird my man, if you watch in 0.25 speed you can even see it flaps its wings, and isn't even anywhere near the rocket, just flying between the camera and it.

       Its a bird and it appears  to pass over the rocket if you watch frame by frame. It is actually in front of the rocket and moves really quickly across the shot because the camera is zoomed so far in

      <p>
       Woe to you who are complacent in Zion,
    and to you who feel secure on Mount Samaria,
you notable men of the foremost nation,
    to whom the people of Israel come!
      </p>
      <p>
       Go to Kalneh and look at it;
    go from there to great Hamath,
    and then go down to Gath in Philistia.
Are they better off than your two kingdoms?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is their land larger than yours?
You put off the day of disaster
    and bring near a reign of terror.
      </p>
      <p>
       You lie on beds adorned with ivory
    and lounge on your couches.
      </p>
      <p>
       You dine on choice lambs
    and fattened calves.
      </p>
      <p>
       You strum away on your harps like David
    and improvise on musical instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
       You drink wine by the bowlful
    and use the finest lotions,
    but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile;
    your feasting and lounging will end.

       a bible verse complaining about the corruption and dissolution in israel and promising a future exile

       what are the odds?
      </p>
      <p>
       really high, actually, literally half the old testament is about that, there are entire books that are nothing but that, one of those books is that of Amos, 9 chapters of explaining why corruption is bad and that the people of israel should do better and be good people

      <p>
       Book of Amos, Chapter 6:
Woe to the Complacent
      </p>

Are they better off than your two kingdoms?
    Is their land larger than yours?

The Lord Abhors the Pride of Israel
      </p>
      <p>
       8 The Sovereign Lord has sworn by himself—the Lord God Almighty declares:
      </p>
      <p>
       “I abhor the pride of Jacob
    and detest his fortresses;
I will deliver up the city
    and everything in it.”
      </p>
      <p>
       9 If ten people are left in one house, they too will die.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 And if the relative who comes to carry the bodies out of the house to burn them[a] asks anyone who might be hiding there, “Is anyone else with you?” and he says, “No,” then he will go on to say, “Hush! We must not mention the name of the Lord.”
      </p>
      <p>
       11 For the Lord has given the command,
    and he will smash the great house into pieces
    and the small house into bits.
      </p>
      <p>
       12 Do horses run on the rocky crags?
    Does one plow the sea[b] with oxen?
But you have turned justice into poison
    and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness—
      </p>
      <p>
       13 you who rejoice in the conquest of Lo Debar[c]
    and say, “Did we not take Karnaim[d] by our own strength?”
      </p>
      <p>
       14 For the Lord God Almighty declares,
    “I will stir up a nation against you, Israel,
that will oppress you all the way
    from Lebo Hamath to the valley of the Arabah.”

       They always launch from a launchpad at KSC, and never launch from a barge - they land the used first stage on a barge (and twice back to the Cape) so that they can re-use it, which is a pretty amazing feat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, they did not blow up "the last time they launched from land." WTF. The amount of made-up ridiculousness people pull out of their ass on Reddit never fails to amaze me.

       The barge launch was faked many believe. If you watch the video forwards and backwards, it looks like it was played in reverse for the landing/touchdown. Each frame lines up with the first half of the video (the launch).

       SpaceX has never, in their entire history, launched any of their rockets from a barge.

       You're free to disagree, but I would ask you back that up with some evidence - for example, a press release, video of such a launch from their youtube channel, anything official from them that makes such a claim.

       Just letting you know, there is no way on this earth that the footage of the moon landing was pre-recorded. So you have to either believe they did it all
       <em>
        live
       </em>
       and broadcast it as they 'faked' it...which...for a 'top level government conspiracy' seems awfully risky, or actually went to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget, the live broadcast wasn't the odd 10 second clip you see on conspiracy sites....it was like fucking 2 hours long, on TV.....they didn't have the technology at the time to have recorded that footage to then re-broadcast....so....yeah.

       Please explain then the technical specs of how they broadcast over 2 hours of the moon landing on national TV then? I don't think you quite grasp the basic physical photographic concepts which make recording it
       <em>
        literally impossible for the time
       </em>
       . That means you believe they did it live, with the astronauts walking around super slowly to simulate the low gravity.........
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets look at the one where they talk some shit about 'adding the flag in afterwards',
       <em>
        HOW EXACTLY DO YOU DO THIS AT THE TIME?
       </em>
       , we didn't have computer graphics and CGI at the time, they would've have to have been added
       <em>
        onto the fucking film
       </em>
       , do you even understand how photographically this is quite literally
       <em>
        impossible
       </em>
       in the late 60s? You now not only have to get around the whole 'its impossible they recorded over 2hrs of this then overcranked for slowmo', you now have to explain fucking modern-day CGI somehow being added to the mix...........
       <em>
        in the fucking 60s
       </em>
       . All you have shown by linking those pages, is that you know absolutely nothing about photography, film, the physics of light and shadow or videography, and especially not about the photographic technology available at the time, you seem to think it was shot in 2016 and then ported back in time to air on tv in the 60s.

       The exact same way they broadcast over two hours on earth.

       NASA deleted it all, by accident, that is the answer to my question.

       ....So you are saying they did it
       <em>
        live
       </em>
       on earth, for over 2hrs? Seems risky for such a top level conspiracy don't you think? And....you're saying that as they did it live, they also walked around slowly/weirdly to simulate the lesser gravity of the moon then?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know they
       <em>
        could not have
       </em>
       recorded it on film, and then broadcast it at the length/fps they did....right? It wasn't *photographically or technically feasible in the late 60s....
      </p>
      <p>
       You could always go google the camera they used? It was a
       <em>
        live fucking broadcast on the moon
       </em>
       , doing it live on earth means you have to explain the movement from having less gravity, as well as explain why the fuck they would do it fucking
       <em>
        live
       </em>
       on earth....the risks would be absolutely enormous. All you have proved so far is that you know absolutely nothing about how film works, how television broadcasts work or the actual technology of the late 60s available to photographers? Please watch the video and explain how they got around his points.

       No they didn't, you are misinformed.  There are many of the original tapes remaining from the other Apollo missions.  The "missing tapes" only applies to one of the missions.

       I live in Orlando and the NBC affiliate, WESH, said was it an Israeli built satellite for Facebook to beam signals to people in Africa.  Do people in mud huts need facebook or is this some Israeli NRO satellite?

       Both and probably more.

       I think people in mud huts are committing acts of poor journalism, actually. You would think Orlando journalists, being so close to the Cape, would understand how satellites work and the fact that they have multiple functions/purposes/companies/countries involved.

       a bible verse complaining about the corruption and dissolution in israel and promising a future exile
      </p>
      <p>
       what are the odds?
      </p>
      <p>
       really high, actually, literally half the old testament is about that, there are entire books that are nothing but that, one of those books is that of Amos, 9 chapters of explaining why corruption is bad and that the people of israel should do better and be good people
