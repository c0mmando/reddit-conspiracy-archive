        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Centralized federal control of the elections in November  to &quot;protect their integrity&quot; would likely be the best way to actually have the insiders steal them now that people are wise to past theft like the mike connell theft in ohio in 2004.</p>

<p>What the insiders would do is declare they need to take control and suddenly make all the infrastructure secret and no longer permit any citizen observation of vote colunting etc putting a whole new means of  obfuscation in place and then they can simply manipulate vote counts at will. Any requests for review would be denied under &quot;national security&quot; concerns.</p>

<p>I am somewhat worried about this since the bullshit &quot;russian state election machines hack&quot; stories have come up. The whole russian thing is BS but would be perfect to provide plausible justification for most of the public who hasnt known about the history of state system voting machine hacking by the USA neocons since at least 2004. (2000 was also an analog hack as the paper ballot company was bought out by a neocon front group before the florida elections and purposefully printed ballots fhat were misaligned guaranteeing a florida punch card debacle. This we know from a former worker at the paper ballot company who flagged bad ballot blanks and saw them returned to the shipping lines and was told to stop flagging them or lose his job. Then 2000 florida happened. The worker&#39;s story appeared on reddit back then.)</p>

<p>We also know karl rove expected a repeat of the man in the middle hack which he had apparently arrnaged for Romney which was why he kept insisting romney would win on the national news the night of the 2008 election to the point of ridiculousness except he didnt know white hat hackers had intercepted his man in the middle attack .that white hat interception of the romney man in the middle attack story also has appeared on reddit.</p>

<p>But no one who hasnt been following this like a hawk would know any of this. It just sounds too farfetched for someone learning of it all for the first time.</p>

<p>So insiders could easily work through th dept of homeland security and federalize and secretize state by state voting totalling by the machines making the security process the actual cover for the vote total adjusting theft. Any one upset by the totals if hillary won could just be turned away from examining the votes records on the grounds of &quot;national security&quot;.  They have been doing nearly the same things for two decades when people want to examine the vote totaling software on the grounds of &quot;machine manufacturers tradesecrets&quot; which is complefe bs but it hasnt mattered. (how much tradesecret can there be in software which is supposed to add totals when touch screen buttons are pushed unless they are hidding somefhing nefarious?)</p>

<p>And we know from 2000 that the american public will accept any election results no matter how dodgy. There simply isnt a mechanism in place to force a reelection under verified conditions in the constitution. We learned that in florida in 2000 when clealry a revote would have been the proper thing to do to learn the will of the people.</p>

<p>As the outsiders, Trump people better be ready at the state legislature level BEFORE IT HAPPENS to stop federal secretization of the vote counting process in November if they try to do it. But state legislators are both stupid and often corrupt and will simply vote to go along with any secretization if someone who heads their state party tells them they must vote for it in an emergency without much time to think. Especially if they are told they will look like they are &quot;helping the rissians&quot; if they dont vote to give up state power of the election verification process to certifiy their electoral college votes.  It would be just like the 2008 emergency funding bailout plan Hank Paulson pushed through congress by threstening a national financial collapse and martial law if they didnt approve the huge measure which no congressmen read. No congressmen will demand time to think of presented with a vote as a crisis situation.</p>

<p>I really beleive the &quot;russian hacker&quot;  association with this cover story means the ones in the infrastruture of national security that are considering secretizing the vote counting process are not pro trump and are instead pro insider hillary because pro hillary insiders are the ones spreading the russian hackers bs against trump.</p>

<p>There are apparently some  pro trump national security folks in the 3 letter agnecies who are working to expose dnc corruption to stop hillary but they woukdnt use the &quot;russian hacker&quot; cover story I wouldnt think if they were behind this efforto protect election ingrity.</p>

<p>Whats needed is not more secrecy but open sources tablulator programs and vote tracing by individuals and paper backups and absolutely open room vote tabulating preferably on giant over head tv monitors for everyone to see without habing to go to court to get permission . But we wont get that before nov 8th.</p>
