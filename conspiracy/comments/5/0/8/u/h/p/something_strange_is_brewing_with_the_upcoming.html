       What's going on?  Is it a legitimate hack?  Is someone trying to cover up for previous shadiness?  Are we being prepared for a "false flag" on an upcoming election?   Or is this a cover to send in agents to muck with voting systems around the country under the cover of an investigation?

       Probably different plans in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       If trump wins they will blame Russia and try to cause as much ruckus as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hillary wins they will find another reason to war with Russia. It's probably the only way they can save themselves from the central bank QE clusterfuck that's happening.

       If they give Trump the election, there will be riots, martial law, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they give Hillary the election, it will just stall the inevitable a bit longer and cause further political divide. That divide might also result in race riots, martial law, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both cases will be blamed on a hacked/rigged election.

       I really doubt Black lives matter will riot and go crazy if Trump wins, because their Soros pay will have stopped. But THEY are trying everything in their power to stop him and rig in their pick.

       I'm not American, but I can see from here that shit is seriously going to hit the fan in America pretty soon. The election has been rigged and people can see it. It's a recipe for unrest, riots and mayhem, it really is.

       Yeah.  Certainly seems like it.  I could be wrong, but I think what's going on is that there actually is some
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       change looming on the horizon - not just politically, but globally and in terms of ET disclosure, etc - and TPTB are possibly feeling that they may not have as much control over everything as they'd like to have.

       I haven't really read up on it but my guess is they (our wonderful government) had the voting machines compromised so that they could get in there and do what they want with the votes.  But knowing how incompetent they tend to be (or appear), either some foreign government was able to poke around and find their way in or they had spies or a domestic source of information that allowed them to get in.  Assuming the premise (systems compromised by foreign gov) is true, of course, which it may or may not be.

       It's so when our supposed leaders and politicians get busted rigging the vote, since they know we have all caught on, they can blame it on Russia like everything else nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's priming to accept that some foreign entity was the cause, and not our own worthless piece of shit government which is who we all know is doing this shit.

       We will set the world a blaze with fear from all sides. This will allow us to use blue beam and give you all a central fear. Then we can line the useless feeders up and begin the cull. What is left will be used like the surfs they are. Mostly cleaners and servicers of the systems we use.

       The division from within is so easy. Look at the fighting amongst man over politicians we prop up. Mean while we softly kill you with our gmo foods, meds, water, air.   notice most of us are vegan and vegetarian? Gates spend a lot of money on food, meds, and ? We have time and will wait till chaos is across the globe, then we will be your saviors as we unity to defeat the holograms that scared our precious flock.:.
