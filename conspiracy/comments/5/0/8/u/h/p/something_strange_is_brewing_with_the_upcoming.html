<p>What&#39;s going on?  Is it a legitimate hack?  Is someone trying to cover up for previous shadiness?  Are we being prepared for a &quot;false flag&quot; on an upcoming election?   Or is this a cover to send in agents to muck with voting systems around the country under the cover of an investigation?</p>

<p>If trump wins they will blame Russia and try to cause as much ruckus as possible.</p>

<p>If Hillary wins they will find another reason to war with Russia. It&#39;s probably the only way they can save themselves from the central bank QE clusterfuck that&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>If they give Hillary the election, it will just stall the inevitable a bit longer and cause further political divide. That divide might also result in race riots, martial law, etc.</p>

<p>Both cases will be blamed on a hacked/rigged election.</p>

<p>I really doubt Black lives matter will riot and go crazy if Trump wins, because their Soros pay will have stopped. But THEY are trying everything in their power to stop him and rig in their pick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Certainly seems like it.  I could be wrong, but I think what&#39;s going on is that there actually is some <em>real</em> change looming on the horizon - not just politically, but globally and in terms of ET disclosure, etc - and TPTB are possibly feeling that they may not have as much control over everything as they&#39;d like to have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t really read up on it but my guess is they (our wonderful government) had the voting machines compromised so that they could get in there and do what they want with the votes.  But knowing how incompetent they tend to be (or appear), either some foreign government was able to poke around and find their way in or they had spies or a domestic source of information that allowed them to get in.  Assuming the premise (systems compromised by foreign gov) is true, of course, which it may or may not be.</p>
