        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/11/111101130200.htm">immune system works better at a higher temperature</a>, especially the white blood cells, that&#39;s what&#39;s going on when you get a fever, a fever is how the human body helps itself fight off infection.  It should be no surprise that studies into the spontaneous remission of various cancers have concluded that it&#39;s fevers/immune systems at work.</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t spontaneous remission of cancer tumors more common?  Many cancer patients are given chemotherapy which decimates their white blood cells (an important part of the immune system), so any fever or immune response their body triggers will be weak and ineffective.  Therefor it will mainly be people who either avoided treatment or weren&#39;t diagnosed who go into spontaneous remission.</p>

<p><strong>Spontaneous Tumour Regression</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://ispub.com/IJPA/8/1/10901">http://ispub.com/IJPA/8/1/10901</a></p>

<p>&quot;Regression on the other hand, may be mediated by immune response, apoptosis, antiangiogenesis, terminal differentiation or genomic crisis resulting from telomere exhaustion.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Spontaneous regression of pancreatic cancer</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.505.466&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.505.466&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a></p>

<p>&quot;Regression  in  the  present  case  appeared  to  coincide with a prolonged febrile infection similar to that often observed in many other cases of spontaneous regression&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Spontaneous regression of non-small cell lung cancer after biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node metastasis: a case report</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-015-0702-9">https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-015-0702-9</a></p>

<p>&quot;Given the circumstances that regression started after the biopsy and involved both the tumor in the upper lobe of his right lung and the mediastinal lymph node metastases, an immune response is a reasonable explanation for the observed spontaneous regression in this case.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Spontaneous regression of an untreated lung cancer</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://medind.nic.in/ibq/t10/i2/ibqt10i2p173.pdf">http://medind.nic.in/ibq/t10/i2/ibqt10i2p173.pdf</a></p>

<p>&quot;Immunological theory is most plausible explanation for SRC&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The role of innate immunity in spontaneous regression of cancer</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.indianjcancer.com/article.asp?issn=0019-509X;year=2011;volume=48;issue=2;spage=246;epage=251;aulast=Thomas">http://www.indianjcancer.com/article.asp?issn=0019-509X;year=2011;volume=48;issue=2;spage=246;epage=251;aulast=Thomas</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, the role of the primary and innate immunity by induced or naturally occurring acute infections and the subsequent activation of the slower specific adaptive immunity play a vital role in fighting cancer. Infectious agents like the immune system are dual in nature and have both beneficial and harmful effects. Occurrence of fever and common cold significantly activates and prepares the immune system against virulent attacks in the future and the indiscriminate use of fever controlling drugs and antibiotics in common ailments should be curbed. [4] Current research in the UK into the use of adenovirus or common cold virus to regress cancer is a step in harnessing body&#39;s own immunity to fight cancer. [44] Feverish infection reduce would be malignant cells and its implications are profound. [22]</p>

<p>It is important to remember the larger significance and beneficial aspects of the common flu and other fever causing self-limiting infections on the human population, especially during childhood, as it has a protective role in preventing dangerous and untreatable diseases like malignancy later in life.</p>

<p>&quot;When cancer suddenly disappears, people may call it a miracle. But a recent study by three physician-researchers from DMS and Norway found that spontaneous remission of breast cancer is actually quite common. More than one in five invasive cancers detected in the study by mammography vanished without ever being treated.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they kill off your immune system, it means you cannot get cured naturally and then have to keep on coming to them for chemo, which costs the same price of a house.  This is why cancers come back much stronger after chemo as your immune system can no longer contain them naturally.  Most cancers will start off when you immune system is at a low because of factors such as stress and/or regular use of certain pharmaceutical drugs, if you fix your immune system in time the cancer can be dealt with, whereas once Big Pharma nuke your immune system with their cancer treatments (chemo and radiation) you are left at the mercy of the Gods and Big Pharma&#39;s toxic treatments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know that chemotherapy, though devastating to the body, is the best treatment we have for cancer?  Many people die of their cancer with chemo, or even worse, after chemotherapy many patients develop new and more aggressive forms of cancer, especially children.  However, all of them were going to die from their cancer without chemo anyway.  The patients that lived have a chance to live a little longer due to these advances in Western medicine. </p>

<p>Is the conspiracy that biology is incredibly complicated, and we don&#39;t understand many things about cell biology, much less the biology of entire organisms?  </p>

<p>Is the cost higher than it should be?  Well, all of our medical costs are excessive right now due to the paperwork and overhead associated with appeasing the insurance companies.  That&#39;s the real conspiracy:  Why do we allow these insurance companies to dictate what they will and won&#39;t pay for, all the while they try as hard as possible to not pay anything, and the man-hours and bureaucracy required to deal with that are driving medical costs through the roof? </p>

<p>That&#39;s not true at all, that&#39;s just assumption and Big Pharma marketing, there are rare cases such as advanced lung cancer where chemo can be the lifesaver, but apart from that it&#39;s rarely the case.</p>

<p>A particularly good example is that many breast cancers never do anything if you leave them alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL.  That he did, though Swayze was older, I think.  It&#39;s interesting that there is a theory that cancer always exists in the body, and that it is held in check by the immune system, and that is why so many researchers are working on new treatments, specifically they want to make sure treatments are localized to the specific tissue where the cancer resides.  It&#39;s a very difficult research problem...getting drugs where you want them in the body, and then getting them to stay there.  Another problem is that many drugs try to target cell-surface receptors to prevent their signaling, but we don&#39;t even really know the  molecular mechanism of action of these receptors, and thus when a drug targets a specific protein on the surface of a cell, we don&#39;t even really know how that small molecule is affecting the protein-protein interactions that drive signal transduction.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Steve Jobs survived many years longer than Patrick Swayze, and it was only after Jobs eventually went for Chemotherapy that he did die.  Typically a Cancer drug will only extend the life of a patient by two months, whereas by Jobs going natural he far outlived all expectation.</p>

<p>&quot;If there is a great new hope in the treatment of cancer, the immune system is it. Over the past dozen years, 71 anticancer drugs have been approved by US regulators. <strong>Typically they extend the lives of patients by only two months</strong>. And they are not cheap. A month of anti-cancer therapy can cost £7,000.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, what&#39;s up with folks at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and quoting things out of context? You forgot to mention that the article goes on to say that (likely very expensive) drugs that help the immune system fight cancer are the great new hope. Not letting the immune system do its thing by itself. Also, while Steve Jobs was a rare case in how long he lived with cancer, he said that he regretted not getting real treatment earlier and was in rather bad shape when he went in for chemotherapy, so he probably would have died soon without it anyway.</p>
