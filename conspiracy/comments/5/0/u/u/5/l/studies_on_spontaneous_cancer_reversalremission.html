       , especially the white blood cells, that's what's going on when you get a fever, a fever is how the human body helps itself fight off infection.  It should be no surprise that studies into the spontaneous remission of various cancers have concluded that it's fevers/immune systems at work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why isn't spontaneous remission of cancer tumors more common?  Many cancer patients are given chemotherapy which decimates their white blood cells (an important part of the immune system), so any fever or immune response their body triggers will be weak and ineffective.  Therefor it will mainly be people who either avoided treatment or weren't diagnosed who go into spontaneous remission.

      <p>
       In conclusion, the role of the primary and innate immunity by induced or naturally occurring acute infections and the subsequent activation of the slower specific adaptive immunity play a vital role in fighting cancer. Infectious agents like the immune system are dual in nature and have both beneficial and harmful effects. Occurrence of fever and common cold significantly activates and prepares the immune system against virulent attacks in the future and the indiscriminate use of fever controlling drugs and antibiotics in common ailments should be curbed. [4] Current research in the UK into the use of adenovirus or common cold virus to regress cancer is a step in harnessing body's own immunity to fight cancer. [44] Feverish infection reduce would be malignant cells and its implications are profound. [22]
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to remember the larger significance and beneficial aspects of the common flu and other fever causing self-limiting infections on the human population, especially during childhood, as it has a protective role in preventing dangerous and untreatable diseases like malignancy later in life.

       If they kill off your immune system, it means you cannot get cured naturally and then have to keep on coming to them for chemo, which costs the same price of a house.  This is why cancers come back much stronger after chemo as your immune system can no longer contain them naturally.  Most cancers will start off when you immune system is at a low because of factors such as stress and/or regular use of certain pharmaceutical drugs, if you fix your immune system in time the cancer can be dealt with, whereas once Big Pharma nuke your immune system with their cancer treatments (chemo and radiation) you are left at the mercy of the Gods and Big Pharma's toxic treatments.

       Did you know that chemotherapy, though devastating to the body, is the best treatment we have for cancer?  Many people die of their cancer with chemo, or even worse, after chemotherapy many patients develop new and more aggressive forms of cancer, especially children.  However, all of them were going to die from their cancer without chemo anyway.  The patients that lived have a chance to live a little longer due to these advances in Western medicine.

       But, they get paid less if the patient dies.  If the patient lives, then they have a lifetime of treatment to look forward to paying for...maybe even new medical issues that require different and more expensive treatments pop up!

       They charge such insane prices that even if the patient lives for a year they still make over $100K.  They never needed to increase length of survival, they only needed to increase prices, as they know they can charge whatever they like when it comes to life or death.

       Why is the treatment expensive?  Well, it took years to develop and test.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the cost higher than it should be?  Well, all of our medical costs are excessive right now due to the paperwork and overhead associated with appeasing the insurance companies.  That's the real conspiracy:  Why do we allow these insurance companies to dictate what they will and won't pay for, all the while they try as hard as possible to not pay anything, and the man-hours and bureaucracy required to deal with that are driving medical costs through the roof?

       You are right that the insurance companies shouldn't be involved, instead money should go straight into a government pot and should get paid out when necessary, no need for insurance companies to be sucking so much blood out.

       I also think people fail to appreciate how hard it is to synthesize and purify these compounds.  Not to mention that some of them degrade very quickly, and must be used right after they are made.  Many can't be stored for long term use.

       And here's a pdf (warning) that describes all of the requirements and procedures for preparation of chemotherapeutic agents by a specially trained pharmacist.  All of this adds up to an expensive drug cocktail.

       Well they can keep their fucking poison because I'm not taking it if I get cancer. I don't care how hard it is to synthesize. The truth is they will never cure cancer because they make way too much money treating the symptoms of cancer and of the bloody hell you go through when you do take their poison.

       Thats a fact lol look it up. Cancerous cells are basically rogue cells. When the rogue cell is allowed to exist for too long it multiplys, 2, 4, 8, 16+++ Then those cancerous cells group into a tumor. So everyone gets cancer, you could have it right now.

       Then we will agree to disagree. I believe these researchers who said they found a cure before they died were telling the truth. I know the Big-Pharmas who are in charge of medicine only want profit so what they say on the subject is irrelevant. The Vaccinations proved this.

       That's not true at all, that's just assumption and Big Pharma marketing, there are rare cases such as advanced lung cancer where chemo can be the lifesaver, but apart from that it's rarely the case.

       LOL.  That he did, though Swayze was older, I think.  It's interesting that there is a theory that cancer always exists in the body, and that it is held in check by the immune system, and that is why so many researchers are working on new treatments, specifically they want to make sure treatments are localized to the specific tissue where the cancer resides.  It's a very difficult research problem...getting drugs where you want them in the body, and then getting them to stay there.  Another problem is that many drugs try to target cell-surface receptors to prevent their signaling, but we don't even really know the  molecular mechanism of action of these receptors, and thus when a drug targets a specific protein on the surface of a cell, we don't even really know how that small molecule is affecting the protein-protein interactions that drive signal transduction.

       I get what you say and know what is involved. Even so, would not do chemo for most cancers if I got it. Just because the suffering involved vs the time won does not make sense to me. But that is just me.

       If ever I get cancer I'll be taking hot 20 minute baths to help my immune system.  Another thing I'll do is attempt to induce fevers.

       Of course I'll keep well clear of all the Big Pharma crap

       But big pharma is out to kills us all, it'd be much better to just let the human body take care of cancer naturally or smoke some weed and let it cure all the illnesses in your body. After all, that's what Steve Jobs did, and he was fine until he wasn't :

       Steve Jobs survived many years longer than Patrick Swayze, and it was only after Jobs eventually went for Chemotherapy that he did die.  Typically a Cancer drug will only extend the life of a patient by two months, whereas by Jobs going natural he far outlived all expectation.

       "If there is a great new hope in the treatment of cancer, the immune system is it. Over the past dozen years, 71 anticancer drugs have been approved by US regulators.
       <strong>
        Typically they extend the lives of patients by only two months
       </strong>
       . And they are not cheap. A month of anti-cancer therapy can cost £7,000."

       Man, what's up with folks at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and quoting things out of context? You forgot to mention that the article goes on to say that (likely very expensive) drugs that help the immune system fight cancer are the great new hope. Not letting the immune system do its thing by itself. Also, while Steve Jobs was a rare case in how long he lived with cancer, he said that he regretted not getting real treatment earlier and was in rather bad shape when he went in for chemotherapy, so he probably would have died soon without it anyway.

       Then we will agree to disagree. I believe these researchers who said they found a cure before they died were telling the truth. I know the Big-Pharmas who are in charge of medicine only want profit so what they say on the subject is irrelevant. The Vaccinations proved this.

        Look up GcMAF to understand why the person you're responding to says cancer has already been cured and then the person who finds the cure is assassinated and so are his colleagues. The person who found this cure Dr. Jeff Bradstreet is dead now.
