       , I really enjoyed your recent posts about the Grand Canyon. I enjoyed them so much that I shared them with my family, and they enjoyed it, too. So that's a few people that learned something new because of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the need to take a break from the conspiracy stuff. I've taken a few breaks myself when it got to be too overwhelming. It's important to balance it out with the positive and beautiful things in life. So I hope you find a way to recharge, but I also hope you don't disappear from Reddit forever. You have a unique perspective and I hope you continue to share it here.

       Americans have been trained to be moral relativists.  The logical conclusion of moral relativism is that there is no true right and wrong.  If there is no true right and wrong, then what do we stand for?  What should we stand for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans today don't stand for anything.  This is because they have been manipulated by a satanist agenda.

       bullshit.    the shills have been exposed along with their tactics that are useless.

      <p>
       they don't argue WTC demolition anymore.
       <br/>
       they don't argue about Sandy Hoax anymore.
       <br/>
       they can't argue about the Boston marathon anymore.

       Syria was NOT invaded by French and American ground forces.  Assad is still in power.    9/11 truth is mainstream.  Alex Jones is bill hicks.

       Do you really think AJ is bill hicks?  When they gave him plastic surgery did they steal his wit also?  I mean sometimes AJ randomly says some terribly funny thing, but Hicks said terribly funny things in a row for an hour.  I just think that whole thing is silly.  LIke rush limbaugh is the doors guy.  Or lady gaga is freddy mercury  or lady gaga is andrew dice clay.  Or andrew dice clay is john stewart

       I think I just got depressed after realizing that the ancient Egyptians were highly advanced and spread all through the earth using free energy. The idea that we devolved and are in a demon slave system is kinda unnerving. I need to just chill on the constant idea that it's my duty to inform people about the horrors of this world.

       This is perhaps what your OP should have said instead, as it's your thinking that you need to help or "save" anyone that's the problem in the first place.  Just make sure and save
       <em>
        yourself
       </em>
       .  If others want to follow suit, then so be it.  Don't try to get others to see things how
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       see them though.  Many won't - for better and/or for worse.

       Yeah, there's no point in trying to wake anyone up, I've determined as well. Because of the paradigm shift required, every individual has to want to learn the truth or they will remain wilfully ignorant. The info is widely available. The shills make no difference. It's kind of a hands off cosmic thing at this point

       seriously... dude just took all the wind outta my sails.  Now I'm just sitting here in the bathtub with my clothes on.  The water isn't even warm anymore.  I had some cake but it got wet so now I'm just sitting here in the tub eating fistfuls of wet cake listening to a scratched Annie Lennox album in the dark

       ROFL!!  Personally, I've locked myself in a closet that I call my safe space, have stapled black-light posters all over the walls and only have my favorite snow-globe to peer into while I recite passages of Thoreau's Walden and eat cream cheese directly from the package.  Sounds like we should become friends.

       Lb3pHj, you're just leaving this phase and it's completely understandable. Dealing with the tremendous stress of 'work or die' living, daily abuses at the hands of this global criminal enterprise and the total void of justice can push anyone into a PTSD condition. Not say this is what you're going through, but there has to be a balance that you will need to enforce in your life. Dealing with this is a bit like being a homicide detective who's constantly exposed to the horrors of the world and seeing the worst in people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truths you've learned and internalised are forever, and you cannot go back to the status quo of compliant, indoctrinated slave. Once you are awakened very few ever return back to the fantasy world of lies, brainwash and indoctrination. You can walk away, but the truth and search for it will always live and burn in your heart and soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Help those you can help and those who wish to learn, teach them. For those who are lost, let them be and move on. Never save a drowning fool who fights not to be saved, they'll always pull you down with them.

       "Do not cast your pearls before swine," said a really smart guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was one of the biggest steps I had to learn and take. But it's a good one -- there are many many people who are willing to listen, they just might not be the ones you care about NOW, because you've changed from the person who used to be part of that social circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this (s)election season has really made people question the reality of our current political paradigm, among other things. The ruling class is getting dumber and more desperate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take some time off, don't blame you. I've done the same. But I don't think it's time for despair. We may be on the verge of our finest hour, honestly.

       This is perhaps what your OP should have said instead, as it's your thinking that you need to help or "save" anyone that's the problem in the first place.  Just make sure and save
       <em>
        yourself
       </em>
       .  If others want to follow suit, then so be it.  Don't try to get others to see things how
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       see them though.  Many won't - for better and/or for worse.
