<p>The wings can sometimes either be dark enough to require a flashlight for absolute safety, or the abrupt shift from the sheer brightness to relative darkness can leave a person momentarily blinded. Sometimes you&#39;ll see tech people in these areas with similar flashlights or small LED headpieces.</p>

<p>Basically, Secret Service needs to be able to absolutely see anyone or anything in these areas clearly.</p>

<p>These small &quot;tactical&quot; flashlights of 160 lumens or more were really popularlized by the CCW (carry concealed weapon) community, especially the types that run on CR123 3v LiON batteries or are rechargeable.  Twin AA-powered flashlights have gotten better but really can&#39;t compete.</p>

<p>You offer no other explanation for what the device, which clearly gives off light, is in this instance. Why would he wave his &quot;diazepam injector&quot; around like a flashlight?</p>

<p>I politely showed you that Secret Service can and will use a flashlight if they deem it necessary, and that Hillary&#39;s man used one at the DNC. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever argued.</p>

<p>If they were worried about lights going out, why not a decent sized flashlight? If anything, the flashlight could check for dilation, but it&#39;s too small for anything else.</p>

<p>Robert Kennedy was assassinated in exactly the circumstances that Hillary was in in the photo. Do you think the secret service is more likely to keep their hands free to act or block themselves with a tiny little flashlight for no particular reason?</p>

<p>Perhaps you can show me some photos of Secret Service agents carrying around flashlights.</p>

<p>Hey, do you think holding a useless flashlight would enable the Secret Service to do their primary duty or interfere?</p>

<p>Since the area of illumination of the flashlight was about the size of an eye, how does that help ID anyone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s not a stretch at all. I&#39;m sure they check darkened corridors - before their charges are walking down them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also sure the corridor wasn&#39;t darkened.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m sure Obama was in a darker corridor, and none of his agents were carrying flashlights.</p>

<p>You see, you ask &quot;is it a huge stretch&quot;, in other words: is there the slightest bit of plausible deniability? But then you have to utterly change the the actual circumstances to even get the slightest bit of plausible deniability in there.</p>

<p>No, in your example at the Newton, Iowa factory it is clearly well lit. You can see stark shadows cast by the entire entourage. </p>

<p>It is quite laughable that you would claim this is a dark enough environment to warrant flashlights.</p>

<p>I have shown evidence that Hillary&#39;s Secret Service man is using a flashlight, and that Secret Service agents may carry flashlights... but you keep dancing around and blowing hot air. You don&#39;t seem to offer a single shred of evidence to the contrary, hrmm.</p>

<p>Until you actually do offer anything, I&#39;ve no choice but to assume the matter is settled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most tactical flashlights have multiple strength settings.  A good one at full power will run up to 900 lumens, enough to blind somebody (temporarily).  It will also eat batteries real quick.  So you have lower power settings. </p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s guy is clearly pointing the flashlight into the darkened wings to the side of the stage. You can also see Hillary&#39;s Secret Service man&#39;s earpiece in the gif. Obama is walking through a factory in your photo, which presumably has to be lit to be safe by OSHA standards in the first place.</p>

<p>Your Obama Secret Service pic does illustrate the lapel pins, which are differently colored on a weekly schedule, quite clearly. Thanks for that.</p>

<p>Hillary is exiting to the wings, which are less brightly lit. That&#39;s why the Secret Service man is pointing ahead with a flashlight. You can see the flashlight beam touch the arm of the man in the grey suit jacket in the gif.</p>

<p>I mean, you&#39;re nitpicking here. Your photo of Obama walking around a manufacturing plant looks quite well lit. You can see multiple shadows indicating bright lighting. As an industrial workplace would need to have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you showing me reviews of other flashlights?</p>

<p>I can clearly see the size of the area the flashlight illuminates. About the size of a human eye.</p>

<p>Why you chose to show only the end of the video in the gif is clear: you wanted people to think that the flashlight had some possible use.</p>

<p>It obviously doesn&#39;t, unless it is going to be pointed at an eye.</p>

<p>The use of it in this video is extremely weird. It is supposed to be at the DNC as they are exiting. Is that when the Secret Service start to check for threats? When they are leaving? With a flashlight that is useless?</p>

<p>Is it common for secret service agents to was around with a flashlight in their hands in brightly lit secured corridors?</p>

<p>So, to believe this, we must:</p>

<p>a. ignore that such a light is useless
b. ignore that it is being used for no reason
c. ignore that it would prevent the agent from engaging an actual threat</p>

<p>Now that we have ignored those things, we can start imaging useful LED lights which actually do illuminate things, we must imagine some threat materializing at the end of the DNC and that that is an appropriate time to start seeking out threats. We must imagine some grave unforeseen threat of darkness descending the brightly lit corridor in a secured building, whereas that threat doesn&#39;t apparently exist when guarding the actual President in a dimly lit unsecured factory.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve engaged in all this doublethink, Hillary is obviously healthy. Good, that means she won&#39;t die quickly in prison. </p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s agent is pointing the flashlight into the darkened corridor. This action wouldn&#39;t necessarily require explicit fear of assassins. He could be making sure she won&#39;t trip on anything. He could be pointing the way with the light.</p>

<p>I mean, you keep saying the light is useless, but it clearly is what&#39;s obviously happening in the video. What else could be happening?</p>

<p>I dunno, you&#39;re not offering any other possibilities for what the object is. You can clearly see that it&#39;s a flashlight. This debate is becoming circular. Maybe declare &quot;victory&quot; and move on?</p>
