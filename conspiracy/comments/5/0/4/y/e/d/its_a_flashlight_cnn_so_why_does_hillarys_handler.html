       If you've ever been backstage at a big event-- a rock show, a play, or a rally, you'll notice that immediately backstage it can be dark compared to the brightly lit stage areas. This area is typically called "the wings."
      </p>
      <p>
       The wings can sometimes either be dark enough to require a flashlight for absolute safety, or the abrupt shift from the sheer brightness to relative darkness can leave a person momentarily blinded. Sometimes you'll see tech people in these areas with similar flashlights or small LED headpieces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, Secret Service needs to be able to absolutely see anyone or anything in these areas clearly.

       It's reasonable to take these extra precautions with a presidential candidate but it's even more reasonable with a presidential candidate having her particular medical history.

       Not only that...anybody who carries a gun
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       have a decent flashlight on them.  It's immoral not to.  A lot of problems happen in the dark and you need to be able to see what a threat is (or if it's a threat).
      </p>
      <p>
       These small "tactical" flashlights of 160 lumens or more were really popularlized by the CCW (carry concealed weapon) community, especially the types that run on CR123 3v LiON batteries or are rechargeable.  Twin AA-powered flashlights have gotten better but really can't compete.

       The examples people are discussing take place in lit, indoor rooms. A nighttime, outdoor helicopter landing is hardly comparable.

       Why would you try to light up a lit room? Hillary's man is pointing his flashlight into a darkened area.

       You can see that he is pointing it into the dark doorway. You can see the light touch another man's arm. At a certain point we are disagreeing on objective reality, and you offer no other explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have clearly established that Secret Service do use flashlights if warranted.

       I didn't say it was common practice. I said it's what happened. It's clearly what is being done in any video of Hillary exiting the stage at the DNC.

       You offer no other explanation for what the device, which clearly gives off light, is in this instance. Why would he wave his "diazepam injector" around like a flashlight?
      </p>
      <p>
       I politely showed you that Secret Service can and will use a flashlight if they deem it necessary, and that Hillary's man used one at the DNC. That's all I've ever argued.

       Except it makes no sense. Had to log out to see the comments because I have the user blocked because in every single thread they always give plausible deniability excuses and then go proceed to cover their ears when you point out all the holes in their "official position".

       If they were worried about lights going out, why not a decent sized flashlight? If anything, the flashlight could check for dilation, but it's too small for anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Kennedy was assassinated in exactly the circumstances that Hillary was in in the photo. Do you think the secret service is more likely to keep their hands free to act or block themselves with a tiny little flashlight for no particular reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy is holding the most useful tool he can at the time. The idea that a mini flashlight would be the most useful tool is comical.

       There's only so much stuff anybody can pack on their body at one time.  You end up choosing a flashlight that's a good "all around" tool, including good enough to do target ID in a dark indoor area.

       Perhaps you can show me some photos of Secret Service agents carrying around flashlights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey, do you think holding a useless flashlight would enable the Secret Service to do their primary duty or interfere?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the area of illumination of the flashlight was about the size of an eye, how does that help ID anyone?

       That was your request. I provided evidence that they carry flashlights.

       It is clearly established that Secret Service may use flashlights.

       Yes, in the dark.

       They also carry guns in their hands sometimes.

       Since you have trouble with the concept of dark = flashlight; I'm guessing you will struggle when trying to figure out when they might reach for their other tools.

       So, you admit that they may carry flashlights. Is it a huge stretch that a Secret Service may then use a flashlight to point into a darkened corridor?

       No, it's not a stretch at all. I'm sure they check darkened corridors - before their charges are walking down them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also sure the corridor wasn't darkened.

       And I'm sure Obama was in a darker corridor, and none of his agents were carrying flashlights.

       You see, you ask "is it a huge stretch", in other words: is there the slightest bit of plausible deniability? But then you have to utterly change the the actual circumstances to even get the slightest bit of plausible deniability in there.

       No, in your example at the Newton, Iowa factory it is clearly well lit. You can see stark shadows cast by the entire entourage.

       It is quite laughable that you would claim this is a dark enough environment to warrant flashlights.

      <p>
       I have shown evidence that Hillary's Secret Service man is using a flashlight, and that Secret Service agents may carry flashlights... but you keep dancing around and blowing hot air. You don't seem to offer a single shred of evidence to the contrary, hrmm.

       Until you actually do offer anything, I've no choice but to assume the matter is settled.

       Most tactical flashlights have multiple strength settings.  A good one at full power will run up to 900 lumens, enough to blind somebody (temporarily).  It will also eat batteries real quick.  So you have lower power settings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again: if this is a secret service agent it is guaranteed he'll have a flashlight and likely something high end, big power, multiple settings.

       He's pointing it into the darkened wings, you can see the beam touch the arm of the man in the grey suit. If you point a flashlight into a darkened area from a lit area it doesn't make a lightsaber beam-- it just lights the target area.

       Hillary's guy is clearly pointing the flashlight into the darkened wings to the side of the stage. You can also see Hillary's Secret Service man's earpiece in the gif. Obama is walking through a factory in your photo, which presumably has to be lit to be safe by OSHA standards in the first place.

       Your Obama Secret Service pic does illustrate the lapel pins, which are differently colored on a weekly schedule, quite clearly. Thanks for that.

       As for the rest, pure nonsense. The secret service sweep with dogs before allowing their charge in. Since you can't even see "darkened wings under the stage" how it can possibly be "clear" is just ridiculous.

       WTF does this have to do with anything? Hillary is pictured in a well lit corridor, Obama is pictured in a darker corridor. In the darker corridor, none of the secret service agents are holding a flashlight.

       How you arrive at the conclusion that therefore the secret service hold flashlights its fucking mind-blowing.

       Hillary is exiting to the wings, which are less brightly lit. That's why the Secret Service man is pointing ahead with a flashlight. You can see the flashlight beam touch the arm of the man in the grey suit jacket in the gif.

       And yet that is the worst flashlight ever. It makes no sense for him to be using it in this situation and it is a user made video that came out after the public was aware of the seizure pen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny how you cut it so that people couldn't see what a terrible flashlight it was. Funny how you tried to say how many lumens it had as if it were of any use.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as previously pointed out, the secret service does not walk around with flashlights. If they did, when the president is walking around a dimly lit factory, they would be holding a flashlight.

       If you've ever owned an LED flashlight, then you know that they can get quite bright.

      <p>
       I mean, you're nitpicking here. Your photo of Obama walking around a manufacturing plant looks quite well lit. You can see multiple shadows indicating bright lighting. As an industrial workplace would need to have.

       Why are you showing me reviews of other flashlights?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can clearly see the size of the area the flashlight illuminates. About the size of a human eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why you chose to show only the end of the video in the gif is clear: you wanted people to think that the flashlight had some possible use.
      </p>
      <p>
       It obviously doesn't, unless it is going to be pointed at an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of it in this video is extremely weird. It is supposed to be at the DNC as they are exiting. Is that when the Secret Service start to check for threats? When they are leaving? With a flashlight that is useless?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it common for secret service agents to was around with a flashlight in their hands in brightly lit secured corridors?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to believe this, we must:
      </p>
      <p>
       a. ignore that such a light is useless
b. ignore that it is being used for no reason
c. ignore that it would prevent the agent from engaging an actual threat
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that we have ignored those things, we can start imaging useful LED lights which actually do illuminate things, we must imagine some threat materializing at the end of the DNC and that that is an appropriate time to start seeking out threats. We must imagine some grave unforeseen threat of darkness descending the brightly lit corridor in a secured building, whereas that threat doesn't apparently exist when guarding the actual President in a dimly lit unsecured factory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I've engaged in all this doublethink, Hillary is obviously healthy. Good, that means she won't die quickly in prison.

       I'm showing you reviews of LED flashlights (some of which are the model in question) made by the same company in order for you to see their brightness settings. If you watched the videos you would see people flip through the settings to the maximum illumination which is very bright.

      <p>
       Hillary's agent is pointing the flashlight into the darkened corridor. This action wouldn't necessarily require explicit fear of assassins. He could be making sure she won't trip on anything. He could be pointing the way with the light.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, you keep saying the light is useless, but it clearly is what's obviously happening in the video. What else could be happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno, you're not offering any other possibilities for what the object is. You can clearly see that it's a flashlight. This debate is becoming circular. Maybe declare "victory" and move on?

       I don't know why you're being downvoted, but I suspect you're right.  LED flashlights with strobes are being used by police to stun people and disrupt video footage.

       Because she's got Parkinson's disease and she needs the pathway where she hobbles to be lit up...otherwise she will have a seizure stemming from her brain clot.

       Why would you try to light up a lit room? Hillary's man is pointing his flashlight into a darkened area.

       You can see that he is pointing it into the dark doorway. You can see the light touch another man's arm. At a certain point we are disagreeing on objective reality, and you offer no other explanation.

       I have clearly established that Secret Service do use flashlights if warranted.

       Is it also "guaranteed" he'll be carrying it a brightly lit corridor in a secured building instead of keeping his hands available?

       Funny how it's the same guy who had to talk Hilldog down when she went freaky behind the podium.

       Funny how Dr Drew got fired. And the reporter from Huffpost. But as long as she's safe in a brightly lit corridor because of a flashlight, then we really don't need to question her health.
