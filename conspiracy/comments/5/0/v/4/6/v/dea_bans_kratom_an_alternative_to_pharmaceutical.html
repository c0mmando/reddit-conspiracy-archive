        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Kratom plant is the leaves of a large tree that grows in southeastern Asian countries (Thai, Bali, Malaysia), and has opiate-esque effects, and alkaloids that play on the opiate receptors. It is non-toxic, less addictive (yet still very addictive) than conventional opiates, and safe to consume, much like cannabis.</p>

<p>Heroin and opiate addicts have used kratom for many years, as a rail to ween themselves off of heroin and opiates. It is very effective as a taper regimine, much more effective than suboxone. </p>

<p>Is the establishment coordinating this in an effort to establish more control? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit, kratom is still physically addictive, but much less so than conventional opiods like heroin or oxycontin. I am a former addict (24 days clean) and can attest to this, however, despite how debilitating kratom addiction can be, many people without addictive personalities are able to use it safely as a substitute for opiates for pain relief and getting clean from conventional opiates.</p>

<p>U.S. Military occupies Afghanastan (90% of world&#39;s opium), the CIA aids in shipping the opiates into the U.S., creating millions of addicts. Then, they ban the one natural, organic solution to opiate addiction, &quot;Kratom&quot;. Is this all being coordinated to 1. Bring the U.S. to it&#39;s knees with an orchestrated opiate epidemic. 2. Bring in huge profits for big pharma?</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This entire episode the past few days is sad. I&#39;m someone whose struggled to get off sub for YEARS and was just about to start a Kratom regimen. No point now when it&#39;s gonna end in around 30 days. </p>

<p>Oh well, us druggies are incredibly resourceful, something else will work it&#39;s way into the ether and be a good thing into it gets too big and hen will end up schedule 1. This cycle is getting real old frankly.  </p>

<p>Look at Imodium. That shit is gonna be behind the counter within a year or two mark my words. I went to Walmart last week and the Walmart brand 200 count loperamide was in a fucking SECURITY CASE. Like the shit they or video games in. </p>

<p>Our priorities as a society and what we hold true and believe has value...IS FUCKED. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once upon a time I used this to come off of heroin, I suppose the government doesn&#39;t want competition. After all, that&#39;s why we&#39;re in Afghanistan, 90% of the world&#39;s poppy fields are in that country. And if you&#39;re lucky enough to get off of the real stuff, it&#39;s probably with the help of the government&#39;s other petrochemical pharmaceutical products like Buperenorphine or Methadone, both of which can be helpful but are way more addictive than Kratom are, which begs the question WHY IS IT FUCKING ILLEGAL?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For certain, the wealthy are promoting heroin addiction but I think you are over estimating its effects. The promotion of drug use (legal and otherwise) is just one prong in a multi-pronged attack on the lower classes. This attack has been going on for 25 years and the goal is to eliminate the lower class&#39;s ability to resist the move to replace democracy with oligarchy. So far, it is working splendidly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Micro dosing. Start at about 0.5 grams per day move to 1g per day after two weeks. Usually takes about 3 to 4 weeks. The first dose you might feel a little euphoria but no real effects. After that your body will adjust and you won&#39;t have any noticable effects. Just be careful it will take about a week or two after the regimine for your body to eliminate the shrooms from your system. You won&#39;t pass a drug screen during this time</p>

<p>These kind of contradict each other I would think, however from what I&#39;ve read the side effects of an overdose sound like they are no where near fatal, probably extremely uncomfortable but that seems to be about it. However addiction rates are an important factor when you talk about the safety of a drug.</p>
