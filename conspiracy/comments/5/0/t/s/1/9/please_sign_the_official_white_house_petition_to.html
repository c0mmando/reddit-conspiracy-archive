       The other thing you can do is start blogging about how everyone is freebasing saffron because it turns out to have dmt analogues, you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then people start going out and buyng up the saffron.  Then write letters to local senators about how kids are dying from saffron, and abusing saffron.  How saffron is a gateway drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they will ban saffron, which will cause a whole host of saffron based weightloss pills that don't actually work to be pulled from the shelves, costing those pill companies' parent groups to lose probably close to a trillion in assets, because they'll have to pull raspberry ketones and other weight loss formula pills which also have small amounts of saffons in them too.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all this happens, the DEA will realize it's stupid and just was juked out by psychological operations, then people will begin to understand their power of running abusive social psychology ops of their own that cause industry to lose a shitton of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also forces a national dialogue on why the DEA is retarded and whether psychological operations ought to be illegal, which will cause people to question the government generally, or it will just draconianize the US more until it breaks open and its guts spill out.  I'm at a point where I don't care

       Especially the ones that help people. At all costs, do not give an inch. I came off heroin with Kratom quite a few years ago and I ordered it online in a cinch, I imagine were I to be in the same struggle today I would have to resort to other more illegal means such as getting pharmaceuticals. This of course, gives you just a glimpse into why they might be wanting to extinguish Kratom use, if people are quitting without the use of petrochemical pharmaceutical poisons, that means a huge loss of potential profit. So, in the mind of the psychopath, I suppose the obvious answer is banning kratom, even if that means increasing overall pain and suffering.

       Sharing these petitions on social media and IRL raises awareness of the issue
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       when nothing happens proves to people that their well-being is secondary to the profits of corporations, and that they need to start demanding better treatment from their 'representatives'.
       <br/>
       Or just sit back and watch more freedoms get squashed while doing fuck all about it.

       The freedom is already squashed, hence why the petition has no effect whatsoever and permission to use a harmless substance is revoked at will, right in your fucking face. I do plenty to help people get on the level, I just don't bother signing these silly petitions. Feel free to accuse me of doing "fuck all," but at least I'm not making ridiculous justifications like the post you just made, trying hopelessly to maintain a story about how my efforts matter because I'm weak. Just saying brah

       I still maintain sharing these petitions allows less aware people to know that
       <em>
        they're
       </em>
       being fucked over too. Until the awareness is raised nothing can be changed.
