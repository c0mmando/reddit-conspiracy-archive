    <div class="md"><p>My question is why would any sane person support Trump?  Not saying I&#39;m pro Hillary given the blatant corruption,  etc but given the vitriol spewed forth from an overtly racist and xenophobic egomaniac I can see, given the need to probably at least support one or the other, the msm  has chosen Hillary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost every single time I&#39;ve tried to verify that the MSM&#39;s claims about Trump were accurate and not taken out of context, it turns out they weren&#39;t. If the MSM is caught lying numerous times, why give them the benefit of the doubt? If they&#39;ve lied, you shouldn&#39;t trust a single thing they say about trump until you have personally verified it yourself. I think the problem with most people is they cannot fathom the shear magnitude of the lies, so most of the MSM claims about Trump must be true. </p>

<p>When I read Trump&#39;s <em>actual</em> statements, all I see is a guy who needs a professional PR specialist to make sure that every single person out there interprets his statements correctly. They guy likes to say things with language that isn&#39;t super precise. That is it. Some people <em>want to believe</em> that he is racist and that is why they write articles about their interpretation of his statements as being racist. Is Trump actually racist? Of course not. </p>

<p>With all of that said., I don&#39;t fully agree with all of Trump&#39;s policies, but he seems to be a <em>real</em> choice. I&#39;m not even republican, but if the entire MSM is against Trump and constantly makes shit up about him, there must be a reason. They don&#39;t want you to vote for him because he might not be part of the inner circle. </p>

It used to only be in print and you could only pick it up at the University of Wisconsin at Madison or at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in the Midwest. (I&#39;m sure it was also at U of Minnesota, I just didn&#39;t visit in the late 90&#39;s). In the early 2000&#39;s, when visiting the twin cities, I started seeing it in bars in the area there. Regardless, when it started out as a print paper, it was only ever available in the liberal bastions of America. I don&#39;t think they have ever attempted to hide their leanings. Anyone who ever assumed the Onion was not biased in some way to the extreme left has not been paying attention. </p>

<p>It&#39;s for funsies and it&#39;s satire. Most of it is much more intelligent than the kind of attempted satire you see on SNL for example. It&#39;s entertainment. If you want conservative satire, read Coulter. There are not a ton of options.</p>

He&#39;s definitely at his best when he lambastes <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QJu3e9E.jpg">today&#39;s troubled teens</a>, and I love his passionate defense of big box America. </p>
