       My question is why would any sane person support Trump?  Not saying I'm pro Hillary given the blatant corruption,  etc but given the vitriol spewed forth from an overtly racist and xenophobic egomaniac I can see, given the need to probably at least support one or the other, the msm  has chosen Hillary.

       Almost every single time I've tried to verify that the MSM's claims about Trump were accurate and not taken out of context, it turns out they weren't. If the MSM is caught lying numerous times, why give them the benefit of the doubt? If they've lied, you shouldn't trust a single thing they say about trump until you have personally verified it yourself. I think the problem with most people is they cannot fathom the shear magnitude of the lies, so most of the MSM claims about Trump must be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I read Trump's
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       statements, all I see is a guy who needs a professional PR specialist to make sure that every single person out there interprets his statements correctly. They guy likes to say things with language that isn't super precise. That is it. Some people
       <em>
        want to believe
       </em>
       that he is racist and that is why they write articles about their interpretation of his statements as being racist. Is Trump actually racist? Of course not.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of that said., I don't fully agree with all of Trump's policies, but he seems to be a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       choice. I'm not even republican, but if the entire MSM is against Trump and constantly makes shit up about him, there must be a reason. They don't want you to vote for him because he might not be part of the inner circle.

       Apparently you didn't look too hard for the money quote. Not sure it's a worth my time to bother copying and pasting it. Trumpkins gonna Trump and no reasonable argument will change minds. Fortunately they are far from a majority so Trump will crash and burn anyway.

       Of course not. Why listen to the candidate himself when you can have suits on the telescreen tell you how to act and feel and think and hate. Anything else would be critical thinking and hard work.

       Nothing you said had anything to do with race. You're suffering from cognitive dissonance and conflating these policies with
       <em>
        racism
       </em>
       is a tell tale sign.

       Of course it's satire. And it's funny, hence a humor site.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, why can't a satire site ( if that makes you feel better) be biased in the subjects it chooses to satirize? Why is it a loss of 'credibility' if they don't keep a scorecard to make sure they pick on everyone equally? That's ridiculous.

       I saw a post when this takeover actually happened earlier in the year. It was a pretty noticeable difference in their politics section. It was all smear for the Republican candidates and a tongue-in-cheek article about how Hillary didn't have anything else to prove after being a woman that made it that far.

       Didn't the Onion start out on UC Berkely's campus? It used to only be in print and you could only pick it up at the University of Wisconsin at Madison or at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in the Midwest. (I'm sure it was also at U of Minnesota, I just didn't visit in the late 90's). In the early 2000's, when visiting the twin cities, I started seeing it in bars in the area there. Regardless, when it started out as a print paper, it was only ever available in the liberal bastions of America. I don't think they have ever attempted to hide their leanings. Anyone who ever assumed the Onion was not biased in some way to the extreme left has not been paying attention.

       They bought the Onion to influence the Democratic Primary, not the general election. Same reason she tried to get pro-Hillary messages on shows like Broad City. The Onion has always had a partisan slant toward the Democrats.

       The editorial cartoon (which is my favorite feature) is a parody of grumpy old conservative cartoonists. "Kelly" has kind of developed into a more complex character though. He is a particular kind of northeastern Republican whose bitterness about his divorce manifested as anti-family beliefs. He's definitely at his best when he lambastes

       This is the quote I found so far regarding this incident:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Due to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the Judge's reported associations with certain professional organizations,  questions were raised regarding the Obama appointed Judge's impartiality, he continued.
