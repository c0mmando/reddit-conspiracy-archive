       Hate to break it to you, OP, but you don't "own" any "hard-earned" money. You don't own the money in your bank account or the money under your bed. You don't work 50 hours a week for money that is "yours". The Federal Reserve owns your money. They not only own your money, they own your government. The moment you rally up the country to stop paying their taxes to defeat the evil government is the very moment the federal reserve will yank THEIR property (money) from your bank accounts and nullify all use of the money afterwards. Your idea is beautiful, but in actuality is impossible. The USA has a third party centralized corrupt as all hell money system/bank known as the Federal Reserve board. They own the money you work for and the debt that they add onto each dollar printed. The only way to fix this country is NOT to stop paying taxes, but rather dismantle and abolish the federal reserve, create a new GOLD/SILVER backed currency that is not manipulated by 13 old rich white men. Once we create our own soverign currency for the UNITED STATES, then we can eliminate all the problems that come with the Federal Reserve.

       FBI owns the largest bitcoin wallet, which was said to have over 60 percent of the Bitcoin that there is on the internet. Think again, my friend. Money is an illusion, and an even bigger illusion is ownership of said money. No matter the format or style, the government will always be able to take everything from you, including "your" money.

       Just like people have begun "pleading the Hillary" in court, I feel like citing the government's lack of money management is sufficient enough of a reason to not pay any sort of federal tax.

       The money is not real though. It's all numbers. The only way to fix this is to stop participating in commerce that involves debt based money, a la the US dollar, aka the Federal Reserve debt note. Participating in commerce is what gives the IRS jurisdiction in the first place.

       You are required by law to file an income tax if you make over a certain amount and you are required by law to pay taxes on that amount. Not doing so is a crime. This is separate than s.s. and Medicare.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you don't have to withhold taxes, but you do have to pay them at tax time. That would be your standard 1040 self employment routine.

       Yes. I never said anything about not filing a return. Lots of people  are uninformed when it comes to limiting the taxes they pay. With a little effort and educating themselves on deductions and credits , they could keep more of their own money, not to mention reducing the amount of money government steals and wastes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I stated before, those who allow income taxes to be withheld out of their paychecks with the expectation of getting a tax refund are doing nothing more than giving the govt an interest free loan. That's the worst idea imaginable.

       No, come April 15 you will figure out if you actually "owe", or if you were just giving the govt an interest free loan.

       Survival has never been ideal OR convenient, but in survival mode, living moment by moment, day by day, you are actually free. But it is hard to do. To become self sufficient enough. To go back to what they label as "primitive" when in reality building your own shelter and making your own food and protecting your own land is amazing.

       I'm negotiable. Implement an anonymous, cryptographically secure voting process and enforce it's open, verifiable results with the force of law, and that "would" fix everything... of course they would implement a loophole for themselves, like always.

       It will happen automatically. Declining wages, declining money, declining credit, increasing taxes, and a burgeoning rentier economy as a result; at some point it becomes just working to pay taxes, rent, and usury, which is not sustainable, and people start checking out of society en masse. The state will become increasingly reactionary, coming down hard with severe penalties to staunch the bleeding, which will only further drive the movement away from it. This is Precisely how the western Roman empire fell.

       Sure, that money has value is a collective delusion. But how else are you going to convince people, especially people that don't like you, to give you things that have real value without this intermediary? I am open to hear suggestions as I long for the future where money becomes unnecessary. I don't think humans will ever get there, though. Too much going on psychologically to trade without a buffer.

       commented below about changing your withholding amounts to reduce the amount they take out. It is a start and I'm sure they will try to suck it out of you at the end of the year but that is when people need to be most vigilant. At least with less incoming tax money they will theoretically have a tighter budget, but that's just wishful thinking.

       I agree with the advice but not the premise, budgets being very negative every year, it's actually debt that fuels it all. Taxes are economic control and re-appropriation, that's why you should not pay them (in a legal way because they still have the force).

       You do realize that the government takes their cut of our money automatically, before we even see it, right? How do you suppose I can stop paying taxes if they take it before I get it?

       I can't believe how many comments here are "they just take it out automatically..".  Are you that simple minded you can't think back to when you filled out a w4 and what that was for?    Voluntary compliance is easy when Americans don't have the cognitive ability to comprehend what it is they are doing.

       I've always been curious what would happen if at least 51% of all Americans simply did not submit their taxes. Would the government come out on TV/Internet/radio, asking us what they need to do, to get us to pay haha
