    <div class="md"><p>Hate to break it to you, OP, but you don&#39;t &quot;own&quot; any &quot;hard-earned&quot; money. You don&#39;t own the money in your bank account or the money under your bed. You don&#39;t work 50 hours a week for money that is &quot;yours&quot;. The Federal Reserve owns your money. They not only own your money, they own your government. The moment you rally up the country to stop paying their taxes to defeat the evil government is the very moment the federal reserve will yank THEIR property (money) from your bank accounts and nullify all use of the money afterwards. Your idea is beautiful, but in actuality is impossible. The USA has a third party centralized corrupt as all hell money system/bank known as the Federal Reserve board. They own the money you work for and the debt that they add onto each dollar printed. The only way to fix this country is NOT to stop paying taxes, but rather dismantle and abolish the federal reserve, create a new GOLD/SILVER backed currency that is not manipulated by 13 old rich white men. Once we create our own soverign currency for the UNITED STATES, then we can eliminate all the problems that come with the Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>So you don&#39;t have to withhold taxes, but you do have to pay them at tax time. That would be your standard 1040 self employment routine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I never said anything about not filing a return. Lots of people  are uninformed when it comes to limiting the taxes they pay. With a little effort and educating themselves on deductions and credits , they could keep more of their own money, not to mention reducing the amount of money government steals and wastes.</p>

<p>As I stated before, those who allow income taxes to be withheld out of their paychecks with the expectation of getting a tax refund are doing nothing more than giving the govt an interest free loan. That&#39;s the worst idea imaginable.</p>

<p>It is very easy to limit the damage if you have kids.</p>

<p>Sales tax is another beast, but there are ways to do it, even on big ticket items like cars.</p>
