       Right before the rocket explodes you can see some objects flying around at very high speed (you will want to reduce the video playback speed to .25 by clicking on the YouTube gear icon for desktop users).

       The post is written by someone claiming to be a part of the ground crew at Kennedy Space Center. He says him and others there saw strange lights in the sky before the explosion.

       The camera is very far away, and zoomed close in.  The object is a bird, near the camera, and the high zoom makes it seem fast.

       The first explosion was the rocket combusting, and the second one was the payload (which has its own independent fuel and propulsion systems) hitting the ground.  The time delay is just the result of light traveling faster than sound.

       There are some bugs and maybe a bird? but the moment before the explosion, an object is moving and is captured for around 17 frames +/- 2/3...It appears to be behind the last far left tower on the 2nd to last frame it's pictured.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can dload with 9xbuddy.com? and watch in vlc at .03x from the 1:11 mark.
      </p>
      <p>
       at the 1:08/1:09 it appears to be a fly out of focus, it appears in front of the rocket in a frame and the mid tower in a frame, but hard to tell where it is relative to the mid tower. I'm assuming because the focus/blur its close to the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       And at 1:00 something similar appeared on screen as 1:08. It appears for about 19 frames. It seems to move the same speed as the previous objects at 1:11 and 1:08 and it appears to be in foreground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Must be flies. I don't see anything in any frame flying at into or lighting up the rocket.

       You can see a small black object, about ten feet in diameter flash across the top third of the frame at 1m11s. You can pause play pause play etc at 1:10.

       SpaceX is in direct competition with the largest defence contracting companies on the planet, in fact an alliance of three. These are companies that have black budget projects and well above top secret vehicles at their command. You can be sure this footage will not be shown on mainstream media, which are controlled by the same parent conglomerates.

       It must fly relatively close by, to deliver a
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       payload, slightly behind the rocket. "It" - whatever it is - would obviously not want to fly between the rocket and known observer locations, and the rocket itself is about 20 feet in diameter (just confirmed on Google it's actually 17').
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see an intelligent trajectory - not a random path of a fly; it angles away from the rocket in an open elbow like pivot as the top third of the rocket flashes into an explosion.

       the far left tower appears to be behind the rocket, so if it was behind the tower it would be farther away than it looks.

       at 1:11 in the 2nd to last frame the object appears, it looks like it behind the far left tower.

      <p>
       Or it's very close to the camera and is merely a fly. It last about the same amount of frames as the objects/flies that are in front of everything during the 1:01 and 1:08 segments.

       I can not see why or how you'd think this is a fly, ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch this
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aGz-OUzh8Ug">
        quick video
       </a>
       with different light adjustments rendered to make it easier to see. This is unequivocally not a fly. It is a UFO from our perspective and from the powers that be, a weapon that is hundreds of years ahead of what the Air Force publicly shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're shocked at the prospect and denying it, fine you'll just have to mentally process this realization, but if you see it and are pretending it's a fly, then you're lying to yourself and to others on this thread.

       Do you really want to be one of those sad, little people that blame Israel for everything, including sabotaging their own satellite rocket? Are vast numbers of people utterly lacking in imagination these days? Do many just read some racist site and just blather back whatever's on it? OBVIOUSLY SPACEX WAS THE RECIPIENT OF INDUSTRIAL SABOTAGE. It wasn't Israel.

       It did, indeed have the payload on board.  It is normal (though the customer can choose otherwise) to run an engine test with the payload on board.  Not having the payload means the test is less complete, and that more time is required between the engine test and the launch.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, the rocket was not intended to launch today at all.  The engines were supposed to fire while the rocket was locked down to the pad.  From what I've read, they actually never got to the point of testing the engines, though.  The explosion happened during fueling.

       Ah okay, thanks for the info! That almost makes it seem worse. They lost the payload for basically no real reason.
