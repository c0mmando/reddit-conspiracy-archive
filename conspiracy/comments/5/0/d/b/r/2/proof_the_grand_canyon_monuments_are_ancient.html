<p>There is a reason why the Monuments of the Grand Canyon are named for Egyptian Pharaohs, but not because Egyptians were present on this continent. David Hatcher Childress (first voice) erroneously and without correction delivers history from a 1909 article that never mentions Egypt or Egyptological principles as part of the experience within the Grand Canyon subterranean expedition. The Headline specifically says Orient and never discusses Egyptian artifacts being observed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, I wouldn&#39;t discredit our capabilities, but look at the structures of Puma Punku, and there are only 2-3 conclusions you can reach.</p>

<p>1.) Humans re-develop in cycles, so we&#39;ve had advanced technology before, even more advanced than what we have today. And that <em>era</em> was wiped out likely from an ancient war (ex: Atlantis or Sumerians) Therefore, those in the know are lying to the vast majority today.</p>

<p>2.) Advanced race/s from other planets created the pyramids and other monuments on our globe. </p>

<p>3.) Advanced race/s from other planets helped humans create the pyramids and other wonders of our world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Search YouTube for &quot;in search of aliens puma punku&quot;. The host goes and interviews a local shaman who tells the story that those blocks were shaped by giant beings. In their oral culture, stories are considered truth, not something that is embellished or modified for one person&#39;s gain. Anyway, a scientist also analyzes a sample of puma punku rock and he shows that the cut pattern found on all the massive rocks is more advanced than today&#39;s laser cutters and our best diamond cutters. </p>

<p>Some of those blocks are over 600 tonnes, which could not be lifted today with our best cranes. So they go way beyond clever masonry.</p>

<p>So it shouldn&#39;t be a mystery to folks that research these matters. The only challenge for most is to tune out the mainstream media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly didn&#39;t watch the video because what you&#39;re arguing doesn&#39;t even match the video&#39;s contents.  I suspect you used an upvote brigade to promote your comment--I&#39;m SURE of it, because many in conspiracy would see right through a comment like this.  For example, using multiple pseudoskeptical adhoms instead of an actual cogent critique.  You are arguing &#39;ancient aliens&#39;.  He didn&#39;t say that.  He said alien OR human, he&#39;s pointing out things in the dogma that don&#39;t make sense. That right there means you&#39;re moving the line and then attacking a strawman.</p>

<p>You want to talk about facts?   Did you see the &#39;overlay&#39; he made where the stars of Orion constellation lined up with the peaks?</p>

<p>Did you see the part where he said rivers dont&#39; cut right angles and that&#39;s never addressed by the &#39;river cut the canyon&#39; accepted dogma?  Or the fact that there aren&#39;t typical river rocks (rounded rocks) like in ALL other rivers except in the river bed and nearby riparian zone?</p>

<p>EDIT: I think you&#39;re being overtly reactionary and kind of dickish in way that smacks of scientism and statusquotarian dogmatism, and attacking a strawman (actually 2) that suggests you&#39;re control grid trying to fight a subversive idea.</p>

<p>What do you think of my assessment?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the grand canyon lighting theory.</p>

<p>&quot;Satellite images, as well as pictures taken by astronauts in orbit, seem to indicate that the Grand Canyon is an enormous Lichtenberg figure, in other words, a gigantic lightning scar. As the Electric Universe hypothesis suggests, electric discharge machining (EDM) might account for the Canyon&#39;s appearance: steep walls, thousands of layers, brachiated side canyons at practically every scale, and periodic, hemispherical &quot;nips&quot; cut into each rim&quot;</p>

<p>My reason for attacking you is seeing a very distinct pattern of astroturfing.  Here is my polyangulation to identify you as control grid.  You did the following</p>

<ol>
<li>) conflated with flat earth --&gt; transfer propaganda</li>
<li>) free mental illness diagnosis --&gt; vicious ad hominem</li>
<li>) Jew jitsu --&gt; antisemitic transfer propaganda</li>
<li>) How about You develop an intuition  --&gt; ad hominem attack, strawman</li>
<li>) mushrooms --&gt; Completely strange nonsequitur and misdirection</li>
<li>) &quot;Mushrooms for the Maya Monkey masses.&quot;  --&gt; Obvious you&#39;ve never done mushrooms ever not once in your life.  OR psychedelics.  Mushrooms are serpentine not monkey, which you&#39;d know if you did them.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>YOU WOULD DO VERY WELL TO ACTUALLY DO MUSHROOMS IN A COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY ARE LEGAL because they would teach you </p>

<p>how </p>

<ol>
<li>) you&#39;re a traitor to this country by engaging in this activity </li>
<li>) what youre doing is very immoral, </li>
<li>) your service either as a veteran or a non-vet astroturfer is immoral and harmful to the entire world in fact, </li>
<li>) that your time on earth has been completely pointless if this is what you&#39;re doing with your life.</li>
<li>) that psychopathy is the hallmark of someone who thinks they are doing right when they are doing wrong, and that you are a psychopath, and that&#39;s ok because the mushroom will awaken the christ within you and pull the humanity that is still there like a candle in void of darkness, and will bring you back to us.  You can save yourself from this mental illness of astroturfing psychopathy.</li>
</ol>

<p>There&#39;s my unsolicited mental health advice :take your own advice and do mushrooms and rekindle the Christ within you.  </p>
