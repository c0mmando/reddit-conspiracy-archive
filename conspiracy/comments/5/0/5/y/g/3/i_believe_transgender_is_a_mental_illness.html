       I am trans myself, but I came to the conclusion that gender identity disorder is really a mental illness. I am not trying to offend anyone here, but to me it makes more sense than just "a man trapped in a woman's body" and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are studies showing that the brain is wired differently depending on gender, but I like to say you should never think something is true just because a "study says". This guy explains the subject very well:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rnq1NpHdmw
       </a>
       In reality, the study just shows brains more feminine or masculine, it doesn't have anything to do with gender. Of course if you scan a trans woman's brain you're gonna see feminine features, I have personally never heard of a trans woman who likes to be hairy and masculine and have lots of muscles etc. (yes that sounds like a stereotype but it's just so you can understand what I mean better). The "shape" of your brain will only determine your personality, not your gender.
      </p>
      <p>
       So from that point, "sex" or "gender" is just biological, what we call gender identities are just personalities. Yes masculinity and femininity is a spectrum, not gender. Gender only means what you have between your legs so you can reproduce. There is no such thing as a MAN or a WOMAN. We are people, with different personalities and genitals that's all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, to me being obsessed with wanting to look like the opposite gender is a mental illness. I am a girl, but I've always wanted to be a boy, when I understood I would grow up to be a girl, I cried all the time. I wanted to be a boy so freaking bad, I hated my body, to me my life was ruined because I wasn't a boy. And every single one of these feelings are still valid today, nothing has changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a mental illness, which is gender identity disorder. I don't even agree with how it's called, because gender is not an identity, it's a biological factor. How my brain works is not up to me, I don't choose to cry every night because I'm a girl, that's just how I am. But this is ruining my life because I just can't be happy because of that illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       So from that, to all the jerks who hate on us saying we are mentally ill, well DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEN. Find that freaking miraculous pill that will stop gender dysphoria, because no I don't want to mutilate my body and take hormones, I just have to for my own happiness! So if there was any real cure, believe me I would take it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So thank you for being more understanding of people who choose to transition, but stop promoting it like it's normal and a good thing to do. IT'S NOT. Focus on finding a cure instead of pushing us to go through so much pain...
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: First off I wanna say thank you to everyone that answered this post! It made me feel so much better, so thank you guys for that. I also want to thank that guy again who shared with me this youtube channel:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmCBKaKOtOrEqgsL4-3C8Q">
        https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDmCBKaKOtOrEqgsL4-3C8Q
       </a>
       She's a transgender youtuber who explains so well what I meant to say through this post.
Now whether or not I decide to transition, it will be MY choice to make MY life better. 
If you are trans and you read this, please don't fall in this social stigma that tells you you're a special snowflake therefore a minority therefore a victim etc. You are YOU and being trans is only like 1% of who you are... Don't let it define your life nor future.
One video, by the youtuber I talked about above, everyone's got to watch:

        Johns Hopkins Psychiatrist: Transgender is ‘Mental Disorder;’ Sex Change ‘Biologically Impossible’
       </strong>
       <a href="https://archive.is/k9YGX">
        https://archive.is/k9YGX
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Paul R. McHugh, the former psychiatrist-in-chief for Johns Hopkins Hospital and its current Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry, said that transgenderism is a “mental disorder” that merits treatment, that sex change is “biologically impossible,” and that people who promote sexual reassignment surgery are collaborating with and promoting a mental disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       The transgendered person’s disorder, said Dr. McHugh, is in the person’s “assumption” that they are different than the physical reality of their body, their maleness or femaleness, as assigned by nature. It is a disorder similar to a “dangerously thin” person suffering anorexia who looks in the mirror and thinks they are “overweight,” said McHugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also reported on a new study showing that the suicide rate among transgendered people who had reassignment surgery is 20 times higher than the suicide rate among non-transgender people. Dr. McHugh further noted studies from Vanderbilt University and London’s Portman Clinic of children who had expressed transgender feelings but for whom, over time, 70%-80% “spontaneously lost those feelings.”
      </p>
      <p>

        Transgenderism Is A Mental Illness, Not A Civil Rights Issue
       </strong>
       <a href="https://archive.is/jcIxp">

      <p>
       If someone came to a doctor and asked him to cut off a perfectly healthy arm because it just felt “wrong” for the arm to be there, should the doctor do it? This isn't an idle question because this does happen with a mental illness called Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID). People who have it feel as if they're not supposed to have a certain body part, like an arm or leg. As a general rule, doctors won't remove a healthy body part; so some of these poor deluded people crush, mangle, burn, or otherwise deliberately destroy their own arms or legs in order to get a surgeon to slice them off.
      </p>
      <p>
       This raises a question: Are surgeons who refuse to remove healthy limbs from people with BIID doing them a service because they're mentally ill or are they denying them their civil rights? MOST of us would say that a surgeon who refuses to cut off a healthy leg is doing the right thing. Of course, not everyone would agree. In fact, there are some people who will tell you that mental illness is a “super power.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, your mortality rate will be 51% higher than the general population because of suicide and all the female hormones you’ve pumped into your body en masse. In fact, the suicide rate for people who are transgender is 25 times that of the general population according to the American Psychological Association.

        Adult Gender Identity Disorder (GID) Can Remit

      <p>
       This fluctuation can be in tandem with that of comorbid psychopathology or in response to sexual and other life events. Remission has been documented at up to 10 years. If evaluated over many years, GIDs and paraphilias can be less fixed than is often thought. The frequency of permanent remission may be underestimated, as such subjects may not consult clinicians. So if you have other problems, you can get GID. Also, they found adults which had GID up to 10 years and then it vanished.

        Transsexualism, Dissociation, and Child Abuse

       Sixty percent reported one or more types of severe child abuse. In the course of discussing other issues, participants also reported having experienced many of the commonly cited initial and long-term effects of child abuse, including fear, anxiety and depression, eating disorders, substance abuse, excessive aggression, and suicide ideation and attempts. [...] I have speculated, as have some of the participants themselves, that in some cases transsexualism may be an adaptive extreme dissociative swival response to severe child abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people with GID show effects of child abuse, even 60% openly reported serve ones. So instead of being a ‘genetic’ problem, he (and the people he interviewed) speculated that it was an adaptive response to this early child abuse.

       Persons with GID compared to cisgender heterosexuals have higher presence of PDs, particularly Paranoid PD, avoidant PDs, and comorbid PDs. In addition.

       Evidence suggests over-representation of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and behavioral difficulties among people referred for gender issues [...] As compared to non-referred comparisons, participants with ASD were 7.59x more likely to express gender variance; participants with ADHD were 6.64 times more likely to express gender variance.

      <p>
       Clinical evidence suggests that schizophrenia occurs in patients with GID at rates higher than in the general population and that patients with GID may have schizophrenia-like personality traits. Conversely, patients with schizophrenia may experience alterations in gender identity and gender role perception. Neurobiological research, including brain imaging and studies of finger length ratio and handedness, suggests that both these disorders are associated with altered cerebral sexual dimorphism and changes in cerebral lateralization. Various mechanisms, such as Toxoplasma infection, reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), early childhood adversity, and links with autism spectrum disorders, may account for some of this overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
       So people with GID are similar to those who have schizophrenia-like personality traits which suggests that something in the brain is fucked up which can stem from infections, autism, some brain imbalance or childhood problems.

       This study provided information on the long term psychosexual and psychiatric outcomes of 139 boys with gender identity disorder (GID). [...] At follow-up, 17 participants (12.2%) were judged to have persistent gender dysphoria. Regarding sexual orientation, 82 (63.6%) participants were classified as bisexual/ homosexual in fantasy and 51 (47.2%) participants were classified as bisexual/homosexual in behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here they studied boys at around 8 and then at 20 regarding the development of GID. Of these 139 boys which had GID at the first study only 12% had it 12 years later, 47% were bi/gay and 41% were hetero or asexual.

       These respondents reported on 584 patients with cross-gender identification. In 225 patients (39%), gender identity disorder was regarded as the primary diagnosis. For the remaining 359 patients (61%), cross-gender identification was comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. In 270 (75%) of these 359 patients, cross-gender identification was interpreted as an epiphenomenon of other psychiatric illnesses, notably personality, mood, dissociative, and psychotic disorders. In around 75% of the patients, GID was seen as the result of other personality problems / illnesses.

That you feel like you are a man, that you KNOW THIS IS WRONG, and that you want help to STAY a woman–to get rid of the "transitional" feelings. Don't allow him to try to prescribe anything at the first meeting. Don't allow him to recommend you a psychiatrist. He will be able to help you, though. As long as he's not a quack.

       A lot of the articles are either from conservative websites, are using outdated information (such as using the DSM-IV), or come from countries such as India and Iran-- which are notoriously hostile to women.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the data is also based on correlation, which does not equal causation. Trans individuals may have higher rates of suicide, but consider how they're treated. They are often looked at with disgust or even outright hated, or skepticism at the very least.

       Ah, the Federalist. Another news source with a conservative/libertarian bent! This is totally proof! End of discussion, they've solved it!

       It's interesting, because actual medical and legal research says otherwise:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Overall, the most striking finding of our analysis was 
the exceptionally high prevalence of lifetime suicide 
attempts reported by NTDS respondents across 
all demographics and experiences. Based on prior 
research and the findings of this report, we find that 
mental health factors and experiences of harassment, 
discrimination, violence and rejection may interact to 
produce a marked vulnerability to suicidal behavior in 
transgender and gender non-conforming individuals. 
More research on suicidal behavior among transgender 
and gender non-conforming people is needed.

       Comparing trans individuals to black people is a faulty comparison (logical fallacy, which you're clearly versed in).

       I'm saying most of those sources are biased, as their political agenda is one of denying trans rights--and their very existence.

        Genetic fallacy.

      <p>
       Actually, if someone's lied to you before, not trusting them isn't any sort of "genetic fallacy" - it's common sense.  And in fact, this common sense is also a principle of law - "falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus".
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, someone who thinks it's a logical fallacy to distrust claims from people who have repeatedly tried to deceive you in the past should probably hone their skepticism.  Once I've caught someone in a self-conscious lie, I tend not to pay attention to them in the future - you should consider doing the same or risk being fooled again and again and again.

That you feel like you are a man, that you KNOW THIS IS WRONG, and that you want help to STAY a woman–to get rid of the "transitional" feelings. Don't allow him to try to prescribe anything at the first meeting. Don't allow him to recommend you a psychiatrist. He will be able to help you, though. As long as he's not a quack.

       Yes it's the kinda doctor I need to find! Because the ones I tried to see either told me "you have to transition I'll give you hormones" or "I don't want to deal with that" --' I'll keep digging though.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are studies showing that the brain is wired differently depending on gender.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Another point to touch on Is - I'm not really sure how this proves anything: we now know that genes can express themselves differently in different situations.  For example, we have seen observable differences in the brains of children who've suffered abuse, versus those who haven't; the experience of abuse has caused a gene to express a physiological change that results in the brain structure changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we take the logic of observable structural difference in trans' versus non-trans brains as proof that transgender disorder isn't a disorder but a
       <em>
        natural
       </em>
       genetic variation from birth, then we should be concluding that abuse victims are born abuse victims from birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is absurd.  If we see structural change in people after abuse, it's just as likely that you'd see structural change in trans people after a prolonged period of being transgender.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the transgender stories I've read, surrounding transitioning, and coming out to people - being trans' more often than not seems to be a very traumatic and quite alienating experience (surprise, surprise, being abused is quite traumatic and alienating as well).
 Just as we see with abuse victims, as we do with transgender people, we see an over represented in mental health and suicide statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my argument is, transgender people are essentially submitting themselves to trauma, stress and prolonged alienation, that results in a structural change.
      </p>
      <p>
       But why is this? Two reason, people can't perpetually live in a psychologically traumatic state - we develop coping mechanisms to alleviate stress; somethings wrong, you think you're different and everyone's telling you there's a community that'll embrace you and make the incongruent feelings go away, so you throw yourself head first into that community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the argument being that the gene responsible for the structural change, is an evolutionary coping mechanism, that if you find yourself in a position of prolonged abuse, or having to capitulate or submit yourself unwillingly to another, this gene will express a change that may lead you to being more able to cope or capitulate with that situation - making it more likely that you'd survive to pass on yours genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, evolution isn't about progression towards some perfect being, it's simply the progression towards being more competitively able to pass on your genetic makeup.

       Yes that's the sad part, 99% of trans people think there is scientific proof that they are really a man or a woman "inside". So now they are promoting it like transition is something totally normal or stuff like "my genitals don't define my gender". I agree society should be accepting of people who have transitioned, it's their choice, no reason to hate on them. But stop saying being trans is an identity...  Thank you man, I'll try as hard as I can to break free from GID before I choose to go further. Good luck to you too!

       This.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have nothing against trans people and would never consciously discriminate against them or treat them different than any other people. The decision for a man or a woman to live their life as a different gender has no impact on my life, and I couldn't care less what bathroom they use.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, if you ask me if I think that a man wanting to live as a woman is "normal", the answer is no. It comes down to wanting to be something you're just not. It's a mental illness, but it's obviously not something that represents any sort of threat to anybody. If you're a man or a woman and you feel like you'll only be happy if you live your life as the other gender, by all means do so. I feel bad for those that feel that they're not the gender they would have wanted to be but also feel inadequate with the whole trans thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, living your life as a transgender does NOT make you whatever gender you choose to be. Gender isn't just some kind of mental barrier. If you were born a man and live as a woman, you're still just a man living as a woman, not a woman. You are NOT a woman in the same way as someone born a woman is, and never will be. Nothing wrong with that, but you don't get to choose your physical gender. I don't buy into the whole "if you wouldn't date a trans you're a biggot" bullshit I've seen in some places. If I like apples and you give me an orange painted red with food coloring, I'm not an asshole for not eating the orange.

       My perspective is that the tree of life has both the female and the male, we can define both and they take getting in touch with your feminine side to a whole other level. When we are born we are born into one, after vaccines and consciousness alteration, we probably have lasting effects on every part of the brain. After watching Vaxxed yesterday I now think that vaccines are even a partial cause of the transgender mental illness. I say vaccines cause autism in 1 in 95 kids. I'm 21 years old and I was born in 95, that's the year 24 vaccines were made available. I know the vaccines have done something, it's not just the vaccines but a bunch of other things in a large spider web of control. Vaccine consciousness alteration, constant sugar high to have happiness, advil to remove your empathy, fluoride to make you more docile. Humans are just being fucked with on a whole other level.

       Wait so crying every day and hating yourself is better than transitioning and finding peace with yourself? I am 2 years into transitioning and I am far more comfortable, confident and happy with myself as a trans woman than I was as a dude with GID. Here's what happens: You turn your self hate into fuel for being transphobic and not transitioning. You drift through life for the next X years with casual transphobia to try and keep yourself from feeling that way. You finally get tired of hating yourself after Y years and come out and talk all about how you repressed yourself for so long and you make a big happy post about how you accept yourself now and how you're going to transition. This happens every day with so many people. Might as well stop making inflammatory posts on a subreddit that could give a shit about you or your feelings and find people that will actually accept you and help you be happy.

       I really like your post because that's what I've been thinking for a long time. I know I'm not just questioning my gender and stuff like that, I do have very severe GID that will probably not go away until I hit my sixties maybe lol. I still hold on to my opinion that it is a mental illness, but I also know that the only real cure for now is transition. So I'm still asking myself, should I go for what you say above? Or keep on waiting hoping all this suffering will go away on its own. Thank you again for your post

       Look at the exgay movement. They're not actually "cured" or over being gay, they just repress them and use religion as the reason to stay "loyal" to a life they despise. Despite all these assholes telling you otherwise, you can transition and find a happy life. I am pretty much there. The dysphoria from my body is pretty minimal and I have a good career. You're fortunate too because ftms have an easier time transitioning because testosterone has a lot stronger of an effect than estrogen. Yeah genital dysphoria sucks but they already have phalloplasty and it is always being improved.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can make it through this. Just give yourself a chance to be happy. Repressing yourself through hate doesn't work, I did that for a while and it sucks and you just end up feeling like you wasted your life.

       yes you're right repressing ourselves is never a good thing, however I don't agree it's always the case for people who has seen their GID go away. I am sure there are plenty of people who experienced it, because sometimes GID can be a consequence of many other problems. Sometimes people transition thinking it's the ultimate solution for everything and that's when bad things happen. Really it's only up to the person concerned, only them will know what's best! :)

       Yeah, that does seem to be the case now days. Gender is definitely a physical and biological trait. In a society that is obsessed with sex, gender and personality are often confused.  Sexual gratification is often focused on as a "need". Remember we are all just souls chained to this mortal coil. We are all both female and masculine energy. Separating the two of where you get problems. Look within for wholeness and unity. Sexuality is just an illusion of the human condition.

       I support your view here, but I just wanted to make a comment that mental illnesses are rarely "fixed" with a "miracle pill". It also requires work from the patient in cognitive behavior therapy sessions. You need to talk to someone.

       Yes I agree, and since we still struggle in fighting depression, no surprise there hasn't been any success concerning therapy for transgender individuals. Yes I do, but I don't have the money for it unfortunately. In my country hormones are free but not therapy, we live in a crazy world.

       You're discussing a topic that I think is sort of in a grey area; I don't really think it can be proved one way or the other, mental illness or not mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the thing to focus on is that it's not a choice, any  more than being gay, straight or bi is a choice. You're either trans, or you're not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are trans, you have a much higher likelihood of depression or suicide, and also I think you are more vulnerable to random violence; people are much likelier to attack you because people fear what they do not understand. I think the vast majority of trans people understand these things; I do not think it likely that anyone would make this choice, would choose to operate on their genitalia, if they felt that they actually had a better choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were me, I think I would try to look at the situation as more of a disability than a mental illness. If I had a vagina that should be a penis, this absence of penis would be a disability that prevents me from fully being me, and that lowers my quality of life. Quality of life is made of quality of moments. Short of getting an operation to create a penis, my recommendation is that you focus on things that you truly enjoy, and try to create as many quality moments as you can. Maybe one day you will decide to go and get your own penis; until then, your duty in life is to seek out pleasure and joy where ever and when ever possible, in order to increase quality moments and thus increase the quality of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my old friends turned out to be trans; he was actually a she. It took her until the age of 43 to share this with others, and she began taking hormones. She has been dreadfully ill with crone's disease and diabetes for much of her life. Knowing this, I was concerned that the stress of coming out and transitioning would put her back in the hospital, but her response was: "Coming out was the best thing I ever did. The weight of the world is off my shoulders."
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be too hard on yourself, life is often a struggle anyway. Love yourself, if you are a man trapped in a woman's body you still deserve love just as much as everyone else.

       I've had the exact same discussion with a friend last week! There are so many other things in life that can make me happy, that I should try to stop focusing on my disorder and do things that I love and bring me joy. It worked the first 2 days, then I was crying of anger again looking in the mirror. But I keep thinking, if it worked for 2 days, it can work for 3, and then 4, etc... I will definitely try my best for that to happen.

       That's awesome for your friend! In my opinion, it might be easier to see it as something off your shoulders when you get older. Because you have been going through it for all your life so you see it as a deliverance. In my case I'm still young, barely starting life and I saw my coming out more like something that would ruin my life instead of something great. I had many dreams until I realized how bad my dysphoria was, I felt as if my whole world was destroyed. Now I can't help but think being trans will affect every aspect of my life, and  I will never be able to be """"normal"""".

       So if gayness is a mental illness, do you think it should be treated or that it is possible to have some therapy or drug that will make you straight again?
      </p>
      <p>
       The American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from its official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973. So it appears that the professionals or specialists in this area currently disagree with you, and further it is clear that the definition of a mental issue or disorder can change over time.

       I'm not big on medication unless absolutely necessary, given the current predicament of widespread overmedication. As homo/transsexuality deal with mental issues, it's entirely possible that (real) counseling can do wonders in fixing things. There are degrees of the type of counseling that can be done before medication is required, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's always the ethical question of forcing someone who is mentally ill to take medicine, of course, but when the entire society is damaged by the actions of an individual or group (no matter the size), and when objective fact is telling us something contrary to their beliefs or actions, there's little debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, take a group of arsonists. Say they're so overcome by their urges that if you put a match in their hands they'll immediately set fire to something. This doesn't work. Society can't function like that. They have an otherwise normal behavior set (this is where the analogy departs from homo/transsexuality), but will burn (poz) anything they can WHENever they can.

       It is objectively in THEIR benefit–as well as society's–to medicate/remand to psychiatric care/otherwise help them, and so it
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still haven't answered your question, though. Yes, absolutely homo/transsexuals should be treated. The fostering of their mental illnesses is part of a larger campaign to commit genocide (by the UN definition thereof) on all
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       a specific group of people. Even if it was not, the fact that they are objectively mentally ill is reason enough to help them.

        The American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from its official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Indeed they did! Do you know WHY?
       <strong>
        History time!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, also known as the DSM, is the official list of mental disorders to which all mental health professionals refer when diagnosing patient. The first version, released in 1952, listed homosexuality as a sociopathic personality disturbance. In 1968, the second version (DSM II) reclassified homosexuality as a sexual deviancy. Soon afterward,
       <strong>
        gay protesters began picketing
       </strong>
       at the APA's annual conventions, demanding that homosexuality be removed from the list completely. Members of the APA had their lives–and the lives of their families–threatened by gay activists. In 1973, after intensive debate and numerous disturbances by gay activists, the APA decided to remove homosexuality from its next manual (DSM III). What followed was a swarm of outrage from psychiatrists within the APA who disagreed with the decision and demanded that the issue be reconsidered.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1974, a
       <strong>
        referendum
       </strong>
       was called and approximately 40% of the APA’s membership voted to put homosexuality back into the DSM. Since a majority was not achieved to reverse the decision, homosexuality remains omitted from the APA’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. To the
       <strong>
        LGBT community
       </strong>
       , this omission from the DSM was a logical move.
       <em>
        They
       </em>
       felt that, absent from any unbiased social-science research to prove that homosexuality is inherently pathological, the only thing that had been keeping homosexuality in the DSM was societal prejudice. However,
       <strong>
        many in the
       </strong>
       <strong>
        <em>
         scientific
        </em>
       </strong>
       <strong>
        community
       </strong>
       have criticized the APA’s decision to remove homosexuality from the DSM, claiming
       <strong>
        its motives were more political than scientific.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Ronald Bayer, author of the book
       <em>
        Homosexuality and American Psychiatry
       </em>
       , writes:
      </p>
      <pre><code>“The entire process, from the first confrontation organized by gay demonstrators to the referendum demanded by the orthodox psychiatrists, seemed to violate the most basic expectations about how questions of science should be resolved. Instead of being engaged in sober discussion of data, psychiatrists were swept up in a political controversy. The result was not a conclusion based on an approximation of the scientific truth as dictated by reason, but was instead an action demanded by the ideological temper of the times.”
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Along these same lines, a recent radio documentary on the subject of homosexuality revealed that the president-elect of the APA in 1973,
       <strong>
        Dr. John P. Speigel, was a “closeted homosexual with a very particular agenda.”
       </strong>
       Another of the reasons APA members were so quick to vote in favor of homosexuality’s removal from the DSM, according to Dr. Joseph Nicolosi, is that many in the psychiatric profession had “failed to identify, with certainty, the psychodynamic causes of homosexuality, and consequently to devise a reasonably successful treatment for it.” It should be noted that although the psychiatric profession as a whole has failed in treating homosexuals,
       <strong>
        there are still many psychotherapists who report great personal success in such treatment.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       While the medical profession in general has done much to advance our knowledge of human functioning, in some cases it seems that modern medicine seeks to recognize or diagnose only those problems that it believes it can remedy. I (not me; storyteller) found this out a few years ago when I experienced an unexplained twitching in my eye. (The medical term is “blesphorospasm.”) I visited a general practitioner, two optometrists, an ophthalmologist, and a neurologist and underwent a thirteen-hundred-dollar MRI only to be told I had no problem. Although a few of the physicians were able to name my symptom, none could tell me, with certainty, what was causing it. It wasn't until I visited a doctor friend of my dad’s (whose alternative methods were not recognized as legitimate by my insurance company) that my problem was diagnosed and corrected. And, I might add, he charged me only forty-five dollars. Gordon Dalbey writes, “I am convinced that the American Psychiatric Society [sic] removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses simply because the psychiatrists were tired of failing in their human efforts to heal it.” He suggests that the reason much of secular psychiatry has failed in treating those with unwanted homosexual desires is that it has ignored the spiritual component of this process. Dalbey points out that homosexuality is something that “only the Father God can heal.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Another factor in the APA’s decision to remove homosexuality from its list may have been
       <strong>
        the perception that there were not many homosexuals who desired
       </strong>
       therapy to change their orientation. This perception may have been fueled by the fact that
       <strong>
        ex
       </strong>
       -gays were not nearly as vocal in 1973 as they are now. I (again, not me; storyteller. he's an ex-gay, by the way) take issue with the fact that the APA and many other professional organizations have moved far beyond just saying that homosexuality is not an illness, and instead are now saying that reorientation therapy could potentially “harm” someone tying to change from gay to straight. Groups like the American Psychological Association, the National Association of Social Workers, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have upset a large portion of their membership by rejecting the idea that homosexuals can change. In doing this, most of the major psychological associations have turned their backs on people But there are still hundreds of mental health experts successfully treating homosexuals; they just aren't advertising it. This is because doing so could get them into trouble, if some gay activists have their way. There has been a move in the APA to make treatment of homosexuality a violation of professional conduct for a psychiatrist, even if it's done at the patient's request.

       My understanding is that the vast majority of those few gays who undergo therapy in an effort to become straight, eventually end up accepting that they are gay.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also note that I have repeatedly noticed a pattern among those who claim that homosexuality is an illness. The pattern is that they are themselves, closeted gays. I will not guess at their motivations, except to say that if you discover that you yourself are gay, I would not be very surprised. There is nothing wrong with it, and it harms nobody. I hope that you find some peace in accepting your gayness; while I don't believe that people can choose whether or not they are gay, they can choose to accept themselves as they are, or not. Good luck to  you,

       You've noticed no such thing. You're repeating what the paid shills say, having done no research on the subject yourself. If "homophobes" are closeted, then arachnophobes are actually spiders. It's complete fucking bullshit to think this. Do you have an actual reply to anything I've posted?

       In fact, you provided not one single study, or (more useful) meta-study of any of your claims. You just rambled on listing a bunch of random ideas claiming that homosexuality is actually mental illness.

      <p>
       I don't think this discussion is useful for either of us; I know what I believe, and you appear pretty interested in maintaining your point of view, whatever your reasons may be. I think the best thing to do now is simply agree to disagree, and move on.

       There are some cultures that accept people not only as they are but as they want to be.  Our culture makes everything an illness.  And judging by tv, film and advertising, makes everybody
       <em>
        unacceptable
       </em>
       ,  by creating impossible standards that aren't even real on their own merits (CGI, airbrushing)
      </p>
      <p>
       By calling your transgenderism an illness, you are judging yourself as 'aberrant from normalcy'.  What's normal?  Even psychiatrists don't know, that's why when you go to see one, there has not been a single person that has left their offices with a "completely 100% perfect human" certification and clean bill of mental health.  The only exceptions are policemen, because two things, 1) if the evaluators were so strict, we'd be out of police; and 2), the police know where the police psychiatrists live.  For some reason, extreme authoritarianism and towing to a blue line even though it's unethical isn't a mental illness to these people, although to any other body of psychiatric evaltuation or the court-of-public-opinion would say otherwise.  And this is why people get shot in the back because they were resisting arrest and then that police person gets a 2 week paid vacation and then a magical bill of clean health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to make this about police when I really wanted it to be about self-acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am of the belief--for what it's worth to you--that the field of psychiatry is total quackery and that you would do VERY well by yourself to utilize their services only to the extent of justifying any kind of hormones if you continue to be transgender, otherwise, I'd tell them to take a hike and work on accepting who you are, because as a cisgendered person I accept you however you want to be and dont' get 'grossed out by the abnormality of you that you think you are'

       Could have something to do with plastics and how they affect hormones, especially in pregnant mothers.
      </p>
      <p>
       More and more children are being born with higher amounts of estrogen hormone, so male children are more prone to feminine tendencies as a result. Could also explain why some are born homosexual, or with the feeling that they're trapped in a man's body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, less males are born than before in countries high in plastic use. Plastics like drinking bottles, containers for food, etc.

       Questioning it doesn't mean being convinced of it tho ;) There is a difference between someone thinking "I'm very effeminate... Maybe I'm a girl inside?" and someone who terribly suffers because they've been forever convinced they were born in the wrong body

       Point still stands. Someone who is convinced from day one that they are in wrong body most likely has a hormonal imbalance.

      <p>
       I think what you're saying is that personality and bodily functions are separate. I would argue not. The mind and your physical body chemistry are very much linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a person in depression for example is usually the case that the body is missing key ingredients (vitamins, minerals, fats, etc) to make the mind and body happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short body chemistry affects your personality in some way or another.

       It can have a snowball effect. If a male grows up with high levels of estrogen, then it could be assumed they take on higher effeminate characteristics and traits. Maybe this compounding effect eventually lays the framework for the manifestation of the mental disorder you are suggesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is naive to think that culture doesn't play a part. US culture is currently embracing homosexuality and transgenderism. If an individual that I described above allows these influences to impact them is it hard to believe that they'd start wondering if they too are are trapped in the wrong body? Once the seed is planted, how do any of them escape it? They'll never know what's "right" until they experiment with it. But by that point, to what extents have their internal dialogue gone to be in that position? They might very well be in the position you outlined in your post.

       There's no debate to be had here, to be honest. Gender dysphoria(the main cause of transgenderism) is clearly a mental illness. That doesn't mean it's bad or anything, but anyone denying it's a mental illness is either trying to sound PC or has no idea what a mental illness is.

       "mental illnesses" are just what a body of people agree upon.  If you like to cross the road where you aren't supposed to, well that will be a mental illness soon.  "Crosswalk dysutilization syndrome" coming to DSMVI
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, military intelligence invented the DSM originally in order to discover and label people who would be a threat to the government: ie: nonconformists.  Then it expanded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that such a system could possibly be legitimate if its roots are in that bias?  I don't.  Feel free to disagree but I think psychiatry is quackery.  It helped me 0% for 20 yrs.  I felt like a guinea pig and their 'testing out drugs on me' did nothing but harm me at several points in my life by subtly (sometimes not so subtly) altering my personalty in a bad way--most egregious was lithium which made me violent and nearly got me in a lot of legal trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, sorry to disagree.  It's a designation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took psychedelics and it cured me of a treatment resistant depresssion. (ketamine--it was legal).  This is a very bleeding edge treatment and it worked, but guess what?  not prescribed by a F psychiatrist but by an anesthetist and it was VERY frowned upon by psychiatry.  In fact, when I told them I had gotten ketamine treatment, they flagged me as a drug addict and started asking me substance abused questions.  Which is laughable.  I've only ever been addicted to tobacco and I kicked that shit cold turkey a decade ago and I did it
       <em>
        myself
       </em>
       .  They waxed officious with me when I challenged their beliefs and said, 'now that's just the boundary disobeying typical of borderline personality'... I was like, "no that's a person asking another person a reasonable question".  Then they said I was being defiant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I walked and I've been a happy unmedicated lunatic since.
      </p>
      <p>
       so no they have 0% of a clue.  The field of psychiatry itsef is VERY LIKELY responsible for 75% of all iatrogenic mental disorders, meaning they make stuff worse.  Especially with bipolar, depression and borderline personality disorders.  They probably only really help schizophrenia and non-disorders they call disorders

       Well, that's kinda true but the term "mental illness" does have its own definition that gender dysphoria fits perfectly. If transgenderism isn't a mental illness, then nothing is.

       "Mental illness" is one of these umbrella terms that tries to pull too many conditions beneath it that it has become nothing more than a means to secure research funding, a way to segment healthcare professionals, and a pejorative people can use on the internet. What exactly is similar between someone with schizophrenia and someone with autism other than many people think the person with either condition "acts weird"? Someone who has had a stroke also "acts weird".

       Franz Mesmer who is basically the father of hypnotists was a freemason who splintered off to start his own sect - le ordre de harmonie universelle. Also a member of the Rose Cross. All modern public-facing hypnosis technique stems from him, and it is where we get the word "mesmerize."

       Alright, so I don't wanna get too into this topic but I do wanna chime in on a few things even though this isnt really conspiracy related but since I've commented on similar posts in the past - why not.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So from that point, "sex" or "gender" is just biological, what we call gender identities are just personalities. Yes masculinity and femininity is a spectrum, not gender. Gender only means what you have between your legs so you can reproduce. There is no such thing as a MAN or a WOMAN. We are people, with different personalities and genitals that's all.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't wanna dive too hard into this pit because it's all really just semantics, but it seems that you may be confusing "gender" with "sex", unless you're trying to argue that the definition of "gender" is incorrect or is a conspiracy within itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just saw that a few other replies have posted similar things so I suppose I'll stop there as to not be spamming with repetitive crapola.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a hard thing to discuss because the positions vary so drastically, and with that being said I guess everything in life that pushes away from the accepted norms could be portrayed as a mental disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you grow up on one side of the fence, curious minds will wonder what it's like on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're here for a very limited time and we don't get to choose our genetics.  If our consciousness is aware of the differences and through our own life experience and the inadequacies we perceive throughout our life journey could greatly affect the internal dialogue of ones self that helps build the foundation for further frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a feeling that if we were all offered a character selection screen that we'd be surprised at the amount of people that would like to experience the other half of the human experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is hard and hard to understand, not everything is so black and white and it's hard to make sense of everything in the midst of chaos.  Seek truth, seek happiness, seek stability and explore your mind. It's all we really have.  I'm sorry that the way you feel has caused you so much unhappiness, just do yourself a favor and try to enjoy the cards that you've drawn.

       I've definitely wondered the same thing. For now I just have questions and not answers. I wonder how much of "feeling like a certain gender" has to do with what we define as masculine and feminine. The only thing that's truly masculine is having a penis and that's pretty much it. A similar story females. So I wonder if it's environmental... boys are taught to act one way and girls another, so if a girl naturally likes typical boy activities, maybe she could get confused? And maybe her ideas about herself do influence how the brain is wired over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of agree it's some form if mental illness. Shouldn't all parts of a person's body work together? If the physical characteristics all work fine but the mind doesn't agree with them... that sounds like a mental illness to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm gay, and I've wondered if that's some form of mental illness too, especially since mental illness runs in my family. But then again, maybe my sisters depression, my bother's Asperger's, and my homosexuality are results of the stressful environment we grew up in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe until the "cure" for gender identity disorder, as you put it, is found, the best we can do is continue to push for transgender people to be accepted, while working on some way to treat the underlying disorder.

       Yes I agree it might have a lot to do with the environment we grew up in, and our mental health background. My experience definitely doesn't apply to every trans person, but I know I was already subject to "mental illnesses" because of my family. On top of that, I grew up in a very "masculine" environment with people telling me being "feminine" was wrong, I always naturally looked up to men and now all this simply resulted in severe gender dysphoria. That's only a guess for what happened in my case, everyone will have a different story.

       I agree with this pretty much. "Gender" may or may not exist in some objective and historically universal sense; sex, on the other hand, is a paradigm that, in its really occurring form, is never modelic or perfect but all approximations to the hypothetical model that lead to the physical reproduction of the individual (and, of course, the species), of which there are historically billions upon billions, necessitate the understanding that the aforesaid paradigm of binary sexual difference among humans is an objective reality, the essential objective reality of humanity. Nothing else is as real and also as human as sexual reproduction because nothing else is as fundamentally necessary to our arrival at, and presence in, this current point in time. What populates the mind of the sexually reproduced human is and can be anything, including the motivation to undo the binary sexual reality that led to the formation of such a mind by sciences that might make chimeras of our descendants, but that which formed us can never be erased from our reality because a historical reality has consequences that will not be repressed, no matter how much we try, because we will never be fully able to control what we will never fully be able to understand: the undeniable, but imperceivable, reality of our past, the 'dark' reality that controls us ineluctably precisely because it is 'dark,' the 'ignota' at the heart of who we are, and whose undeniable--the only undeniable--testament of fact is sexual reproduction.

       First of all, some things need to be cleared up. The key factor that people often miss is the relationship between sex and gender and is really the core of this issue. Gender is typically defined as the cultural expression or characteristics associated with a particular sex. Here's what the World Health Organization says about gender:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Gender refers to the socially constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men. It varies from society to society and can be changed. While most people are born either male or female, they are taught appropriate norms and behaviours – including how they should interact with others of the same or opposite sex within households, communities and work places.
        <a href="http://www.who.int/gender-equity-rights/understanding/gender-definition/en/">
         WHO - Gender
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Gender is not clear, not necessarily binary, and is largely a social construct. This is why the terms are
       <strong>
        gender
       </strong>
       identity, trans
       <strong>
        gender
       </strong>
       , etc; and why terms like transsexual are discouraged. Sex is typically binary--although there are conditions which affect this (hermaphroditism, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       There really is no normal, it's a myth. Regardless of whether hormones and gender reassignment surgery are "normal" or not, some people are happier after doing it--and some people are not. What matters is what you want to do. If you don't want to do it, then don't. You're the judge as to what constitutes whether something is disorderly.

       Sometimes, for whatever reason, the process that erases the memories from past lives does not seem to complete.  Which is to say:  some people remember being of a different sex just like some people remember being of a different family.  Depending on how strong those feelings become or are initially can result in some uncomfortable situations.  I do not think this is a mental illness more than it is a problem with the universe.  Best of luck OP.

        So from that, to all the jerks who hate on us saying we are mentally ill, well DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEN. Find that freaking miraculous pill that will stop gender dysphoria, because no I don't want to mutilate my body and take hormones, I just have to for my own happiness!

       The issue is that social progressives have dropped the hammer down
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       on people who insist that it's a mental illness, and are instead dedicated to enabling said mental illness. This makes it incredibly controversial (to say the least) to open up any sort of tests and/or trials for a treatment that could potentially address the problem. The major obstacle in that road is that an extremely vocal and rather large percentage of the population absolutely refuses to acknowledge that it is a problem, and will suppress any dissenting views, sometimes violently.

       It's hard to sell self-determination, personal responsibility, independence, a balanced view of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you package a product or service to someone who is adaptable, is perfectly satisfied with having bare essentials because their happiness isn't tied to status, identity or things, and thinks clearly and objectively about their real problems versus their perceived problems?
      </p>
      <p>
       These new forms of mental illness are to be expected. As there are less and less things to worry about and problems to solve, people invent their own problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say you cry yourself to sleep every night and that you have wanted to be a boy for a long time. Let me tell you a little secret, everyone has moments when they want to be someone else. They want to feel empowered, or attractive, or strong, or independent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a guy so I'll tell you what it feels like to be a man. You want to stick your dick somewhere. There is this desire that wells up inside of you as you enter puberty to penetrate, mouth, ass, pussy, breasts, thighs, armpit, elbow, knee. You just want to rub your dick up against some warm soft and velvety skin attached to a set of pretty eyes and inviting lips. You also want to give pleasure, you want to cum and make a woman groan with ecstasy. Since you're like 13, you can't express this emotionally or physically, so you learn to suppress your urges and control them. You do stupid things to show to girls how brave, strong, funny, amazing you are. You fight the sudden urge to vomit when you are torn between talking to a beautiful woman and running away. Your body is on fire all the time and you fall in love over and over and over again. Internet porn gives young men an immediate form of relief from this constant environmental overstimulation. As you get older the desire to bang any attractive thing doesn't diminish, but you temper it with logic and you weigh the pros and cons. Often you exercise self-restraint, which is why we don't have a massive rape epidemic worldwide with every woman having to carry a gun to defend herself against every man. For men as we age we place less emphasis on sex and more on what makes a good mother, a reliable partner, an understanding soft and forgiving nature, this is why the shrill screaming feminist stereotype is so antithetical to what any normal man would want.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you say you want to be a man, what does that mean? Do you have a phantom penis where you see something that attracts you visually and you feel an invisible tingle, the urge to dominate and penetrate a beautiful soft thing? You can be a masculine girl and still be very sexy and feminine, look at the crossfit women for example. Most guys would love to be with a girl like that and I'm sure lesbians go crazy over abs on a girl and being dominated sexually by a fit athletic woman with great stamina. So whether you are attracted to men or women, you can easily train your body to reflect your inner personality, without destroying it's natural order with surgery and drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You were born a female, you have the generative power inside of you, a mother's womb, the ability to grow a child and nurture it. This is what the mother goddess and earth religion cults of hundreds of thousands of years ago worshipped, the woman, the creator, the life giver. How can you hate this part of yourself or reject it? It's beautiful and transcends everything else in the human experience. If every woman felt like you do, we would all end up dying in 1 generation.

       Belief is a mental illness. Your beliefs are hurting you. Your inclinations towards expressing the full spectrum of your personality aren't harmful, it's your refusal to act upon them because of your institutionalized fears of not conforming with the map of the world that you've confused with reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Illness, requiring harm, can appear difficult to define. Is it more harmful to oneself to educate bigots or is it more harmful to buy drugs that inhibit your will?

       As a Thelemite, my will trumps all else. But I've got no desire to transition from one cultural cage to another. I desire to dissemble the cages and build a shining new tower of gender inclusivity that abuses technology towards the fulfillment of our collective wills, rather than using it to inhibit the same.

       First off, I am in a very similar position to you, and I empathize. I am transgender but very heavily closeted, living in a town with one of the highest ratio of churches to population in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a couple things wrong with your argument. Your terms are improperly defined. There is a difference between
       <strong>
        sex
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        gender
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a 100% necessary distinction to make to even begin to understand the discussion.
       <strong>
        trans
       </strong>
       gender means
       <strong>
        gender
       </strong>
       does not match
       <strong>
        sex
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Sex
       </strong>
       is defined by genitals and physical body makeup.
       <strong>
        Gender
       </strong>
       is defined by whats in the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your understanding of
       <strong>
        gender
       </strong>
       is incomplete. You talk about "femininity" and "masculinity" as if these are the only things that constitute gender, but this is an incomplete picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the phenomenon of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_limb">
        phantom limbs
       </a>
       . When a limb is amputated, the brain still contains a sort of "blueprint" that believes that limb should still be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is essential to understanding what is going on in the case of gender dysphoria. Transgenderism isn't referring to someone who simply has a
       <strong>
        personality
       </strong>
       that doesn't match their
       <strong>
        sex
       </strong>
       . In gender dysphoria, the relevant aspect of
       <strong>
        gender
       </strong>
       is the part of the brain that corresponds to the
       <strong>
        sex
       </strong>
       of the person, where the two are mismatched. The brain develops to handle one set of genitals, and the body develops a different set of genitals.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's worth noting that most things we think of as being inherent aspects of gender, constituting masculinity and femininity, are not based on differences in the brain. By this I mean there are actually very few, if any, born-in differences between men and women in terms of personality.

       This is what everybody says yes, but really there isn't anything that proves that to be true right? How can you know there really is a gender in your brain. If it's true, what actually makes a man or a woman then? Most people who don't have GID don't even think gender exist, it's like only our community has made this up so we could explain our feelings

      </p>

       Those are part of the blueprint of reality designating two body types and functions. But as you know your body type, and how you identify yourself can be in conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now think outside the box with me for a moment. You bring up identity. Your personality is an energy gestalt of Essence. And your Essence creates many lives simultaneous to this one. And in essence, these lives are all connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       When manifesting into this reality essence chooses a gender for each life. But, essence may choose, for example, 100 female lives, but 900 male lives.
       <br/>
       So if you are one of the female lives, you would have the influence of 900 male lives being lived within the gestalt action of your personality, and that would then be influencing of you in how you identify yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       When considering the identity most people think in terms of one thing. No, it's not like that, the identity is larger than is believed to be in the mainstream. And it is very connected to an even larger portion of itself. Of yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also why the transgender movement has a lot of confusion. There is no understanding of identity. But basically you are a predominantly male energy because you have more male lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this can shed more light on your situation. If you want to look more into the concept of Essence identity and multiple lifetimes try the Elias sessions , best wishes.

       very interesting thanks for sharing. To me it's still a proof that it is a mental illness, there's no man or woman inside us. It's just a condition in our brain that prevents us from being happy if we don't have the body of the opposite gender... To make it short

       Yes, they are different. Some trans people experience the former. If you only experience the latter, you are right to have pause about medical transition.

       for one thing, there's a stigma on mental illness.  every personality trait that is potentially negative could probably be classified by the american psychiatric association.  and frankly half those shrinks could probably be sectioned.  what is determined to be a mental illness seems in large part based on social values.
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as gender dysphoria- how much of that is nature and how much nurture.  why do men raised by over anxious mothers often end up more effeminate and troubled?  how much of the issue is potentially hormonal?
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe you feel trans because of how you were treated at key points in your maturation process.  maybe you have been treated more like a boy than a girl because you have more traditionally masculine features, and as such you'd prefer to identify as male.  maybe you have a hormone imbalance that drives you to feel masculine.  maybe you have more generalized identity issues and a gender swap just feels like the most obvious solution- it gives you an obvious facade so you can blame THAT when people judge you, rather than your personality or "natural" look.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't an objective answer right now, because the "science" only goes so far when we're talking about human issues.  What's the end goal- to feel good about yourself?

       I agree when you say my condition might be the result of many things, but sure as hell not of feeling uncomfortable being myself in front of other people. Everyone around me said masculine women were awesome and bla bla bla, when I tried to come out, but really this isn't how I feel. I hate having the body of a woman, I want to be the man I always thought I'd grow up to be. I don't give two shits what people think, if I just felt masculine I would keep on being that way.

        Gender only means what you have between your legs so you can reproduce
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is 100% false. What you have between your legs is what portion you are contributing to the furthering the replication of the species. Your mental outlook thus must align with that physiology in order to carry out your role in the two gender species.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a female, you will want to attract the opposite sex and the opposite for a male. In order to do this, you must be mentally aligned and stable according to the physiology of your species. Otherwise you will not reproduce. You simply won't have the mental inclination to.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, if you are a man and you have male genitalia, in order for you to be a contributing member of the race you must not only look the part, you must also be able to adapt to the role. That role entails being masculine. Masculinity is a role made up of achievement and logic and being able to provide and take what is necessary to ensure you not only procure a female, but provide for her and your children.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other side of the species is female. The role entails a certain mental standard that attracts a male by being opposite in features and attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing with being of one sex and another mental attitude is that it is a complete contradiction to the progression of the species.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are reasons this happens. Like over population of males in mothers. There have been studies that show that the woman's immune system attacks a mother's male child. This occurs when a mother has too many males. They come out feminine and homosexual. There are many aspects of human breeding that are still a puzzle but one can assume our genetics has a way to deal with over population by creating variants. One can see the physical difference in women attracted to other women. They tend to be masculine and carry more testosterone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biology is everything. It creates the mental through bio-chemical mechanics. It not only is responsible for physical features, it is responsible for hormonal distribution through physical glands. And the resulting development due to those chemical balances or imbalances.

       What you say might be very true, but to me it still doesn't explain GID. Because there are many masculine women and feminine men, but surely not all of them want to change their body to become the opposite sex. You will find butch women who are attracted to girls, but won't want to become a guy

       Fetal ultrasound was found to produce subtle indicators of brain damage, such as increased incidence of left handedness. Homosexuals also have a higher incidence of left handedness.

       <p>
        Lalumière et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 20 studies with a total of 6,987 homosexual and 16,423 heterosexual participants. They found that homosexual men had a 34% greater odds of non-right-handedness, and homosexual women had a 91% greater odds (39% overall).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So much of the great increase in homosexuality may be due to fetal ultrasound. Which is another reason to treat homosexuals fairly and equally since it is likely something done to them.

       It most likely is, but I think that's OK and we should still accept them (you) as we'd accept anyone else and do our best to make you feel welcome and normal. :)

       OP I feel for you, truly I do. You must be going through some hard times to have come to such a conclusion. Regardless I just came here to say that you're presenting your opinion as fact to countless people here who have no ability to separate facts about trans people from opinions about us. The fact is that I disagree with you on just about every point. First off, transition is an emotional fuck-show of a ride, but it's worth it to so many transgender individuals out there besides you. Secondly, my identity (gendered or not) is who I am when I strip away all of society's expectations of me and just live my life authentically. The fact that my identity happens to align with what society has predefined as "feminine/female" is no comment on my own individual mental facilities. You're so focused on labels and "science" that you seem to have forgotten that we transition to feel comfortable, to feel free to be ourselves openly. Let go of what's expected of you as male or female, let go of this obsession with labeling who you are and just live your life as well as you can. That being said, next time these feelings become too much too handle, try posting on one of the more trans-supportive forums out there. Posting this sort of thing here reinforces a lot of negative misconceptions some people have about what it is to be trans. I'm not saying that your opinion isn't valid, it's just that your opinion represents a very small minority within the trans community and the manner in which you've presented it here can have a very negative impact.

       I'm sorry you took my message the wrong way... What I was trying to say is that transition is a lot of pain to go through just so we can feel comfortable, and unfortunately it's the only "cure" we know. Trans people deserve as much respect as anyone else, whether they have transitioned or not. I think society should focus more on the disorder in itself, than just being trans. They should talk about it as something real, something that brings huge amounts of pain to those of us who go through it. Those who have transitioned deserve respect for having found the courage to simply do it, and that should show the world how real the issue is. I just hope you get my point :)

       I agree 100%. I totally get your point that the world focuses on the wrong aspects of transitioning and being transgender in general. All I can say to that is, fuck 'em. They probably will never understand exactly how difficult a decision it is to decide to transition but really can we expect them to having never had to make that decision? I used to stress myself out over the whole "maybe i do actually have a mental illness" thing for a long time but it wasn't until I actually accepted that their was nothing in nature that even came close to mimicking our conception of "mentally ill," that I started focusing on what did actually come naturally and that was my gender identity. Anyways, I could go on for days but for the sake of brevity I'll stop here. If you're feeling stressed out still or just want to talk things out then feel free to pm me, us trans folk need to stick together :)

       Yes that's why the media should focus on the fact that GID is a real disorder and the choice to transition is simply so we can live better lives.

       This demonstrates that you are largely ignorant about the history of treatment for this condition, as it was originally dismissed, as it being still dismissed in this thread and by medical professionals the world over, as not a real condition, as imagined suffering. A long line of caring medical professionals beginning with Magnus Hirschfeld and Harry Benjamin had to fight hard to develop best practices in treating trans people. There are still only a tiny but loud minority of medical practitioners willing to learn about and treat the condition. It is early days yet, but things are looking better by the day. 
If you are opining that thinkpieces and opeds on web magazines don't talk about the medical component as much, well, they never will, except for the brief and few moments when and if new treatments become available. It is more "fun" and gains more eyeballs to be sensationalist about it and focus on the novel aspects of trans lives. In-depth articles on latest brain research are not exactly front page headline material.

       Find a good hypnotist.  By good I mean real hypnotist that has been helping people for many years.  It isn't perfect, but if they know what you are doing they can have most people cured in just a few sessions.

       EDIT: not just good, try to make sure they are a good-hearted person who isn't obsessed with making money.  They need to get to know you and actually care about who you are as a human being.

       Congratulation, dumbdreamer, for your efforts.
Sorry for my english, I consider that I have other skills better than written english... At least I hope.
I just want to share with you one point of view, being a bit familiar with this issue, not being a trans myself, but having my daughter in the same situation as yours. We have a hard time because of this, everyone is suffering and we are seeking for a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is humanly to try to get out of this suffering, isn't it? But without trying to be sadistic, I ask myself (and you), why? Actually, I want to point to the motivation. Of course it is a lot of pain and nobody want it. It is natural to try to get a better life, and in your case you are not looking for something too luxurious, but to have peace with yourself. It is very natural, and I agree 100%.
It is natural that someone is looking to increase the quality of life, but is more that natural (if you want supra-natural) that someone suffer for the quality of life of someone else! There were many doctors that instead of choosing an easy life style on their home they choose to do their duty and go into war zones to preserve others lives risking their own ones. They do this because they consider that it is something more important than their own life. An you know what? It is honourable to die for someone, but it is something more than this: to live for someone! When you love someone so much, you will have to die to yourself each day!
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is my point? Look deeper into this problem and save yourself before it is too late. I don't think that you will be able to find a satisfactory solution before finding the answer to the question: which is your duty? Go to the bottom line. Is it the quality of my life the last criteria that will drive me into this life? Or could be something more important than this? At the bottom line, which is the meaning of this life? Is it any at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       I rest confident that if you will find the answer to that question, your pain will not reduce, but it will make sense. you will understand how to align all your life to that meaning. And there, in pain, you will find a supra-natural peace that you make your duty that will empower you to fight that war from inside you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can debate many years on the surface of the problem: is it an illness or not? Is it a problem with trans / bi / homo etc? Is it good or not? Depend how you define the good? If you have an objective in life, something is good if it helps you get there. Which is the objective (if any) of any of us? Of a community? Of o country? Of the human race? Who established that objective?
When you will find that really you have a meaning in this life, and a magnificent one, and that someone gave you that meaning and love you so much, you will start loving that person with all of you, and you will start live for him!
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that are many that will start throw rocks on me, that will say to stop smoking weed, or to start smoking... But, as I said, I also live with this struggle for many years in my family, so I try not to play with words, but looking for the truth. I prefer to confront a sad truth rather than a nice lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be blessed

       What you say makes lots of sense, I definitely have very severe GID which impacts my life on every aspect, but I know I am not a man in any way. I still know who I am, I'm not feeling an imaginary dick down there lol. Let's say I feel like a little boy who hasn't got the chance to grow up to be like all the other men... I want to have a beard like them, have a low voice like them, and everything that comes with it, but I know I can't have those things naturally.

I can't relate to your condition, or maybe everyone can, and we just use different words to say the same things (yet consider ourselves different).
You don't have to feel alone, different, or out of place. I think you're taking a healthy approach to all of this.

       Why does everything have to be a mental illness? Why aren't people allowed to have preferences without being labeled and thrown into a box by authoritarian control freaks?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not necessarily directed at you OP, just at the idea of calling transgenderism mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's already known that things like sexuality aren't binary and are incredibly fluid, that it can change overtime, and isn't hardwired genetically.

       Haha I get you. What I'm trying to say is that being transgender shouldn't be viewed neither as a choice, or an identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a disorder, and transition is what allows us to live better lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having GID doesn't mean you are gender non conforming, it means you feel extremely uncomfortable in the body you're in and the wish to have the opposite gender's body is so strong that it affects your everyday mood/life.

       Yes, it literally is, 'gender dysphoria'. The problem is that the 'psychiatric professional community' has decided 'reassignment' to be an effective treatment. Of course it obviously isn't, by definition that it furthers the disruption of healthy functioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why have they become so confused about this very simple and obvious fact? Incorrect associations of 'masculinity and femininity', 'male and female traits' with behavior patterns considered generally desirable or undesirable for mankinds future development; generally boiling down to 'sociability'.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short it's just another aspect of the general cultural jihad against 'masculinity' as an emblem of 'the old ways' of independent thinking.

       Well said. I'm gay and have taken a lot of flak from gay/trans peers for sharing a similar sentiment. Basically, I argue trans people need therapists, not surgeries. When I read about
       <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/culture/lgbt/transgender-suicide/">
        the suicide rates in the trans community,
       </a>
       it's usually left-wing apologists suggesting "society was too intolerant." However, I've known people who have gone through the transition, thinking, "when I'm the opposite gender, I'll be happy."
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        You'll never be the opposite gender (science)
       </li>
       <li>
        If you can't be happy now, and accept yourself now, why go through this radical and costly procedure and demand everyone else accept you for who you never were in the first place?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       My 2¢.

       I don't think transition is either all bad nor all good, it depends. I think what would make a transition successful, is doing it being fully aware of our mental health. The biggest mistake trans people make is deciding to transition while they are severely depressed. That will affect their logical thinking, and self awareness. I think those who transition while being mentally healthy are the ones who get out of it even happier. I know we can have GID and have stable mental health, which means no depression/ anxiety etc. It really depends on who does it, their life experiences and what they're expecting from transition.

       The only difference between your experience now, and the experience of people of your situation in the past, is that today we have PC people ready to pander to anything. In the past no one would have supported your right to be mentally ill. Psychiatrists would have worked to get you healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that this reply is going to be downvoted. That's because PC is now seen as being more desirable than sense. People desire to be popular and conforming to the latest fad is the path to glory. So we see a self-reinforcing belief system that's based on currying favour rather on rationality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, neither your condition, nor the condition of the PC's is all that unusual. It's been going on forever. What's changed is that now we have the internet. PC people believe that they have the right, and obligation, to impose their views. The 'net gives them an unprecedented platform. As a result all kinds of mindless crap has gone mainstream, enforced by the self-righteous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So afraid are they of being publicly outed by PC extremists that medical and psychological professionals have caved. Science has no place in PC conformity. Worse, PCs have given license to practice to unscrupulous surgeons performing "corrective" surgery on children who are only suffering the same issues that children have encountered in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said, everyone has sexual issues of identity and preference. It's part of the baggage we carry for being animals of (at least some) intellect. Recall when you were you were very young. Like everyone you went through a period of experimenting with your own beliefs about everything, including the nature of sex. In the past, responsible people would have shown you your error and helped you to a more mature understanding. Today people in the same position encourage children to be "individuals" regardless of how crazy that might be.

       The trendiness of 'trans' has to do with an agenda by the NWO occultists.  The male/female 'nonbinary' concept is a reference to Hermes and a few other of the symbols in their mythos.
      </p>
      <p>
       This information has been slow to come out because
       <a href="http://www.spirituallysmart.com/Paris-The_Secret_History_of_Jesuits_1975.pdf">
        the Vatican's role in the NWO
       </a>
       isn't predominantly known at this point, let alone that of
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/theTwoBabylons">
        the occultists for which they're fronting
       </a>
       .  That role is set to

        increase
       </a>
       , by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes all the way back to the Babylonian Gnostic 'mystery priests', and their effort has been tracked from the original Babylon, Chaldea and Sumeria through the Medo-Persian empire, into the Greek, through the Roman, and then the Roman Empire went underground and opted to present as a church in response to legit Christianity.  There is also
       <a href="http://youtu.be/gTL0PM9CdNE">
        compelling evidence
       </a>
       that they developed Islam wholesale as a way to pave over the legit Christians in the Middle East without taking the PR blowback for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their occult symbolism presents as Christian, but is instead rife with
       <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vatican/esp_vatican138.htm">
        Dagonist
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://granddesignexposed.com/sun/baal.html">
        Mithraic
       </a>
       symbolism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Result: Running the NWO effort on behalf of the Babylonian occultists - the Gnostic 'mystery priests' - their various fronts and franchises have been enacting agendas which apply their occult symbolism, particularly that of Hermes who signifies them, and bring it to the fore.  And we end up with social movements, an alt-media and often mainstream media which legitimatize gender dysphoria as a civil rights issue.

       What you are experiencing is a self perception issue (google self perception psychology). It is one component of dysphoria, but at present, dysphoria is used as catch-all term, not segmented enough to describe the different manifestations of it and symptoms it can produce. Another component of dysphoria is feeling that sexed parts of your body are physically alien, like they are overpresent or not at all present in your body map. Simultaneously, sexed organs that appear on the opposite phenotypical sex will be present on the body map, creating phantom sensations. It is hard to describe and hard to comprehend for someone that doesn't experience it. So far, there are only preliminary investigations into prevalence and mechanism of this manifestation. Neurologist V. S. Ramachandran believes it is the same mechanism which causes xenomelia sufferers to lack representation of limbs in their body map.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have this type of "wrong part/missing part" dysphoria and it is extremely unpleasant. It is long term mental torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not experience this, you should really think long and hard about transition because there aren't enough providers and you could be making someone who is really suffering wait for care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statistically, trans people are a minority. It is a very rare medical phenomenon. Because the surrounding word is heavily biased to believe in a sexgender binary and uneducated about the spectrum of sex development, trans people do have to deal with a fair amount of in-group/out-group aggression.

       The way I see it, it is a mental illness but it's not exactly one we should cure or worry about. You having the mental structure of a female if you are a male isn't natural but it doesn't alter your ability to work, love, function, etc. or put you in any danger. so why worry about it? Same with homosexuality. Nothing wrong with it. Live your life how you want. It's not like psychopathy or schizophrenia where they are a danger to themselves or anyone else.

       It's very much a social virus in one aspect, just stop reading watching about it just work on real things in your life.  Part of it is not a mental illness people like to do kinky things in bed, no one cares.  The ancient Spartans were the manliest of men but also had gay sex when away from home.  You want to dress up like the opposite sex go for it and then get on with your life because it's just a distraction.

       What you say makes sense kind of. However I don't agree we can just go on with our lives without thinking about it, if it was the case then it wouldn't be a disorder. It is when it negatively impacts your life, which it does.

       It may very well be a mental illness, same with homo sexuality. I think people are reluctant to speculate as such because of the negative connotation the term mental illness holds. I agree in that these are probably mental illnesses by that they are fairly innocuous and not worth trying to correct. In my mind it is similar to some high functioning levels of autism or add. Those people do not fit well with society as it is constructed, they are fundamentally different and often have difficulty functioning. But there are some huge benefits that they and society receive from these afflictions. It's isn't a coincidence that so many buisness leaders and innovators have this sort of mental disability. Trans and queer people have similar benefits in the way that their illness allow them to see the world in a much more egalitarian way. It is no coincidence that so many of our gender and class equality activists are from the LGBT  and I don't think it is simply because they are from a discriminated subsection of society. I think this is the case because their illness allows them to fundamentally see sides from more than one perspective and rationalized solutions which are more inclusive of different cultures and persons. Similar to how a bipolar person often can be very unstable in some situations but incredibly eloquent about human nature in others. Many of our world's best authors were bipolar because they understand the human condition in its extremes. The stigma of mental illness is the issue not the mental illness itself.

       I'm trying man, I really am. One day I'll be like, hooray I made it out, and the next I'll be punching everything because I hate my body so much. It's not as easy as you think, the disorder is what makes you feel this way, that's why it's there.

       What you say makes lots of sense, I definitely have very severe GID which impacts my life on every aspect, but I know I am not a man in any way. I still know who I am, I'm not feeling an imaginary dick down there lol. Let's say I feel like a little boy who hasn't got the chance to grow up to be like all the other men... I want to have a beard like them, have a low voice like them, and everything that comes with it, but I know I can't have those things naturally.
