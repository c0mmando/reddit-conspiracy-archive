Post about raising your consciousness, not about how it&#39;s being down trodden. Post about free energy and the technologies that can change the world, not the ones bringing us down. Post about love and forgiveness, not hate and sadness. We must embody the change we wish to see, and R/conspiracy doesn&#39;t have to be a gutter. It can be a place of light that gives people hope, offers the message of truth. Don&#39;t post about ignorance, instead encourage investigation and free thinking. We cannot simply dwell on the negative, when our fight  deep down is for a better world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I&#39;ve advocated for a brighter cheerier theme to this subreddit for quite some time  now. Conspiracy shouldn&#39;t be dark and ominous, but rather shining a light on the possibilities of a better world. Magnifying glass/weights of justice theme, rather than men in black trenchcoat and sunglasses theme, is more conducive to the vibe I&#39;m going for. Good post OP.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t simply ignore the negative though, by just talking about all the good things, reality is ignored. We need to be real and speak the truth no matter how sour it is.</p>

<p>Also forget posting. Go do something that changes the world or your self for the better. We don&#39;t need change, change happens all the time no matter what. We want and need global revolution. Simple change is not enough anymore.</p>

<p>Physical place:</p>

<p>DC.  Ok, go there.  Hold up a sign.  Try to lobby a congressperson with your people money.  We&#39;ll be rooting for you from our &quot;useless armchairs&quot;.  Meanwhile, we&#39;re cognitively reinfiltrating those who are infiltrating us.  And THEY are the ones with the power.  And THEY are the ones we&#39;re trying to influence</p>

<p>These 911 faither mindcontrolled bodysnatched zomboids who have done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for this country in the last 15 yrs.  They actually don&#39;t matter.   Because you can&#39;t reach them.  You can only reach those who are reachable.  And so the people to focus on are the people who come here to harass us, and then those peopel who pop in to see what that&#39;s all about.</p>

<p>We must be more fascinating than everyone else.  And the key thing is, we are. This is more interesting sub now than any I&#39;ve ever seen on reddit, with CST and a few others a close second.</p>

<p>If you think I&#39;m some kind of government or commercial shill you haven&#39;t been paying attention.  OR if I am, then you should get behind that corporation because the quality of propaganda is so very good that it&#39;s threatening to mislead lots of people, more so even than standard issue shills, you said so yourself, that&#39;s why you&#39;re taking so much screen real estate to be whining about me.  I mean you can&#39;t have your cake and eat it too--am I a shill or just a dangerous user who spends his whole day on reddit because he&#39;s disabled and living off private income, unemployed and doing this uncompensated like it&#39;s his job.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll get killed by a police, thrown in jail or end up with your car driving itself into a tree.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen what happens to &#39;taking action&#39; in this country. It doesn&#39;t work.  Protest doesn&#39;t work.  The litmus test is that over 6 MILLION people protested the war in Iraq in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_the_Iraq_War">2002-2003 in US alone, 36 Million worldwide</a>.  What did that accomplish?  Did you know that many people participated?  Of course you didn&#39;t.  It wasn&#39;t in the news often.</p>

<p>You must first influence the larger public to give a damn. </p>

<p>You are making a judgment saying that this &#39;armchair activism&#39; is invalid.  But I 100% disagree.  It&#39;s more important than standing out in the heat and pissing off a larger public to induce a police force that will beat you up and pepper spray you so that the news can make money talking about how foolish you were to dare to stand up to the establishment.</p>

<p>Get smarter.  Faster. Nonlinear psychological warfare. Don&#39;t ask anyone here to take action.  It draws even more attention to this sub and puts people here in actual danger from the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with you.  I think talking is the most important thing.  You just have to have fresh ideas to keep people engaged.</p>

<p>The protest of iraq wars in 2002-3 involved 36M people.  Are there more than 36M people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  No there aren&#39;t.  So if 36M people couldn&#39;t do it, why do you think YOU can.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t.  </p>

<p>You have to change CULTURE.  You change CULTURE by producing more CULTURE, and that involves talking, writing, if you don&#39;t have the power to raise an army.  Even if you did, you don&#39;t bring swords to a drone fight.  You have to know when you&#39;re totally totally totally globally outmatched by AI programs and advanced weaponry.  You raise your sword and you&#39;re vaporized.</p>

<p>So stop this not-well-thought-out idea (GOES FOR ALL OF YOU) of taking some kind of action.</p>

<p>Because when you propose that, it does a couple things: </p>

<ol>
<li>) it draws unnecessary attention from the government</li>
<li>) it draws more agents provocateur (ex: people who incite others to &#39;action&#39;)</li>
<li>) it scares tourists from thinking we&#39;re oathkeeper types forming a militia, when we aren&#39;t.</li>

<p>2)  Buy a drone and a GoPro and learn how to operate them.</p>

<p>3)  Set up multiple shadow identities.</p>

<p>4)  Carry a camera with you at all times.  Do not rely on your phone!  Cops with Stingrays can hack it; no doubt the NSA can delete your stuff remotely if they feel like it.  </p>

<p>5)  Learn about critical infrastructure in your area.</p>

<p>6)  Get a vehicle with good ground clearance and practice ramping it over drainage ditches in case you have to evade a road block.</p>

<p>7)  Periodically expose your naked body to EMP energy to short out any chips that may have been implanted in you.  </p>

<p>8)  Spend one weekend a month in a remote area with nothing but a large knife, just in case.</p>

Maybe I&#39;m just a boring guy but are you really dealing with that? The only chips that I know people carry around with them is their phone, and in my opinion its really the only chip the NSA needs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this, OP. It&#39;s rare to hear anyone on the Internet speak of love and forgiveness. The Internet is often an incredibly immature place where egotism prevails over all, so to hear that is very refreshing. I&#39;m so used to the shit flinging on here that my first thoughts sadly are to try to disagree with you, but no, you&#39;re right. Being positive will bring us together.</p>
