       Let's start with a simple commercial on t.v.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtube.com/?#/watch?v=r-j9lwYiB1w">
        https://youtube.com/?#/watch?v=r-j9lwYiB1w
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one I noticed the other day while just staring at backgrounds with the volume off, because that's where the symbols and subliminal plants usually are.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what you are looking for in that commercial is first look at the apparent reflections in the scenes at the beginning. The people who plant symbols do so with inversion and reflection. So if you see an Ad with reflections be on the look out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ok,  Keep going until they are in the pancake house. And look at the word pancakes loosely written and inverted on the glass behind them. And notice that the last three letters when hand drawn resemble the word Sex. Now pause at 19 seconds. S Gomez turns and looks at the word real quick, and then looks back to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Ad then ends with just the last three letters in focus in the background while the man has 'sugar poured on him', an obvious Def Leppard song connection- Sometimes Ads purposely allude to other things in pop culture that are sexy as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically it's a way to link her, and the product, to the idea of sex; which is exciting and bonding and fun. They are each selling you an attraction through subliminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you see how this works...
Please share what you have noticed in your viewing. If there is any interest I will put some others up.

       So it doesn't matter. Has nothing to do with subliminal. I've already called you out, you may keep clouding the place with your stories. it helps us notice who the fakes are.

       Oh, your son left that in your car player? Such a common song for a son to just happen to leave in your car player, a song that has only thirty thousand views....Actually the odds of that happening are staggering, probably about ten million to one. You must be so connected to the pancake song. Glad I was able to help tell your story.

       So he just happened to drive your car to Tennessee, got home, and left the song pancake house in the player. You got in, it was on, you listened to it. Days later, I start a thread about subliminal, and some other guy posts pancake house. You come here, my link doesn't work, but there is a link to pancake house that does? A link to the same site, YouTube, in the same type of link. But that doesn't work, but element 80 pancake house did?

       Oh, wow, you have excellent memory. Let me guess, it's eidetic? Sure. Maybe we can be two of the 50 people at their next concert. Its a small world afterall. Oh wait, we can meet right to bear arms, so there is three if you don't mind.
We can meet there and not talk about the topic, as well.

       I've not concerned myself with the subject of your post because you failed to post a link that worked so that we three could have discussed it.

       There was the topic of Element Eighty and we chatted, waited and chatted. Then you got snarky.

       Interesting. Link works fine. It's Selina Gomez and pancakes in a commercial. It's not that hard to find. Maybe you aren't meant for this game, no hard feelings but this requires some detective work.

       I was looking for a Pancake Commercial not a fucking Verizon Commercial. Certainly would be more inclined to listen to Element Eighty than S. Gomez.

       But seriously pancakes and Gomez was sufficient.  You could of found it with the info I gave. You could of found it with pancakes and commercial and the word recent. Verizon you didn't even need, Gomez you could of added if that didn't work. I have no idea why you and your computer can't find such current events. There is no way you are even going to see the subliminal, give up.

       Your link doesn't work and your content made it dicey in a search. I do not have a TV so S. Gomez and pancakes were my search parameters. I put your link into my phone, my roommates computer and twice into my desktop.

       When I saw
       <em>
        subliminal
       </em>
       I intentionally stopped reading any of the
       <em>
        possible cues or tells
       </em>
       in the body of your
       <em>
        descriptive text
       </em>
       because that would have told me
       <em>
        what I should be fucking seeing
       </em>
       according to you!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll hazard I know more about subliminal adds, music, symbols, NLP, body language and much more than your average redditor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you insult me.
