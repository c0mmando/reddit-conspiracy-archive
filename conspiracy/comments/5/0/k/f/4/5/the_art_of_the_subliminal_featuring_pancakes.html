        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s start with a simple commercial on t.v.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtube.com/?#/watch?v=r-j9lwYiB1w">https://youtube.com/?#/watch?v=r-j9lwYiB1w</a></p>

<p>This is one I noticed the other day while just staring at backgrounds with the volume off, because that&#39;s where the symbols and subliminal plants usually are.</p>

<p>But what you are looking for in that commercial is first look at the apparent reflections in the scenes at the beginning. The people who plant symbols do so with inversion and reflection. So if you see an Ad with reflections be on the look out.</p>

<p>So ok,  Keep going until they are in the pancake house. And look at the word pancakes loosely written and inverted on the glass behind them. And notice that the last three letters when hand drawn resemble the word Sex. Now pause at 19 seconds. S Gomez turns and looks at the word real quick, and then looks back to you. </p>

<p>And the Ad then ends with just the last three letters in focus in the background while the man has &#39;sugar poured on him&#39;, an obvious Def Leppard song connection- Sometimes Ads purposely allude to other things in pop culture that are sexy as well.</p>

<p>Basically it&#39;s a way to link her, and the product, to the idea of sex; which is exciting and bonding and fun. They are each selling you an attraction through subliminal.</p>

<p>If you see how this works...
Please share what you have noticed in your viewing. If there is any interest I will put some others up.</p>

Days later, I start a thread about subliminal, and some other guy posts pancake house. You come here, my link doesn&#39;t work, but there is a link to pancake house that does? A link to the same site, YouTube, in the same type of link. But that doesn&#39;t work, but element 80 pancake house did?</p>

<p>But seriously pancakes and Gomez was sufficient.  You could of found it with the info I gave. You could of found it with pancakes and commercial and the word recent. Verizon you didn&#39;t even need, Gomez you could of added if that didn&#39;t work. I have no idea why you and your computer can&#39;t find such current events. There is no way you are even going to see the subliminal, give up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve not embarrassed myself, nor did the <em>other guy</em> post a link!</p>

<p>As for the simple shared chat between myself and <a href="/u/RightToBearArms">/u/RightToBearArms</a> I rather enjoyed the brief exchange.</p>

<p>About thirty minutes ago, I checked your user history. It isn&#39;t something I do often, as I would lean towards the benefit of the doubt first.</p>

<p>You cannot even properly <em>tag</em> users in here. Joke is on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply asked you to fix your link. You said you did. Would have been happy to dissect the video but you refused to post a working link. Pretty simple.</p>

<p>Then the other two of us started shooting the shit about music. Yes. He deleted a link that confirmed he/she had issues with your link.</p>
