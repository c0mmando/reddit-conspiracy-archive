       I hate that we break our backs and waste hours off our lives to make some greedy fuck that doesn't care about us more comfortable and do less for himself. We slave hours away to give some removed person the life of luxury we should all have. 1 person gets the rewards of 10 people and those 10 people get the left over scraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not how it should be. One human shouldn't have more than another human. That's plain selfishness and egotistical greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't fucking matter our skin color or our "socioeconomic status" it doesn't fucking matter! We are here together to survive but instead we compete with each other, screw over each other, back stab each other, just to "get ahead"
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't take that fucking man made currency with you when you die, and why would you want to leave a bitter taste in everyone's mouth when you finally do kick the bucket!

       Most of these rich people inherited their money. Only some of them actually worked hard to get to where they are. And some of them got there by fucking over everyone else.
This is industrial capitalism at its finest unfortunately. It will always end up funneling the wealth to the top, keeping the poor poor and slowly destroying the middle class.

       "Stealing shit" won't solve my problems and will only hurt me in the end. I'm a firm believer in karma and by stealing from someone else I'm stealing from my self.

       If karma existed there would be alot of dead rich people right now. Unless karma doesn't apply to them in the same way the justice system also doesn't?

       I am a get even type of person so for me its a matter of personal justice. Its either that or bottle everything up and go mad.

       Everything we do is energy. Thoughts and actions are energy. If a rich person is sustainably running a company and bettering himself and his workers he's going to get that positive energy back in return.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we have is ruthless corporations polluting and raping the earth for their own short term gain at the expense of their kids futures and health and wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wether those negative actions a lot of CEO's put out come back to them this life or their next life or whenever, the point still stands that you get what you put out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is energy/vibration. We are like a giant lake or ocean. We are each ripples and each ripple can have a good effect or a bad effect and affect others and yourself either way.

       If you got what you put out some these people would of died a million times over. They would of starved a million times over and suffered a million times over. But they don't, They get richer and richer. More and more powerful. Avoid all justice. Then their family carries on with the same wealth and power.

       I appreciate your opinion but it is only an opinion. If I were to go by what I see and can prove  I would have to conclude karma doesn't exist. Bad things happen to the best people. Great things happen to the worst people. And all kinds of variations inbetween with no statistics that back up Karma. But each to their own belief.

       Thank you for being civil. I know my viewpoints are not accepted by a lot of people and can almost seem esoteric in nature.

       Everything happens for a reason and the steps we are taking today are preparing us for tomorrow wether it be negative or positive.

       That is one thing I've always wondered, how the really evil greedy rich people get away with a lot of things they do to other people and not face that wrath of karma. But maybe they will be at the brunt of their own doing in their next life or the life after that. Either way, we are all one so they are ultimately hurting themselves anyway.

       On a side note I believe alistar crowley spoke words of deep regret on his death bed. I am not sure if that is a fact or a conspiracy I will have to re-check that but I am 95% certain it was true. He started saying "what have I done, What have I done...." on his death bed.

       Everyone eventually realizes the pain they've put others through. Just takes enough self awareness. I've heard about that too and it's not limited to him either there's a lot of people that have done bad things but while on their death bed expressed regret for the actions they did and the pain they have caused. If only they realized it sooner but atleast they realized it

       This is what's wrong with this first world culture of entitlement we've engendered in kids. They actually believe that someone having more than them is wrong, regardless of what they did to acquire those resources.

       Because someone having more than someone is wrong. We are all human why should one kid dig through garbage dumps for food scraps while another person has millions?

       It's not entitlement as much as it is a toxic disease. We are a young primitive culture that can't even keep the environment in check letalone ourselves or our politicians.

       I agree absolutely. I think it's better to spread out the wealth so everyone can live equally a life of mediocrity. Then again, who will own any place that hires others? What if there are those who don't want to do anything and complain about those of us who live said mediocre lives and think we too have too much? What do we do about them?

       Now, while I agree that our current system of government and finance need a complete overhaul, it's hard to say what the RIGHT replacement system/s would be. We need a system that keeps everyone invested in it, gives each citizen the same quality of opportunity to be successful in a variety of ways, doesn't allow a minority of the population to control a majority of the economy's wealth, and instead the economy is held together by the "drive" of the majority of the population. Our currency doesn't effectively give value to the work being done for the "paycheck." The physical labor and production put in by the average employee creates at least 10x more value for the corporation/owner, than the employee earns for the time and effort put in. This is what kills motivation and efficiency in the workplace by employees; the belief that the job itself isn't worth the reward in the end. I don't believe everyone should be equal, as we all encounter those who choose to do less than ourselves but expect the same return, however there definitely needs  to be a greater importance on merit. I'm not able to cover each facet that makes up a sustainable economy, but the major focus of an economy should be to better itself and the population that helped build it. When the rich are the only ones still benefitting off of the physical/mental labor of the employees that helped create the rich in the first place, than that economy is built around making the rich, more rich. I might be wrong with specific details that I failed to cover or mention, but I think all of us in here can agree that the majority of our population isn't being given the credit that they're due for the wealth they have created.

       theres an old comment on one website about people having fun at their jobs, even if they work in military, within boundries etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       modern factory life is without fun, skeleton staff, almost nobody in sight most times, everybody with a brain is depressed, broken down and worn out machines, 40/50/60 hours of boredom making crap for unappreciative customers. the pay and benefits are garbage too. and ripoff health insurance and deductibles...

       Yes exactly.

       We almost need a system overhaul, something new something better but we need to be sustainable.

       We are setting ourselves and our kids up for failure. Oil alone will run out by 2040 if we don't find alternatives.

       I think a good start would be limiting the work week to 3-4 days unless someone wants to work more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been scientifically proven that 3-4 day work weeks are much much better for people mentally, physically, and spiritually.

       It's time we stop this endless consumerism that just fuels this massive machine that continually rapes and pillages this earth just so people can have the newest iPhone and tv at the price of the earth crumbling.

       Globalist Capitalism. People seem to forget that only a few decades ago most people were living a perfect fine middle class lifestyle. A Home, A car/truck, 3 kids, and a dog. Where did that go? Globalism came along an made the labor force of the entire world compete in a race to the bottom. Workers now are a multinational slave force paid horribly for long hours of work. While the ownership class live as kings. Fortunately this system will not stand. It's already dying rapidly an all their money printing wont save it. No one is buying the negative interest rate bullshit. Many countries already want gold for goods.

       You're kicking yourself in the face with that line of thinking. To think one person is "better" than another person because he or she is "stronger" or "smarter" or what have you is really ignorant, no offense man.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care if you're in a wheel chair, I don't care if you're homeless, I don't care if you're a tweaker that smashes car windows every night to get their fix. We are all one and to think of others as unequals is saying that you're not equal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand where you are coming from but the more we keep alienating each other and competing with each other and disenfranchising each other and acting as if we are unequal, the further we will stray from ourselves, each other, and all that is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, no one person is better than the other merely because they have certain skills that the other does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we are to advance as a species, we need to treat each other with respect and equality weather that person is a "dredge" on society or is "striving for greatness"
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the reply but please, please, please! Do not think of others as unequals! That is dangerous thinking!

       You have said nothing of worth in this comment. You believe in nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it really is, is that you want things for free. You want to do nothing and then demand that your fellow man provide for you. "I have provided nothing and deserve everything. Others put in more effort than myself, but we're really just the same. It's not fair that you get more just because you do more."
      </p>
      <p>
       Your selfishness is astounding, and I hope you are ashamed of yourself.

       I never said I want things for free.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I have said, and continue to say, is that no child should be digging through heaps of trash to find scraps of food for his family to eat.
      </p>
      <p>
       No person should go to bed hungry at night.
      </p>
      <p>
       No person should worry about where their next meal is coming from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make me selfish?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it make me selfish I want the best for everyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it make me selfish I don't want to see others suffer while others fine wine and dine themselves and are ignorant and bliss of their fellow man?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jump and shout all you want and call me names but I refuse to believe I'm selfish for merely not wanting a child to have to die of starvation or for someone to worry about something like clean drinking water.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you are ashamed of yourself for defending kids starving to death merely because they don't "deserve something free"

       Oh please. That's life. You want to change the entirety of the natural order? Good fucking luck.

       You're selfish because these aren't the real reasons you think the way you think. These are the justifications you give to others and, probably, yourself.

       Because someone having more than someone is wrong. We are all human why should one kid dig through garbage dumps for food scraps while another person has millions?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not entitlement as much as it is a toxic disease. We are a young primitive culture that can't even keep the environment in check letalone ourselves or our politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but that way of thinking is way too egotistical and self centered. If everyone thought that way this world would be a fucking shit place to live because people like you would hoard it all while throwing scraps to the needy.

       100000%  correct. Today's college kids and their support of a parasitic system like socialism is all the proof anyone needs to see how fucked the future of this country is going to be.
