       Is it wise to just publicly declare your suspicions regardless, in some recorded format?  Should you string them along playing innocent to see who else they could be working with?  What strategies would you employ if you suspected you were in such a situation?

       Surely there are situations where doing this has value.  Like if you know you're watched by multiple groups, and outing your knowledge would ripple observably through the group you've caught out, for the other observers to spot.  I call this move the "Personal Honeypot".  Or maybe this is too Hollywood.

       Could be too Hollywood, but then again I don't know how Satanists/Luciferians/whatever think, so I don't know

       Surely they have some sort of sick obsession with making people suffer, but if you can somehow show that you're not affected, it will hopefully just anger them and make their moves more obvious.  Anger does no good for subtlety.

       I thought I was just suggesting that a person who denies the existence of spooks before affirming their sanity might not be sane in the first place. You know, given the probably certainty that spooks do exist and people do get targeted by them.

       Narcs, stooges, patsies, Manchurian candidates, informants, assassins, law enforcement officers, insurgents... Plenty of spooks in the world and you sit there and imply that OP is crazy for even asking the hypothetical.

       You're putting a lot of words in my mouth here. I didn't deny that surveillance exists, clearly it can and does happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question OP asks is what I would do if I felt I was under surveillance. Considering I can't fathom what I would be doing to warrant such surveillance, I would be concerned that it's an issue with my own mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's simply not enough information within the premise to speculate much further. We don't know if this hypothetical target is engaging in political activism, direct action, whistleblowing, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, my point is calm the fuck down.

       He suspects the CIA, or similar three-letter agencies, of running the mental health institutions, perhaps?
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't need to run them, though. Asking loaded questions like, "Do you think the government is out to get you?", with the implication that if you think they are then you're crazy... is enough for an ordinary mental health worker to, perhaps, believe suspicions should be treated as delusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think many people are locked up for life these days, though. A few weeks to a month or so is enough to cause major interference with daily life. And the legal consequences of a trip to the mental hospital linger in ways which aren't particularly ingratiating.

       Reconnaissance. Reconnaissance. And more reconnaissance. Observe before interacting. "Blend in" while doing so. Get substantial evidence before doing anything, but prepare for the worst in the meantime. Work with them and remember that they're a victim of their handlers as much as you're a victim of their handling.

      <p>
       Don't do anything self incriminating. Use proper opsec. Don't be surprised to find that they're operating using such dated technology. These are pawns you'll be 1 on 1 with. Many might not even be aware of their complicity or that they're following subliminal orders.

       Take your time. Inflitrate their network. Sow discord and chaos the second you get caught. Then it's off to live in the edge for the rest of your brief life before departing from his bodily vessel to your next incarnation.
