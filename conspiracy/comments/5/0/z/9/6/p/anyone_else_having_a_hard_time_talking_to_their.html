Over time, she should open her mind up

       Yeah but who knows anymore. Seems like everything is circumstantial these days. I think assange is legit, but I am frustrated by how un-knowable everything seems right now. Seems like no one can agree on what the facts are, even. Well, as they say, the first casualty of war is the truth.

       You're going to get downvotes but your right.  Arguing with a Clinton supporter is like trying to convince a 6 year old with down syndrome  that 2+2 doesn't equal banana, so beyond the concept and logic it makes one wonder what the point of even attempting.

       Discounting entire groups of people like that isn't doing anyone any favors. I get your frustration, but these are real people who are convinced that they're doing the right thing for this nation. If we don't take them seriously, we can't ever engage them properly and no minds will be changed. There's some people like you say, but there are many on the fringe too.

       To her defense, waking up is harder for some people than others. It all depends very much on how you are raised. You show what you know, and cognitive dissonance is real. I struggled personally for 4 years ignoring all the signs till it was too much. I had only one friend who would listen empathetically and answer honestly. Sometimes that's all we need.

       Here's what you do. You sit down and calmly tell her your world view, present some reasonbly credible evidence about 9/11 and some other key events. Tell her you care about this issue. Then stop talking to her about the issue and tell her that you won't bother her anymore since your world view can be disruptive to hers. Then just wait for her to think about it and you'll find she eventually starts to consider the possibility. We all had to make the decision to become open to this reality and it's important that you don't try to change people brcause it feels too invasive, you have to temp them over.
