       Obviously, she's already crowned herself Queen of the USA--but you'd think her highness would want to do a little damage control and come out from her gilded cage to let us serfs know that she's alright (health wise) and her mental capacity is fully functional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully you've read the KL Roberts "White Paper" (which has been stickied) and understand the
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/fVx8S">
        <em>
         Council on Foreign Relations
        </em>
        has many of the main stream media as members and the conglomerates they work for are Corporate Sponsors of the
        <em>
         CFR
        </em>
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the FBI, it seems they are in collusion with HRC as well, having released the last 2 batches of info regarding her emails over long weekends.  The last batch was released over the July 4th weekend--which also preceded the RNC/DNC Conventions--further assuring the release would get lost in the shuffle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't consume main stream corporate hack news, but from what I've heard through the grapevine there was very little coverage yesterday of the FBI release.  I would expect the corporate hacks to pick up on pieces but continue committing their usual Sins of Omission.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should also be pointed out that a network/cable interview is Not the same as an open press conference.  Interviews are controlled, the questions are agreed upon in writing in advance and the time is limited.  An actual press conference involves an open invitation for members of the press to ask questions (not just pre-selected reporters).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no FREE PRESS unless the reporters are given regular, open access; the article or interview cannot be censored by complicit editors/publishers.  One of the best takeaways I got from George Galloways new documentary
       <a href="http://www.veoh.com/watch/v110198720Zt5NDZfC">
        <em>
         THE KILLING$ OF TONY BLAIR
        </em>
       </a>
       was that one of the keys to Tony Blair's rise was the Deal he made with Rupert Murdoch...I suspect that Hillary may have made some sort of deal with Murdoch as well--which is why FOX "news" has made such a shift in their coverage over the past year or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       My prediction is that HRC will appear on one of the Sunday morning "news" shows in a pre-scripted interview (most likely NBC or ABC).  Other than the Sunday "news" show, there might be a photo op or two, but no in-depth questioning.  Last summer HRC literally roped off reporters like cattle during a small-town parade photo op...you'd think the reporters would get sick of being controlled like slaves at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, those who stick their necks out and do openly criticize HRC tend to lose their jobs, don't they!!!

       A press conference is entirely different than an interview (please see paragraphs 5 &amp; 6 above).  Plus at this point, at least some of the reporters have to be getting tired of looking like stage props.

       This is interesting to me. In the most recent articles about Trump ridiculously being a "time traveler", there is a bit of truth revealed in that his ancestor investigated Tesla. I wonder if this is an artifact of Trump being "team FBI". There is also a bit of leeway in the aspect that the FBI has free range in what they investigate, although being fined afterwards by a third party. It seems the shadow government is more shadow than we previously have conceived.

       She wont do anything but hide, and let the press cook the polls, and cover for her scandals. She has probably been ordered not to say anything. Apparently DHS is now seizing control of the elections too. So her leading or not doesn't even matter. The election is rigged unless it can be exposed by who ever is doing these leaks.

       You're right but it won't matter if it's exposed by leaks.  Look at everything else that's been exposed by leaks and nothing changes.  They don't give a fuck about us or what we think.  They've assumed direct control.
