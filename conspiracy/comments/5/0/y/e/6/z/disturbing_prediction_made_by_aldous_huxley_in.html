<p>&quot;There will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies, so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution.&quot; -- Aldous Huxley, Tavistock Group, California Medical School, 1961 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why do we consciously choose to watch tv and read the news and be brainwashed? Isn&#39;t that what Huxley meant?</p>

<p>David Foster Wallace also wrote a book called Infinite Jest. The book is about a piece of entertainment so enjoyable that it consumes the viewer, absorbs the viewer in synthesis. 
Here is a short and well done video about infinite jest </p>

<p>I&#39;m considering writing a piece with all the items I feel that people should know about Huxley. I think the context of his background, character, and motivations give an entirely different tone and perspective to his words. Please... give yourself as much context as possible to understand Huxley and those surrounding him.  </p>

<p>As for Tavistock...There is lots of information available. Here&#39;s a link to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=tavistock">search /r/conspiracy for &quot;tavistock&quot;</a></p>

<p>Let me know if you have any additional questions</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huxley was a brilliant mind. He knew where society was heading and wrote about it in Brave New World. His final book, The Island, told the story of an ideal society that takes various beliefs from eastern parts of the world. However, this perfect society is infiltrated by a man that is an opportunist at heart. The inner conflict that goes on between the feelings of inspiration and greed are on full display.</p>

<p>One has to wonder if this is Huxley showing his cards. A man that had his head in the clouds with politics, societies, and spirituality couldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to develop ways for societies to be ruled by the oligarchs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that some eastern teachings put an emphasis on knowledge and spiritual maturity. A lot of it is mostly self-discipline to ensure you can eventually escape the spiritual prison that is Earth.</p>

<p>With Christianity, a lot of the teachings revolve around an all seeing God that an individual must be in good standings with to ensure they enter paradise when they die.</p>

<p>I&#39;d argue that Christianity obviously has the richest history, but it has historically been used as a tool to rule others. </p>

<p>I recommend checking out The Island. It&#39;s a short read, but it&#39;s pretty interesting. Huxley combines many eastern teachings to create his ideal utopia. Even if you don&#39;t get the fascination with the teachings, it&#39;s still interesting to know why it resonates with so many others.</p>

<p>It&#39;s Judaism +1.</p>

<p>Neanderthals had their own religion, that was the old european religion, which afterwards changed and we have different versions from ancient egypt, to sumer, to the eastern religions to germanic/celtic/slavic paganism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been around for at least 40000 years most likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep,you definitely havent smoked.</p>

<p>You know what I did when high on a couch? Realized what a shame our election system is back in 2008. Realizing how attack ads used colors and music to make me feel a certain type of way..</p>

<p>Weed helped me be more introspective about myself, the world around me. It helped &quot;open my third eye&quot; as some put it.</p>

<p>If governments felt weed would keep people sedated and in check why is it just now starting to be legalized? You think this is something world governments would have just discovered? Come on.</p>

<p>Weren&#39;t the Vietnam revolutions fueled by pot smoking hippies? Your Saturday morning cartoon stereotypes of marijuana are a bit embarrassing tbqh.</p>

<p>I guarantee you you know a ton of people who you respect who smoke weed. So roll up a blunt and actually know what you&#39;re talking about before talking about it.</p>

<p>Heavy smoker here, when I get stoned I could care less about cartoons.<br/>
It&#39;s my intoxicant of choice why would I want to switch out to opiates when the effects aren&#39;t similar and there is mountains of evidence, some I&#39;ve seen personally in my life, showing how tragic it is to the lives of the users.<br/>
I will happily enjoy my &quot;legal weed&quot;, thanks, though despite it being legal in my state it is not legal in my country. If it was so helpful in brainwashing I doubt the Fed would be fighting its legalization as hard as they are.</p>

Which is what some people think is why they made it illegal in the first place.  It&#39;s hard to control people when they won&#39;t be led around like sheep. I have no knowledge of Xanax. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our own self importance blinds us to the possibility that others have succeeded where we have failed. Society fuels this belief.</p>

<p>One of these days I plan on sharing my life story with you guys. It&#39;s so surreal I doubt most will consider the events true. But they are true and I embrace my past as what has shaped me into the compassionate being I am today.</p>

<p>I have infinite empathy for those who struggle in life and find themselves in the pit of despair. But I also acknowledge the fact that permanent crutches cause more damage than attempting to crawl out of the pit yourself.</p>

<p>You will never learn how to control your spirit if you rely on chemicals to keep you &quot;balanced&quot;. Pharmaceuticals are not a permanent solution to an issue. They only treat the symptoms of a broken spirit. If you want to go through life as a broken individual.. I guess that&#39;s your choice.</p>

<p>I&#39;m considering writing a piece with all the items I feel that people should know about Huxley. I think the context of his background, character, and motivations give an entirely different tone and perspective to his words. Please... give yourself as much context as possible to understand Huxley and those surrounding him.  </p>

<p>As for Tavistock...There is lots of information available. Here&#39;s a link to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=tavistock">search /r/conspiracy for &quot;tavistock&quot;</a></p>

<p>Let me know if you have any additional questions</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huxley was a brilliant mind. He knew where society was heading and wrote about it in Brave New World. His final book, The Island, told the story of an ideal society that takes various beliefs from eastern parts of the world. However, this perfect society is infiltrated by a man that is an opportunist at heart. The inner conflict that goes on between the feelings of inspiration and greed are on full display.</p>

<p>One has to wonder if this is Huxley showing his cards. A man that had his head in the clouds with politics, societies, and spirituality couldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to develop ways for societies to be ruled by the oligarchs.</p>
