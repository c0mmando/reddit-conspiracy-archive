       I keep seeing everyone on here blame everything on liberals.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you need to realise is that you've been played. Both parties in the US are neoliberals. Clinton is a neoliberal, and so is Trump. Don't be fooled.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same situation over here in the UK. Both parties are neoliberals, and they have been since Regan and Thatcher introduced the ideology into the Western world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The illusion of choice - a two party system in which both parties have the same agenda. I thought this would be common knowledge on r/conspiracy. Evidently I was wrong.

       It doesn't matter what anyone is "hooked on". The entire election is a complete farce. Your votes don't make it past the ballot box. Politics is a game for the ignorant to play while submitting to dictation. Your democracy is dead, and its been that way since Nixon.

       Lol, Trump is political dissent sink for the right, just as Bernie was for the left, with Hillary placed directly in the middle. They're all playing the same act. Trump, Obama, Hillary, Bernie, Bushes.

       The two party system is simply mommy and daddy. Mommy(left) submits and provides care(welfare state), Daddy(right) dominates and protects(police state).

       A-fucking-greed. I will always remember the real sides are profit vs humanity. I see it all around me. The left-right paradigm is firmly planted on the profit side.

       I think it can be argued the only true side
       <em>
        is the greed side
       </em>
       . Think about humans, evolution, the trials and tribulations we must have encountered. We romanticize are distant past with visions of humanity and the like but wouldn't it make more sense if our greed is what drove us from the caves to now? If not for greed maybe our first tribes would have died off? Animals are greedy as fuck. Survival itself can be categorized as greed.

       Boil it down further. To survival. To survive is to be greedy. Simply surviving when others do not is greed. Why is your consciousness any more important than all the consciousness you have consumed over the years so yours could live? A greedy desire to live when others can not has driven you here to right now. Your greed has shaped your life, your greed is your life. Without it you will sink back into the earth.

       There is a clear distinction between getting what you need to survive and resource exploitation. Not to say that greed and other emotions/motivators are not a consistent problem to humanity, but I believe that your blanket supposition about humans (notoriously diverse) all being greedy, and that being the driving force behind evolution etc. might not hold water when scietifically studied for true motivators in peoples' lives. According to one of my faves, M. Ghandi, commerce without morality is a sin... So, maybe greed is inevitable for anyone who lives long enough, but I think it is also worth considering that wanting and receiving does not necessitate greed. If we as a people chose to focus on altruism as a driving force and still not denegrating greed, we would thrive in a more balanced and sustainable way. I guess the question in my mind is, can you be altruistic and greedy at the same time? They seem to be fairly exclusive ideas in my mind.

       Yes maybe, but George Soros and the Liberal media hate Trump and deliberately lie about him. Even Fox news and most of the Republican party hated him. This is why and reason enough to disagree with this post.

       It usually is. It's just that the election and all the pageantry that goes with it has young first-time voters all whipped up and dancing to propaganda tunes. After November things should stop looking so partisan.

       When U.K. citizens use the word "neoliberal," Americans hear an opposite meaning.  The meaning of "liberal" is opposite in the U.S. from the rest of the world.

       But what I'm trying to highlight is that they aren't liberals in the American sense of the word either. Neoliberalism basically favours corporations and not the people. America is Neoliberalism on steroids. Corporations are pulling the strings on the puppets that they install in government.

       Capitalism is necessary as a movement away from feudalism / slavery and is a great tool for implementing production improvements.  If there's some profit to be made capitalists are great at finding the best way to get it.  However it does grow beyond it's uses into those points where it becomes a tool of the wealthy to oppress all others.

       I agree with you that neoliberalism usually gets talked about "academically" only in terms of economics, but you see what I'm getting at, right? In political reality, it definitely DOES have links to foreign policy and warfare

       Various ideologies can yield the same byproducts. It all depends on the state of foreign relations and diplomacy when executing the ideology. Neoliberals can choose to use diplomacy to cut deals or impose sanctions, or can use warfare to get a desirable outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The foreign policy of neo-liberals is much more fluid than the economic ideology.

       I think a significant portion of the users of this forum are aware that the left-right paradigm of surface politics is just a scripted circus of distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       They encourage everyone to become involved, get out and vote.  Pick a team, expose the corruption and hypocrisy of the other side.  Then settle for the lesser of two evils when the dust settles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile none of it matters anyway because the people who make decisions are not in elected positions.  They are however running both sides of the distraction.

      <p>
       This left-right political system is only one example of a contrived adversarial deception.  Another extremely important one to recognize is the East-West paradigm.  The same people control both sides.  China + Russia vs NATO is just theater to enthrall the masses.  The same central banking interests are behind both just as in the past world wars.

       MOST of this community is stuck on name-calling and blaming various political wings or groups on all of the world's problems. Very frustrating to know that so many people are still brainwashed.

       I suspect we're going to see more whistle blowers, more servers, offshore tax havens, and personal accounts hacked linked to the ultra elite - to out what's really going on behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       High level corruption is censored on mainstream media in the US, as is financial manipulation and tax evasion by the ultra elite. Politicians will get wrapped up as well, but they won't matter, they're just weak accomplices sucked in by money and the carrot of moderate power. I believe we're seeing the first signs that the ultra elite pulling the strings are slowly getting outted.

       I unfortunately believe that this is part of a campaign to overwhelm people - look at, say, Clinton's corruption or Trump's incessant bullshit. It's all so overwhelming, there's so much of it, that people can't sift through it and just give up. Like what the Clintons did newswise during the Croatia-Bosnia stuff. Or the 2008 TARP debacle. It gets too confusing, or people are told it's too confusing and regular people with lives and obligations bow out, give up, "Eh, it'll be fine, let the 'professionals' deal with it."

       Many people today don't realize that the tolerable working conditions we have were the result of the struggles of the workers of the past getting obscenely shafted by their employers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There always has been and perhaps always will be a conflict between profits and employee compensation. Less compensation is less expense, which is more profits. More compensation increases expenses and reduces profits. So, your employer and its owners want you to work for as little as possible they can make the most money possible. This is not a news flash to many people, yet logic does not come afterwards often times nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left has typically been the supporter of workers' economic interests against the ever present influence of owner/employer interests. The fight between these opposing camps of interests goes on in the legislature and by the selection of the SCOTUS judges. Also, it goes on in our hearts, minds, and conversations online and offline.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right typically, worldwide, is on the side of the employer/owner. It is not for worker rights over their employers generally. It's a thinly veiled vehicle for employer/owner interests to get power. They play on fears using deception to get working class people to support their agendas that work against working class people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the USA. They sell people that the people want low regulation, that means worker, customer, and environmental safety. They sell people that they want to have the right to not pay union dues, to undermine unions, calling it the right to work. It is well known to destroy how unions operate, but the right invests in our ignorance and fear. They imply that we get a right by losing our unions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right typically doesn't want a minimum wage. They don't want social programs to help the working class and poor stay out of poverty, because those programs don't benefit the owners and desperate people offer even cheaper employee compendation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right in the USA needs a base of evangelical Christians to vote for them based on banning abortion and gay marriage to even stay viable now. If you poll people on individual issues, they tend to be more left than right, but you won't hear that on TV very often.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real betrayal of the working class is from the false left though. They have an even more effective position to screw the workers. They get elected with the hope that they will help workers, then they turn around and help the employers/owners instead of the workers. This behavior is what causes so much leftist enthusiasm to turn to apathy. They wonder how the hell do you get an actual leftist like Bernie Sanders into power? It's rare and difficult. There are plenty of wolves in sheep's clothing on the left.

       The false left is correct. The only difference between the republicans and democrats in charge is that the republicans want to ban transgenders from using the bathroom and democrats don't. They agree on all the important economic, civil rights, foreign policy stuff, and then argue on the margins about identity politics, abortion, and guns. Various groups of voters get mad about their particular issue and go to vote, often ignoring their own greater interests, like their income, or their children's education.

       Most of us old school conspiracy folk hardly participate here anymore, especially during election seasons. There are far more important things to take part in, like removing the lint from our belly buttons, or enjoying what little is left of nature while we can. The rig is in, the elections are a farce. What good does it do when everybody and their grandmother knows it but feel powerless?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't bother much with exercises in futility. I'll just continue along making fun of the cruel joke that are our respective governing bodies as I enjoy whatever respite I can get. Call me selfish for giving up all you want, i'm just waiting for the riots. There's no point in making yourself a target before everybody else is ready. Preaching to the choir won't do much good. I've had this same discussion every election since the early 2000's.

       When you try and post ANYTHING about a third party candidate, you get immediately downvoted. There's too many people here stuck in the "I'm not throwing away my vote!" mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, whenever you bring up Gary Johnson, you get non-stop "He's a TPP supporter!!" nonsense comments. It's very sad.

       Of course you do, because it's cold hard evidence the guy is either a complete dimwit or completely compromised. Either way, that's the end of his viability as a candidate.

       Being a supporter of FREE TRADE is about as Libertarian of a philosophy as you can get.

       He has said many times that he does not support the TPP in it's current state, due to the level of secrecy and crony-capitalism involved. But he is completely on board with the idea of free trade.

       A Libertarian is somebody who doesn't like the idea of being raped as a citizen, but is OK with being raped as a consumer. Big business is no more concerned about your interests than big government is. You need protection against both.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consumer/citizen needs some form of collective bargaining mechanism and an elected government is the best thing we've invented so far.

       so Ron Paul isn't a libertarian? I think he's been pretty critical of the so-called free trade agreements and how they serve special interest groups, not the people
      </p>
      <p>
       also, Johnson has been promising a spot in his administration to Mitt Romney...as SecDef or Sec of State. He's a fraud.

       But it's true, and I only post that because I think his supporters deserve to know he is no different than the rest of the politicians. Many supports of his would assume that he would be against these "free-trade" agreements because they are literally 100% antithetical to the Libertarian ideology. I cannot think of something Gary Johnson could do otherwise that would further expose himself as a fraud other than supporting the TPP.

       There are a good number of "accounts" here who are invested in certain viewpoints or electoral outcomes here for reasons we can't begin to speculate about (but some of us do, for sure, speculate). We shouldn't let it shut us up, downvotes or no.

       I wouldn't say "all" because some of this know what you're saying is true and have been talking about this very subject.  Yes some of us know it's an illusion.  We even refer sometimes to this as 'the spectacle' (me and a few others).  Thanks for promoting this idea, because I think it's the truth.

       One thing that is
       <strong>
        <em>
         very
        </em>
       </strong>
       helpful in getting to this perspective is a birds-eye-view.  But that view is impossible to many people because they don't have the skill to manage complexity, because unless you are a software dev or engineer, you don't have the training or the practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tool I've found most recently that is helpful for getting you up-to-speed extraordinarily quickly to this 'birds eye view' is the web brain / mindmapping software.  Here's an example of what this looks like

       Tim Berner's Lee, the guy who created WWW / hypertext transfer protocol service (https) believes this webbrain will be what the new internet (web 3.0) will look like.  My example is missing a key feature (I'm on the freemium edition), which is a description of the linkage itself.  (ex: a "informs" b; c "associated with at dallas" d; e "is a part of / subordinate to" f; g "is a related term to" h).  At some point I'm going to fork over the big spend on webbrain.  It's amazing.  Found out about it by Jan Ivrin of gnosticmedia's MKULTRA / CIA created the Hippie movement brain

       Not really. Those labels identify with political ideology. Do people limit themselves by labeling themselves as a Neo Liberal or Classical Liberal? Probably. I get your point but there's no reason to sit here and point fingers at who's getting played. We all are.

       Is the exact same thing in Canada too... Things in reality are a bit better than they are in the states, and things in the media look a lot better than they are in the States... But the same two party fake democracy still exists.

       Justin Trudeau is spending more time on public relations and trying to look good than actually being good and bringing about the change that our generation really needs to see right now. He is violating a treaty in BC that was signed in 1899 just to expedite the construction of a dam... As well he signed off on sales of armored vehicles with weapons of death such as machine guns and bazookas to Saudi Arabia, and there are rumors that the foreign nation may use the purchased products in violations of human rights. I can't remember the article exactly as I did not spend very long reading it but it might have even spoke of these weapons of death being used on citizens of the nation purchasing them!

       Same thing in Australia. Both the major parties have the same foreign policy, media policy (Julia Gillards media laws lost her the job but then the opposition brought in the exact same laws), education policy (Labor wanted to make bachelor undergrads complete compulsory honors, then the liberals did it. And none of Christopher Pines scary policy's even got through, that was all just a show to politicise the debt and give them something to argue about) and while they try and try to make us think that their economic policy's are opposites neither have done anything to set themselves apart from the other (except screaming that they are so different to eachother).

       I love that politicians these days can be simultaneously neo-liberal and neo-conservative. This of course goes along with the liberal or conservative label, which are just two different degrees of center-right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton's mentor believed that the policy and goals of America were clear and indisputable, and that politics these days are simply a question of how to bureaucratically implement this known future. That's "the third way."

       There are liberals and they are ruining the country with their little labels and politics of hierarchical victimhood and intellectual degradation. They can hardly be classified as people, and never functional adults necessary for the continuation of a healthy society.

       there is an outside chance trump will actually change things. that outside chance is reason enough to vote for him when you look at the competition. the choice is vote trump or dont vote. when you consider a trump vote is also an anti-shillery vote it really is a no brainer. if you think trump is even in the same galaxy of deceit and corruption as shillary is, you need to do more digging. no one here gives a shit about the left/right blue.red bs

       I see people like to label things "right wing" &amp; "leftist". Like Military aggression is labeled as "Right Wing" when leftists do it constantly also. Massive defeciet spending is labeled as "Leftist" when the "republican/neo cons" do it constantly also.

       Fact is, the media is 100% against Trump and shilling for the hill-dog. I'm voting Trump. Am I getting played? Maybe. But I know, that the globalist scum hate him. So I'm taking my chances with MAGA.

       Clearly the  republicans and Democrats are two gangs just like the Crips and the bloods,  that's why the entire establishment is against trump.   Trump is going to fight the corporations that have become multinationals and shipped all our jobs overseas.  He has created tens of thousands of jobs in the USA building skyscrapers in our cities.

       What you are even trying to argue? That trump is just part of the Republican Party? The party that tried to rig the primary to cheat trump but he won overwhelmingly ?  You are just totally ignorant. And your argument fails immediately. Trump is the only way to stop corrupt Hillary.  As a foreigner you have no valuable opinion on the matter worry about your own POS country.  You have absolutely no understanding of America and what it's like to be here.  I have graduate degrees in engineering and now how foreigners are being prioritized over Americans. Over the past 30 years USA has lost all manufacturing and he is running on penalizing companies and factories that move.  Also we pay a shit ton for illegal immigrants healthcare and school for their kids which will all end. We are going to send those illegals back to the hell hole they came from and they can sit in line with everyone else

       There is no flip flop all trump said was that on day one we will send every single criminal back.  And no amnesty, if people want to become citizens have to leave the country.  We will continue deporting like under Obama and also cut money to sanctuary cities, we are already deporting right now just not criminals! Which is absurd

       It's pretty absurd. This board is annually a low key commie hangout. A few MAGA supporters flow in here and it's absolutely unbearable for a commie to be in here.

       A Libertarian is somebody who doesn't like the idea of being raped as a citizen, but is OK with being raped as a consumer. Big business is no more concerned about your interests than big government is. You need protection against both.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consumer/citizen needs some form of collective bargaining mechanism and an elected government is the best thing we've invented so far.

       so Ron Paul isn't a libertarian? I think he's been pretty critical of the so-called free trade agreements and how they serve special interest groups, not the people

       also, Johnson has been promising a spot in his administration to Mitt Romney...as SecDef or Sec of State. He's a fraud.

       I agree with you that neoliberalism usually gets talked about "academically" only in terms of economics, but you see what I'm getting at, right? In political reality, it definitely DOES have links to foreign policy and warfare

       Various ideologies can yield the same byproducts. It all depends on the state of foreign relations and diplomacy when executing the ideology. Neoliberals can choose to use diplomacy to cut deals or impose sanctions, or can use warfare to get a desirable outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The foreign policy of neo-liberals is much more fluid than the economic ideology.

       The false left is correct. The only difference between the republicans and democrats in charge is that the republicans want to ban transgenders from using the bathroom and democrats don't. They agree on all the important economic, civil rights, foreign policy stuff, and then argue on the margins about identity politics, abortion, and guns. Various groups of voters get mad about their particular issue and go to vote, often ignoring their own greater interests, like their income, or their children's education.
