       I found it a little weird that this subject seemed to come out of the blue, and You would think the lobbyists for those companies would not let that happen. So there has to be another reason. I just wanted to get your thoughts and/or any more info about this.

       You need to do a little more reading.  The world isn't flat and most prisons aren't privately owned and operated. "Today, for-profit companies are responsible for approximately 6 percent of state prisoners, 16 percent of federal prisoners, and inmates in local jails in Texas, Louisiana, and a handful of other states"

       My two week old account?  Sure.  Anyway, I do know how to read and think.  What I've seen after observing you is that you're an idiot, or you're here to keep people sidetracked with stupid bs.  We already know you're a liar, so I'm leaning toward the latter.

       I've looked into it deeper than 98% of the people who "think" the Earth is actually flat. Sorry to burst your bubble. The occult/esoteric I got out of it was the most vital though, so I'm happy with that. Always learning something new.

       If that were true there is no way that you would still be clinging to the 1,000 mph spinning ball theory.  I'm sorry but if you really look into the subject with an unbiased mind I don't see how you can still believe it, it actually becomes laughable to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you one that still trusts NASA or have you realized that they do not tell us the truth at all?  It seems like the people that can not wrap their minds around the fact that a lie of that magnitude could exist are the ones that still trust NASA.

       That's the key.  Hopefully you will not dismiss the subject and still keep an open mind to it.  There is much surrounding the subject and much to learn but It will not be going away, the cat is out of the bag.

       Dude, I've looked into it for damn near a few months. I don't believe a  thing NASA says, and I think they are lying. I also think there is something to either Concave or Hollow Earth theory. Slow your roll. If you actually went down the rabbit hole far enough, you would come to the same conclusions as me. Concave or Hollow Earth have way more evidence/solid models.

       I've looked into it for nearly a couple of years.  There is no proof for a concave earth.  There is no doubt that hollow pockets exist but to what extend is unknown.   What proof are you relying on that we are on a 1,000 mph spinning ball going 67,000mph around the Sun?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway we don't have to have this conversation, (especially since this thread is about something else) but I was just curious as to the "flaws in the FE theory" compared to the "ball theory" that you apparently still subscribe to.

       You obviously have not looked into concave or hollow earth. If you did, you wouldn't be saying that. It shows your ignorance of the various theories. Then you keep saying I buy the heliocentric model, after I explicitly made it clear that I don't buy many aspects of it and explore other theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I don't think this will spawn an honest discussion between us. Whether you are willfully not comprehending what I'm saying or just can't comprehend. So.. I suppose have a nice night...

       too many people are about to be thrown into prison maybe and they will need all those inmates for matters pertaining to working very low budget/for free. For that to happen the feds will need to run the prisons not private companies. Just a guess but seems solid enough.

       It's PR. The prisons may switch to "state control", but all of the services will still be private. Food, security, clothing, medical, etc, all for profit.

       They needed private companies to build the infrastructure. Tank their stock prices and get all that sweet sweet population control at a fraction of the cost.

       Puzzling considering the Obama administration gave $1 billion to Corrections Corporation of America, a company that owns and manages private prisons, a few days before the push to end private prisons was announced. (

       I believe it has something to do with the federalization of the local and state police forces, essentially creating a standing army separate from the military. With federal control of the prisons and law enforcement once either of the two main candidates get elected and shit starts to hit the fan dissenters and "criminals" will be rounded up.
