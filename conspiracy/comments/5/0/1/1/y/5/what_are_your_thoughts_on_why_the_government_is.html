<p>If that were true there is no way that you would still be clinging to the 1,000 mph spinning ball theory.  I&#39;m sorry but if you really look into the subject with an unbiased mind I don&#39;t see how you can still believe it, it actually becomes laughable to me. </p>

<p>Are you one that still trusts NASA or have you realized that they do not tell us the truth at all?  It seems like the people that can not wrap their minds around the fact that a lie of that magnitude could exist are the ones that still trust NASA.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the key.  Hopefully you will not dismiss the subject and still keep an open mind to it.  There is much surrounding the subject and much to learn but It will not be going away, the cat is out of the bag.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked into it for nearly a couple of years.  There is no proof for a concave earth.  There is no doubt that hollow pockets exist but to what extend is unknown.   What proof are you relying on that we are on a 1,000 mph spinning ball going 67,000mph around the Sun?  </p>

<p>Anyway we don&#39;t have to have this conversation, (especially since this thread is about something else) but I was just curious as to the &quot;flaws in the FE theory&quot; compared to the &quot;ball theory&quot; that you apparently still subscribe to.</p>

<p>You obviously have not looked into concave or hollow earth. If you did, you wouldn&#39;t be saying that. It shows your ignorance of the various theories. Then you keep saying I buy the heliocentric model, after I explicitly made it clear that I don&#39;t buy many aspects of it and explore other theories.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t think this will spawn an honest discussion between us. Whether you are willfully not comprehending what I&#39;m saying or just can&#39;t comprehend. So.. I suppose have a nice night... </p>
