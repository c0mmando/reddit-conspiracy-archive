       ...but that it’s SOOO damn obvious that we were fucking
       <em>
        bombed
       </em>
       as a people and attacked BY OUR OWN FUCKING GOVERNMENT…and yet we’re
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       not doing anything (or nearly enough) about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean look at
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/50830z/major_physics_magazine_europhysics_news_publishes/">
        the information in the topmost post in this sub right now
       </a>
       for Chrissakes.  How the
       <em>
        fuck
       </em>
       does AAAANYBODY come up with the idea that we
       <em>
        weren't
       </em>
       attacked from within?
      </p>
      <p>
       So
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       the real conspiracy here...that the power on this planet is so powerful that it's convinced all of us as a citizenry to allow ourselves to be murdered
       <em>
        right in front of our very face
       </em>
       ...and KNOW IT...and yet
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       not to shit about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, yeah...I know.  People have written petitions.  People have written articles.  People have made documentaries.  Yada yada...
      </p>
      <p>
       But we haven't done what I'm pretty sure a
       <em>
        looot
       </em>
       of us already know we
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to do as a people:  Come together and move as one AGAINST the b.s. ptb running/ruining this country and planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh but we're not united!  We're not together!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Well...so then let's GET together!  I mean whatever it is we have to do to
       <em>
        stop
       </em>
       from continuing to be used like the very expendable sheep stooges we keep getting used as is what we have to come together and

       What's more intelligent and likely to work in our favor? Getting goaded info a fight with a prepared enemy who desires a fight or preparing defenses while refusing to engage that enemy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Non compliance, civil disobedience while exercising your right to self defense will leave these parasitic assholes no clear win strategy. Decentralized and focused on a common goal of self determination we would be unbeatable.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why they spend so much time and effort in weakening our minds and dividing us by or differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have unlimited financial resources and unprecedented control of information. Getting an organised "war party" assembled under those circumstances is literally impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead the alternative community should focus on educating the common people about their rights, encourage them to be brave in their families defense, and teach them how to live without dependence on government.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should all be leaders by example. We know what they're doing, we have that knowledge. Why are we collectively using the knowledge to produce content for ourselves to consume?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the point of knowing something and turning to someone who didn't bother to find that something out and saying "see I told you so, look at that"?
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is fuck pointing this shit out to as we say "sheep" and start herding them in the right direction.

      <p>
       I’d say the latter - but I’d also say that it doesn’t look like enough of us are sufficiently “preparing defenses”.  Don’t misunderstand now.  I am most definitely
       <em>
        NOT
       </em>
       advocating for any type of “violent chaos” type of scenario.  That’s stupid and would most definitely not work.  No way am I now nor have I ever advocated for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m talking about us coming together and simply not supporting the system, among other things.
      </p>

      <p>
       We are saying exactly the same thing.  This is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what I’m talking about.  However, I’m not sure how many of us are truly doing this.  I think there needs to be some solidarity in this - the citizenry communicating with each other so that ALL OF US know that we’re all doing this…and stand up for those others of us that are getting bullied by TPTB while we continue to try to stand up for our rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, we’re basically saying the same thing, and I agree w/what you said here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, but we need a greater level of intelligence in the citizenry for that.  Decentralization only works if the decentralized are intelligent enough to wisely manage themselves - and that requires the development of more skills, more wisdom, more intelligence amongst those interested in decentralization.

      <p>
       Correct.  They’re aware of the power that lies in a movement based upon the philosophy you stated above here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Not if that war party fights by “Non compliance, civil disobedience while exercising your right to self defense”.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, we’re saying exactly the same thing.  Perhaps it was not sufficiently clear that I’m advocating for something like this as well in my OP.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We should all be leaders by example. We know what they're doing, we have that knowledge. Why

        </del>
        aren’t we collectively using the knowledge to produce content for ourselves to consume?

      <p>
       Fully agreed.

      <p>
       Agreed, but part of how you start herding them/us in the right direction
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       by pointing it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the thoughtful response.  It ultimately buoys the point that I made above in my OP.

       I'm advocating, as

         while exercising your right to self defense

      <p>
       The first part of that statement means that the main goal is to
       <em>
        peacefully
       </em>
       become a free people that aren't getting manipulated by a nefarious covert force.  The second part of that statement, however, means that if the antagonizing force does not
       <em>
        stop
       </em>
       antagonizing, then it must be MADE to stop antagonizing -

       Perhaps you may be right.  However, this doesn't mean that we must stay that way - especially if we have the knowledge of the fact that A) we were/might have been engineered to be submissive and B) our being this way makes it very easy to manipulate us and take advantage of us at great cost to our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we wish to not continue to be taken advantage of (and I imagine many of us
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       like to be taken advantage of), then it would seem that we should take the necessary steps to break OUT of this "engineered submissiveness".

Mass protests, im talking 30% of the population, would cause a big enough stir to make some real changes.

       Yes.  Correct.  We have to come together and organize sufficiently to make mass, collective protests happen that actually WORK and aren't chaotic cesspools of moronic violence.  We have to be concerted, strong enough, and organized enough so that we can stand against the
       <del>
        ptb goons'
       </del>
       police's eventual/inevitable decent into violence against the citizenry in the face of a mass protest.  It
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       happen - the batons and the water canons will come out - because that's what they do.  We can't let that keep a mass protest from still moving forward, however.

      <p>
       I wouldn't disagree with the idea that American citizens would have definite problems in all coming together.  Yes.  However, as far as
       <em>
        "hell
       </em>
       breaking loose"?  I wouldn't say that that's any sort of "inevitable" consequence of American citizens coming together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that this country is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       divided.  Yes.  TPTB have definitely made sure to foment all kinds of racial dissent, etc in order to keep us separated and apart from one another.  However, it seems that many of us have a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       common ground in that we are all expendable subjects of a manipulative financial elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are manipulated and kept apart and at each other's throats - racially and otherwise.  The more we realize that this is the case, the more we can fight against it and move forward as the united people we indeed are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not pretending it's easy, but the alternative is to continue getting taken advantage of as we have been.

       Perhaps...but if so...well, we're a choir that's kind of stuck sitting on our pews.  I understand that actually getting up and doing something is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       not easy, takes a lot of character, a lot of strength, and a lot of courage - especially when you might not know if others will stand up and support you and be with you in your efforts - but, well...it seems the time is pretty much nigh for people to stop "wondering if 911 was an inside job" or not.  It's time to stop trying to come up with more and more "damning evidence".
      </p>
      <p>
       The shit is
       <em>
        known
       </em>
       .  It most definitely
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       an inside job.  100%.  We have to move past the "was it an inside job or not?" stage and go into the stage that says "now that we all
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that it most definitely was an inside job and that our very own government and institutions don't care about us and
       <em>
        kill us
       </em>
       , what the hell do we need to start doing about it together so that we can start keeping this shit from continuing to happen?"
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to start moving to step two now, and even
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       choir here needs reminding of that because even we - with all the information we have and with all we supposedly (and
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       ) know - even we aren't moving forward with the information we have toward the next steps that need to be taken if we are to keep ourselves from continuing to be the horribly expendable fodder tptb most definitely see us as.

       Why dont you make a thread and get people who are willing to join you to sign it, contact the major 9/11 sites and movements, do them same there. Exchange information and set a meeting point, bring signs, march on washington or whatever and make your voices heard like occupy but have a direct goal. Make sure you have detailed lists of your main points so that politicians cant derail you so easily.

       I wish I could do more in my life. I know a good way to wake up a lot of people, and to stop a lot of this madness, but it would require me to make a sacrifice, to let go of my own life. But I get treated like shit  by every asshole around me. Life has turned to garbage, the American people are garbage. So I have almost no motivation to enact any of my plans. The only people that give a shit are digital strangers on obscure forums and websites. I can't find a single soul with a revolutionary spirit, everyone I'm surrounded by makes money or is reliant on the military complex and the police state to live. This country is shit. I know how to stop this all but I would have to die and I'm not willing to die for worthless assholes that likely wouldn't notice and would have a huge chance of my death meaning nothing and them continuing to fall off the cliff like the stupid beasts they are.

       You don’t have any idea of that?  Nothing comes to your mind?  You don’t know the first thing about the manipulation and the theft and fraud that’s overcome this country and planet that needs to be done away with?  Really?

      <p>
       What are you doing now though?  So long as you (and me and the rest of us) stay in this system as it stands, you most definitely
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       being the useful idiot…but with zero “righteous fury” to burn out one way or the other.  You’re just sitting there…like me, like so many of us (all of us, it seems)…doing either nothing, or not nearly enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I come on here and post an OP that’s at least
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to invite some sort of ideas that can possibly spark some possibilities, but your idea is to respond with critical vitriol that does all of nothing to contribute.
      </p>
      <p>
       So which one of us is at least
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to help, and which one of us is coming here shooting things down?  Which one is ultimately helping more here?

       The Open Source Direct Democracy. The Panarchy. The viable solutions that I gave that are far more useful than your platitudes and weeping for togetherness.

       You mistook what I was trying to do, and the attempt at pining to Cunningham's law looks more like a cop out than anything else.  Regardless, the fact that you ignored what I clearly posted as some answers readily illustrates that you're interested in simply attempting to be antagonistic, which is something not worth continuing to respond to.

       Of course, you'll likely misinterpret that too.

       There's nothing to comprehend because you're saying absolutely nothing. You haven't put forth a single idea in either your OP, any of your responses to me or any responses to any of the other people in this thread. Some buzzwords like 'civil disobedience' and 'coming together'.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're just repeating over and over 'we need to do something'. What is that something little kid? We're gonna protest... or something... until all the bad guys that did a 9/11 just leave government. And then like... Something'll happen and suddenly all the corruption in the world will also go away and the only people who'll be in government will be pleasant good guys?

       We win by creating the new system that we move on to, not by fighting the old system on their home turf while they hold all the cards. Paraphrasing Buckminster, but you get the point.

       I get that you're all upset coz my responses haven't been pleasantly jerking you off for being the edgy anti-hero we all need, but you need to read a fucking book and chill out.

       I'm all for textual communication - I can tend to do it a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       - but mostly when it's under circumstances that aren't unnecessarily antagonistic.  I much prefer idea-sharing under the auspices of respectful communication rather than anyone trying to "one up" each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly didn't really pay much attention to the other posts in the thread you linked.  The one comment you
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       link me to, however, was quite appreciated, and echoed some of my own sentiments on the issue.  I responded to that user letting him/her know that much as well.
