        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">116</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-08-30 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/cordeezy.html">cordeezy</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At this point CNN has been found to be a fraudulent news network by anyone that is paying attention.  They are not trying to cover the facts of a situation, they are covering stories and altering them to make sure they fit a certain narrative.  The Milwaukee girl who asked people to burn down the suburbs of Milwaukee instead of the inner city, Colin Kapernick&#39;s rant about Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump&#39;s tweet editing out &quot;crooked&quot; because that is his theme that has been effective throughout his campaign.  Effective because she is crooked not because she isn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>At this point if you even pay attention to CNN or anything they report on you are openly receiving a biased view of the news that has never been so blatant before in the history of the USA.  Dr. Drew fired after raising health concerns.  </p>

<p>People love to bash the people that read the conspiracy sub, but the same people get their news from CNN.  I understand call for abolition of CNN, but why should we even have to?  Who the hell is even paying attention to that network any more after everything that has been revealed?  The nancy grace and other chick in the same parking lot talking about the same story only feet away from each other if they were even in Phoenix at the time, maybe it was a green screen.</p>

<p>Hillary is and has been a member of the CFR for a while now as has Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>This is the point where people trained to not believe in conspiracies start to disregard this post, and I do suppose that is because for a person to take this in, they have to do research.  As they do research they will start to see that there is a power structure in place, and if you look at the membership of the CFR then you can begin putting things together for yourself:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_Council_on_Foreign_Relations">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_Council_on_Foreign_Relations</a></p>

<p>Members include the CEO of Time Warner, who owns CNN who is Hillary Clinton&#39;s seventh largest financial backer either as a company or by employees within the company.  George Soros is also a member, Andrew Ross Sorkin, Roger Ailes, George Clooney, George HW Bush etc.......</p>

<p>Names you don&#39;t see:  Trump or anyone named Trump.  </p>

<p>The Trump campaign is scary to the establishment, perhaps NBC offered him the apprentice deal hoping he wouldn&#39;t run because he couldn&#39;t turn down such a sum of money, but he did.</p>

<p>The media felt that Donald Trump would be the easiest candidate to beat so they destroyed every other credible candidate by giving Trump all the air time he could want or need to win the primary.  They interviewed him more than any other candidate after everything he said.  They gave him a platform and helped him win.  </p>

<p>The plan seems to have backfired because the polls are much closer than they thought.  Maybe they thought Hillary wasn&#39;t lying about the e-mails and that by the time the investigation was over the e-mails she deleted would never be heard from again, but they came back from the receiver&#39;s side to haunt her.  Comey openly admitted she broke the law but maybe didn&#39;t mean to, then we find bleachbit was used on the server, so how can anyone now believe that she didnt mean to?</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t know the DNC would be hacked, they didnt know the Clinton foundation would be revealed as a corrupt organization.  They didn&#39;t know her health might be an issue.  Now they are scrambling to push a narrative by altering news stories, to sink that low, they must be utterly scared of what will happen during a Trump presidency.</p>

<p>Trump is the problem that will not go away, they manipulate his words, highlight the negative.  The media highlighted Hillary&#39;s speech the other day as a great moment in her campaign?  Did they listen to the content?   I watched all 40 minutes of it or whatever, and I can&#39;t believe anyone would call that a great speech, Trump gives speeches like that daily, but they are ignored unless he says something racist, then that is the only portion of the speech aired on CNN, then America screams &quot;RACIST!&quot; </p>

<p>How do we change anything?  People are not doing the research needed, they see a headline on cnn then tweet it out or snap it out or instagram it or whatever without even questioning what it says.</p>

<p>I think people just want to be part of a discussion regardless of the facts behind the thing that starts the discussion.  I was once more active on Reddit, now I just don&#39;t see the point.  I check the news, world news and conspiracy subs as well as the uplifting news sub for some positive affirmation that the world is not a complete shit hole.  </p>

<p>James Corbett has the best you tube channel I have found, if you cross reference the facts he lays out they are always on point, which I am sure alot of people don&#39;t so they either believe everything he says because he sounds intelligent or nothing he says because what he says is scary to the average person trying to go to work, come home and watch tv the rest of their lives.  </p>

<p>If you have read this far you are probably like minded, so thanks for reading this long rant, but you are the choir to whom I am preaching.  How can you multiply to be the majority?</p>

<p>The title was intentionally click bait for this sub because I want to see if I get a lot of down votes from people who don&#39;t read the content of the post.
TL:DR:  If you skipped to the TLDR you are part of the problem I addressed in this post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re witnessing the democracy-edition of a WWE Raw wrestling show. Incidentally, they&#39;ve hired an actual WWE Raw actor (named Donald Trump) to play the role of one of the competitors.. only he&#39;s really a Clinton foundation donor who has been set up to &quot;run against&quot; a Clinton, gee, what a surprise, but I&#39;m sure he&#39;s genuine opposition, rite guys?! <em>&quot;The madman!&quot;</em>.</p>

<p>this whole thing is a scam and Trump got tapped to participate because of his personality and history, now he&#39;s been heavily promoted to distract the poor people and make them think they&#39;ve &quot;got a guy in the race&quot; and that all they need to do is stick a sign in their yard and yell about Trump occasionally. That&#39;s the best way to make sure nothing ever changes in America. Personally I think Trump has been set up to win to make all the stupid people think they&#39;ve somehow &quot;beaten the establishment&quot;, to make them feel like &quot;omg, we won, we got our guy in, we beat the corruption!&quot;, so that they&#39;ll keep quiet for the next 4-8 years --- Obama was part of the exact same strategy, everyone upset about the Bush crimes? Give them a nice, well-spoken, intelligent young black man with &quot;constitutional law professor&quot; as his job - but what did he actually end up doing? All the same shit Bush did, and worse.  </p>

<p>the same will be true of Donald Trump. This is the same type of scam that was run when Bush II &quot;ran against&quot; his own fraternity brother and fellow Bonesman, Al Gore. It&#39;s a scam, it&#39;s a Clinton &quot;running against&quot; a Clinton donor and family friend. It&#39;s not actually meaningful. It&#39;s a diversion to distract people from the political realities facing their country and the world, which are now well-hidden behind an &quot;election cycle&quot; where 2 fakes are foisted upon the public and heavily promoted while the masses take to gossiping about them and focusing all of their attention on them. It&#39;s a &quot;look over here, not over there&quot; scam.</p>

<p>Clinton is being set up as a corruption scape-goat, just like her husband was, while the neocons provide you with a false leader to take her place and trick you into quietly going along with whatever new wars and police state measures (ostensibly &#39;only for use on the bad immigrants and evil muslims and criminal blacks, not you!&#39;) come  down the pike. It&#39;s no surprise that the 4chan-type people are falling for a scam that plays on their petty contrarian mentalities. Their attitudes are easy to understand and they have been easily co-opted.</p>

<p>If you want an idea of who&#39;s actually been running things and the names of those involved in the unelected government who (using the TPP) have brought about what amounts to an attempt to
overthrow the entire legal framework of the United States government in a corporate coup d&#39;etat to legally cement the powers that they&#39;ve already seized in their private, quiet revolution,  read this: <a href="https://cryptome.org/2016/08/deep-politics-rev4.pdf">https://cryptome.org/2016/08/deep-politics-rev4.pdf</a></p>

<p>Trump and Clinton&#39;s wife are <em>completely irrelevant</em> and only meant to distract people and hide the political realities facing the US and the world. Same as Romney/Obama, same as Gore/Bush II (son of CIA Director President Vice President Bush I)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hasn&#39;t any read <em>Manufacturing Consent</em> by Noam Chomsky?<br/>
All mainstream media is state propoganda- no different than what we percieve it to be in North Korea. The only big difference is the illusion of freedom and choice and information presented. You have your conservative news lense on Fox and your liberal news lense on CNN- both to hekp facilitate the myth of bipartisanship, and to further facilitate the divide between the average American.<br/>
Whatever you see on the news- and I think its clear that we can include all social media platforms as well- whatever&#39;s trending, you know- just question whatever it is they&#39;re telling you.<br/>
I think it might be helpful to watch some maibstream media, because it serves as a way for you to base your theories of something. If you can watch the news and say &quot;this is biased propoganda- what&#39;s the real story theyre either manipulating or trying to distract me from?&quot;</p>

<p>I dont think we can allow ourselves to get too bogged down in the left vs right agenda that the establishment is pushing- its too divisive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point I believe it can be an option, I am cautiously optimistic about his candidacy, but I still know the power of the elite, which he has ran in circles with for decades.  If he were a plant, is he planted to win or lose?  If he is a plant that wins and proceeds to destroy America from the inside then I wouldn&#39;t be surprised,  but I guess there is a blind optimism side of me that is willing to believe that maybe there is a billionaire out there who sees what is being done to the country and the 99 percent of the people that can&#39;t just pick up and leave when it all turns to shit because of failed economic, foreign and domestic policies.  </p>

<p>I hold on to the hope that it could be positive if he wins,  but I am a realist and consider it a far fetched dream as well.  </p>

<p>The msm does not interview him or give him as much air time as before,  they overlook everything Hillary does, while pouncing on Trumps every slip up.  Like when Hillary said we will raise taxes on the middle class, this never got reported.  If it were trump there would have been a weeks coverage on it.  </p>

<p>Trump may be like flipping a coin between corrupt and noncorrupt when the alternative is a two sided coin of corrupt.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I have found in my research is this: yes the stories are crafted to fit a narrative, but it&#39;s the narrative that gets higher ratings.  You see, CNN, fox, NBC they all know who their audience is.  They know what their audience wants to hear.  If they deviate too far they lose viewers.  It seems like they are towing the party line, and they are.  But that&#39;s because most of their news comes from govt sources and they only tell the news companies what they want people to hear.  It&#39;s up to the news companies to spin and craft the story to fit their audience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. I read this morning about the editing out the word crooked. </p>

<p>I usually read cnn, nbc, fox and the guardian to find the middle ground for the same story. Alternative news really hasn&#39;t been a thing that I like. Some seems more biased than others, but I&#39;ll check out that James dude. </p>

<p>What about alternative news do you not like? Is it the style or the information? Or just something else all together? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From most what I&#39;ve seen, it seems biased to what he authors believes or just seems like click bait or a &quot;bloggy&quot; feel.  Like some of the links posted here, I don&#39;t even attempt to click based off of what I&#39;ve seen in the past.  I just take the left wing, right wing, and the mutual grounds and figure out the truth from there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha. I generally check them out to find out other issues that the main streams dont talk about. To me it seems the MSM&#39;s just present their sides of the &quot;allowable&quot; topics and thats all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I&#39;ve been on this sub for about three years now and I&#39;ll say one thing that ive learned out of many. Do your own research and sometimes come to your own conclusion if it doesn&#39;t add up. </p>
