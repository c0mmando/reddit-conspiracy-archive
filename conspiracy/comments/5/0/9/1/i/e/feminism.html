    <div class="md"><p>Whole family units, especially with extended family, have historically been fairly self reliant.</p>

<p>Single parent homes tend to be reliant on the state for, child care, education, financial aid, healthcare. Pretty much all facets of life.</p>

<p>Having children institutionalized from an early age ensures that state and societal propaganda is accepted as truth.</p>

<p>Furthermore, punitive child support and falling wages help to ensure that adults are kept on the hamster wheel instead of pursuing self education, reliance, and development of healthy habits.</p>

<p>EVERY SINGLE THING THAT THEY HAVE EVER DONE, EVER.</p>

<p><strong>SO YOU’RE FOR GENDER EQUALITY?</strong> </p>

<p>Unfortunately, gender equality is not what you think it is but what the highest politicians and judges think it is. They define it as “equality of outcome” and “equality of income”; i.e. women’s quotas, affirmative action, high taxes to redistribute wealth from men to women, harsh alimony laws focusing on women’s issues while neglecting mens’, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>SO YOU’RE FOR EQUAL RIGHTS?</strong></p>

<p>The term “equal rights” has also been redefined by politicians and now includes “the right to be represented.” Just like parents have the duty to make sure their baby is not underfed, men have the “duty” to make sure that women are not underrepresented. Therefore, any area with less than 50% women automatically infringes on the inborn rights of women. ”Equal rights” is another term for women’s quotas and affirmative action.</p>

<p><strong>SO YOU’RE FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES?</strong></p>

<p>Equal opportunity has also been redefined. Previously it meant “Everyone starts at the same starting point and earns his way up to the top.” Now it means that women are given the opportunity to start at a high position and then earn their right to may there by doing a satisfactory job. Equal opportunities is now, too, another word for women’s quotas, affirmative action, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>SO YOU’RE FOR EQUAL PAY? AND YOU THINK THE GENDER PAY GAP IS A MYTH?</strong></p>

<p>The gender pay gap exists. It is not caused by discrimination by men, but by women’s own choices, limitations, and pregnancies. When politicians vow to close the gender pay gap, they don’t mean to fight discrimination (since there isn’t any to fight), but to enforce women’s quotas (only for the highest paying jobs, of course, since that closes the pay gap best), to lower qualification standards (to qualify more women for well-paying jobs like doctors and professors), to make kindergarten mandatory (so mothers have no chance to stay home), to expand government (so women have always a guaranteed place to find work), and so on. “Closing the gender pay gap” is another term for women’s quotas, socialism, and expansion of government.</p>

<p>I am not making this up.</p>

<p>When you read high-level political texts (EU parliament international treaties, UN declarations, etc.) this is exactly what they mean when they write “equal” or “equality.” They mean “enforced equality of outcome” and “enforced equality of income.”</p>

<p>Just to give you one example of many: When the EU parliament (representing 28 countries) voted to enforce women’s quotas in the European Union (passing with a ⅔ majority), they justified it by using terms like “equality”, “equal opportunities”, “equal rights”, “equal participation”, “equal academic and professional rights for men and women”, “eliminate inequalities”, “elimination of the gender pay gap”, “shared responsibilities”, the fight against the “democracy deficit”, “equal treatment”, and a lot of other terms following feminist redefinitions you thought only existed in crazy feminist blogs. </p>

<p>This is a real-world example of what “equality” means. This is how far feminism has infiltrated world politics. “Equality” is feminist newspeak for “misandry.” “Equal rights” is feminist newspeak for “less rights for men.” If you are upholding principles like “men and women are equal,” you are part of the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I know I was just pointing out how stupid is it to say feminism promotes equal rights for all and how its very similar to saying the &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; term is meant to promote equal rights for all.</p>

<p>Feminism promotes that women are the victims of 1000&#39;s of years of patriarchy and now its their times to rule over men.  the sad part is that in slave societies the women did rule over men because they were seen as more loyal to the masters and the men were left uneducated.</p>

<p>There actually is an &quot;ism&quot; that promotes equality for all its called humanism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excerpt from <em>Their Angry Creed</em>, by Herbert Purdy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was 1969. Kate invited me to join her for a gathering at the home of her friend, Lila Karp. They called the assemblage a “consciousness-raising-group”–a typical communist exercise, something practiced in Maoist China. We gathered at a large table as the chairperson opened the meeting with a back-and-forth recitation, like a Litany, a type of prayer done in catholic church. But now it was Marxism, the Church of the Left, mimicking religious practice:</p>

<p>“Why are we here today?” she asked.</p>

<p>“To make revolution,” they answered.</p>

<p>“What kind of revolution?” she replied.</p>

<p>“The Cultural Revolution,” they chanted.</p>

<p>“And how do we make Cultural Revolution?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“By destroying the American family!” they answered.</p>

<p>“How do we destroy the family?” she came back.</p>

<p>“By destroying the American Patriarch,” they cried exuberantly.</p>

<p>“And how do we destroy the American Patriarch?” she replied.</p>

<p>“By taking away his power!”</p>

<p>“How do we do that?”</p>

<p>“By destroying monogamy!” they shouted.</p>

<p>“How can we destroy monogamy?” Their answer left me dumbstruck, breathless, disbelieving my ears. Was I on planet Earth? Who were these people? </p>

<p>“By promoting promiscuity, eroticism, prostitution and homosexuality!” they resounded. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more that in practice, the demands of feminists are never-ending and almost comical in scope. Men, in general, have long ago ceded equality to women (the younger ones were raised by the first generation of women who had equal rights, and are on the whole, happy to support equality).  Feminists are like a dog with a bone, though, and keep &quot;fighting&quot; a war that is over.  </p>

<p>Then it&#39;s <em>meaningless</em>, because it contradicts fact.</p>
