       Is this place just another Trump board is it a conspiracy board? Why don't most people here see that he's just like the rest? One person comes saying the right things and people forget everything they know about politics being a sham.

       That's not even the point dude, use your filter. You can't see the forest for the trees but consider your point taken. I did not direct your attention there to boost his popularity. Just look at the stuff that is being exposed and forget your partisan feelings. Trendy Reddit elites hate r/the_donald, that in and of itself ought to have you asking yourself why. I digress. There are things going on in there that the power structure doesn't want you to see so by all means, go somewhere else but don't attempt to dissuade others from checking it out, it only makes the itch stronger.

       It would be absurd to be in a conspiracy sub of this nature and believe Trump is the mighty saviour of America when clearly he is just another lackey. Mike Pence was icing on top of that bullshit, do you think rworshipdonald  cares that the Goldman Sachs' boy is VP? I care, so Fuck Trump, and his naive supporters.

       If they put a disclaimer on the sub like this I would respect their sub:

       <em>
        In no way, shape or form, do we believe that Donald Trump will do any good for the American People, He will be just as a corporate whore as all the other presidents before, in fact he might be worse. However, we are morally, spiritually and physically opposed to the presidency of Corrupt and pre picked Hillary Clinton

       Hey Man, thanks! If you think there is something so compelling in that sub, please post it here. I certainly value discussion with you here, it's just the sub is not where I would fit in with my opinion of their main topic. I would of course read any compelling stuff you would refer to me.

       I'm not on this sub to let demagogues and their cryptophytes (my own neologism) direct me to the truth. Had you de-politicized your original statement, I would have been more inclined to take it at face value. I think Trump is a nationalist, opportunist, megalomaniac—but he's put some good ideas forward (never his own).

       What "itch"? Do you not get that what is out out in the media is what the elite want you to see? Do you not get that Trump is an elite and is a politician despite what he may say?

       In reality, Hiliray benefits from the DHS stepping in to 'ensure' election integrity. If you don't know who Jeh Johnson is and what he stands for, you really aren't paying attention or can't see through your own bias. Now who is a tool of the MSM?

       What exactly has trump done for the people with his billions of dollars if he's so great and generous and cares about the people?  Why is he manufacturing his garbage macy clothing line in China if he cares about nationalism and about China taking our jobs?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is just like all the others but he just panders hard to a slightly different crowd.  Meanwhile his policies are classic authoritarian neocon.  Likes the Patriot Act, likes the NSA, likes the drone program, wants more soldiers in the middle east, wants massive bush style tax cuts for the obscenely wealthy.  Business as fucking usual why can't you fuckin people understand that?  Maybe you're all hypnotized by stupid frog cartoons.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no by all means throw all your support behind the authoritarian circus freak trump because he wants to build a wall (does he still even want to do that?).  Like that's what matters, at all.

       That's not even the point dude, use your filter. You can't see the forest for the trees but consider your point taken. I did not direct your attention there to boost his popularity. Just look at the stuff that is being exposed and forget your partisan feelings. Trendy Reddit elites hate r/the_donald, that in and of itself ought to have you asking yourself why. I digress. There are things going on in there that the power structure doesn't want you to see so by all means, go somewhere else but don't attempt to dissuade others from checking it out, it only makes the itch stronger.
