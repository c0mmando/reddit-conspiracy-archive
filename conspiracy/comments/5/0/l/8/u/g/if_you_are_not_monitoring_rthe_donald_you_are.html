I did not direct your attention there to boost his popularity. Just look at the stuff that is being exposed and forget your partisan feelings. Trendy Reddit elites hate r/the_donald, that in and of itself ought to have you asking yourself why. I digress. There are things going on in there that the power structure doesn&#39;t want you to see so by all means, go somewhere else but don&#39;t attempt to dissuade others from checking it out, it only makes the itch stronger. </p>

<p>In reality, Hiliray benefits from the DHS stepping in to &#39;ensure&#39; election integrity. If you don&#39;t know who Jeh Johnson is and what he stands for, you really aren&#39;t paying attention or can&#39;t see through your own bias. Now who is a tool of the MSM?</p>

<p>No you are doing it wrong.  The guy is telling <strong>you</strong> to watch what they do not what they say.  </p>

<p>What exactly has trump done for the people with his billions of dollars if he&#39;s so great and generous and cares about the people?  Why is he manufacturing his garbage macy clothing line in China if he cares about nationalism and about China taking our jobs?  </p>

<p>Trump is just like all the others but he just panders hard to a slightly different crowd.  Meanwhile his policies are classic authoritarian neocon.  Likes the Patriot Act, likes the NSA, likes the drone program, wants more soldiers in the middle east, wants massive bush style tax cuts for the obscenely wealthy.  Business as fucking usual why can&#39;t you fuckin people understand that?  Maybe you&#39;re all hypnotized by stupid frog cartoons.</p>

<p>But no by all means throw all your support behind the authoritarian circus freak trump because he wants to build a wall (does he still even want to do that?).  Like that&#39;s what matters, at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not even the point dude, use your filter. You can&#39;t see the forest for the trees but consider your point taken. I did not direct your attention there to boost his popularity. Just look at the stuff that is being exposed and forget your partisan feelings. Trendy Reddit elites hate r/the_donald, that in and of itself ought to have you asking yourself why. I digress. There are things going on in there that the power structure doesn&#39;t want you to see so by all means, go somewhere else but don&#39;t attempt to dissuade others from checking it out, it only makes the itch stronger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t think you received the message, that sub mirrors r/conspiracy w/o all of the sophomoric BS and infighting. Nobody is forcing Trump into your safe space. Enjoy a tendie and relax.</p>
