       Both of those questions are basic and easy and have simple answers. A real question is why no country or enterprise has been "back" to the moon. I know the answers people give to this question but the fact is they're all insufficient and usually not offered in good faith.

       first question, an easy reason to lie about it would be the prestige at the time, and ownership.  Because, honestly, We put the flag on it, USA, USA!  So, yes, many good reasons to lie about such an accomplishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, his second question is spot on, due you (joe_jaywalker) really think countries We shit on, like Iran, a country where officials have denied the Holocaust is real, would go along with the US pretending to land on the moon?  Let alone, Cuba, Venezuela, Russia, China, N. Korea.  The fact that these countries do not challenge the lunar landing claim, is stronger evidence than the bullshit attempting to disprove it.

       First of all it's not like many other countries are outspoken in lauding this achievement. Even if any of the countries you mentioned came out and publicly called the bluff, the average person wouldn't believe them and they wouldn't be able to produce definitive "proof" just like I can't produce definitive "proof" on an internet forum. It's up to each person to look at the totality of evidence and realize it all points towards it being a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if one of the aforementioned countries had some kind of definitive "proof," whatever that would even look like, the average American still wouldn't believe them. Especially not Russia, not now when they're being demonized and definitely not at the tail end of the space race or any time during the Cold War.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, however, any of those countries did have proof and did disclose the lie, they would gain nothing from it but the ire of those with entrenched interests in promoting the lie, like NASA employees and television scientists like DeGrasse Tyson who would be instantly revealed as a fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, it would make much more sense for any country, assuming they could prove we faked the landings, to blackmail us for money or intelligence or both, and I indeed believe this to be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I will add that Russia and Japan are two countries that are now participating in space fakery of their own in relation to collaborating with NASA on the mythical ISS. So they're part of the profitable space hoax at this point as well.

      <p>
       There's no reason to. There is nothing a human can accomplish on the moon that a robot cannot. We've sent robots several times since Apollo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that people don't get about the Apollo program is that people went, people saw, and people left. Until we start needing a lot of Helium-3 for cold fusion, the moon is literally a more boring, much more expensive to get to and harder to survive on earth. It has no life, no major deposits of things we don't have due to the way it was formed, and no real worth as a gateway until we have somewhere else to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's incredibly risky and expensive to go to it, and there's no real tangible benefit to doing so.

       For very few reasons, one of which I mentioned. Another is it's position for astronomy, which can be done by high orbit telescopes almost as well without the need for humans. The other is to keep humanity alive with a form of last outpost in case of world ending cataclysm, to which I and most others would agree mars is a far mre attractive option.

       Yeah, Russia plans to go in 2030 to begin to start a colony or base. Of course the idea that we could go in 1969 and they won't be able to once until 60 years later is absurd...
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason would be to launch a Mars mission from the moon as an outpost... there are plenty of reasons to go for profit as well; in fact if we had really gone to the moon in 1969 then we would already have extremely lucrative commercial flights there. You see articles about this happening within a decade or so sometimes, so we'll see! (It won't happen.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were no reason to go to the moon, we wouldn't have returned so many times so quickly. All they apparently did on later trips was zoom around on the stupid rover and play golf. You are aware we allegedly went 6 times total before 1973?
      </p>
      <p>
       And we haven't been back once because we never went once.

       This video positively certified we never went to the moon because he is obviously lying. If Apollo 12 had been to the moon, and he has walked on the lunar surface, he would be able to answer this question. I mean there are a hundred reasons we couldn't have gone and didn't go, but I'm now convinced this video is all you need. He makes it crystal clear we never went if you have any common sense at all.

       The more I think about it, in relation to the Van Allen belts especially, this video absolutely certifies they never went to the moon. If you just stop and think about it, there's literally no way anyone who had been to the moon would come off this way when asked what should be a simple question. He is 100% absolutely lying.

       So let me get this straight.

      <p>
       The earth is moving around the sun at 1000 miles per hour, the solar system is orbiting around the center of the galaxy at 500,000 miles per hour; the universe is expanding at several million light years per second!
      </p>

       And the reason we can’t feel any of this is because of ‘the atmosphere’? Gee, you NASA fanboys are beginning to sound like conspiracy theorists!

       I mean, it's been debunked hundreds of times by the flight data showing the trajectory they used, but hey, keep going I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skimming the top of the belt by traveling on a relatively high inclanation exposed the astronauts to some radiation, but much less than they would have been exposed to had they reaveled on an equatorial plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason this matters now is that it's a
       <em>
        fuck-load
       </em>
       easier to reach other planets by traveling on an equatorial plane as opposed to a 40 or even 50 degree angle of escape. To have the astronauts survive the actual intense zones requires new designs, to have them spend almost no time in a weak part of the zone doesn't.

       I jump back and forth on my opinion on the moon landing. I think the best pieces of evidence is the collection of photographs that have all the anomalies or fuckery within them.

       But at a close 2nd is the Van Allen belt. I've never heard someone explain it in a way that explains how we were able to do this before and not now.

       the only reason i think the moon landing was real is simple. if it was fake why didnt russia accuse the us of it being fake? they were the number 1 enemy in the space race and they simply congratulated the us and accepted the fact. that speaks volume to the credibility

       I don't claim to know if people landed on the moon, but I do know for a fact that some of NASA's astronauts are not what they seem to be.  Some of them appear to be paid actors, and here's the proof:

       The truth is NASA has used fake civilian crews and build huge public relations events around fictional missions used as a cover for covert military missions with military crews.  There's no possible way to deny this fact.

       NASA you are SOOOOO busted!

       If they've lied about this you have to wonder what else they've lied about.

       Both of those questions are basic and easy and have simple answers. A real question is why no country or enterprise has been "back" to the moon. I know the answers people give to this question but the fact is they're all insufficient and usually not offered in good faith.
