<p>I&#39;m curious, which came first, Wikileaks or the <em>Sudden Death</em>?</p>

<p>If the death came first, do you think this is what Wikileaks was referring to? If wikileaks went first, do you think they knew of a CIA plot? Or just a coincidence, unconnected?</p>

My grandpa had a stroke and it was caught early enough it wasn&#39;t too bad really (Doctors ended up finding massive amounts of cancer while he was in the hospital and died from surgeries soon after). While in the hospital visiting, my grandma was telling my mom about how my gramps sister was still recovering from her stroke earlier in the year. They started listing just about everyone I know of on that side and how they&#39;ve had 1 or 2 strokes already in their lives. Most were in their 50s, but one persons daughter (in her 30s) already had one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah man, that really sucks, I&#39;m so sorry.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another shocking story that happened to my family recently. My cousin (72, lived in Vancouver, Canada) had a bit of a cough and was feeling a little fatigued. She went to the ER to be looked at and they sent her home saying it was a cold. Two days later, she was getting even more fatigued so she asked a neighbor to call an ambulance. </p>

<p>When she got to the hospital, they told her she had Leukemia and had 12 hours to live. She called our family, said her goodbyes and was gone by the morning. </p>

<p>If all this has taught me anything, it&#39;s that life is incredibly precious and we need to cherish our loved ones more than we probably do because the life stick can beat the crap out of you at any moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the same thing. It&#39;s called &quot;Sudden death syndrome&quot; and you should bring it up with your doctor if you haven&#39;t already. The whole &quot;get an EKG&quot; thing as any heart abnormalities in you are risks for SDS that wouldn&#39;t be a risk in other people. For example, I have &quot;short QT syndrome&quot; but that is just an abnormality and not a defect to worry about since SDS doesn&#39;t run in my family.</p>
