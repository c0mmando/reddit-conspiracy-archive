    <div class="md"><p>The specific Podesta email says flying in from Chicago. Here&#39;s your first mistake, you&#39;re not factoring in transport or refrigeration costs. Just the cost of trucking items across states is expensive, much less flying them in. You&#39;re looking at transit to the airport in a climate controlled vehicle, transport in either a climate controlled cargo plane or chartered plane. Not everything is eligible for Amazon Prime you know.</p>

<p>Now:
* How many hot dogs are there?
* How much did the purchase cost for the base supplies?
* What kind of schedule are they on?
* Who&#39;s handling them from the shipper to the airport and from the airport to the White House?
* Are they sending someone to prepare them? Is this a party being carried out by a specific restaurant? Chicago is serious about their dogs, it&#39;s why it&#39;s a regional specialty. If yes, that just increases the cost.</p>

<p>There&#39;s just no way. Those suppliers would be preferential, for sure - the White House is not paying retail prices. And even taking into account shipping/etc - which should be factored in to their regular supply network - $65K is not a party-sized amount of hot dog meat.</p>

<p>If he used outside kitchen staff, perhaps we can assume that they got payed? Maybe the white house kitchen pays above your usual hotdog vendor pay level, but still at that price, it must have been a pretty well staffed event, with some top of the line sausages.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ahh okay, thank you for the answer  </p>

<p>Problem is that is has to be thrown in with the rest before it even looks suspicious, and you know burden of proof and yada yada - No one has to convince anyone that PG is <em>not</em> a thing, the burden of proof is on the people trying to convince anyone, without doubt, that a crime has been committed.   </p>

<p>If you had an actual crime, then maybe it would make sense to look at the conjecture, and to speculate. But you need a crime, to have a big picture, in which you can <em>then</em> observe the details. Otherwise how can you know that the so-called pieces are supposed to fit together?</p>

<p>There is a complaint.</p>

<p>Of a specific crime - What is the specific crime in PG?  </p>

<p>Then there is collection of evidence.  </p>

<p>Collect evidence of what? From where? On suspicion of which specific crime?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to sound like a broken record with the &quot;specific crime&quot; thing, but that just doesn&#39;t change. Just consider how much circumstantial evidence you would be able to connect pretty much any person to, if anyone ever considered you creepy, that is circumstantial evidence too, but without a crime, it&#39;s not really evidence of anything other than that person perceiving you as creepy, not even evidence of any actual creepiness in your person</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just do the hot dog one. That&#39;s taxpayer money, so there should be a paper trail. And it&#39;s false on its face - you can&#39;t bring outside food into the White House. So - what exactly is being discussed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, this is <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html">an intra-office email in Stratfor.</a> It has nothing to do with Podesta or Clinton. Fred Burton of Stratfor said &quot;I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago.&quot; He&#39;s not claiming to have any special, inside knowledge, so he is probably referring to something in the news.  The email was in May 2009. Just a few weeks earlier, there was a very minor kerfuffle about Obama flying in Pizza. Though the pizza had Chicago-themed names, it was actually from St. Louis, which made some Chicago pizzerias mad.</p>

</ul>

<p>Some right-wing bloggers and a few in the media tried to stir up anger at Obama for extravagance or wasting taxpayers&#39; money, but it turned out that no taxpayer money was used to fly the food out.</p>

<p>The pizzeria brought dough and sauce with them, but the pizzas were <a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/foodblog/2009/04/16/pis-chris-sommers-deep-dishes-on-cooking-at-the-white-houseand-the-controversy">prepared in the White House kitchen</a>, supervised by the White House chefs.

<p>Find the location of the Hawaii hot dog stand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no hot dog stand. Running a hot dog stand was John Podesta&#39;s humorous idea of a low-stress job that he would get after being Chief of Staff. For example, in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/07/03/for-the-presidents-4th-chief-of-staff-a-measure-of-success/4f7a333b-0e12-4815-a749-fa7ff35c82f1/">this July 2000 article</a>, Tony Podesta says that John &#39;often says--in a voice that seems only half-joking--his biggest goal after the White House is to run a hot-dog stand in Hawaii. Even that might prove too stressful for a presidential chief of staff already getting the feel of beach sand in his toes. His true goal, Tony Podesta speculated, is to run &quot;a crazy T-shirt store on the Big Island.&quot;&#39;</p>

<p>Investigate the &quot;farm&quot; that mysteriously closed down. The one where the 5, 7 and 11 year old were used as &quot;entertainment&quot; for the hot tub. And after &quot;the clothes came off&quot; one was &quot;rubbing Pedosta&#39;s nose at 5:30am&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t heard about any farm &quot;mysteriously&quot; closing down. The farm is Tamera Luzzatto&#39;s house in the country. She does mention growing lettuce and herbs in one email. The nose getting rubbed was Tamera&#39;s. All the people mentioned as being at <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/47943">the farm in that email</a> are Tamera&#39;s husband, her children (or stepchildren), their spouses, and Tamera&#39;s grandchildren. What would there be to investigate?</p>

<p>The other event was an annual gathering <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kKcwBDh.png">of friends</a>, mostly married couples in their mid-50s. There&#39;s no sign of anything illegal there, either, unless you have a sick, sick imagination.</p>

<p>You mean the basement where the canned tomatoes are kept?

<p>I haven&#39;t heard about that.</p>

<p>Investigate the museum location and find the &quot;kill room&quot; (their hashtag)</p>

<p>Investigate <em>what</em> about them? One is a walk-in cooler, of which there are <em>hundreds</em> of in Washington, D.C. There&#39;s nothing illegal about them. The &quot;museum&quot; doesn&#39;t appear to be a museum, but there&#39;s also no sign of anything illegal there.</p>

<p>I remember when people were talking about how suspicious it was that Alefantis was digging &quot;tunnels&quot; in the basement of Comet Ping Pong without a permit. Of course, it turns out that the digging was somewhere else, so some other story has to be made up about how nefarious it is.</p>

<p>The basement has a room that can be used to display multi-screen videos. The Hirshhorn Museum in Washington has one, too. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28btx34bXHA">Here&#39;s an example video.</a> Maybe not great art, bu that&#39;s hardly a crime.

<p>If, by &quot;serial killer art&quot;, you mean <a href="https://remedianetwork.net/2014/06/23/the-arch-of-hysteria/">Louise Bourgeois’ <em>The Arch of Hysteria</em></a>, that has nothing to do with Jeffrey Dahmer.

<p>In addition to what others have stated as far as Obama&#39;s criticisms for frivolous spending on pizza at the time, there is more context with regards to the author.</p>

<p>TL;DR, The email&#39;s writer hates Obama and is making a baseless accusations in private. He has no inside knowledge of Obama&#39;s dealings and was most likely regurgitating some bullshit/talking point he heard, exaggerating, joking, or making it up from whole cloth.</p>

<p>Explain the $60,000 hot dog party.</p>

<p>Here is the explanation: some random guy who votes Republican saw a random blog post shared on Facebook about how OBUMMER was WASTING TAXPAYER MONEY on such FRIVOLITIES as PARTIES with CATERING, and referenced that blog post in an email to coworkers. It was never based in fact. It was just a partisan talking-point that got circulated among some dude&#39;s friends and co-workers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is about something that affects millions - maybe billions - of people. Most of the people who are getting their hopes up about pizzagate blowing wide open, are looking for the truth about the way the world operates, and the protection for the little guy from the depredations of the well-connected and the powerful.</p>

<p>Personally, when I think about charity, or &quot;heroism&quot; in the fight against [fill-in-your-injustice], it leaves me feeling weak and hollow. Why? Because I know that no matter what we do to cut down on one of the symptoms of evil in our world, it&#39;s only going to spring up somewhere else. (Have you ever fought weeds?)</p>

<p>It&#39;s good that some people do the necessary work of fighting particular injustices. Most of the &quot;pizzagaters&quot; aren&#39;t in a position in life where they can. But they&#39;re not stupid. A lot of them see the big picture.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t you think that someone should be fighting the particular injustice of either pedophilia or satanism witch hunts.  </p>

<p>I have and would never discourage anyone from educating themselves, or seeking their perceived truth, I think most people misunderstands my message, when i&#39;m asking the questions that i do.  </p>

<p>I think every question should be allowed to be asked, and every angle examined, not just the ones that confirm what is believed is the big picture.  </p>

<p>Many pizzagaters do appear to see a big picture, yes - but is that the same thing as seeing <em>the</em> big picture, or asked the other way around - how can we even know that there is one unified big picture in this thing at all?  </p>

<p>And if that was the case - wouldn&#39;t the best way to try and confirm if the thing you believe to be true, is actually true - to actually have it pass some kind of falsification? - like trying to <em>prove</em> that an actual crime have happened, instead of doing it the other way around, where it&#39;s the doubters that have to prove that nothing happened?  </p>

<p>Too bad PG wasn&#39;t allowed to have their own sub, Then there would probably be a lot less of those trolling, shilling, jackasses like me come in and ruin the whole narrative by asking all our dumb questions.  </p>

<p>I just really don&#39;t get is why PG-supporters actually want this to get investigated by the police and to get MSM attention, when they aren&#39;t prepared for anyone asking questions. Do they really just expect anyone to just accept the narrative without any further examination? - If the point is truth-seeking, it just seems kinda misguided too.</p>

<p>And no, the &quot;suspects&quot; are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, so there isn&#39;t really anything to clear them off - the burden of proof is never on the suspects, because it&#39;s impossible to prove that you didn&#39;t do anything.

<p>No one has to prove their innocence, but someone must at least be able prove the suspicion of a law that has been broken. It&#39;s really quite simple - what law do you suggest has been broken? and why do you think that? - If <strong>anyone</strong> can give plausible answers to these two questions, well then there isn&#39;t really any talking against it anymore, but still no one will come up with an answer that actually takes the law and the boundaries that the police work under, under consideration.  </p>

<p>It seems be some kind of government or marketing experiment, perhaps to see how easy it would be to get people to sign away their own legal rights?

<p>My company routinely spends $5-10K on <em>teambuilding events</em> that don&#39;t even include alcohol.  A recent event at <a href="http://topgolf.com/us/">Top Golf</a> cost almost $7k for a one hour team meeting, followed by two hours of golf and buffet lunch (no booze).

Would you do it then if they told you they were doing it because of rumors about you of pedophilia they read online? So that would be most likely be the end of that investigation, since the pizzaguy has pretty much the same legal rights as you would have in that situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quick question to the skeptics:</p>

<p>Can you name one (1) other topic in recent history (let&#39;s say since the year 2000) that has been as aggressively censored as pizzagate?</p>

<p>Mainstream media won&#39;t touch it. They created a whole new term (fake news) to discredit it because the old CIA Conspiracy Theoroo wasn&#39;t enough (if you think that isn&#39;t true, name the dates that a) the term fake news was first used in the media, and b) the term pizzagate was first trending on twitter). Subreddit was taken down. I believe there was something about an image hosting site removing the content (or something). CONSTANT dismissals in countless threads that all follow the same pattern: there&#39;s no evidence, no one has come forward, everyone in this sub is crazy now.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s really fake, they wouldn&#39;t be fighting it so hard.</p>

<p>I reckon most made up wild stories are by default &#39;censored&#39; in the sense that they aren&#39;t covered. Aliens for example. Take any issue with basically no evidence and a fervent fanbase and they likely feel that they&#39;re being censored when really there&#39;s no legitimate news to report.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mainstream media won&#39;t touch it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>already did, some of it even addressed the basic points of pizzagate. Not to mention heavily mainstream breitbart and infowars (which are more popular than multiple &quot;mainstream news&quot;) reporters trying to push it to the mainstream.</p>

<p>The only legit news on pizzagate are the people who&#39;ve been driven to breaking by it, like the comet ping pong guy who fired a round off inside but was <strong>immediately dismissed by the entire pizzagate crowd as an inside agent / false flag because he worked as an actor</strong>  So there you have it, when something actually happens in MSM you just ignore and and claim you&#39;re being censored when really you don&#39;t like to see an outside perspective of this mess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Subreddit was taken down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of legal pressure and breaking the rules of reddit, pizzagate is actively attempting to ruin someone&#39;s life and business over rumor and hearsay so this should&#39;ve been expected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONSTANT dismissals in countless threads that all follow the same pattern: there&#39;s no evidence, no one has come forward</p>
</blockquote>

<p>uh yeah, that is the most responsible, most legitimate response to allegations that have no victim and no hard evidence. You try to make it sound like that&#39;s some kind of attack designed to undermine a legitimate conspiracy, but it&#39;s the only rational response.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen these answered over and over by the way, so you&#39;re simply not paying attention to the rightful skepticism of pizzagate. You can go as far back to the beginning of the pizzagate threads and find critiques of pizzagate. sort by controversial sometimes.</p>

<p>Right, the most responsible thing to do when there are allegations of possible child abuse, torture, murder, and slavery on an international level is to ignore it.</p>

<p>Especially when GB had a similar pedophilia scandal come out in 2014, and the Vatican has been diddlin boys for decades if not longer.</p>

<p>I experienced heavy push back from shills who didn&#39;t appreciate me calling attention to the exit polls in the 2016 Democratic Presidential primaries. See, in about a dozen states, the exit poll results show OBVIOUS evidence of election fraud with the most egregious instances suggesting over 10% of votes were tampered with to Clinton&#39;s benefit. The shill mods in r/politics and r/sandersforpresident even banned me discussing these exit polls. I&#39;d say that topic was similarly censored and corporate media outlets also went out of their way to claim it was debunked by releasing articles that lied and said exit polls being VERY off from reported results was nothing to be worried about. I mean, the corporate media wouldn&#39;t even cover the fraud that Wikileaks exposed, they were never going to cover the exit polls that showed votes being hacked. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s just do the hot dog one. That&#39;s taxpayer money, so there should be a paper trail. And it&#39;s false on its face - you can&#39;t bring outside food into the White House. So - what exactly is being discussed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, this is <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html">an intra-office email in Stratfor.</a> It has nothing to do with Podesta or Clinton. Fred Burton of Stratfor said &quot;I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago.&quot; He&#39;s not claiming to have any special, inside knowledge, so he is probably referring to something in the news.  The email was in May 2009. Just a few weeks earlier, there was a very minor kerfuffle about Obama flying in Pizza. Though the pizza had Chicago-themed names, it was actually from St. Louis, which made some Chicago pizzerias mad.</p>

</ul>

<p>Some right-wing bloggers and a few in the media tried to stir up anger at Obama for extravagance or wasting taxpayers&#39; money, but it turned out that no taxpayer money was used to fly the food out.</p>

Pizzagate has been maintained, and if you are a high-level Hillary/government/scary elites basher there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re posting about it on facebook.
