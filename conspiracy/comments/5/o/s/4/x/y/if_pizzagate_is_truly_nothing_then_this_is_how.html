       But you know, as far as investigations go, people have their comfortable lives full of televised singing competitions and they don't want to think about the suffering of others. That would require empathy, which is "hard." So the dead roll away unrevenged because meeeeh I done wannaaaaa. Mmm hmmph hmmph.

       Yeah. But once you mention her they immediately call her unreliable cause she's said some crazy things. You can't win with those folks. Skepticism is healthy but what they seem to keep doing is masturbate over how skeptic they are. Lol.

       I totally agree, gullibility is a far better quality in a person than skepticism!
      </p>
      <p>
       How dare those people ask question upon question, when there's an agenda they should just accept right in front of them. They have to be either government shills or pedophiliac supporters, why else ask those damn questions, it's not like anyone is saying anything happened, so why won't these goddamn people don't just accept PG once and for all.
      </p>

       I thought masturbating was supposed to feel good, having a rational discussion about PG is more akin to banging your head into a wall.

       If there is indeed witnesses I don't think any will come forward until there is a swell of public attention and support. If the media get behind the story they might provide an atmosphere of safety for wistleblowers and witnesses. Until then we aren't likely to hear from people who might mysteriously commit suicide.

       Investigate the "farm" that mysteriously closed down. The one where the 5, 7 and 11 year old were used as "entertainment" for the hot tub. And after "the clothes came off" one was "rubbing Pedosta's nose at 5:30am"

       That's not one item. Reputable law enforcement officials - also knowsn as non-internet investigators - can't just investigate anything they fucking like in a wide blanket like that. Pick ONE. You have to pick ONE to make the case. The problem is that
       <em>
        you

       NEED all of that list just to make your case.

       Let's just do the hot dog one. That's taxpayer money, so there should be a paper trail. And it's false on its face - you can't bring outside food into the White House. So - what exactly is being discussed?

       The specific Podesta email says flying in from Chicago. Here's your first mistake, you're not factoring in transport or refrigeration costs. Just the cost of trucking items across states is expensive, much less flying them in. You're looking at transit to the airport in a climate controlled vehicle, transport in either a climate controlled cargo plane or chartered plane. Not everything is eligible for Amazon Prime you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now:
* How many hot dogs are there?
* How much did the purchase cost for the base supplies?
* What kind of schedule are they on?
* Who's handling them from the shipper to the airport and from the airport to the White House?
* Are they sending someone to prepare them? Is this a party being carried out by a specific restaurant? Chicago is serious about their dogs, it's why it's a regional specialty. If yes, that just increases the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can (hopefully) see, you're making something more sinister than it perhaps needs to be made.

       No one is shipping hot dogs from Chicago to the White House. The food is prepared on-site from pre-approved suppliers - so it couldn't have been prepared in Chicago and shipped to the White House.

       I don't. No one does. But I highly doubt that they have a raw hotdog supplier on call from Chicago. Even still - $65K?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's just no way. Those suppliers would be preferential, for sure - the White House is not paying retail prices. And even taking into account shipping/etc - which should be factored in to their regular supply network - $65K is not a party-sized amount of hot dog meat.

       If he used outside kitchen staff, perhaps we can assume that they got payed? Maybe the white house kitchen pays above your usual hotdog vendor pay level, but still at that price, it must have been a pretty well staffed event, with some top of the line sausages.

       ahh okay, thank you for the answer

      <p>
       Problem is that is has to be thrown in with the rest before it even looks suspicious, and you know burden of proof and yada yada - No one has to convince anyone that PG is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a thing, the burden of proof is on the people trying to convince anyone, without doubt, that a crime has been committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had an actual crime, then maybe it would make sense to look at the conjecture, and to speculate. But you need a crime, to have a big picture, in which you can
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       observe the details. Otherwise how can you know that the so-called pieces are supposed to fit together?

       I'm not trying to sound like a broken record with the "specific crime" thing, but that just doesn't change. Just consider how much circumstantial evidence you would be able to connect pretty much any person to, if anyone ever considered you creepy, that is circumstantial evidence too, but without a crime, it's not really evidence of anything other than that person perceiving you as creepy, not even evidence of any actual creepiness in your person

       Sure. Pedophilia is pedophilia. I'd support throwing Trump/Clinton/Bernie/whomever in jail over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is, the implication right now is that one of Hillary's top men is involved in it. I'm not sure why you're defending it so hard, to be honest. It doesn't seem bizarre to you? The puzzle pieces don't seem to be fitting together?

       If you have information on Trump, definitely release it.

       C'mon now - this hot dog thing ALONE should give you cause for consideration. The rest is icing on the cake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put it this way - there's definitely enough circumstantial evidence for someone to ask questions. Like, real ones. They likely aren't being asked because of the connections these people have.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's a chance that this IS happening and IS real...why not investigate?

       How is the hot dog thing suspicious without the other information that you can't prove is related to that, though? You're still making the mistake of trying to prove it by using multiple bits of circumstantial evidence, since none of them are strong enough to stand on it's own. If you do investigate one and find nothing there, it kills the investigation of the other parts, since the house of cards starts falling in on itself.

       The money. That is an insane amount of money, even for a catered white house event.

       The e-mail itself doesn't really sound like they're discussing catering, does it?

       I'm still waiting for evidence of the ribs thing. You, anonymous internet man, knowing another guy and him telling you he totally shipped ribs to the White House isn't cutting it. Bizarre, too, that here you are, defending accused pedophiles, and you ALSO happen to be a friend of the guy that runs Bill Clinton's favorite rib joint.

       No way we can prove this...I think Scott might have been lying to you. In the BEST CASE scenario, that was allowed before 9/11...but it is not now.

       So we're still left with a weird e-mail describing a $65K hot dog party. Do we have pictures of it? Anything? You'd think something like that would be documented, with a guest list, probably a press presence, etc.

        Let's just do the hot dog one. That's taxpayer money, so there should be a paper trail. And it's false on its face - you can't bring outside food into the White House. So - what exactly is being discussed?

       First of all, this is
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html">
        an intra-office email in Stratfor.
       </a>
       It has nothing to do with Podesta or Clinton. Fred Burton of Stratfor said "I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago." He's not claiming to have any special, inside knowledge, so he is probably referring to something in the news.  The email was in May 2009. Just a few weeks earlier, there was a very minor kerfuffle about Obama flying in Pizza. Though the pizza had Chicago-themed names, it was actually from St. Louis, which made some Chicago pizzerias mad.

       This doesn't really solve my core problem, though - the money. That's an obscene amount of money for hot dogs - and was there any coverage of this pizza party? Photos, anyone there, press, etc?

       There is no hot dog stand. Running a hot dog stand was John Podesta's humorous idea of a low-stress job that he would get after being Chief of Staff. For example, in
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/07/03/for-the-presidents-4th-chief-of-staff-a-measure-of-success/4f7a333b-0e12-4815-a749-fa7ff35c82f1/">
        this July 2000 article
       </a>
       , Tony Podesta says that John 'often says--in a voice that seems only half-joking--his biggest goal after the White House is to run a hot-dog stand in Hawaii. Even that might prove too stressful for a presidential chief of staff already getting the feel of beach sand in his toes. His true goal, Tony Podesta speculated, is to run "a crazy T-shirt store on the Big Island."'

       I remember when people were talking about how suspicious it was that Alefantis was digging "tunnels" in the basement of Comet Ping Pong without a permit. Of course, it turns out that the digging was somewhere else, so some other story has to be made up about how nefarious it is.

       In addition to what others have stated as far as Obama's criticisms for frivolous spending on pizza at the time, there is more context with regards to the author.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR, The email's writer hates Obama and is making a baseless accusations in private. He has no inside knowledge of Obama's dealings and was most likely regurgitating some bullshit/talking point he heard, exaggerating, joking, or making it up from whole cloth.

       Here is the explanation: some random guy who votes Republican saw a random blog post shared on Facebook about how OBUMMER was WASTING TAXPAYER MONEY on such FRIVOLITIES as PARTIES with CATERING, and referenced that blog post in an email to coworkers. It was never based in fact. It was just a partisan talking-point that got circulated among some dude's friends and co-workers.

       Caring about your kids doesn't correlate to caring about pizzagate, most people don't believe it so they don't fear that their kids will be a part of it.

       I think you might be confusing posting on reddit for caring.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are actually a hell of a lot of people around the world fighting against human trafficking and trying to better the conditions for actual children who have been victims of crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If pizzagaters are so full of sympathy towards child suffering, there are countless of posibilities for volunteer work or donations for the more lazily-inclined, that can help actual real children in trouble.

       Pizzagate is about something that affects millions - maybe billions - of people. Most of the people who are getting their hopes up about pizzagate blowing wide open, are looking for the truth about the way the world operates, and the protection for the little guy from the depredations of the well-connected and the powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, when I think about charity, or "heroism" in the fight against [fill-in-your-injustice], it leaves me feeling weak and hollow. Why? Because I know that no matter what we do to cut down on one of the symptoms of evil in our world, it's only going to spring up somewhere else. (Have you ever fought weeds?)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's good that some people do the necessary work of fighting particular injustices. Most of the "pizzagaters" aren't in a position in life where they can. But they're not stupid. A lot of them see the big picture.

       I have and would never discourage anyone from educating themselves, or seeking their perceived truth, I think most people misunderstands my message, when i'm asking the questions that i do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think every question should be allowed to be asked, and every angle examined, not just the ones that confirm what is believed is the big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many pizzagaters do appear to see a big picture, yes - but is that the same thing as seeing
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       big picture, or asked the other way around - how can we even know that there is one unified big picture in this thing at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that was the case - wouldn't the best way to try and confirm if the thing you believe to be true, is actually true - to actually have it pass some kind of falsification? - like trying to
       <em>
        prove
       </em>
       that an actual crime have happened, instead of doing it the other way around, where it's the doubters that have to prove that nothing happened?

      <p>
       Too bad PG wasn't allowed to have their own sub, Then there would probably be a lot less of those trolling, shilling, jackasses like me come in and ruin the whole narrative by asking all our dumb questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just really don't get is why PG-supporters actually want this to get investigated by the police and to get MSM attention, when they aren't prepared for anyone asking questions. Do they really just expect anyone to just accept the narrative without any further examination? - If the point is truth-seeking, it just seems kinda misguided too.

       Pizzagate is about child trafficking. Look if it's trending worldwide online or was then obviously enough people are aware of at least the basic details behind it. Just because in your reality people around you don't know about it doesn't mean everyone else doesn't know either. I'm just stating facts and you're trying to shit talk your way into believing nobody knows or cares about pizzagate.

       Obviously it's about child trafficking, but they're not synonymous, regardless of how hard they try to connect every big case to the pizzagate name.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, it's not widely known nor has it ever been trending outside of reddit, voat, and 4chan. Most people don't know about it or don't believe it, you're delusional if you think it's a common topic.

       Investigate what, exactly? An investigation requires actual evidence, otherwise you're spending money and time on something completely unsubstantiated. On top of that, you give credence to the claims in the eyes of the public, which, without proper evidence, could ruin the lives of those involved for no good reason.

       It appears that you are mistaking a proper investigation, for an illegal one
      </p>

       The only thing people in here are arguing against would be an
       <em>
        illegal
       </em>
       investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you consider an illegal investigation of anyone anything you would even want to argue for? - I'm actually really curious about this, why is it so important to get this guy investigated, that makes it so important that his rights, or the law don't even matter anymore? And if the law isn't important, why even care about a legal investigation anyway?

       No one is advocating anything illegal here, including illegal investigations. When we call for an investigation, we are calling for an investigation by the proper and correct and legal authorities.

       Since you're checking out my posting history, i encourage you to actually read the post where i address why this is - But of course, why not just assume suspicious activity when there's an answer right in front of you. I made this account especially for discussing PG-related stuff, since i don't want to risk getting doxxed from personal info on my regular account or to get that account spammed with hatemail from pizzagate-tards.
       <br/>
       Try actually taking a critical look at what i am actually writing in the posts where i argue against this crap, and figure out why i'm doing it.

       Because if it was so, pretty much anything could be made out to look like potential illegal activity, a simple and perfect way to use tax-dollars for taking out your enemies,  and people you just generally don't like.

       And why not start a murder investigation into anyone who likes artwork depicting dead people, cause that's definitely evidence that they're involved in something with dead people, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or why not just investigate anyone who seems like a murderer, and hasn't been truthful about their basement either, even though no one has been murdered, just cause otherwise how would you explain how anyone can seem like a murderer and not be?

       Why exactly? You shouldn't have to add in things to make a crime a crime, either there has to be suspicion about a concrete law that has been broken, or there is nothing to come after.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, the "suspects" are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, so there isn't really anything to clear them off - the burden of proof is never on the suspects, because it's impossible to prove that you didn't do anything. So the burden of proof is always on the accusing part when solving and proving crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has to prove their innocence, but someone must at least be able prove the suspicion of a law that has been broken. It's really quite simple - what law do you suggest has been broken? and why do you think that? - If
       <strong>
        anyone
       </strong>
       can give plausible answers to these two questions, well then there isn't really any talking against it anymore, but still no one will come up with an answer that actually takes the law and the boundaries that the police work under, under consideration.

       It seems be some kind of government or marketing experiment, perhaps to see how easy it would be to get people to sign away their own legal rights?

       Don't forget about the timing of introduction (right around Comey's letter, really took off afterwards,) which had been preceded by Eric Prince (Blackwater, Betsy DeVos's sister) going on Breitbart claiming these "new emails" had proof of all this horrible stuff, proof that everyone's Clinton fears were totally true in the worst way, mentions Epstein and alludes to pedophilia, then the emails are said to be duplicates of no relevant investigative value whatsoever. Pizzagate has been maintained, and if you are a high-level Hillary/government/scary elites basher there's a good chance you're posting about it on facebook. Did the Podesta emails present anything questionable besides this interpretive fairy tale? The notion is so nightmarish it has strong legs, and the longer it isn't taken seriously by the scary TPTB the more it feels true, etc.

       Besides all that, nobody cares if the theory hurts anyone in the real world--small price to pay when the lives of innocent children are potentially at risk, I guess. Probably assume they deserve it anyway.

       It's not a lot of money.  Maybe to you and me, but in the world of corporate and government spending, it is chump change.
      </p>
      <p>
       My company routinely spends $5-10K on
       <em>
        teambuilding events
       </em>
       that don't even include alcohol.  A recent event at
       <a href="http://topgolf.com/us/">
        Top Golf
       </a>
       cost almost $7k for a one hour team meeting, followed by two hours of golf and buffet lunch (no booze).  That was for only 60 fucking people, and nobody had to fly in the goddamned help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our yearly Christmas party (held in a local hotel ballroom with several hundred people and an open bar) exceeds $10K by orders of magnitude.  I'd say that $65K for an authentic Chicago pizza and hotdog party at the White House is a
       <em>
        fucking steal
       </em>
       .

       Finally, there is zero evidence that taxpayer funds were used for any of this, and the copious links that the other dude provided you with above seem to make that abundantly clear.

       What should be collected, how would you determine what is evidence and what isn't without any crime to connect it too?

       A knife is not suspicious, unless it might be considered a murder weapon, but it wouldn't be without a murder.

      <p>
       If the police knocked at your door, and asked if they could investigate your place, would you just let them in? Would you do it then if they told you they were doing it because of rumors about you of pedophilia they read online? So that would be most likely be the end of that investigation, since the pizzaguy has pretty much the same legal rights as you would have in that situation.

       Quick question to the skeptics:
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you name one (1) other topic in recent history (let's say since the year 2000) that has been as aggressively censored as pizzagate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream media won't touch it. They created a whole new term (fake news) to discredit it because the old CIA Conspiracy Theoroo wasn't enough (if you think that isn't true, name the dates that a) the term fake news was first used in the media, and b) the term pizzagate was first trending on twitter). Subreddit was taken down. I believe there was something about an image hosting site removing the content (or something). CONSTANT dismissals in countless threads that all follow the same pattern: there's no evidence, no one has come forward, everyone in this sub is crazy now.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's really fake, they wouldn't be fighting it so hard.

      <p>
       I reckon most made up wild stories are by default 'censored' in the sense that they aren't covered. Aliens for example. Take any issue with basically no evidence and a fervent fanbase and they likely feel that they're being censored when really there's no legitimate news to report.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       already did, some of it even addressed the basic points of pizzagate. Not to mention heavily mainstream breitbart and infowars (which are more popular than multiple "mainstream news") reporters trying to push it to the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only legit news on pizzagate are the people who've been driven to breaking by it, like the comet ping pong guy who fired a round off inside but was
       <strong>
        immediately dismissed by the entire pizzagate crowd as an inside agent / false flag because he worked as an actor
       </strong>
       So there you have it, when something actually happens in MSM you just ignore and and claim you're being censored when really you don't like to see an outside perspective of this mess.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because of legal pressure and breaking the rules of reddit, pizzagate is actively attempting to ruin someone's life and business over rumor and hearsay so this should've been expected.

      <p>
       uh yeah, that is the most responsible, most legitimate response to allegations that have no victim and no hard evidence. You try to make it sound like that's some kind of attack designed to undermine a legitimate conspiracy, but it's the only rational response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen these answered over and over by the way, so you're simply not paying attention to the rightful skepticism of pizzagate. You can go as far back to the beginning of the pizzagate threads and find critiques of pizzagate. sort by controversial sometimes.

       I experienced heavy push back from shills who didn't appreciate me calling attention to the exit polls in the 2016 Democratic Presidential primaries. See, in about a dozen states, the exit poll results show OBVIOUS evidence of election fraud with the most egregious instances suggesting over 10% of votes were tampered with to Clinton's benefit. The shill mods in r/politics and r/sandersforpresident even banned me discussing these exit polls. I'd say that topic was similarly censored and corporate media outlets also went out of their way to claim it was debunked by releasing articles that lied and said exit polls being VERY off from reported results was nothing to be worried about. I mean, the corporate media wouldn't even cover the fraud that Wikileaks exposed, they were never going to cover the exit polls that showed votes being hacked.

       Just a thought, but people could start in their home towns. This scandal is not only at one location.
It seems that there are many people, on this site, that are wealthy, and smart. They are the ones who could stop this. As it is, child trafficking news is a broken record.

       Thank you. I've seen what rape/pedophilia accusations can do to people, even when completely unsubstantiated. Flinging accusations at people without considering consequences is just so naive and fucked up.

       How does food get to the White House then? On the surface, it's not as suspicious as you make it look. There are catered events held at the White House.

       These are vetted celebrity chefs - not someone just flown in from Chicago. The ingredients, moreover, have to come from the White House procurement system.

        Let's just do the hot dog one. That's taxpayer money, so there should be a paper trail. And it's false on its face - you can't bring outside food into the White House. So - what exactly is being discussed?

       First of all, this is

        an intra-office email in Stratfor.
       </a>
       It has nothing to do with Podesta or Clinton. Fred Burton of Stratfor said "I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago." He's not claiming to have any special, inside knowledge, so he is probably referring to something in the news.  The email was in May 2009. Just a few weeks earlier, there was a very minor kerfuffle about Obama flying in Pizza. Though the pizza had Chicago-themed names, it was actually from St. Louis, which made some Chicago pizzerias mad.

       Some right-wing bloggers and a few in the media tried to stir up anger at Obama for extravagance or wasting taxpayers' money, but it turned out that no taxpayer money was used to fly the food out.

       Don't forget about the timing of introduction (right around Comey's letter, really took off afterwards,) which had been preceded by Eric Prince (Blackwater, Betsy DeVos's sister) going on Breitbart claiming these "new emails" had proof of all this horrible stuff, proof that everyone's Clinton fears were totally true in the worst way, mentions Epstein and alludes to pedophilia, then the emails are said to be duplicates of no relevant investigative value whatsoever. Pizzagate has been maintained, and if you are a high-level Hillary/government/scary elites basher there's a good chance you're posting about it on facebook. Did the Podesta emails present anything questionable besides this interpretive fairy tale? The notion is so nightmarish it has strong legs, and the longer it isn't taken seriously by the scary TPTB the more it feels true, etc.

       Besides all that, nobody cares if the theory hurts anyone in the real world--small price to pay when the lives of innocent children are potentially at risk, I guess. Probably assume they deserve it anyway.

       Add up enough circumstantial evidence like puzzagate, and add in it the possibility of serial sex abuse and murder of children, at least a due diligence investigation should be done.

       Again. If There is nothing to it, the suspects should be asking to be cleared.

       Pizzagate is about child trafficking. Look if it's trending worldwide online or was then obviously enough people are aware of at least the basic details behind it. Just because in your reality people around you don't know about it doesn't mean everyone else doesn't know either. I'm just stating facts and you're trying to shit talk your way into believing nobody knows or cares about pizzagate.
