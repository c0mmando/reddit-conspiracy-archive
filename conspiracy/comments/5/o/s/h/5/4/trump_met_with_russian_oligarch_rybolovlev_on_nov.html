<p>Another small point of contention ...why does Pizzagate gets shit on for having nothing but circumstantial evidence, but this is ok when it is 100% circumstantial evidence?  We at least need to be consistent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I was responding to the other guy lambasting this sub as being T-D 2.0.  I have no issue with your piece at all.  Here is what I meant ...</p>

<p>...in every Pizzagate thread on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, there are many comments, sometimes even half of all comments, that are asking for solid &quot;proof&quot; and will not accept the conspiracy without that proof.  Now we have a thread that asks an important question about Trump with nothing but circumstantial evidence.  We need to treat either both as false until we get solid proof ..or both as conspiracies in the abscence of solid proof.  My two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m leaving a small thought for you r/all and r/politics vertebrates on this thread.</p>

<p>May it be that you see Reddit as a sort of &quot;Facebook for the more sophisticated&quot;, a beauty contest, something to signal identity to yourself and others?</p>

<p>People ingurgitate a bunch of words and factoids, learn how to regurgitate them, and are thus able to project a false image of erudition. Then they&#39;re given a degree that comforts their illusion. As time goes by they become increasingly mirred in their condition, as forming an original thought becomes increasingly risky (for their image could shatter). They&#39;ll repeat what they read in the NYT (or what other &quot;intelligent&quot; people say or write) because they believe it reinforces their signaled identity.</p>

<p>The socialization of higher education has produced hordes of people educated way beyond their intelligence. Every last moron has a vocabulary, and a degree, that grants him a pretention he formerly couldn&#39;t claim. Is it possible you belong to this configuration?</p>

<p>As with fashionistas wearing certain clothes/styles, or some guys with certain cars, you hold onto your opinions regardless of fact, logic or reason, for the simple reason you think they define who you are.</p>

<p>For example, you should know that if you still believe in aerobats throwing passports out of aircraft cabins and pulverizing 3 steel skyscrapers with 2 aluminum planes on 911, not only are you a nutter conspiracy theorist (worthy of no praise on this sub), not only do you hold the burden of proof for your crazy belief system, but you are on the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polls_about_9/11_conspiracy_theories">wrong side of history</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed you should be aware the ramblings you subject us to when you come visiting on this sub, parroting ad nauseam what the State tells you you have to say to appear intelligent, are decreasingly congruent with a signaled image of intelligence and erudition. My advice is keeping your belief system confined to Reddit, so as to avoid public embarrassment in real life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a repost since the mods took it down. Save this comment and repost at will. </p>

<p>Well, my biggest question is this. Trump team met with Russian billionaire and businessman Dmitry Rybolovlev, on November 3rd. A week before the election. Why? And why is no one else talking about this?</p>

<p>We have pictures of this. <a href="https://twitter.com/AceInCharlotte/status/794345237275639809">here</a> Trump was scheduled for a rally in Charlotte, NC and parked his private jet in a small airport. The plane right next to it arrived that day, for a few hours, belonged to Dmitry. Since real-time GPS tracking of Trump&#39;s plane is disabled, we would not have known if someone hadn&#39;t taken pictures of it. There <em>were</em> ALSO records of Rybolovlev&#39;s plane being there.</p>

<p>Why did the mainstream media not report this? He met with a Russian oligarch 5 days before the election. Why? The media went crazy over Bill Clinton &amp; Lynch... but a Russian oligarch parks his plane next to Trump&#39;s in a small airport on the day Trump is scheduled to be there, and not a sound?</p>

<p>Need I also add, that this man, Dmitry Rybolovlev, has immense political power in Russia because of his wealth? Need I also add that in 2008, he bought a mansion from Trump, which Trump made $60mill in profit off of? (Bought in 2004, $40mill, Sold for $100 mill).  Was this all a way of laundering money? It wouldn&#39;t be the first time a foreign businessman does that in the West - the chinese do it all the time! If it was Clinton, we would have questions being asked.</p>

<p>EDIT - People keep asking me for more pictures/proof (although you can find most of these in the following comment string or in the twitter link):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Flight route for Dmitry&#39;s plane, MKATE: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/baZGv">http://imgur.com/a/baZGv</a> - From Concord to Charlotte, NC. Trump&#39;s Plane also landed in Charlotte NC nov 3rd (see first picture linked)</p></li>
<li><p>Picture of MKATE at Charlotte, NC airport Nov 3rd: <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2Q6CmlUsAAw31e.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2Q6CmlUsAAw31e.jpg</a></p></li>

<li><p>Trump at Concord airport on Nov 3rd (after Dmitry had arrived): <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwYUx2KXUAArRoO.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwYUx2KXUAArRoO.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>Comprehensive flight history: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/baZGv">http://imgur.com/a/baZGv</a> It is interesting to note that his recent flight history does not contain any trips to North Carolina otherwise. I think it is VERY LIKELY he was there to meet with Trump&#39;s team/Trump.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s undeniable that the Trump team, Trump and Rybolovlev were all at this tiny Charlotte, NC airport on the same day the week before the election date. The important thing is WHY?</p>

<p>EDIT:
Didn&#39;t expect this to blow up. RIP my inbox, and thank you for the reddit gold comrades!</p>

The US political (and possible economical) system is being destroyed from all sides, inside and out. It has little to do with Trump, Clinton, and any other specific actor. They are just symptoms of a failing system.</p>

<p>The fact that we had the two most disliked people in the USA competing for the presidency should be evidence enough, that is not normal or something a healthy system does. The establishment is finally being exposed and we are seeing that is completely corrupt. It&#39;s only going to get worse from here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the issue people have with lifting sanctions on Russia, is they have a very poor wealth distribution model.  That is, any sanctions lifted will almost certainly, only benefit Putin and those in power. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s very important that people understand, opposing Russia is not a stance against it&#39;s people, but rather against those in power.  It&#39;s quite sad in a lot of ways, as Russia really had the chance to be in China&#39;s position or even better when communism fell. </p>

<p>The cold war produced a very large and educated populist that could have easily produced world changing technology, had a more nurturing model been adopted.  However, greed took precedent, which created a massive wealth gap, which basically killed innovation.</p>

<p>Most innovations in developed countries comes from ordinary folks that have the luxury of taking risk.  That is, there is enough safety nets in place, to ensure failure does not mean death.  In developing countries, this is not the case, since survival comes first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re spot on with most of this, though Yeltsin was not really a &quot;puppet&quot; i thought?</p>

<p>Russia is doing propaganda in Europe and empowering pro-Russia parties without a doubt. I completely agree with you that the latest efforts are Putin &amp; Russia&#39;s attempts to keep and regain strength in the face of his country&#39;s economic decline. Currently they are economically on-par with Italy which is far smaller population wise, so I think Putin is trying to keep stability in his country by engaging in propaganda that says &quot;things are going well&quot;, &quot;the West is victimising us&quot;, and the like. I think it&#39;s very plausible Trump is being heavily bribed or coerced to be doing what he is doing, and stands to make an unbelievable amount of money from this, which fits with Putin&#39;s willingness to engage with oligarchs that are friendly to him. </p>

<p>Granted, I was scared as shit of Clinton because of her Syria stance, but this is now going to require a real, tangible response by the US left to ensure we don&#39;t get <em>too</em> friendly with RUS and risk security in the Baltics or other parts of the world. </p>

<p>It depends on who you ask. I didn&#39;t think Yeltsin was a puppet either but that is a Russian nationalist&#39;s classic MO.</p>

<p>Interesting to note that Trump used to be in touch with Gorbachev&#39;s and later Yeltsin&#39;s guys too. Although I&#39;m sure it was nothing, his ties to Russian politicians go back pretty deep.</p>

And to be clear, I am not convinced that the Russian government was involved, and I do believe that the transparency brought about by the leak was a good thing.  But if Putin actually did authorize a cyber attack against one of our political parties in order to benefit the other, then we should be very concerned about the fact that he got what he wanted.</p>

<p>Cmon man, normal Americans were never worried about WW3 if Clinton got elected. Besides reddit I have never met someone who even considered the possibility, and pretty much everyone in my family voted for Trump. It is 100% a a line from the most biased of Trump supporters. </p>

<p>I say that Clinton nor Putin would start WW3 because I do have some understanding of geopolitics. We are not at a point similar to WW1 where any little crises could spiral out of control. Everyone understands major conflict will have no real victors. But, just for what-if&#39;s sake, if Putin starts invading countries like Germany did in WW2 than I guess we&#39;re just supposed to appease him and let him do it? </p>

I 100% disagree on them spending money on Trump&#39;s campaign. There is, however, evidence that Clinton spent countless dollars on foreign campaigns (read Hastings&#39; book The Operators) and her meddling in Palestinian elections...

<p>As far as both of them being here at the same time is concerned; As stated, Trump had a rally here. He had reason to be here. Charlotte is a MAJOR banking city. As a matter of fact; Charlotte is the 2nd largest banking city in the U.S besides NYC. There is a federal reserve here as well. So the billionaire Russian banker could even have had a plausible reason to be here. </p>

<p>FWIW; Charlotte-Douglas Airport also houses one if the largest Air National Guard Armories in the country... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, I edited my post. Concord was a slip of my mind, I meant Charlotte. Concord is unimportant, just that MKATE made a pitstop there before flying to Charlotte.</p>

<p>The pics were taken at Charlotte and they were a gate away from each other, as per the map. As for banking? Rybolovlev did not make any other stops in NC that year, I only checked the flight records a year back. He does do a lot of trips to NYC (and two to Florida, where his property was recently put up for sale). One could deduce that he does most of his banking in NYC rather than NC simply because he does not travel to NC outside this one instance. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>? The fact that his plane was there for 12 hours on the day Trump was, a gate away, on the same tarmac, is a VERY strange coincidence to me. It would be less strange if he hadn&#39;t done previously sketchy money-laundering real estate deals with Trump, but strange nonetheless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>George Lombardi, a Trump friend who lives in Trump Tower, told reporters that he had coffee there Thursday with Le Pen, who he said he has known for 20 years. He said Le Pen did not request a meeting with Trump.</p>

<p>A day earlier, Lombardi said, they attended a party with people they believe might raise money for her campaign, including business people and diplomats.</p>

<p>&quot;This is a perfectly privately encounter that she had with some friends of ours,&quot; Lombardi said. &quot;Some people had been asking to meet her a long time ago, and she just happened to be here because I happen to live here.&quot;</p>

<p>Stop. The US Supreme Court ruled against this claim in 1869. And even if they had seceded lawfully, they lost the Civil War and would therefore have been conquered by the United States and annexed as say, Hawaii or other land by Congress as re-iterated in 1901.</p>

<p>Every time this minority opinion comes up, it is laughed at — including by conservative Justices like Antonin Scalia who says that if nothing else, the outcome of the Civil War showed that there is no unilateral right so secede, even if established in treaty.</p>

<p>You are simply wrong.</p>

<p>What about it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was the democratic south that split from the union the first time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly. Using that term confuses the policy goals of the parties at the time, which were basically inverted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it is not possible then why allow a state to have it on their ballot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no mechanism for the Federal Government to block a State from having something on its ballot. Whether or not the vote means anything is a totally different matter. For example, legalizing marijuana doesn&#39;t mean the DEA won&#39;t arrest people under Federal Law. I don&#39;t understand your objection here, and it appears based on a lack of understanding of US law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also if 34 states agree to leave then they overrule national law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>You need 38 state legislatures, and 2/3rds of both the House and Representatives in order to pass a Constitutional Amendment necessary to authorize a secession.</p>

<p>What you linked to is a manipulation and cherry picking of data to support a narrative that Republicans are more progressive and anti-Racist than they in fact are.</p>

<p>In reality, the Civil Rights Movement and slavery was one of several sea-change moments which shifted the positions of the parties.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the time to go through it, but people like George Wallace and Stom Thurmond left the Democrat Party in response to the anti-Slavery position.</p>

<p>The Democrats are not largely based in the Union, while the Republicans are not largely based in the Confederacy. General approach to policy, etc... has similarly shifted.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no real argument against this observation. </p>

<p>No I didn&#39;t. Use pronouns so I can understand what your saying. My only argument was that the Republicans and Democrats have switched ideologies since the era of Lincoln so its very confusing to use the term the way you did.</p>

<p>Because sometimes national parties move slowly?</p>

<p>I mean, its been 35 years since Reagan basically, and you have the Republicans now being Fascists, and the Democrats being Center-Right Republicans.</p>

<p>How and why parties evolve platforms and opinions is a totally different question than whether it happened, and whether your characterization in your original comment was meaningful.</p>

<p>You&#39;re either too stupid to understand that you&#39;ve been corrected and move on, or you&#39;re maliciously against being corrected, in which case you&#39;re an anti-democratic Fascist who I don&#39;t need to bother myself with (other than to eliminate you should we need to use force to settle our ideas). Either way you can&#39;t be reasoned with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about we talk to another libral and watch them go back to the same people you mentioned earlier and their answer will be it happened in the 50&#39;s/60&#39;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How about you learn to spell, and understand that you&#39;ve moved the discussion from Slavery, to the Civil Rights Act, to the Equal Rights Amendment, three very different ideas and progressions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically you can&#39;t answer the why so you do straw-man answers and will deny the truth with it right in front of you. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The why was not the question. The why is complicated, but I gave you a general look at it: that it was based on geography, economic sector, educational attainment, and constituency demographics. That&#39;s a pretty good fucking why.</p>

<p>That you can&#39;t accept that these factors led to the switching of the Republicans with the Democrats on a lot of positions over time, largely based on regional politics means I&#39;m bored with you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democrats lost power and are not willing to give it up peacefully like the republicans do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Republicans don&#39;t give it up peacefully — thers been no evidence of the Democrats and Obama not giving up power peacefully, because he could have easily said he viewed Trump as illegitimate the night of the election. Your accusation doesn&#39;t even make sense. </p>

<p>Furthermore, Donald Trump normalized protest and contesting elections (as in fact did Bush) when he said he might not accept them. The moment he said he might not, he legitimized exactly the way many who disagree with him are treating him. He only has himself to blame.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t really care since I&#39;m wealthy white straight New Yorker, and the flyover states are already irrelevant. This election of Trump was their last dying grasp, and they fucked up by electing someone who will give them minimum wage jobs in Foxconn factories.</p>

<p>You were duped along with the rest of your kin, and will likely starve to death in irrelevance.</p>

<p>Yuri&#39;s talking about what happened to you / what Putin did to you.</p>

<p>Have a nice life. I doubt it will be long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The troll is the self center asshole that is you. &quot; I live in New York and the rest of country is irrelevant&quot;. Then you proceed to wish me a life of poverty and unemployment.  Before that you used insult after insult and brought no facts. Just talk and a trust me. I thought democrats were for acceptance and peace but you displayed hate and disdain for your fellow Americans when you said Hilary should not have apologized for insulting half the nation. I was having conversation and all you can do is attack and not give 1% of acceptance.  Tomorrow you will wake and preach love and peace then spit in face of you fellow countrymen.  You support riots and voilence and wish for the failure of the pilot driving this country. I didn&#39;t vote for Obama but I never wished for him to be worse than Jimmy Carter. The tolerant left being peaceful and wishing death upon the country and disgust for all but themselves is the problem. Not the Trump voters trying to have constructive conversations. </p>

<p>They had the nukes because that was where the USSR kept them, and then the USSR collapsed. Don&#39;t speculate, read. I linked to the treaty like 5 comments up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they &#39;gave them away&#39;, if America promised to protect them for invasion for russians...</p>

<p>Again, this was the same treaty that Russia also signed. Both the US and Russia pledged to respect Ukrainian territorial integrity.</p>

<p>I hope you understand if I don&#39;t find any of them super convincing- there&#39;s a lot of bias and extrapolation going on. Calling the invasion of Crimea a &quot;legal annexation&quot; is particularly outrageous. </p>

<p>But I do think it&#39;s clear that the US was at least advising the new government after the overthrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gee pa, I diddun figure that!</p>

<p>Did you know that with the reunification of Germany, America promised not to expand NATO into Eastern Europe and that policy makers used to talk about making Sevastopol a US Navy post?</p>

<p>Did you know that American officials with the CIA founded National endowment for democracy funded and organized Maidan protests?  Did you know Ukrainian neo Nazi mercenaries admitted firing into police AND protestors to cause chaos at Maidan?  Did you know that corrupt Ukrainian oligarch have seized power in Kiev and are dolling out government positions to people connected to Goldman Sachs and the Obama regime?  Did you know the Kiev government burned people alive for protesting in Odessa, and that it also formed extermination squads to attack and drive out ethnic Russians in the east and Putin&#39;s support for rebels there was in direct response to this reality and democratic pressure within Russia to not leave Ukrainian Russians to the wolves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s bad what Putin did.  But there is a moral principle of aggression tied to who acted first.  The West used violence first (through its proxies), and Russia reacted.  </p>

<p>The implication is obvious, that if the Maidan coup hadn&#39;t occurred, and the putsch regime hadn&#39;t sent conscript/mercenary squads to ensure the disenfranchisement of the East, then Putin wouldn&#39;t have supported the rebels.</p>

<p>Use some fucking logic: The Maidan coup was unconstitutional and disenfranchised the east.  Thus, the east was unlikely to recognize the authority of the new government.  Thus the western funded and supported putsch regime sent squads to exterminate those who hope for Russian self-determination - I.e.: the right to participate and be enfranchised in government in Kiev despite being ethnically Russian.  Thus some Russians resisted and rebelled.  Thus Putin sent operators in to help the rebels organize and fight.</p>

<p>As for MH17, I believe it&#39;s possible to lowly that the Russian buk shot it down.  But why would Putin want that?  If it was the Russians, then it was a mistake.  And if it was a mistake, it means that MH17 was being used to cover warplanes and/or made to look like a warplane.</p>

<p>Where are the ATC tapes?  Why was the plane diverted and forced to fly over a war zone?</p>

<p>You know, the West has used false flag terror many times in conflicts having nothing to do with russia and Pravda.</p>

<p>Assad crushed protests and then the CIA began arming rebels. So, using your logic, this was OK.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Ukrainian government sent militia to fight rebels, just like Assad sent vicious militias to fight rebels.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the east was unlikely to recognize the authority of the new government. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was only due to the incredible amount of propaganda on Russian news channels. People in Kiev openly speak Russian. There is no hatred between Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians and Russian speakers. The ENTIRE conflict is an artificial one, propagated by the Kremlin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if it was a mistake, it means that MH17 was being used to cover warplanes and/or made to look like a warplane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, even after admitting the E. Ukrainians shot it down, you still somehow blame the West?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where are the ATC tapes? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>ATC transcript is out in the Dutch report.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why was the plane diverted and forced to fly over a war zone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you even read the article I linked? Points 3 and 4directly debunk this:</p>

<p><a href="https://wheretospotatairports.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/malaysian-airlines-flight-mh17-never-deviated-from-its-flight-plan-route/">https://wheretospotatairports.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/malaysian-airlines-flight-mh17-never-deviated-from-its-flight-plan-route/</a></p>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Incorrect. Accoding to the Dutch Safety Board the aircraft was offered Flightlevel 350 by Dnipro control. The captain of MH17 prefered to stay on FL330. Likely because of the weight of the aircraft. Instead the Singapore Airlines B777 flying behind MH17 was allowed to climb to FL350.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>You know, the West has used false flag terror many times in conflicts having nothing to do with russia and Pravda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russia pumped out no less than half a dozen different conspiracy theories about MH17. False flags, SU-25s, they were aiming for Putin&#39;s plane, paying some Ukrainian pilot to pretend to &quot;defect&quot; to Russia and claim he heard another pilot admit he shot down MH17, paying a Spanish dude to pretend to be a Ukrainian ATC and claim in an interview with RT Spanish that he heard a pilot say he shot down MH17, etc,. the list goes on....</p>

<p>I agree that Russia has been treated unfairly, especially with regard to NATO, but that doesn&#39;t mean we have to believe everything they say. Nuance is key here.</p>

<p>You&#39;re downplaying a very serious threat in Ukraine which will inevitably boil over as we&#39;ve seen countless times before. Svoboda is not the only fascist organization, there&#39;s also the Azov Regiment, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, and Right Sector. None of these organizations or their violence has been denounced by the US, who have instead given their leaders legitimacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice little touch at the end there.</p>

<p>CIA didn&#39;t arm rebels because protests were being crushed.  They created and exploited the crisis, and sent foreign fighters and arms in, known terrorist extremists, with the intent of destabilizing the region and hopefully creating conditions for a western coalition to enter and replace Assad.  It never had anything to do with popular sentiment in Syria and was an op from day one.</p>

<p>In contrast, the Ukrainian situation in maidan was a western sponsored and organized coup with the explicit intent of removing Russian influence because <em>for better or fucking worse</em> the east Ukrainians democratically supported Russian friendly politics.  Just like in Afghanistan and Vietnam - and here with Trump for now - this is the American establishment only supporting democracy that results in governments that are friendly to its foreign policy goals.</p>

<p>Fuck that shit.</p>

<p>And fuck that shit about flight levels.  3 dimensions.  Why were they diverted over the war zone?  It&#39;s not debunked.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to ignore them but I&#39;m free to ignore whoever the fuck I want or downvote them and give my argument. When everyone on the sub does that then you get a sub with an identity. Now that the sub&#39;s identity is changing to reflect the changing views of is subscribers now so all of a sudden all these users like you come out of the woodwork trying to mold reality to your own liking and tell people how they should think.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Trump supporter, but I don&#39;t excuse anything he does. So far, he is pretty clean and he has not been tied to any major conspiracies, but I&#39;m not a blind sheep... If the guy does stupid shit or is corrupted, I will drop my support immediately.</p>

<p>One reason many Trump supporters are so defensive is because there have been so many attacks and false allegations against him. Trump and his supporters have been attacked a lot and called every name in the book. It&#39;s only human that they are very defensive. If all of the criticisms of Trump had been more credible, it might be a different story.</p>

<p>That said, Trump is not perfect and we have to consider that he could be caught up in some shit. It&#39;s very important that we all follow every lead and keep him honest. It&#39;s our job as citizens and users of this thread to stay impartial and not dismiss stuff just bc we like the guy.</p>

<p>Alone the meeting of these two planes would be nothing of importance. But like many things in this world, the chances given the latest facts does give me concern.</p>

<p>Most likely in scenario is that the Russians have proof of Trump helping businesses or people launder money out of Russia and into real estate or casinos. It&#39;s possible that is why he lost so much money compared to his competitors in the casino&#39;s. </p>

<p>This I think becomes relatively more interesting now for conspirators after finding out that Russian puppet Paul Manafort was fired as campaign manager but still lived inside the trump tower after his firing, he had an apartment in there. You cannot make this stuff up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, well first off.. Trump has a fuck-ton of shady shit going on. His obvious ties to Russia, his fake university, his foundation that he already got in trouble for abusing, ect. </p>

<p>Second, I don&#39;t mind differing opinions on most social/economic issues as there is room for disagreement. But on his anti-science issues like climate change and the EPA I absolutely take a hard-line stance against him and people like you who support him. Why? Because your ignorance to scientifically-accepted data endangers not only my future, but my childrens also. I want a healthier ecosystem, I want cleaner air, water, and land. I don&#39;t want to suffer these insane mass extinction events we see in some of the most iconic species out there. When Trump and his supporters start actively rejecting science, that&#39;s where I draw the line. </p>

I mean, yeah we see all the conspiracies about Clintons and Obama because they&#39;re 100% tied in deep into the gross global misconduct George Webb has pretty perfectly explained in his videos. There&#39;s not much definite evidence that trump is involved in the big cabal, and more evidence suggesting that he&#39;s been fighting them. The pissgate shit was unfounded and a rumor. </p>

<p>This actually has substance, so no one is complaining or writing it off. It&#39;s better than the &quot;Putin personally hacked Hillary and gave it to Assange&quot; narrative for sure.

<p>You trying desperately to discredit that fact doesn&#39;t change it.</p>

<p>Keep on with the colorful language and keep thinking anybody is reading your comments and thinking &quot;hmm. This real person who makes valid points against trump and only attacks other users sounds like a cool guy and is definitely unbiased and doesn&#39;t sound like a paid shill&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it astroturfing if I say Trump is a piece of shit with obvious ties to Russia?  I held the same opinion since the 90s because it&#39;s been obvious to any New Yorker.  I&#39;ve posted here for the better part of a decade and have commented about the shitty things that Bush, Obama, Trump, and many others have done.  It&#39;s clear that this sub has been coopted by Russian-favoring, Trump-supporting, loquacious accounts.  Some are mods who will push comically bad theories like pizzagate, stories designed to be complete directional disinformation, and then will put an &quot;unconfirmed&quot; label on something that is factually true (like Obama and Trump being briefed on the contents of the dossier).  The vast majority of astroturfing in this sub is pro trump/pro Russia and anti everything else.  This is a phenomenon that only started 12ish months ago.</p>

<p>Reading about this guy, hes wanted for extradition to Russia and seems like hes banned from the country.

<p>Did you forget that late in 2008 is when the housing bubble burst?  Of course he lost a shit load of value on it.  And now it is almost back to $100 Million in value. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was worth $40 mil in 2004. When he purchased it, the housing market already burst, so he should have paid no where near $100 mil on it - most people were underpaying by 50% at the time. I can get out a zillow history for you if you are not compelled to believe me. </p>

<p>Instead, in a shitty realestate market he overpaid by 50% when it was probably worth less than what Trump originally paid? Come on man. Now he can barely break even, what a great job. It was never worth 100 mill in 2008. Never ever. </p>

<p>I remember a family friend buying a $2 million dollar house in 2008 for 500k, then selling it in 2012 for $2 mill. My dad brokered the deal. You didn&#39;t lose if you had enough $ to buy in 2008 and weren&#39;t trying to money launder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah...so he bought it in 04.  It then increased in value by 10%+ for 2.5 years then by a smaller amount until sometime in 2007.  After that it started falling and he sold it for $30 million less than his original asking price of $125 million.  </p>

<p>He also supposedly &quot;flipped&quot; this house and made massive upgrades inside.  No clue how much he put into it, but it doesn&#39;t seem that crazy to me that this happened.  Is it questionable?  Sure.  Is it anything more than a weak link where this Russian dude made a poor investment for a few years until the market turned back around? I need more.  Maybe Trump sold this dude on a shitty investment and convinced him it was the deal of the century.  Maybe this dude bailed Trump out in return for when Trump came to power 8 years later or a future favor tbd.  </p>

<p>But for real, I need more.  </p>

<p>Has this Russian guy made any shady or interesting investments lately?  Is there anything that Trump has said he will do that will help this guy? Being in the same place at the same time is something to watch, but is not enough to really get me going yet. Keep going and link this to something else. This is a &quot;hmm&quot; story, not a &quot;holy shit&quot; story. It needs more meat.</p>

<p>According to this article that tries to tie the two together, the sale happened in the summer.  The crash was in September if I remember correctly.  He also bought his daughter an $88 million Manhattan apartment.  </p>

<p>This sale is the only thing linking the two together.  Maybe it is something, but I need more than one link and both being at the 10th busiest American airport on the same day.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub has to shift to the left now or else it completely defeats the purpose of this sub. Trump and the Republicans will hold all 3 branches of the federal government. Accepting the new government and trying to defend it is quite funny when you look at the past year and the exclusive anti-Clinton posts here. Especially since the Left only held the presidential seat and that was it. Conservatives were favored in the Supreme court and had majority in the House. Yet somehow liberals were the source of all evil on this sub for at least the past year. </p>

<p>Before this month, literally every single top post was either anti-clinton or anti-liberals. Seems suspicious to me. </p>

<p>To be more precise he is linked to <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/10103334">XITRANS FINANCE LTD.</a> </p>

<p>Furthermore, an alias of his - Monsieur D. Rybolovlev - is also linked to same company.</p>

Better bring out a &quot;Trump is bought and paid for by the Russians and anyone who doesn&#39;t agree is not a true conspiracy theorist and they need a safe space&quot;--a sentence so loaded with &quot;triggers&quot; that even the staunchest libertarian&#39;s blood pressure will rise a few points just reading it.</p>

<p>Who the fuck did this research? Who is OP?</p>

<p>A concerned citizen that poured over all of Trump&#39;s business dealings? Then highlighted Russian names and searched for their private jets? Then searched for flight histories? Then correlated that with Trump&#39;s flight patterns? Then found a &quot;hit&quot; and posted this--and if we don&#39;t believe it we&#39;re shills?</p>

<p>And then if I&#39;m to believe this is organic, am I also to believe that oppo research on Trump didn&#39;t begin until now? The Russian connections are just NOW coming to light? After 18 months of trying to take this man down, someone just NOW decided to give this Russian thing a quick once over and see if there&#39;s any dirt?</p>

<p>And the retort is: as a conspiracy theorist you should believe NOTHING. If you have faith in Trump, you&#39;re not a TRUE conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>They&#39;re trying their damndest to kill this revolution before it starts. I&#39;m sad to see so many of my comrades starting their periods and shedding blood before the bullets have even started flying. </p>

<p>I am a 22 year old Russian-Canadian law student. I would say my political leanings are centre-right economically, socially it ranges between right/left depending on the issue.</p>

<p>I like reading about geopolitics in my spare time. I was reading twitter just to waste time on my day off and someone retweeted the woman who posted the original links. Khan-something, some never-trump guy. I looked into it, skyped my friend and told him about it, and then decided to look further into it because I&#39;m autistic, slightly. People pointed out that flight patterns were online and another redditor got a free trial and hosted pics on imgur, posting them in another thread. Then I made this thread because it wasn&#39;t getting any attention on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or elsewhere.</p>

<p>But I mean, if you&#39;re implying I&#39;m CNN or something... that&#39;s... cool, I guess? If I got a real job my parents would be proud!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is ridiculous. Trump and the reps literally have all control of the Federal government and here y&#39;all are defending him. That seems contradictory to this sub&#39;s purpose. And its not like liberals held all the power in the last election or even for the past 6 years. All they had was the president, which was blocked constantly, yet somehow Trump cannot be criticized by y&#39;all when he has everything in his hands? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Russia scandal is fake news everyone. Move passed it and look at where the real criminals are. We can use Trump to drain the swamp, we don&#39;t need to like him, but his people are at least a little better than what is in there now.</p>

We haven&#39;t even see him make any executive political decisions yet that actually have affected the country. He&#39;s appointed people, so what?

<p>T_D instantly bans anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with their views. Most people who openly hate them are already banned and if someone new from /all disagrees it doesn&#39;t matter, a quick ban a lbs comment delete will fix that.</p>

<p>Maybe... I&#39;ve seen a bit of Mossad before, but never confirmed any Russians. Got any examples?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dossier was not proven to be anything but unconfirmed allegations.  It has certainly not been deemed a hoax by anyone of any merit besides Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.

The organization sure seems to not have withdrawn it since there is still a link to it and now a contact number for more info, if they thought it was fake they would remove it and offer an apology so they wouldn&#39;t face libel suits.</p>

<p>It is bull that this sub claims to be unbiased but won&#39;t let any of the incredibly sketchy thing the fucking president elect is doing or has done stay here for more than a day.

<p>The FSB has a history of using sexual manipulation to blackmail people.  Donald Trump had a history of being sexually promiscuous, is it really so outlandish to think he fucked a prostitute in a Russian hotel?

<p>As a regular, this mods behavior is unusual - Every time others come into the sub, we are accused of being far right by the left, and shills by the right, but if they would stay past this event, they would see that we are mostly paranoids who don&#39;t trust anyone, and are truth oriented rather than something as silly as identifying oneself with a political party.  All political parties are crooks, liars, and cheats. </p>

<p>Probably a shocker, but wait until after this dies down, you&#39;ll see the occasional thread on this event, but mostly back to trying to find truth.  Just because a thread is labeled &quot;Shocking, Something something political opinion&quot; - doesn&#39;t mean the comments within support the threads title.   It&#39;s actually mostly arguing about what seems more truthful, and some paranoia with a healthy dose of rebellion embedded in our blood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To clarify for everyone else. Mods are being misleading. Conspiracy was mentioned in the front page post. Along the lines of &quot;I bet conspiracy won&#39;t talk about this at all&quot;. So people went to this sub. There was no link to this thread. No one organized anything. They simply said &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> won&#39;t talk about this I bet&quot;. </p>

<p>That image you have? It says pretty much exactly what I said. Some big comment mentioned conspiracy, everyone thought to check the sub out. That&#39;s not a brigade.</p>

<p>This is just the mods trying to stifle any conversation about trump. They pulled this same shit with the last thread, which reached all. Now they&#39;re doing it again. In about an hour they&#39;ll probably delete the thread as well.</p>

All conspiracies should be welcomed, I guess except for ones that are playing the side of the fence you as mods don&#39;t agree with. This outlandish sticky you have posted on this thread falls in line with the piss thread from 2 weeks ago. Why is there a very blatant concerted effort on your part as mods to try and manipulate any post about a Trump conspiracy as being ridiculous and intrusive? Why is it that we have a very questionable incoming POTUS and you guys are making a mission to quell any possible scandal that could come out of his already scandalous ascension to the most powerful position in our government? I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t get answers but hey, at least you caught Comet pizza diddling kids. We over from the real world have plenty of thoughts about what a load of shit that is, but please, let the alt right and their brigade continue to decide what is and what is not acceptable in this sub. You guys, as mods, are garbage and your justification here is a steaming pile of shit. </p>

People are actually making posts with evidence that are banner example of quality posts for this sub with citations and you&#39;re trying to delegitimize it?  And you do so by linking a random screenshot of a single comment, with no context, and a measly 17 upvotes? It&#39;s laughable and really shows your hand.  </p>

If they have real estate transactions between each other perhaps it was something around that.  If Rybolovlev has some sort of Putin connection then maybe there&#39;s more at play?  I&#39;d like to know more about what political influence he has other than just being a rich guy.  There&#39;s plenty of billionaires in the world who don&#39;t have political power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder of those three million votes what number wasn&#39;t a result of ballot stuffing and busing in illegal immigrants over the border to vote. The Midwest states (my home state of Michigan among them) remember what it was like to have jobs in their region, they remember what it was like to earn a livable wage independent of government assistance which only gives enough crumbs to quit them, they remember what life was like before NAFTA of which Bill Clinton signed, sealed, and delivered to the moneyed interest. The trade deal that ruined their lives and opportunity, they knew full well that Hillary Clinton would usher in the equally if not more destructive TPP and wanted nothing to do with it, and so, they went with man who said he would (and did) destroy the TPP, restructure NAFTA, and give them back their lives.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I voted for him and that&#39;s why he won. Now we&#39;ll see where this goes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where is the flight tracker for Trump&#39;s plane for that day? And how come the building and air traffic control tower aren&#39;t in the background of the google maps view of where Trump&#39;s plane was parked... there is a different building there... and no control tower in the wide shot. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the photo wasn&#39;t taken there... but the map and plane photos certainly don&#39;t match.... and I can&#39;t find any tower around the Wilson Air Center similar to that... with a tree and a then hangar between it and the tarmac. </p>

<p>You did a good job placing the Russian plane there, but putting Trump plane there is the weak part of the story. </p>

<p>I think a terrorist attack planned on the inauguration is more important and that got shilled hard.  4-8 yeard of Trump, him maybe going to Russia isn&#39;t a conspiracy.  Im sure he has skeletons just like any billionaire elite but these same people have ignored all Hillary&#39;s dirty deeds just look at their sub. same as MSM ignored Obama&#39;s 26,000 bombs and the fake birth certificate that took a 2x Obama voter 5 years to release the findings that any lab in the country could tell were fakes.</p>

<p>Sick and tired of the MSM shitting on everything, no need to ruin this sub further.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if recent revelations are from the same shills concerning CPP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/27/news/donald-trump-russian-deal-mansion/">In a 2004 auction, Trump snapped up the property from Gosman&#39;s Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Estate for $41 million, according to property records.</a></p>

<p>During the 4 year period, property prices were rising quickly. Assuming Trump made a decent deal, as he is known to do, puts some money into and flips it when the market peaks.</p>

<p>In such a situation, depending on how much he spent renovating it, he makes somewhere under $50m. </p>

<p>That represents .... 0.5% of his wealth. So 0.5% made from sales to Russia, and 99.5% made doing the exact same shit elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now, it is a nice deal and I&#39;m sure he enjoyed it. But...</p>

<p>He bought it at an auction. He didn&#39;t pay market price. He sold it at the peak of the market. </p>

<p>So, we aren&#39;t talking about getting $50m out of nowhere. You compare today&#39;s market value, but he CAN&#39;T get profit. </p>

<p>Neither can millions of other home owners. In fact, millions that bought at the peak had their homes foreclosed on. Others, who could keep them, CAN&#39;T get profit either.</p>

<p>Trump on Nov. 3 was not a public figure, had top notch security but needed to meet this Russian in person because ....</p>

<p>The important thing is WHY?</p>

<p>Why with the media hounding him about Russia and the best privacy money can buy, a huge staff, and a very public schedule with crowds meeting his plane would he give up everything for some random Russian?</p>

<p>A Russian who &quot;did not make any other trips to North Carolina <strong>in recent history</strong>&quot;. Wow, so you&#39;re a law student, eh?</p>

<p>Very cunning use of language. So, this Random Russian has been there before not too long ago. Gotcha.</p>

<p>Hmmm:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The realtor who sold the house has stated that he never move...the Chinese do it all the time!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t know if this is a clever play on words, such as he&#39;s been renting it, but (haha) he never moved in, or is just you providing a common example of what rich Chinese people do (I say this married to a woman from China): overpay and never move in?</p>

<p>This is one of my favourites:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump&#39;s son made 6 trips in 18 months to Russia before 2008–then a Russian oligarch showers Trump with $95M.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The opportunities for lawyerize abound. But let&#39;s go to the most striking. You go from just basic he bought it at auction for fair market price (he wouldn&#39;t), didn&#39;t renovate (he wouldn&#39;t), watch the property market increase by 55%, and then sold it for $95m, making a profit of $32m more than the worst case scenario and that becomes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a Russian oligarch showers Trump with $95M.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well done. </p>

<p>There is absolutely no concrete proof anywhere available to the public of Trumps actual wealth. There is speculation, but no hard evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump team met with Russian billionaire and businessman Dmitry Rybolovlev, on November 3rd. A week before the election. Undeniable proof ignored by MSM... but why did he meet Rybolovlev on that day?</p>

<p>We have pictures of this (see bottom of this post). Trump was scheduled for a rally in Charlotte, NC and parked his private jet in a small airport. The plane right next to it arrived that day, for a few hours, belonged to Dmitry. Since real-time GPS tracking of Trump&#39;s plane is disabled, we would not have known if someone hadn&#39;t taken pictures of it, that it was there on November 3rd. There were ALSO flight records of Rybolovlev&#39;s plane being there, as well as pics.</p>

<p>Why did the mainstream media not report this? He met with a Russian oligarch 5 days before the election. It is a very small airport. Rybolovlev did not make any other trips to North Carolina in recent history, just on that day. Why?</p>

<p>This Russian oligarch has a previous relationship with Trump. This man, Dmitry Rybolovlev, has immense political power in Russia because of his wealth? Need I also add that in 2008, he bought a mansion from Trump, which Trump made $60mill in profit off of? (Bought in 2004, $40mill, Sold for $100 mill). Was this all a way of laundering money? It wouldn&#39;t be the first time a foreign businessman does that in the West - the Chinese do it all the time! If it was Clinton, we would have questions being asked.</p>

<p>The property he bought for $95 million from Trump, in 2008, he is trying to sell in 2016 and CAN&#39;T get profit. He divided it up into three lots and he barely broke even on the largest most expensive lot. Clearly not a good investment property.</p>

<p>Also interesting to note: Trump&#39;s son made 6 trips in 18 months to Russia before 2008–then a Russian oligarch showers Trump with $95M. The realtor who sold the house has stated that he never moved in.</p>

Comprehensive flight history: http://imgur.com/a/baZGv It is interesting to note that his recent flight history does not contain any trips to North Carolina otherwise. I think it is VERY LIKELY he was there to meet with Trump&#39;s team/Trump.
</code></pre>

<p>It&#39;s undeniable that the Trump team, Trump and Rybolovlev were all at this tiny Charlotte, NC airport parking lot/TARMAC (tiny in comparison to Heathrow or LAX) on the same day the week before the election date. Their history with suspicious real estate deals is also undeniable. The important thing is WHY?</p>

<p>RIP inbox</p>

<p>EDIT at 7:12 PM EST: Got a neat tag added to this post thanks to the totes unbiased <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods. You guys serious, this isn&#39;t <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>-worthy? Need I make an <a href="/r/uncensor_conspiracy">/r/uncensor_conspiracy</a> to protect my freedom of speech or something? In your side bar: &quot;keep an open mind&quot;? Yet I am not welcome here because it doesn&#39;t fit in with the narrative of the general sub? Pretty sad...</p>

<p>Thanks for the gold nonetheless.</p>

<p>EDIT at 7:42 PM EST: The very transparent <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods sent me a private message asking me to delete and repost this... haha... stop scaring me guys, wtf? We&#39;re all trying to get to the bottom of the same thing... no need for private messages when you&#39;ve already posted a sticky itt... <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LgfHU5j.png">http://i.imgur.com/LgfHU5j.png</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you link? They have &quot;deleted&quot; my top comment even without it saying it&#39;s deleted. I scrolled through every comment and it&#39;s just not there. It was one of the first 30 responses to the Mods sticky comment up top. Within a minute it had 3 upvotes but then immediately lost traction. I found that weird so I looked at the whole thread and funny enough, my comment was nowhere to be seen. Again, it still says it is a live and active comment on my end. I posted pics below. In addition, maybe a Mod could respond here and explain this very questionable situation. This is proof I replied to this mod. Give me proof you aren&#39;t manipulating these comments? 
Below is what was said in my first message to the mod.</p>

<p>Your points here are placated with obvious bias. Subvert your community? Get the fuck out of here. It&#39;s r/conspiracy. All conspiracies should be welcomed, I guess except for ones that are playing the side of the fence you as mods don&#39;t agree with. This outlandish sticky you have posted on this thread falls in line with the piss thread from 2 weeks ago. Why is there a very blatant concerted effort on your part as mods to try and manipulate any post about a Trump conspiracy as being ridiculous and intrusive? Why is it that we have a very questionable incoming POTUS and you guys are making a mission to quell any possible scandal that could come out of his already scandalous ascension to the most powerful position in our government? I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t get answers but hey, at least you caught Comet pizza diddling kids. We over from the real world have plenty of thoughts about what a load of shit that is, but please, let the alt right and their brigade continue to decide what is and what is not acceptable in this sub. You guys, as mods, are garbage and your justification here is a steaming pile of shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s crazy to me that some people still think any of what we are going through is normal or can be attributed to specific political actors. The US political (and possible economical) system is being destroyed from all sides, inside and out. It has little to do with Trump, Clinton, and any other specific actor. They are just symptoms of a failing system.</p>

<p>The fact that we had the two most disliked people in the USA competing for the presidency should be evidence enough, that is not normal or something a healthy system does. The establishment is finally being exposed and we are seeing that is completely corrupt. It&#39;s only going to get worse from here. </p>

<p>Do you realize that that is by definition terrorism?Threat of violence for political gain? 
You mean like planning on gassing people during Deploraball?
I realize America does shady shit to get our way/narrative, and we kind of have done just that and more ourselves, including unjustifiable deaths.
Like Benghazi</p>

<p>but I think they spent lots of effort and $ on trump and his campaign
I 100% disagree on them spending money on Trump&#39;s campaign. There is, however, evidence that Clinton spent countless dollars on foreign campaigns (read Hastings&#39; book The Operators) and her meddling in Palestinian elections...
I think trump is very bad news. I&#39;d like to be wrong,
then you will like the next few years.</p>

<p>And the American shady influence and backin of far right wing groups in Ukrainian politics. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure how you construct that as a pro trump agenda or fear mongering. Remember puppet Clinton was the one that was keener to push the button. </p>

<p>Syria and Ukraine are a big deal. It&#39;s nieve to think otherwise. Proxy wars can heat up fast</p>
