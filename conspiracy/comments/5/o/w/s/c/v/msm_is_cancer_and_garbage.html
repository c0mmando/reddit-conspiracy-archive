I&#39;m from east europe. Romania to be precise. Corrupt as my country may be, I am glad to be here, was thinking of working in U.S.A when I was younger. I&#39;m glad I came to realise my gut feeling was right, I mean fuck bros, there&#39;s some serious shit happening there... Good luck and stay strong. We are watching you. Hope for the best. Lots of positive energy. </p>

<p>Edit: Thank you all for the very constructive conversation, even those who type before reflecting their answers are welcome. I am an open book. Secrets are for &quot;them&quot;. Fuck them. Thanks again. Always be open, always question, always forward.</p>

<p>Edit 2: I really wasn&#39;t expecting so many responses, but mind my phrasing maybe it&#39;s confusing some people as they call me names like they know me, anyway. Criticism is a good thing, writing racist comments is well a &quot;Stonehenge&quot; thing in my opinion. I don&#39;t side with any leader of the current world, be it the Pope or any president, the society is rotten because we help it to be rotten. Meh , what I wanted to point out that I am anti-system which includes warmongering ,msm&#39;s propaganda etc... If we could be of one consciousness we would soar leaps and bounds in every constructive domain of activity. Rambling off. Thank you all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is true.  I recently have been watching some older tv shows on Hulu from 80s.  One show mentions Libya like they are evil incarnate.  Russia was this all knowing evil country.  Meanwhile the show&#39;s hero Cleverly sneaks into their countries and steals what they need, destroying things on the way.  Hero comes home to play cello sad songs on a lake to serenade an eagle.  America motherfuckers!  </p>

<p>The programming was there as plain as day, only now I see it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People talk about how amazing the 80s were, and awesome Reagan.  You can see in tv and movies (Rambo, Rocky as examples) looked like it was a patriotic time to be.  But it was all bullshit.  Even ghostbusters 2 had the Statue of Liberty bringing justice to Vigo.  </p>

<p>What is weird is, the programming now seems different.  Sure you have 24 which is full tilt programming.  But you have shows now that are almost trying to inform us what is happening.  Is it they are so bold, they feel they can talk about and joke about their plans?  Examples of shows I watch are Timeless (good guys going through time machine financed by evil all powerful org that has tainted this country&#39;s history) and blindspot (tattooed woman given to FBI with no memory uses tattoos to solve crimes and later found to be part of some org that is anti government corruption)..</p>

<p>Now talk about Antarctica and star gates and that was the plot line of Stargate Atlantis a few years ago.  </p>

Everything that comes out of their mouths is just wrong. I read A Lot. And not just articles from r/conspiracy. I really try and dig deep and look at everything objectively. My room mate always says, &quot;Oh, is that what you read on the internet?&quot; whenever I bring up certain topics. Syria, chemtrails, all of the shady shit our military and intelligence agencies are up to, 9/11, etc. he immediately tunes me out. I feel like if I say too much, my own friends would have me committed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my theory: it ties to jobs and prosperity.</p>

<p>Back in 2001 and earlier, most didn&#39;t care about any 9/11 conspiracies because far more people were comfortably in the workforce. Cost of living was lower. They hadn&#39;t gone 15 years without a raise at that point.</p>

<p>In general, when things are good and comfortable for the middle class, nobody but the fringe asks questions.</p>

<p>Now, things got pushed a bit too far - to the point where we can feel it. We&#39;ll soon be at 100 <em>million</em> Americans out of the workforce, shit&#39;s expensive, taxes are high, and we&#39;re getting really oddly sick. Life expectancies are dropping for the first time in forever, and death rates are up.</p>

<p>So we start asking questions. And we didn&#39;t like the answers we got.</p>

<p>None of this happens if the bumblebees are off working 9-5&#39;s four days a week. But we got pushed one step too far, and now the information war has begun.</p>

<p>Welcome to the fold, where we seek truth and wade through shils/bots like we&#39;re in the matrix - and I&#39;m telling you when the time comes, you&#39;ll be ready and won&#39;t even need to dodge them. ;)</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and <em>turn off the TV</em>. </p>

<p>Look for truth wherever else you can find it, the media manipulates what they do or rather don&#39;t show you - the world is their stage and they can set up green screens and literally be anywhere. Fake voices, fake CGI, paid interviews to push agendas, Paid actors to portray a world event for them. Etc etc etc</p>

<p>Funny story: first thing I did was Google Soen. Clicked on &#39;Soen wiki&#39;, describing a metal band. Somehow get redirected to a wiki band page for &quot;Standing on the Edge of the Noise&quot;, which seemed like a cool acronym. Start reading description: </p>

<p>Standing on the Edge of the Noise is a unique, intimate look at Oasis performing in their own space, instead of the huge stadium stages on which they are more often seen.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s Oasis, the guys who are standing under a champagne supernova somewhere. Totally confused me for a sec, trying to figure out if you really recommended me to Oasis 2.0. Lol</p>

<p>East Europe doesn&#39;t have to worry about Russia unless its an ex-U.S.S.R country, perhaps Estonia, and a few others, however, as long as they are in relative peace, they will remain sovereign.</p>

<p>Ukraine was most likely a U.S. Alphabet backed proxy/coup to put in their own puppet, and right after that, Joe Biden son joins the board of the biggest gas company in Ukraine. There&#39;s a shit ton of info on the fuckery that went on in there and Crimea, so Putin reacted, and Annexed Crimea which the majority wanted anyway (there are plenty of benefits of this geopolitically and economically) </p>

<p>Russia is not some scary monster and this is no longer 1980 cold war. We are better off having good relations with them and uniting to fight against Isis and having good trade policies</p>

Romania has been around for about 2500 years to say the least, we have had wars with almost every empire that came before U.S.A , The Ottoman empire, The Roman Empire, The Austro-Hungarian. And we were never conquered. Yeah we got some words from every nation that took a &quot;stroll&quot; around here. But we are Dacians. Google it &quot;bro&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. What I find funny is that Pizzagate deniers are 2 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Firstly, it is very odd how adamant and aggressive they attack Pizzagate posts. They usually Try to use snarky humor to shoot it down and ridicule the idea. This is a conspiracy forum, is this organic skepticism or a CTR campaign? Something to think about...</li>
</ol>

<p>And 2. They are echoing all the mainstream media talking points on PG and using it as their defense. Once again, on a conspiracy forum, and these guys just regurgitate whatever garbage spin and cover up the MSM is puking out. That should, along with the point I listed above, strike you as <strong>very</strong> odd...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media is sometimes full of shit.  And sometimes not.  I think the issue is when people go either way on it.  It&#39;s not all bullshit and it&#39;s not all truth.  You have to consider the source of information, look at other events too, what are people doing vs what are they saying.  I think it&#39;s dangerous to think that every journalist is lying.  What is more likely is that every journalist is under pressure to write positions supporting their owners.  Follow the $$$.  Sometimes lies are exposed by liars.  If we have no source for any verifiable info, it leaves you vulnerable to manipulation.  Imagine for instance no one covered a heath concern about a product that is being used by everyone.  Instead you just see commercials all the time.  Not really a recipe for success.</p>
