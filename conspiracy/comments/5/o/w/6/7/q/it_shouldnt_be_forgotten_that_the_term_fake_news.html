       Agreed, fake news was essentially created because of Pizzagate, it's obvious. The media launched an onslaught of smear campaigns against the investigation. Wikipedia, snopes, ney York times, Colombian, you name it. It's obvious they are covering something up, so obvious.

       It's a total hit piece, and it's locked so nobody can edit it. It presents the investigation as this insane witch hunt, says it's been debunked? How is it debunked, we keep asking about that and nobody has been able to respond. Seriously, use your objective thinking and at least give us some credit. You are intelligent enough where you should be able to say, "hmmm, there are millions of people, mainstream journalists, and several discussion forums talking about this and taking it very seriously. Perhaps they are onto something?"

       Seriously, think outside of the box for once in your life. Many people live in an illusion, believe what they want to. Don't be one of those people, you seem smarter than that.

       No it's completely factual and sourced and explains point by point how silly this is. Yes there are a few million right wing extremists who take this seriously but you are marginalized now just as they have been with the other crazy conspiracies like birtherism. Anyway the burden of proof is on the accuser and they are offering nothing but cheese pizza!

       You are obviously scared of the Wikipedia page is well sourced and those sources thoroughly debunk this conspiracy. Accept or not I don't care but your biggest problem is that you have failed utterly to provide a credible source that substantiates this theory. All the rest of your brigade can come up with is voat.com! So deliver the knockout punch and post a credible source that substantiates this theory. Thanks!

       The Wikipedia article is sourced, if you trace those sources you will see how foolish this is. But as the accuser making a fantastic claim the burden of proof is on you. Please post the most credible source that substantiates this fantastic conspiracy. Thanks in advance!

       Actually that links to YouTube not CBS. That was a local CBS affiliate on one of those segments where they make no bones about the fact that the views expressed do not reflect those of the network. In fact when CBS got wind of it they took it down, which is why you have to link it on YouTube. So it is absolutely not accurate to say CBS is endorsed this. Want to take another crack at it?

       No I asked for your most credible source and you claimed it was CBS, which it was not CBS pulled this segment and called the conspiracy fake. I checked out many sources on voat it's so bad they sometimes cite other voat articles, one guy cited Alex jones! They are still voting on the validity of stories. The next few months will be boring I will continue to ask for credible sources and will get links to YouTube and social networking sites. A few of you will hang on to this like an old 9-11 conspiracy theorist.

       I think the issue of "fake news" got more attention after Pizzagate because a lot of people were shocked at how popular an insane baseless conspiracy had gotten. I mean, somebody literally shot up a pizza parlor because of dumb shit they read on the internet. I think it's reasonable to be worried about that.

       However, the application of the term was heavily applied to Pizzagate. It was almost the media spectacle they used to familiarize people with the term. If you type in fake news, PG comes right up. The first real big story deemed fake news that came out. They pushed it hard. And another unprecedented thing was the "debunked" label they slapped on their, despite no proof of an investigation to debunk anything. They want hard against PG, they were actually scared and had to red alert shut it down.

       The fact remains that the term "fake news" didn't
       <em>
        "only pop up around the time PG was gaining momentum"
       </em>
       as per OP's claim; and wasn't
       <em>
        "essentially created because of Pizzagate"
       </em>
       as you claim.

       That's what this thread is about. Did the MSM conspire to coin the term specifically to attack pizzagate? No. The evidence is irrefutable, the term had already seen widespread use.

       My guess is they're buying time to make sure they completely wipe any incriminating evidence there may be.

       By they time an investigation actually gets launched, if it does, they will have cleaned out any kind of evidence already.

       That could be said...or it could be said that it popped up as Hillary lost the campaign...
      </p>

       Correlation is not equal to causation.   Personally, I believe that it had to do with Hillary losing, seeing as they specifically stated the "fake news affect on the election".

       Here's a logical presentation: It has been estimated that human trafficking is a multi-trillion dollar global industry. Do you think that poor people are involved in trafficking people based on that dollar figure, or do you think that, because there is a huge amount of profit in the human trafficking industry, that the same oligarchs that control every other lucrative industry in the world are behind it?

       there was a ton a fake news being pushed (specifically to the "alt right") during the election.  I consistently had to tell my pro-trump friends that the stories they were citing were definitely not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been going on for a while.  In the MSM, they will run misleading headlines or base a story on an unvetted tweet.  So "alternative media" sites have taken advantage and are turning around invented or old stories to push narratives people are interested in.  During the election, there was a lot of media/ news consumption in general.  So partisan or anti-globalist or anti-altright sites could stick to a narrative and pump out fake news for page views.  Pro-trump Media mavens like Milo yiannopoulosm and Roger Stone became very versed at pushing fake news to their followers, and were frequently picked up by sites like Gatewaypundit, yournewswire and politicalinsider.  You also have older rags like dailymail and nypost that don't seem to care too much about the veracity of claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about it is that the MSM and political elite are not happy that they are losing their strangle hold on information.  They want to conflate this fake news with news that is critical of them, and "conspiracy theory".  So "fake news" has been rebranded to be associated with "conspiracy theory", "racist nationalism" and "russian propaganda".  Ultimately these associations will be used to justify forms of censorship, even if just as filters (remember when default reddit subs started filtering stories about the Israelies murdering palestinians? This is the sort of thing you will see, even from Google and facebook- who are now beginning to label entire sites as "fake news".)
      </p>
      <p>
       So pizzagate fit conveniently into the fake news box, because it was a conspiracy theory.  The term wasn't invented to apply to pizzagate, but pizzagate as a crazy theory helped to drive home the danger and insanity of people who read fake news as if it was real.  This is more reason to "shut it down".

       all leading up to the end of year NDAA and Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016 (S. 2692) which seeks to "disrupt Russian Propaganda" as sites begin being slandered as such with both the fake news and russian propaganda moniker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, you can see Pizzagate being promoted at the end of the election, and after- in conjunction with stories using the label "fake news" and US propaganda stories about Russian Hacks and russian propaganda.  The term does not come from Pizzagate, and pizzagate hasn't even been covered by the media to a large extent.  But it DOES help them frame the term.  If anything, I would question whether the promotion of the "conspiracy theory" is itself a psy-op and distraction.

       This response implies that you believe everything Donald Trump told you is true and everything you heard about him being your savior is true. The truth actually is somewhere in the middle. Clinton campaign wants to say that everything you heard about him and everything he said which was a lie is fake news. Try to see it from their perspective.

       Wrong, this fake news propoganda campaign came about because of pizzgate and The DNC leaked emails. The DNC/Podesta emails are what started providing context and the connections for pizzagate, then the fake news thing started to become a thing.

       Not true. "Fake News" was being used as a term for months before Pizzagate was even coined. It was primarily in reference to foreign website quite literally making fake news clickbait stories for profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I think there's a valid argument that the "fake news" term has since coopted by both sides of the political spectrum in an attempt to delegitimize stories that they don't like.

       Yes very true. At the very exact time the connections were being made (and they were very strong pizzagate connections from the dnc leaked emails) MSM started coining the term fake news. Let me find the timeline of pizzagate events and you can see someone hit a nerve of someone very high up with pizzagate and MSM started this all out blitz of fake news bull.

       That is typical political crap that happens everywhere. Am glad that came to light also, but that pales in comparison to a gigantic pedophilia ring right in the heart of DC! By magnitudes of a thousand! This, is why fake news was started, it was to combat this pizzagate connection.

       Right - "fake news" originally meant faked articles meant to sway public opinion about a candidate. Things like "Hillary drinks blood to Regain Youth" or "Obama has a Gay Lover". Shit like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they started calling pizzagate fake news. You can believe in pizzagate or not, but it's not "fake news". It's a conspiracy theory that got its start on message boards like 4chan and Reddit. It wasn't a faked news article. That was when the term started to unravel.

       As an actual journalist, I agree. The term is derogatory and aimed in the wrong direction. I work in a world of facts. Facts require investigation. The problem with fake news is this: It either follows an extremist bias or is word-for-word written from a press release written by an entity's PR firm. They are reporting secondhand documents from an entity's entity as facts.

       This demonstrates how the media controlled discourse.  In what universe are pro Republican or pro Democrat extremist views.  Not to start with the question of when was a real socialist, Marxist or anarchist given a straight factual treatment. How about the far right?  After decades of control of who and what gets heard, the media lost it. All of this fake news stuff is just an attempt to salvage some of that control that they possessed.

       Yes, because it's becoming a buzz word rather than a descriptive term.  It's the new buzz word for everything that disagrees with your narrative or dissents against you.
      </p>
      <p>
       When used everywhere, everything becomes Fake, which only makes it harder for the general public to know what's real and what's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've been talking about Fake news for quite some time, it was just never given a buzz word that caught on.  There's also been quite the proliferation of fake news articles being found out to be completely fabricated.  There's no precedent for this because it's never been so public on such a large scale.  Scary shit, really.  And people that pretend they don't understand the difference, but continue pushing false narratives, are just as bad.

       But most of the time the media does cite it's sources. Sometimes it uses anonymous sources for access to better info, but on a regular basis we see those facts ends up being confirmed by public sources. I'm all for criticizing media bias and the media ignoring big stories that deserve attention, but I don't see much evidence that the media routinely blatantly lies.

       There are times where the media will verify their information, but this is unreliable at best with the corporate news networks. They will verify info that pertains only to their particular talking points and skim over any counterpoints or even try to present a different point of view. Not to mention the heavily biased and emotive wording, which is nothing short of laughable for any outlet claiming to champion the virtues of "journalistic integrity."

       Donald Trump uses it against media outlets that criticizes him, typically irrespective of whether or not they are reporting the truth. In fact, every instance I've seen of him using the term has been about reporting that is entirely factually correct.

       So giving air time to an unverified story may not technically be a lie but it can certainly be damaging to someone's reputation even when retracted. Wouldn't you agree?  Perhaps almost as equally damaging as a straight out lie?

       But the mainstream media did sit on this story for a long for exactly this reason. CNN reported on it because they found out that Barrack Obama was briefed on the dossier. That is what made the story count as being in the public interest. I'm not commenting on whether or not the document is real because I have no idea, but if the CIA is discussing it in intelligence briefs then I'd say it's at least in the public interest to know that it's out there.

       Because it failed mostly. The term didn't get to be established like conspiracy theory.

       Conspiracy theory was immediately negative and never positive.

      <p>
       Fake news was at first for MSM to own the term but with social media and more aware people nowadays (IMO) the term was pushed from alternative viewpoints calling Me fake news and basically turning fake news into news you don't agree with.

       "Fake News" was in response to foreign websites literally just making shit up for clickbait. There's plenty of evidence and article about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, The term 'fake news' has since expanded and been used to disregard a lot of legitimate news (on both sides of the political spectrum).

       I absolutely agree that people should be skeptical, but when the term is just being thrown around just to simply deflect from answering a tough question or manning up to an accusation, it becomes irresponsible and overused.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is such a thing as "fake News", although journalists don't like calling it that, because if it is Fake, it can't be News.  But "real"  Fake news would be like the DenverGuardian.com story about a Hillary bodyguard being killed or something like that.  A little real investigation work found this to be a completely fabricated website and article, and has since removed the one and only article posted.  NPR found the guy who created the website, and he admitted to it being fabricated simply for monetary gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, people NEED to be skeptical, but with a responsible tone.

       No it is not, why do you keep spewing this line everywhere you go? It is like you are steering the conversation away from the real matter, there is possibly one of the most corrupt and scandalous child pedophilia rings going right in the heart of DC and you think the MSM is concerned about people making money off of clickbait. GTFOH. If anyone ready this has a single cell in their brain left to comprehend what this guy is trying to convince you to believe, believe this, there are people in this world getting paid to post to support one side of a story, i can guarantee you, people are not getting paid to research and uncover a child pedophilia ring the likes of which have probably already got some people killed.

       Because it's true. Simple google search timelines prove it. People were talking about legitimately 'fake news' sites long before Pizzagate was even coined.

       I do agree with you that the term has since been used to delegitimize any information that people don't like. So I don't know why you're throwing a fit, when we agree in principle on how the term is currently being used.

       ah jeez... Yes, I am aware of the Macedonian story that got picked up and circulated to some extent.  Was 100% a small or non-issue for major outlets.  The majors suddently had "Fake News" going full tilt non-stop with Pizzagate.

       The Macedonian thing was the start, and then it was co-opted to describe breitbart and anything right leaning. You can even see the inflammatory headlines on how ONLY TRUMP SUPPORTERS were duped by it. It wasn't a small issue, it was literally the start of pushing the phrase "fake news"

       Find a broadcast story by CNN, MSNBC, or FOX on the Macedonian thing pre-pizzagate.  As a reminder, those networks operate 24/7 circulating garbage to fill air time.  After Pizzagate, was non-stop lead story for days with panels and interviews Wolf Blitzer saying it over and over like beating a drum.  That's the point.

       So: No. Fake news gained tractions after reports that macedonia was the georeferenced root for a lot of the facebook "news" which claimed that HRC was the devils spawn.

       I think that big news was there a change to explain why Hillary didn't win without admitting that she was a shitty candidate. By calling everything that led to his election fake news they tried to delegitimize his election.

       Agreed.

      <p>
       The obfuscation campaign called Fake News had all of the earmarks of a concerted effort to derail the online conversations surrounding pizzagate, just as the online pizzagate chatter was picking up steam.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember thinking at the time that the reaction to pizzagate was so quick and so vehement that it's certain pizzagate struck a nerve and scared some powerful people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, there is some truth to pizzagate. How much truth? That remains to be seen.

       I see pizza gate with a spike on Dec 5th. The highest it was ever searched. 4 days later fake news hit the highest peak in a months.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first spike in fake news is Nov 18th. Pizza gate had its first notable uptick on the 16th.

       Everyone which wonders why&amp;how Trump won the presidential race. It is a question which should be asked pretty loud in a subreddit which constantly bashes the "MSM" for lying ;)
      </p>
      <p>
       Just ask yourself: What were the primary sources of information for those which voted for Trump? If the answer is social networks you've should ask yourself it we really should ignore indications of fabricated stories on a huge scale...

       The MSM told us about Macedonia. So if they are constantly lying, wouldn't that discredit your theory that they totally threw the election in his favor?

       the MSM for lying.  And i never said totally threw the election in his favor. There has been a step rise of disenfranchised masses all around the globe but what really disturbs me is how the language got harsher and harsher over the last decade and social media news play a big role in this process.

       Furthermore the narrative that the MSM is lying begs the question why blogs/social media news should be more trustworthy and the macedonia story is a prime example of that.

       It is interesting how no one here is interested in seeing Trump's tax returns or concerned with what he may be trying to keep secret.  I guess investigating pizza shop logos and making huge leaps of logic over stripped of context emails is more important to the future of the country.

       I did read through some of the

        DNC report
       </a>
       on Trump, which surprisingly had little mention of Russian ties, granted it was produced in Dec 15. But still if he had been being cultivated for 5 years, wouldnt that show up in their personal report on him and all his policies and talking points? Only thing I saw, was that he worked with a russian emigre Felix Sater, who has ties to the italian mafia. (plead guilty to racketeering for bonnano and genovese families.)

       ~ 80-90% "MSM" (Austrian Newspapers, Süddeutsche, Guardian, NYT). The rest from either blogs (like e.g. bellingcat) or personal information. Because I'm a lefty at heart I prefer conservative outlets and I saw with the migrant crisis a massive spike in shared "news" stories on my FB feed which were simply bs.

       The assumption in there is that they have the

       . There might be somewhat of an consensus about what they believe is right but in the end every journalist still has the ability of shaping his artices.

       More people becoming aware of a term that had been used extensively throughout the MSM over the past year is nowhere near the same as

       The spikes appear at the exact same time? I don't know what MSM you were watching but I only heard the term fake news until pizzagate spawned and I'm sure the same goes for most people here. It's a simple correlation, in data, in black and white.

       The spikes represent what people were searching for on google. Correlation ≠ causation. They don't represent when the terms was first used.

       Besides, just because you don't pay attention to the news doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

       The graph you linked is a screenshot of a comparison between the first two links I posted above. As google trend employs a weighting algorithm and/or just uses abolute numbers (as can be seen by comparing e.g. fake news facebook and pizzagate) the only conclusion we can draw is that the amount of searches containing the term "fake news" rose in the the timespan as the term "pizzagate" gained traction. Fake news was used before just not that often.
      </p>
      <p>
       But google trends also provides context to their google trends in this case:
      </p>
      <p>
       pizzagate was most often searched with the phrase: "What is pizzagate" while fake news was searched in combination with Trump (e.g. "Trump fake news"). Given the fact that google trends relies on searches containing a certain term/word (and not the pages crawled) we can further conclude that your title (in combination with your linked graph) is intentionally misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we go a step further (this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       after all) we could assume that pizzagate was places to misdirect from the fact that intentionally placed fake news in social media played a big role in the last election.

       That's simply not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The recent rise of the use of the term started with articles critical of Facebook after they fired their human "trending" editors and replaced them with an algorithm.

       The title of this thread claims that the term
       <em>
        "only popped up around the time pizzagate was gaining momentum"
       </em>
       - which is demonstrably false.

       So a prominent politician used a pre-existing term, popularising it in the process... it still meant the same thing before she said it.

       I never made a comment about that. I would consider, how it suddenly became the big deal in the MSM, and the propaganda bills and other stuff that followed, all came with it. Possibly to cover up pizza gate, I guess? Not my theory, I was only debating your other point. :P

       I was calling all the garbage propaganda for/against both sides that kept popping up on facebook "fake news" since the election began. I know I wasn't the only one either. Not saying that it hasn't only recently turned into a major "buzzword" for discrediting/smearing information, it's just been around alot longer than pizzagate.

       No to bury or uncover any one news source, the term "fake news" is BS. Since when did "check the source" not become relevant anymore? When reading any piece of news, we had been educated in the past to check the source. And as far as MSM is concerned; when you start hearing an opinion and not facts, you're not hearing news anymore you're hearing entertainment or opinion.

       I think it's fair to say the countless attacks on Donald trump, such as the pissing thing, is far bigger fake news... and that's not a conspiracy theory, it was an outright fake news story.

      <p>
       Propaganda is fake news.

       Calling pg the biggest conspiracy is off topic, not weird, but off topic.

       If you can watch the short special that was just on the news and say it's not even slightly strange, then you are so dead set against ANYTHING that pro trump folks support, it's dangerous.

       I thought it popped up as soon as Hillary lost the election and they all started scrambling for a reason why she lost. They landed on "Fake News" being the reason she lost. It was also a convenient phrase to toss at anyone talking about fake news.

       yes there is definitely a correlation with using the term fake news to discredit pizzagate, but from your own piece of evidence, it shows that fake news was a term being searched already prior to November 9 which seems to be the first date that google trends shows pizzagate.
      </p>

       I think it was being used against pizzagate, but it wasnt the reason it was "invented"

       I get that, but my point is that it was losing the election that started the increase of use of the term fake news, prior to pizzagate even being a thing. There was not a lot of time between the two, but I personally do not believe the term Fake News was coined specifically in response to Pizzagate. It was a shit attempt by Hillarys campaign to place the blame on anyone but herself.

       There is a lot of fake news that popped up just before the term was introduced. Articles that look like a real news website but have a slightly different url. They typically provide evidence of something the right or left already suspect, so they get shared quickly before being detected as fake. Also memes with fake quotes from famous people that seem to have predicted current events are popular. A simple Google search shows the famous person never said it. Even bizarre fake news of celebrity deaths have been common place. I contend this was an orchestrated campaign to pave the way for the fake news narrative to be introduced. The whole thing however has backfired in the media's face as the term was quickly re-appropriated by the alternative media to great effect to the point that now the media is running away from it as fast as they can

       Oh fer fuck sake.  Pizzagate is the fake news.  It's pro wrestling level fake shit.  A distraction. An absurdist divide and concur strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know who came up with this shit, but I wouldn't be surprised if Clinton's people came up with it.  We already knew about the drugs, weapons, backdoor deals and political fuckery; all plausible if not verifiable.  Then they pull a Blazing Saddles and accuse themselves of something absurdly evil and patently ridiculous and invite y'all along on the wild goose chase.  You are playing yourselves.

       Jon Stewart has been using the term "fake news" for over a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was so good at pointing out how fake the supposedly "real news" was on his show he only won like every television award ever multiple times.

       Fake news has always been a term, it just wasn't called 'fake news' until recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g any time you're in an argument, and you claim something, and the person you're arguing with asks for a source to your claim, and you give them a link, it goes like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "lol fox news. do you really believe that nazi propaganda?"
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes for CNN. Whether or not any of these news outlets are legit doesn't matter, the only thing that does matter is the simple fact that if you can make people not believe any information at all, you can keep them in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we're in a pitch black room.

       Actually before pizzagate fake news specifically meant made up news stories in facebook feeds.  It was never about WikiLeaks emails.

       From Wikipedia:

      <p>
       Pre-Internet history
      </p>
      <p>
       Unethical journalistic practices existed in printed media for hundreds of years before the invention of the Internet.[33][34][35] Yellow journalism, reporting from a standard which is devoid of morals and professional ethics, was pervasive during the time period in history known as the Gilded Age, and unethical journalists would engage in fraud by fabricating stories, interviews, and made-up names for scholars out of whole cloth.[34][33] During the 1890s the spread of this unethical news sparked violence and conflicts.[33] Both Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst fomented yellow journalism in order to increase profits, which helped lead to misunderstandings which became partially responsible for the outset of the Spanish-American War in 1898.[36] According to USA Today, newspapers which have a history of commonly publishing fake news have included Globe, Weekly World News, and The National Enquirer.[36]

       I legitimately want to punch the first person who used the term "fake news" in the throat. Trump has latched on to it, and is using it in a really uncomfortable way. Sure, most news sources are pretty bias, and yeah, they avoid a lot of important things, but to completely shun entire networks due to them reporting unsavory things about him? Dangerous.

       Wrong, this fake news propoganda campaign came about because of pizzgate and The DNC leaked emails. The DNC/Podesta emails are what started providing context and the connections for pizzagate, then the fake news thing started to become a thing.

       Yes very true. At the very exact time the connections were being made (and they were very strong pizzagate connections from the dnc leaked emails) MSM started coining the term fake news. Let me find the timeline of pizzagate events and you can see someone hit a nerve of someone very high up with pizzagate and MSM started this all out blitz of fake news bull.

       No it is not, why do you keep spewing this line everywhere you go? It is like you are steering the conversation away from the real matter, there is possibly one of the most corrupt and scandalous child pedophilia rings going right in the heart of DC and you think the MSM is concerned about people making money off of clickbait. GTFOH. If anyone ready this has a single cell in their brain left to comprehend what this guy is trying to convince you to believe, believe this, there are people in this world getting paid to post to support one side of a story, i can guarantee you, people are not getting paid to research and uncover a child pedophilia ring the likes of which have probably already got some people killed.

       However, the application of the term was heavily applied to Pizzagate. It was almost the media spectacle they used to familiarize people with the term. If you type in fake news, PG comes right up. The first real big story deemed fake news that came out. They pushed it hard. And another unprecedented thing was the "debunked" label they slapped on their, despite no proof of an investigation to debunk anything. They want hard against PG, they were actually scared and had to red alert shut it down.

       yes there is definitely a correlation with using the term fake news to discredit pizzagate, but from your own piece of evidence, it shows that fake news was a term being searched already prior to November 9 which seems to be the first date that google trends shows pizzagate.

       I think it was being used against pizzagate, but it wasnt the reason it was "invented"

       I get that, but my point is that it was losing the election that started the increase of use of the term fake news, prior to pizzagate even being a thing. There was not a lot of time between the two, but I personally do not believe the term Fake News was coined specifically in response to Pizzagate. It was a shit attempt by Hillarys campaign to place the blame on anyone but herself.

       I did say that in response to why the term 'fake news' popped up around the same time pizzagate was taking off. A massive fake news campaign pops up, and someone calls it fake news. What's so weird about that?

       It is interesting how no one here is interested in seeing Trump's tax returns or concerned with what he may be trying to keep secret.  I guess investigating pizza shop logos and making huge leaps of logic over stripped of context emails is more important to the future of the country.

        Furthermore the narrative that the MSM is lying begs the question why blogs/social media news should be more trustworthy and the macedonia story is a prime example of that.

       You have spent all day harping about this fake news shit. Where do you get your news, if you dont mind me asking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think anybody is saying that they are more trustworthy. Literally nobody was like well cindy kim's blog said hes a good guy and hilliary is going to jail. I guess I better vote for him. GTFO
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit that I do watch MSM, and yes alternative sources as well. I do not in my recollection remember seeing fake news in my Facebook feed, or even visiting a supposed site. Unless we are talking about buzzfeed.  That being said, I take them all with a grain of salt.

       just because there are numerous outlets doesn't mean that they separate entities, with differing agendas. They all have the same story to push, when 6 companies control 90% of your programming.

       It didn't enter the mainstream until the Washington Post wrote about the guy with the gun at Comet. Before that, it was only DNC and politifact using it.
