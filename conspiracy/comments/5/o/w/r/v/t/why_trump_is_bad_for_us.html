Trump is buddies with Michael <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/06/17/nyregion/18bb_pop.jpg">Bloomberg</a> and other establishment figures.

His cabinet is filled with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ntxkf/donald_trump_has_added_his_fifth_goldman_sachs/">Goldman Sachs executives</a>, and at least one of them (Trump&#39;s secretary of the treasury) is even a member of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-14/trump-advisers-said-to-recommend-mnuchin-for-treasury-secretary">Skull &amp; Bones</a>. Trump is flip flopping; he can&#39;t be <a href="https://youtu.be/xDreLyC_FTQ?t=17s">trusted.</a> He&#39;s a <a href="http://hbu.h-cdn.co/assets/16/19/980x639/gallery-1462816039-donald-trump-1.jpg">NOT a working class hero</a> on the side of the Average Joe.

<p>Oh, and remember that criticizing him or his fans, is (supposedly) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nhunk/a_message_to_the_real_conspiracy_theorists/dcc3y1i/"><em>concern trolling</em>.</a> </p>

<p>The MSM used reverse psychology to get the working class to vote for this billionaire zionist, and they continue to use it now. The MSM narrative claims the CIA (and the rest of the evil intelligence community) is out to &quot;get&quot; Trump because he&#39;s so &quot;anti establishment&quot;. They even claim there&#39;s a chance he&#39;ll be assassinated. He won&#39;t, because he&#39;s Israel&#39;s and Goldman Sachs&#39; candidate. A lot of conspiracy theorists were tricked into thinking Trump is &quot;anti establishment&quot;, thanks to clever use of reverse psychology by the MSM -- plus Trump endorsements from Alex Jones and other controlled opposition figures in the &quot;alternative&quot; media scene. </p>

<p>The inauguration will go as planned, and Trump won&#39;t be assassinated. </p>

<p>No there&#39;s not. He&#39;s literally had an unprecedented amount of information and &#39;scandals&#39; released and discussed...and he hasn&#39;t even taken office yet.</p>

<p>One thread, and interestingly, almost all the top comments are dismissing it for &quot;not enough proof&quot;, meanwhile this sub continues to circlejerk about a single topic with little to no proof as well (Pizzagate).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what&#39;s a thousand times bigger than lurid allegations of paedophilia backed up by circumstantial evidence that appeals to specific demographics? A Saudi spy sending State Dept. emails to a personal Yahoo email address directly from Hillary&#39;s private server.</p>

<p>The conspiracy community is, broadly speaking, a group of investigators and &quot;free-thinkers&quot; that have spent decades uncovering and detailing government and corprate secrets. For decades, conspiracy theorists have been poring over government documents and reading obscure books, researching and studying, trying to gain as much knowledge on a given topic as they can so that they can properly understand what happened and reveal their truth to all who will listen. In return for their efforts they have been painted as Kazynski-looking krazies to distract from the facts. Over the years, a fairly linear narrative has emerged of US government activities involving oil, &quot;regime change&quot;, and the arms trade that has little, if anything, to do with partisan politics. The Bush dynasty&#39;s connections to the CIA, Saudi Arabia and terrorism are relatively well-known but it isn&#39;t just one family, or even one party, it&#39;s the government itself. </p>

<p>Given all the things that conspiracy theorists have uncovered over the years, including but not limited to government connectiins to 9/11, and knowing the tactics used to denigrate them, what can we make of the extraordinarily sudden change of direction the investigations into the emails took right at the same time people started asking questions about Huma Abedin&#39;s &quot;Insurance&quot; folder?  An anonymous user on 4chan, claiming to be a member of the FBI, told everyone that there was information in those documents that would bring everyone and everything down but he didn&#39;t say what that information was. Instead of further looking into a Saudi woman with alleged family ties to terrorism sending State Dept emails from Hillary&#39;s private server to her own private address (as in it was literally something like H_Abedin at yahoo), possibly during a period when Yahoo got hacked, the conspirosphere suddenly got obssessed with pizza. </p>

<p>Conspiracy Theory is a complex game of moves and counter-moves with few rules and the highest of stakes. What is something that could &quot;bring everything down&quot;? What is more likely to be a distraction narrative? A smoking gun for the biggest political scandal in American history, if not the world, involving millions of deaths, trillions of oil &amp; arms dollars, terrorism, regime change, and both sides of politics over a period of decades? Or is it a suspiciously partisan secret paedophile network that rapes and sacrifices babies for ritual cannibalism in the name of Satan? According to the forum sliders, if it&#39;s not pizza it&#39;s a distraction because <em>They</em> don&#39;t want you investigating what&#39;s truly important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>PG represents cognitive dissonance, imo. I got banned yesterday for making a joke about ordering pizza. That&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>The fact is that Trump is the most flawed candidate in modern history, and he comes with a ton of corruption and baggage. People do not want to believe that, so they cling to something else, in this case PG. It allows them to ignore reality for the moment. It won&#39;t last.</p>

<p>The irony of course, is that human sex trafficking is a major problem, which probably does reach deep into politics. But, sadly, the victims are not what PG is about.</p>

<p>u/lordrothschild <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4cs4f3/the_months_ahead_a_summary/">wrote</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump is being used as a wedge to increase the gap and hostilities between the politically correct multiculturalists -- and the angry working class commoners. The point of his candidacy is to instigate an &quot;American Spring&quot;, a civil war in America. <strong>The Illuminati might fake a Trump assassination</strong>, or <strong>they might assassinate him for real</strong> (or someone else might kill him anyway (a lot of people truly hate him)). <strong>Either way</strong>, there will be a massive civil war in America this <strong>September/October</strong>, coinciding with WW3 in the Middle East, a truly immense migrant invasion of Europe -- and the biggest financial crisis in the history of mankind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least you stopped saying Trump was supposed to rollover for Hillary. Still posting the exact same photos a year on.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s time for you to head over to r/nba and post pics of him with Shaq and say Trump&#39;s not really a Knicks supporter.</p>
