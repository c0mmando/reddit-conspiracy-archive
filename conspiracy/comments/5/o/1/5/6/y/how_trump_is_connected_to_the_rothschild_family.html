       Recently I posted about how Pissgate has been debunked, as there was no evidence from the getgo and no evidence has been brought forward.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nh29h/pissgate_officially_declared_fake_news_by/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage">
        My post shows how MSNBC, NBC, Politico, and others all are wary of the story or flat out calling it fake news.
       </a>
       There has been a lot of partisanship in this sub recently, which is the exact opposite of what should be happening. It's apparent to anyone who has been here for more than a month that there has been a massive uptick in paid-accounts,
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       crossover, and shills in general that are trying to turn us against each other. This is bad because it separates us and tries to get us to focus on fake scandals about Trump when there are dozens of legitimate ones. Pissgate IS fake until the burden of proof is met and this continued McCarthyism is getting old. While the media focuses on  fake scandals, we need to understand the proven evidence that connects Trump to TPTB.

         "In 1987 Donald Trump purchased his first casino interests when he acquired 93% of the shares in Resorts International. Resorts International has a sordid history which began in the early 1950’s when it evolved from a CIA and Mossad front company which had been established for the purpose of money laundering the profits from drug trafficking, gambling, and other illegal activities. On October 30, 1978, The Spotlight newspaper reported that the principle investors of Resorts International were Meyer Lansky, Tibor Rosenbaum, William Mellon Hitchcock, David Rockefeller, and one Baron Edmond de Rothschild."

        <p>
         “In 1987, upon the death of longtime CIA front man James Crosby, the nominal head of Resorts International, up-and-coming young New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump stepped into the picture and bought Crosby’s interest in the gambling empire.”

         <a href="https://americanfreepress.net/who-towers-behind-trump/">
          “Trump soon became a household name, with his colorful personality and his insistence upon naming a variety of luxury hotels, apartment houses and other commercial ventures after himself. But while the name “Trump” appeared in the headlines, the names of the real movers behind Resorts International remained hidden from public view.”

         "After quickly expanding the reach of Resorts International to Atlantic City in the final years of the 1980’s, Donald Trump found himself in financial trouble as the real estate market in New York tanked. The three casinos in Atlantic City, like other Trump assets, were under threat from lenders. It was only with the assistance and assurance of Wilbur L. Ross Jr., senior managing director of Rothschild Inc. that Trump was allowed to keep the casinos and rebuild his threatened empire."

       Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton play on the same team. Donald Trump was in
       <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/">
        Jeff Epstein's book

       .
       <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/17/the-wedding-that-explains-the-election.html">
        Donald Trump has been friends with Hillary, even being in the front row of her daughter's wedding. Hillary has also been at Donald Trump's weddings.
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So how about calling everyone Trump bots or Hillary shills CTR (both of which are proven, it's not hard to create bots to push agendas, either state or private-sponsored), we realize that both of them are part of the top 1% and will do anything to undermine the people's freedoms. By arguing and not focusing on the real problem, we only keep dividing ourselves.

       Seems he flew and visited. Unless the direction is guilt by association it's not much to go on. I know at some point he revoked Jeffery's membership to his Fl club. I also understand a girl in Trump's employment was hired and later pimped out by Jeffery. She didn't have a bad word to say about Trump. More evidence of BC being pedo if one wants to assume guilt.

       I'm aware of both of those. However, the point I'm making is there's more evidence Trump partook on that island with just those logs than there is him having prostitutes piss in Michelle's bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe Trump did anything and neither do I think Bill Clinton did. The more concrete evidence, and the point of this post, of Trump not being on the peoples' side is Resorts International and how Wilbur Ross was involved in the whole ordeal.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In the late seventies, Ross began twenty-four years at the New York office of Rothschild Inc., where he ran the bankruptcy-restructuring advisory practice. In the eighties, after quickly expanding the reach of Resorts International to Atlantic City, Donald Trump found himself in financial trouble as the real estate market in New York City bottomed-out. His three casinos in Atlantic City were under threat from lenders. It was with the assistance and assurance of Ross, then senior managing director of Rothschild Inc., that Trump was allowed to keep the casinos and rebuild his businesses.[8] In the late nineties, Ross started a $200 million fund at Rothschild to invest in distressed assets. As the U.S. bubble began to burst, he decided he wanted to invest more and advise less. On April Fools’ Day 2000, the 62-year-old banker raised $450 million to plunge into fallen companies.

       What? It's a proven fact Epstein is a convicted pedophile because he raped a (with claims of multiple teens by plenty of victims) teen on his island. And it is a proven fact that BANKRUPTCY implies bailing out in Donald's case. Quit concern trolling.

       Once you Trump pedo conspiracy theorists get called out for evidence it's defensive mode time. "concern troll" lol The concern is the lame attempt at slander. It's really sad that the insinuations are your only bridge to connect Trump. black book said Trump participated in the pedo? That's why you didn't link it first right? You were saving it for the big reveal?

       All politicians are controlled by rothchild, rockefeller, morgan etc..
They can buy anyone if they want to, and why would they not if they have more money than what they can throw in the red sea.

      <p>
       NWO is like that one guy that wants to make a big play and make sure he controls what role everyone on it plays.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's the part that is funny. Majority of politicians don't actually know what they are doing. Invisible Strings make them move and act and they might think and believe they are saving the world while they do the opposite. This is of course masterful brainwashing that happens to almost every political figure. Obama,Hillary, Trump included. Even those that think they are part of the NWO are probably wrong, as they are just tools not knowing a thing about the real NWO.

       Some people believe that the government would never waste billions in a massive lie like space being real or that CIA agents  are wasting 24/7 of their time spying a single random person. But anyone with critical thinking skill would see that this makes a lot of sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poor people already stalk people on the internet 24/7 why would such a powerful organization as CIA not do it in real life.

       its not surprising. trump himself admitted to being an insider who got along fine with many of these other elitists, only until he became their political opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
       im one the fence to see how things turn out once he is in office, but seeing his connections and even his appointments doesnt really surprise me. lets see how he governs, and then well get a better idea of whose side hes on. my take anyway.

       Most people dont deny Trump was part of all this at one point.No one denies he was in bed with the Clintons at one point. Most billionaires dont get to be that without greasing palms and crossing these people and pledging allegiance somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Pro Trump supports believe though or really want to believe is that he has gone rogue from them. His ego has surpassed their hold on him. Hes 70+ years old he dont give a fuck anymore and his supporters now feel hes on their side or will die trying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop discrediting Donald Trump with his past because thats not what will change their minds. If you truly believe Trump is in bed with that side then you need evidence showing it through his presidency and we will see it.

      </p>
      <p>
       I thought Obama was true change until over the last 8 years this sub showed me otherwise. We will do the same to Trump but the past is the past , lets at least clean slate it and watch from day 1 of his presidency. If hes corrupt and full of shit we will see it just like we saw Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our job here is to crowd source the truth not hold people accountable for their past. Donald Trump has not committed a war crime in his past or something that severe all we know is that we have to watch him closely.

      <p>
       No one will EVER defeat the globalists as an outsider its just impossible but maybe Trump is the insider that can stop them. You cannot get to the highest office without scratching a few backs here and there.

      <p>
       Not all rich people are evil. Some legit want to help people that are poor and middle class. Give them the opportunity to strive. Trump learned early on the system by being near these groups of elite circles. He's been planning to help humanity for years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like Trump being president is like going all in on a hand of poker. This could be a winning moment for humanity or the biggest mistake America has ever made. Time will tell. We were fucked for sure with the DMC and Clintons. We have no choice but to give him a chance.

       you're totally right, If trump is a con man, He will never discredit the media. calling cnn fake news is not the move from a person who wants to help the elites. if anything he could do something to increase public trust of media. lets wait and see his final results before judging.

       One of the reason I was pro Trump was the simple fact that he exposed a lot of dirty politics and media biases to the sleeping sheeple. The word "conspiracy theorists" isn't synonymous with "tin foil wearing looney" anymore. He has vindicated and validated a lot of "conspiracy theorists". It's no longer a dirty word. The people are waking up faster than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
       That alone is something big to me. Enough to earn my support. We could've easily had the status quo with Clinton.

       I'm talking about how politicians take advantage of the government and their positions to enrich themselves and others. Before the Clinton Foundation, the masses didn't know to what extent or how the political elite conducted their illicit activities that make them and their cronies billions.

       Not all rich people are evil. Some legit want to help people that are poor and middle class. Give them the opportunity to strive. Trump learned early on the system by being near these groups of elite circles. He's been planning to help humanity for years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like Trump being president is like going all in on a hand of poker. This could be a winning moment for humanity or the biggest mistake America has ever made. Time will tell. We were fucked for sure with the DMC and Clintons. We have no choice but to give him a chance.

       I just want to point out that NBC is deep into Buzzfeed. They dumped $200 million into them in October of this year after several years of investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also like to point out that Chuck Todd is not functioning as NEWS on Meet the Press, where he made the statement. That show is political commentary, not news.

      <p>
       Whether or not the dossier is real, NBC isn't the source I would go with to support my position anyway, considering the ongoing relationship between Trump and NBC going back decades.
