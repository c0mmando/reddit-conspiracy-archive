       "The powers that be"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only "power" needed to discredit #pizzagate is basic critical thinking and a resilience to extrapolated nonsense. There are many real conspiracies that deserve analysis - the gullibility of people who believe this particular heap of sick, projected bullshit is embarrassing.

       What I think is that anyone can say anything on social media, and with enough repetition, morons will believe it. I also think that humans have a remarkable facility for storytelling, and for molding reality around personal fantasy. And I think the irony of conspiracy theorists who are actually just parroting an "alternative" form of propaganda is hilarious.

       This is why this sub is a laughing-stock. It used to be a place where people actually engaged in an exchange of interesting ideas, now it's just a right-leaning fake news circle jerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a "shill" because I read a lot, follow politics, and don't swallow every absurd hit-piece that comes from the delusional far-right? And replying to me will just "lower the intelligence" of
       <a href="/u/Delusional_Liberal">
        /u/Delusional_Liberal
       </a>
       - a user who just threw a temper tantrum and called me a "brainwashed faggot"? Yeah, we wouldn't want to lower
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       intelligence - there can't be much left to spare.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think some self-examination is in order here. Who do you want to be in this world? Are you here because you value the truth, or are you here to be a pawn in a right-wing fantasy? The real conspiracy is not pizzagate - it's the billionaires, industrialists, and Christian extremists who are gaining unchecked control of our government. This fake news shit is a distraction from an actual power grab, just like Trump's constant tweeting. They have been building this up for decades, and they are counting on the divisiveness and inaction of the public. Utterly mind-boggling how well it is working out. Nice job, America.

       because pizzagate is fucking dumb, built entirely on switching innocuous words to "fucking little boys" and thousands upon thousands of 4chan links, images with ms painted 'connections' from one thing to another, and other bullshit. you don't need "proof to debunk" something that doesn't even have one shred of evidence for it beyond switching "pasta" to "torture room"

        You are so thoroughly entrenched in a conspiracy-laden internet fantasy that you don't even notice your own capacity for critical thought shriveling up.

       <p>
        what you're demonstrating here is conspiracy-driven armchair criticism of a field you have actually no knowledge of, because "the media" is probably the most popular scarecrow of this moment

       No user of a board such as this would ever dare use the term conspiracy as a means of conducting an ad-hominem. We know that the term itself was originally weaponized to marginalize people who didn't buy the official JFK assassination story.

       You may be comfortably surrounded here by Trumpster sycophants, but in truth your comments make you look ridiculous. Trump is not as much a threat to the free press, mainstream
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       independent, as he thinks he is. He is however a threat to reason, sustainability, and actual liberties - regardless of your personal ability to realize it. Worse, Trump is himself merely a tool for a longstanding far-Right agenda that has been angling for power since the 80s. I am both fascinated and saddened to watch this real-life dystopia unraveling while you geniuses debate the hidden symbolism of pizza toppings.

       This sub has, unfortunately, become shit. Yes. There are still remnants of true thinkers, I see them here and there. But they are outnumbered (or out-botted). The Trump "revolution" is pathetic, it relies heavily on delusion and illusion, and too many in this sub have fallen into it.

       Think about this:
      </p>
      <p>
       You rule this planet. Your slaves are easy, compliant. You almost fell empathy for them - sometimes. The great unwashed are hard to love consistently, after all. But now - they're starting to think, stating to question, starting to organize and rebell in ways you hadn't necessarily anticipated - at least not in your lifetime. You sit on the precipice of something entirely new. Do you fight them? Or do you simply reduce their numbers back down to a more manageable population?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a conundrum.

       This, along with the increasing anti-Russia propaganda, and the fake news nonsense all seem entirely too coincidental... I believe that the timing is indeed intentional. These things work together too well to be unorchestrated in my opinion.
