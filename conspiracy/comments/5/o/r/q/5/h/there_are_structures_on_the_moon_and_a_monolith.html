(Please note, it seems it&#39;s on Mars moon Phobos, some people refer to Mars or Phobos I referred to Mars to make it simple)</p>

<p>Here is a photo of the monolith

::::::::::</p>

<p>Here are some photos that were grabbed off a nasa website that used to let you view certain coordinates of the moon. Several people found these blurred locations and were curious why they were blurred.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also been said that the lady that was tasked with blurring the locations leaked that she was responsible for it. I need to find some sources for this, if anyone can help. I originally heard this from David Wilcock on his show Wisdom Teachings on the Gaia streaming network.
::::::::::</p>

<p>Those images aside I thought I would throw these images too from artifacts and skeletons found on earth. Have aliens visited earth? </p>

<p>NASA files 4822. You used to be able to buy images of the moon from nasa of certain locations. One man had requested a certain area of the moon and it was black. Years later he requested the same file and this time they weren&#39;t blacked out (did the person quit working that was tasked with watching over this?) and he received the following same images of the same location.</p>

<p>What do you guys think it is?
::::::::::</p>

<p>This is a few of many photographs and artifacts hinting towards extraterrestrial existence. I wanted to keep this short and simple but if you guys are interested I heard about these off the show wisdom teachings by David Wilcock. Only downside is its behind a paywall streaming service called Gaia. It has good content, similar to like a Netflix of the conspiracy/spirituality world. I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>If anyone else wants to contribute links, photos, or anything, feel free to post and I&#39;ll go through it and add it to this main post.</p>

<p>Much thanks!  </p>

<p>The elongated skull though is just a result of head binding which is an ancient people practice found around the world. We humans have been doing odd body modifications for a very long time. We are a strange species. </p>

<p>There might be more but these are the three I remember most. These UFOs (or whatever they are) may or may not be of alien origin, but I have a feeling these are intentional cuts of the live feed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the images, and sure, they seem to evidence some kind of trail that&#39;s claimed to be the footsteps of the astronauts. They claim some other objects are one thing or another, but they&#39;re so ill-defined that I don&#39;t find that aspect to be useful. So, we have the trails. I suppose that would be enough for me if there weren&#39;t so many other holes in the story that really need to be answered reasonably before a second-hand blurry photograph of what appears to be a trail really adds any information. I really doubt that the chinese space agency is that far removed from NASA; it seems likely to me that they collaborate, so why not doctor it? Why won&#39;t NASA answer the myriad questions that seem to suggest the moon landing at that time was an impossibility with anything more than name calling?</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know what to think about the moon landing, but what I do notice is that everyone who claims it did happen seems to think it beneath them to offer any kind of real explanation for the questions being asked, and those who are doubting it have compiled a shit ton.</p>

<p>Fortunately I&#39;m one of the increasing minority of Americans who actually does know enough about radiation to know we couldn&#39;t have gone, and to take one look at <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/75/eb/0d/75eb0d1ec5f35267e0f858f450479087.jpg">this</a> and know it&#39;s a fake piece of junk sitting on a set, not a state of the art space craft on the most complex and impressive mission in human history.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s already obvious enough we didn&#39;t go to the moon, I don&#39;t really even need one of the Apollo 12 astronuts entirely giving it away that he&#39;s obviously been lying and he never went to the moon, but of course it is still amusing.</p>

<p>Oooh perfect, since you &quot;know enough about radiation and physics&quot; surely you will be able to debunk for me the widely understood and accepted radiation physics behind the Van Allen Radiation Belts?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/VABraddose.htm">http://www.braeunig.us/apollo/VABraddose.htm</a></p>

<p><strong>Please be thorough. This link shows all of the work and is very comprehensive. Please explain why and how it is incorrect point by point.</strong></p>

<p>A quick TL;DR for the spectators:</p>

<p>The outermost edge of the outermost VARB is about ~20,000km above the Earth. The Apollo spacecrafts speed through the VARB regions was ~25,000km/hr. Due to the structures of the belts, the regions with the highest concentrations of radiation can by avoided. Due to these factors, plus the radioactive shielding of the craft, the total dose of radiation sustained by all Apollo missions was &lt;~2 rads, with the majority being &lt;0.6 rads, during the ~hour long transit through the belts. OSHA defines a lethal dose of radiation to be 300 rads/hr. The amount of radiation sustained by the astronauts through the VARBs was so small as to be negligible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey! </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget about the famous Phobos 2 incident in 1989. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In July 1988, the Russians launched two unmanned satellite probes - Phobos 1 and Phobos 2 - in the direction of Mars, and with the primary intention of investigating the planet&#39;s mysterious moon, Phobos. Phobos 1 was unfortunately lost en route two months later, reportedly because of a radio command error.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Phobos 2 was also ultimately lost in the most intriguing circumstances, but not before it had beamed back certain images and information from the planet Mars itself. </p>

<p>Phobos 2 arrived safely at Mars in January 1989 and entered into an orbit around Mars as the first step at its destination towards its ultimate goal: to transfer to an orbit that the would make it fly almost in tandem with the Martian moonlet called Phobos (hence the spacecrafts name) and explore the moonlet with highly sophisticated equipment that included two packages of instruments to be placed on the moonlet&#39;s surface. </p>

<p>All went well until Phobos 2 aligned itself with Phobos, the Martian moonlet.</p>

<p>Then, on 28th March, the Soviet mission control center acknowledged sudden communication &quot;problems&quot; with the spacecraft; and Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported that,</p>

<p>&quot;Phobos 2 had failed to communicate with Earth as scheduled after completing an operation yesterday around the Martian moon Phobos. Scientists at mission control have been unable to establish stable radio contact.&quot;
What had caused the Phobos 2 spacecraft to be lost? </p>

<p>According to Boris Bolitsky, science correspondent for Radio Moscow, just before radio contact was lost with Phobos 2, several unusual images were radioed back to Earth, described by the Russian as &quot;Quite remarkable features&quot;.</p>

<p>A report taken from New Scientist of 8 April 1989, described the following:</p>

<p>&quot;The features are either on the Martian surface or in the lower atmosphere. The features are between 20 and 25 kilometers wide and do not resemble any known geological formation. They are spindle - shaped and proving to be intriguing and puzzling.&quot;
An unusual photo of a thin shadow across mars (below left) was shown on the Russian television segment.</p>

<p>Seen on the surface of Mars was a clearly defined dark shape that could indeed be described, as it was in he initial dispatch from Moscow, as a &quot;thin  ellipse&quot; (this photo is a still from the Soviet television clip).</p>

<p>It was certainly different from the shadow of Phobos recorded eighteen years earlier by Mariner 9. The latter cast a shadow that was a rounded ellipse and fuzzy at the edges, as would be cast by the uneven surface of the moonlet.</p>

<p>The &#39;anomaly&#39; seen in the Phobos 2 transmission was a thin ellipse with very sharp rather than rounded points (the shape is known in the diamond trade as a &quot;marquise&quot;) and the edges, rather than being fuzzy, stood out sharply against a kind of halo on the Martian surface.</p>

<p>Dr. Becklake described it as &quot;something that is between the spacecraft and Mars, because we can see the Martian surface below it,&quot; and stressed that the object was seen by both the optical and the infrared (heat seeking) camera. </p>

<p>All these reasons explain why the Soviets have not suggested that the dark, &quot;thin ellipse&quot; might have been a shadow of the moonlet.</p>

<p>While the image was held on the screen, Dr. Becklake explained that it was taken as the spacecraft was aligning itself with Phobos (the moonlet).
&quot;As the last picture was halfway through,&quot; he said, &quot;they [Soviets] saw something that should not be there.&quot;
The Soviets, he went on to state, have not yet released this last picture, and we wont speculate on what it shows. </p>

<p>So what was it that collided or crashed into Phobos 2? Was the space probe shot out of space for &quot;seeing too much&quot;? What does the last secret frame show? Well... Cosmic Conspiracies have managed to track down this elusive last picture (below right).</p>

<p>In his careful words to &#39;Aviation Week and Space Technology&#39;, the chairman of the Soviet equivalent of NASA, referred to the last frame, saying,
&quot;One image appears to include an odd-shaped object between the spacecraft and Mars.&quot;
This &quot;highly secret&quot; photo was later given to the Western press by Colonel Dr. Marina Popovich, a Russian astronaut and pilot who has long been interested in UFO&#39;s.</p>

<p>At a UFO conference in 1991, Popovich gave to certain investigators some interesting information that she &quot;smuggled&quot; out of the now ex-Soviet Union. Part of the information was what has been called &quot;the first ever leaked accounts of an alien mother ship in the solar system&quot;. </p>

<p>The very last picture taken by Phobos 2
The last transmission from Phobos 2 was a photograph of a gigantic cylindrical spaceship - a huge, approx, 20km long, 1.5km diameter cigar-shaped &#39;mother ship&#39;, that was photographed on 25 March 1989 hanging or parked next to the Martian moon Phobos by the Soviet unmanned probe Phobos 2.</p>

<p>After that last frame was radio-transmitted back to Earth, the probe mysteriously disappeared; according to the Russians it was destroyed - possibly knocked out with an energy pulse beam. </p>

<p>The cigar shaped craft in the penultimate frame taken by Phobos 2 is apparently the object casting the oblong shadow on the surface of Mars in the earlier photo. </p>

<p>Australian science writer Brian Crowley says that because of the convex cats eye shadow - which, because the overhead solar inclination prevented shadow-casting by Martian surface features, implies a shadow thrown on the surface from something in orbit - beyond the orbit of Phobos 2 itself.</p>

<p>The shadow - spindle- or cigar shaped - is inconsistent with any possible shadow cast by the moon Phobos, which is an irregular potato shape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was one of my favorite conspiracies when I was younger.  The spire on the moon.  Then it was linked to a base like structure on the moon with a video of an Apollo astronaut walking through them.  Video was too clear to be legitimate though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw some show where they presented tons of photos of the moon surface and they kept highlighting in different colors these structure that they said proved there was an extensive base up their.  And when you&#39;re guided by these false color highlights its much easier for mind to see these things that makes a lot more obvious.  But its hard to tell if they are real or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the issue of discovering if it&#39;s real or not.  I&#39;ve seen some far fetched ideas that the moon is inhabited by Giants.  The pictures were comical and doctored.  </p>

<p>In a presentation, I&#39;d prefer people he as factual and objective as possible.  It&#39;s the best way to prove your conspiracy is real and not fictitious.  Using different colors is just another way of the presenter to lead you or fool you into believe what they believe.  Color me an overall skeptic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just speculation and interpretation of evidence from a viewpoint. Biased analysis. </p>

<p>So, untill we look at it with crisp HD images and maybe proper analisys of these objects, analysis of the this should ramin on pure speculative level. Lets not descent into crazy conspiritard levels here people. In order for this sub to remain open for discussion of critical information we should take evidemce with grain of salt. </p>

<p>The monolith just looks like a rock or chunk of meteorite that happened to land in a way to cast a shadow because of a sharp edge. Same for the &quot;structure&quot; its just parralell lines, on earth we have earth and mountain/rock formations that also resembel parrallel channels formed through geological or environmental processes. So as long as there are multiple legit theories regarding this, we cant go around saying these are alien steuctures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was watching a live feed on youtube of a Florida telescope filming the moon. 11&quot; reflector.  I spotted a crater that had a line from the center to the outer rim. It cast a shadow and was definitely rising up towards the rim from the center  mass in the crater. Where it touched the center was a large rounded shadow. </p>

<p>Once I get back to my PC I will add a screenshot to this comment</p>

<p>Not sure what it is but there is a very small chance that it could form from a meteor strike.</p>
