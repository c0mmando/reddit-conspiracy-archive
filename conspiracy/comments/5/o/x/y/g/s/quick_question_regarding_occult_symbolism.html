       I have to give a shout out to vigilant citzen first and fremost.
       <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/">

       </a>
       The best comprehensive look at occult symbolism surrounding us through mass media. To get a great overall picture, read the "Read this first", and then flick through 3 or 4 of the "Symbols this month" articles. You will see, if you haven't before... Anyway I have a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was introduced to the site last night and read almost half of all of the articles. I haven't read their ebook yet, which may answer this.
      </p>
      <p>
       But please, I ask anyone knowledgeable: Why? Why the illuminati symbolism throughout (every aspect of life) mass media? Why does every one of their media pawns go to the extent they do to put these occult symbols into our daily lives? Is it some sort of brand of ownership, in that they put these "trademarks" all over the shit that we consume so people "in the know" understand that they own us/ the media? I just am not sure WHY the occult symbolism is so prevalent throughout music/tv/movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure I'll have follow up questions but I'm in a hurry right now between classes but EXTREMELY CURIOUS!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks bless you all

       They have to it's a part of the ritual, part of the deal they have made is that it all needs to be "out in the open" even if that open is mocked and ridiculed it still counts.

       I agree it's part of the deal, the ritual, I just want to completely understand why. And also I don't see it mocked or ridiculed very much at all...
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems most of the "LOL Illuminati" bs that occasionally pops up in media is just to keep it as a sort of running joke.. But not to mock the group per say, more like making a little joke of the fact that "no one  ( credible ) believes in this type of thing ". So rather than the joke being aimed at them the joke is created by them.

       That's kinda the point, the joke is made so that you are afraid to pay attention to what is going on or at least not talk about it out of fear of ridicule from your piers. Though I do know they need the attention for this stuff to work so everybody knows about it but it's all a big joke.

       Agreed. Pretty amazing.. Everyone, kids, teens, adults know what illuminati is. Yet it might as well be nothing as far 99% of population are concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just thoroughly amazed at the contradiction of their popularity and art the same time the treating it like it's as consequential as a tree house full of kids.

       I belive we are in somewhat of an artificial (dual) construct and I think by finding and applying as many options as I can think of is a possible way out. All options is the best option if that makes any since... Lol I think we can be just as good at creating as we do destroying.

       Long story short, for the type of Magik that they participate in they use symbols or sigils to draw power into making the change that they want a reality. You give power to the sigils by displaying it in public and having the public conditioned to feel certain emotions by seeing that symbol (in this example). TBTB are then able to use the energy given to them by the masses, vis a vis these symbols in their magik rituals.

       For the "little" things, tiny signs everywhere the main reasons are (by decreased order of importance) mocking (us), bragging (among themselves), and casting "spells" (against viewers).
      </p>
      <p>
       The big stuff, e.g. Superbowl/Grammies/Olympics/tunnel ceremonies are often giant "masses" celebrating their sinister cult: rituals, through which they believe they can harness the captivated attention of millions and somehow make use of it (see
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_%28Thelema%29">
        magick
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally there is the hermetic belief that by imitating nature you exact more effectiveness from the universe, i.e. you have more power. (Look into Fulcanelli). So they align their deeds with dates, sprinkle them with symbols and numbers, in order to imitate/plant pseudo-synchronicities (that would naturally happen if the deed was truth-driven) to increase the effectiveness of their action. Again it is a form of magic, divination.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: These are highly superstitious people.

        Finally there is the hermetic belief that by imitating nature you exact more effectiveness from the universe, i.e. you have more power. (Look into Fulcanelli). So they align their deeds with dates, sprinkle them with symbols and numbers, in order to imitate/plant pseudo-synchronicities (that would naturally happen if the deed was truth-driven) to increase the effectiveness of their action. Again it is a form of magic, divination.

       So basically for the same reason that aging stay at home moms subscribe to "The Secret", they do what they do.

      <p>
       Like for example let's say they have some catalyst event that is likely to set into motion a desired event. Say 60% chance the desired event is triggered.
      </p>
      <p>
       By channeling ancient symbols, ruins, beings and energies, the universe is naturally more aligned to create favorable circumstances for the catalyst. Now the desired event is 85% chance of being set into motion.

       Am I knocking on the right door here?

       Put yourself in their perspective: imagine you walk into a bustling toy store in New York City as a member of an immunization grouping that is in on all coding.  Look at all of the people around you looking plainly at all of these esoteric symbols and never knowing the better.  Imagine how that would make you feel....empowered.  Better.  Smarter.  Manipulative.

       Thank you for the reply. I get the empowering nature of that far-reaching influence especially with the duping-delight type of effect that I imagine comes with it.

       Yep never knew this stuff. Have been noticing roman and illuminati symbology non-stop though. I wonder if different groups are competing as well. Like a bunch of dogs pissing on fire hydrants trying to claim territory.

       I don't know that I see it as terribly complex.... But then again I do not know what I do not know.

       I know they have imposed this cancer on our culture for decades. I know it drastically reduces our power in several ways. (Maybe you can add more) We are more often victim to our immediate desires, increasing predictability, lowering actual satisfaction. It keeps us dumb perpetuates weak genetics. Now that I think of it, I wonder if it's not
       <strong>
        mostly
       </strong>
       a long term plot to preserve elite bloodlines but also to perpetuate among the proletariat genes that are not favorable.

       Feel free to add anything. very curious. Thank you

       What I meant by complexity, I meant that every topic of discussion that is shrouded in mystery has threads holding it in place from other mysteries.  They all connect and when you learn enough about different things the larger picture emerges and it suggests that we've been the victim of cover up after connected coverup.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good thing is that this ultimately reveals their ultimate fear of us finding out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest skipping around the George Webb YouTube Braverman videos because he makes sense of almost all of the absolute worst conspiracies we've been peddling the last 30-50 years.  He ties everything together using main stream articles and facts that paint a much larger picture of how all of these atrocities interplay for the benefit of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if all turns out to be false, the style of his thinking is where we should be heading.  We've fragmented our information into different subjects for so long that most people fail to make connections.  With our database on the Internet of history and knowledge it's all there jut waiting to be constructed into truth.  There is a ton of disinformation but there is always some truth in it and it takes strong intuition and logic to weed out the crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is much easier to bury the truth in lies than to try to take it away.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this together creates the symptom of the victimized human constantly in a state of needing more to be happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is our choice, not their command.  We need to choose to be happy and trust our intuition that something very evil has been lurking for ages.

       I agree with the sentiment for sure. I think about 9/11 for example, and what else would become clear from the fallout of that. Each significant lie is a house of cards at least partially relying on another house of cards for support.

       I've been meaning to watch more. Love the ones I've seen. Do you recommend any over the others? Or any other quality information you recommend that may shed light on some of what I've discussed in this thread?

       I honestly can't recommend one because every time I watch one I learn a new big piece of the puzzle.  His latest videos have been pretty impactful though.  It just gets my mind working with the things I've come across and the world seems smaller.
