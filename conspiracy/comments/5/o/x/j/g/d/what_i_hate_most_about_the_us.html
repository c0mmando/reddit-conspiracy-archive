This has been on the back of my mind for some time now and it keeps bugging me. The United states spends trillions of dollars on war and weapons and vehicles for wars, for wars that we don&#39;t need to be fighting, on wars that no critical thinking citizen even believes in. We spend this money on wars that don&#39;t even exist without the elite. It&#39;s all bullshit. We waste time and money, and blood on these wars that are controlled by a select amount of people. Its so sickening. Humans are not here for war and hate, and the way that media projects it to be, as if we need to be at war and shedding blood with other countries is how they want our reality to be. They spend money on wars that damn near nobody wants to be apart of. This shit is so fucked up. We could be using that money to rebuild infrastructures, rebuilding cities, and making life better for everyone on this planet. But no... we need to make it look like these wars are good for our freedom and for our safety. Fuck the US. They are so caught up in their own shit holes they don&#39;t even know how fucked up they are anymore because its normal to them. FUCK.</p>

<li>Unite as a group with Trump to quickly restore things to sane levels which would bring our lives into a much better place. </li>

<p>OR</p>

<ol>
<li>If Trump is unable to help us, then we will have to walk 100k strong to the white house, and 5k strong to our local city halls and FIRE them because we are the Bosses that pay them so we CAN fire them. If they refuse to leave, we just hang around and bang pots until they do. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t need to start from scratch. We can convert our existing capitalist system into sacred economics if we harness control of the government. Once we do that, everyone keeps doing what they have been doing but no money in the middle. Bankers, accountants, ect.. will need to find new jobs. It&#39;s like how we run our households. We don&#39;t charge each other at home. We aim for an efficient system and we work for free and harvest on our work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple truth: life is too easy. </p>

<p>We are the apex predator on the planet, so we prey on each other.</p>

<p>Original example of a false flag:</p>

<p>And the troops had pushed back their enemies and grown rich with the looted and wanted to head home.</p>

<p>So the general agreed and held a party to celebrate. During the party, he sent his agents bearing the flag of their enemy into the camp and burned down all the soldiers loot.</p>

<p>The soldiers were enraged and the general lead them against the enemy delivering a crushing defeat.</p>

At the very least the killers should be placed on an island, completely cut off from the rest of us. Weapons should be rationed, provided, until the problem has resolved itself.

In so doing we can drop the pasty pink toed pigs <em>behind</em> the promotion of war can <em>themselves</em> be dropped there to suffer the consequences of their combined actions, at the hand of blood thirsty proto-humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;War has changed. It&#39;s not about nations or ideologies. It&#39;s not even about profit, resources or ethnicity. It&#39;s an endless series of proxy battles, fought by mercenaries and machines. </p>

<p>War, and its vast consumption of human life, has become a rational, well-oiled business transaction. Genetic control... Information control... Emotion control... Battlefield control. Everything is monitored, and kept under control. </p>

<p>The age of deterrence is now the age of control, averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction. And he who controls the battlefield, controls history. </p>

<p>When the battlefield is under total control, war becomes routine.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s worth pointing out how long this has been going on for. Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler published &quot;War is a Racket&quot; in 1935, which was of course before WWII. It&#39;s important to notice that he isn&#39;t saying &#39;war has become a racket&#39; or &#39;war is sometimes a racket&#39;. We hold a strange view that we are modern and civilized and that we no longer act out of pure conquest. This seems obvious but try applying that to the brain washing of ww2 or the cold war. Even if you find yourself anti-war, few of us are really coming to grips with how far reaching this is. All war is a waste. That includes your little inter personal wars. That includes defending your position. The wars in history are just a symptom of a greater malaise. </p>

<p>On a more positive note, it does look like there is an awakening. People are asking why it has to be like this. The important first step here is drill down into how deep the psychology goes. We can&#39;t just fool ourselves into thinking it&#39;s just &#39;their&#39; fault. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What annoys me is that all the so called Powerful nations are massively in debt to other countries but continue to go to war and spend, spend, spend.  Imagine if you were just a little bit in debt, you&#39;re screwed.  You don&#39;t get to fly around on jets, fund terrorist Organizations and spend billions on weapons.</p>

<p>Just shows you that money is not real to these people.  When the hell are some of these first world nations ever going to pay China and others that they owe debt.  Pretty clear that it is like other countries having shares in exchange for influence.  Why lend competitors money?  Because China knows they are getting the money straight back by American and other countries like Britain buying their goods.  Yet the debt just goes up.</p>
