        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A Chicago man named (((Bret Sablosky))) has filed a federal lawsuit to seek an emergency injunction from a federal court judge delaying our god emperor&#39;s installation as supreme overlord. His case is that the Electoral College is unconstitutional because something-something-slavery:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lawsuit contends the Electoral College is unconstitutional—and Trump&#39;s presidency illegitimate—because it was part of a system that was created to protect slavery and give slave-owning states more representatives in Congress and in choosing the president (as each state has as many electors as members of Congress). The suit argues this slave-era holdover is unconstitutionally harming the voting rights of people who do not live in the rural states overrepresented in the Electoral College, as evidenced by the fact that, for the second time in 16 years, the national popular vote winner has not been elected president.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get a load of the chutzpah on this Jew, who even relocated his residence from Chicago to Washington DC to meet residency requirements for the lawsuit. The plan seems to be to wreck our big day by getting a court order from a friendly judge to fuck it all up and make everybody wait another few weeks while the Jews argue about it in court. The article even states that he&#39;s forum-shopping in an attempt to find a nice, compliant unqualified, affirmative-action, diversity hire Obama-appointed judge who will shit all over the country when a Jew asks him to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is hoping lower-ranking judges on the court, mostly appointed by President Obama, will be receptive to the historic nature of the case and will order the inauguration postponed while the suit is heard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Sablosky seems to be unaware that one part of the Constitution cannot be upheld to the detriment of another part of the same document, and that the matter of voting rights was already addressed by the XV Amendment, which guarantees universal suffrage to all eligible voters regardless of previous conditions of servitude. What this means in practice is that the Congress has already reconsidered the Electoral College in view of the XIV Amendment and found no conflict. </p>

<p>In other words his case is hopeless, but since when has that stopped a determined saboteur? He&#39;s even naming half of the politicians in DC as defendants.</p>

<p>unconstitutionally harming the voting rights of people who do not live in the rural states overrepresented in the Electoral College</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Liberal states have the largest amount of electoral votes compared to rural states. Rural states have to work together in order to even get that many votes compared to the Coastal states</p>

<hr/>

<p>The mask has come off. Leftards are now telling us what they really think of middle-class white America</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tech Founder: Middle America Is Too ‘Violent, Stupid And Racist’ For New Jobs</p>

<p>One Silicon Valley executive had a few choice words to describe Americans living in the heart of the nation, and they were not flattering. Melinda Byerley, MBA and founder of Timeshare CMO, a Silicon Valley-based tech start-up, tweeted out Saturday afternoon describing what middle America could do to “get more jobs in their area.”</p>

<p>Byerley says that the first thing those in middle America need to realize is that  “no educated person wants to live in a shithole with stupid people.”  Particularly, in a  “shithole”  filled with people who are  “violent, racist, and/or misogynistic.”  In Byerley’s opinion, “big corporations,” do not consider moving to the heart of America because “those towns have nothing going for them.”</p>

<p>The MBA claims that  “we,” the educated people, like herself, “would like to live a more rural lifestyle,” but they “won’t sacrifice tolerance or diversity to do so.”  Especially, these folks do not want to live in “states where the majority of residents are voting for things against their own interests,” solely, because these voters “don’t want brown people to thrive.”</p>

<p>This is the real reason the liberals want to have the country decide the elections by the popular vote.
They want to disenfranchise everyone who does not live in liberal strongholds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries. Obviously that lawsuit is grasping at straws. It seems like in every election the electoral college svrews someone over, but it&#39;s still here. I don&#39;t see any legitimate legal basis on which it could be deemed unconstitutional. I think it&#39;s just sore losers blowing hot air. Do you agree or do you feel otherwise? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Affirmative action is a good example of that, I suppose. In hindsight, I don&#39;t see how it could have ever been deemed constitutional, but in the context of the civil rights movement I can see how people would have viewed it differently back then. Is the lawsuit you posted about seen in a similar light in today&#39;s time?--possibly. I&#39;d honestly have to read more about the actual arguments being used (hopefully other users will offer more substance on this topic than I am) but as a rule of thumb I think it&#39;s more difficult to prove something is unconstitutional than it is to prove it is constitutional--especially something that is an integral (and original) aspect of our &quot;democratic&quot; process. It should appear obvious to all that this talk about unconstitutionallity is just liberal butthirt over a recent close election loss. With how the Supreme Court is looking (like Swiss cheese) and with Obama&#39;s time dwindling (barring disaster), I think this lawsuit goes nowhere.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s ridiculous that a vote from Wyoming or South Dakota has more voting power than a voter in California, Florida, New York, Texas, etc.</p>

<p>If you want to keep the electoral college then whatever (I disagree, everyone in the USA is an American and their vote should count as much as everyone else in the country. When you vote for the President it should be a national popular vote as that makes the most sense. A vote from every American that cares to cast a ballot for the leader of the union. We have state legislatures and governors for handling things within states, and we have the senate for equal representation in the Congress.) but at least make the number of electoral college votes proportionate to the population of the state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A vote in CA isn&#39;t worth 55 EVs; the collective vote is. A single vote is worth ~4.156x10<sup>-6</sup> EVs, and multiplying this by the 13,237,598 registered votes in 2016 (per Wiki) nets you ~55 EVs. Relatively to CA, votes in the other listed states have: ~2.96x (WY), ~1.07x (TX), ~1.97x (SD), and ~0.76x (FL) the voting power of a CA voter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I am from Michigan but living in California right now. If we switched to popular vote, It would create a system in which CA could (and would) build a transcontinental pipeline to drain the Great Lakes to end the drought out here and get water to the completely unsustainable monstrosity that is LA.</p>

<p>Do you want the country to be servants of CA and NY? Because that&#39;s how you get the country to be servants of CA and NY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Florida already decides who the next president will be.</p>

<p>And no, I don&#39;t think that ignoring the majority of the population and the majority of the states in favor of focusing on less 10 arbitrary states is the best way to decide who will become our president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The electoral college was created for many different reasons, some of which go against what has happened. Some of which are outdated. If we believed everything done by the founding fathers to still be necessary, we&#39;d still have slavery.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m talking about campaigning. The electoral college makes candidates only pay attention to certain states.</p>

<p>For example, pretty much all of the northwest is ignored by campaigns.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the electoral college lowers the respect many of those have for the government, since voting is viewed as unnecessary because your vote does not matter in most states.</p>

<p>Oh, and rural areas are bigger echo-chambers than cities. In cities, you get everyone. You get people from different countries, different religions, different ethnicities, and each have their own way of living.</p>

<p>Most of those rural areas are mainly white and protestant. Obviously, there are variations in their way of thinking, but then you&#39;ll say the same about cities, to a larger scale.</p>
