       Exactly. I truly want to believe more people are "waking up" and it really does seem that way, until I look at most MSM articles and their comment sections, which can be rather disheartening. However, you are right on the whole "what are we going to do about?" Unfortunately, Americans seem to so apathetic when it comes to truly getting off our asses and making legitimate change. Seeing all these other nations out there on the streets protesting their governments in an effort for real change is so uplifting, but it just makes me wonder, why can't that be us? It needs to us.

       Why not us? Because we're waiting for someone to start. We want a group to join. None of us want to try to be the first because when that happens we become "crazed gunmen" or social pariahs, or ignored entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       We wait for others to start the revolution knowing that if we try to start it ourselves the powers that be will shut us down.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a deadlock. It seems we're powerless.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, where do we congregate to coordinate a solution? A militia is an option, but that has a stigma of unhinged behavior and radical extremism that is to be ignored or played down.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do We the People rise against?
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me ideas or start the march, and I'll join in. But like many of us, I'm afraid of being the first.

       That's exactly it. I too, feel as if we are all waiting on someone to start a revolution for us, maybe because we've been led and told what to do for far too long now? I don't know, but I would love the idea of a coordinated  solution, I'm ready and I know millions of others have to be as well.

       I can suggest that we all convene somewhere and discuss peaceful options, but how would they gain traction? How would we be taken seriously by anyone? It's difficult enough being open about conspiracies, but even if you aren't and you just struggle to out the truth, you're still an outsider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still can I think like a blue pill. I fight with myself knowing I could have kept my head in the sand and I still have that grit in my mouth after a mere three months. However, I know that we're CAPABLE of doing this. We the People can, in fact, commit a coup d'etat without throwing a punch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we can shed the blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I opt for the peaceful option, because you don't attract the right people with violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever will we do? For now, we contemplate. But I would like to see this revisited soon. To know if enough of us would even be willing to work together for this, or even agree on a common goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how they oppress us: they alienate us from ourselves.

       I'd like to think that their is a peaceful solution. But I really think we are far far beyond it. The real powers to be will never ever listen to reason. So I think it's really out of the equation.

       When I hear this type of talk, I feel like I'm the one that needs to rally the people. I've felt like that for years. And for some reason people are naturally drawn to me. So maybe it's time to start a group or cult, something. The thing I worry about is how do you screen people? Because you know big brother and the shadow cabal are watching waiting for someone to start said movement. So how do you spot the CIA / FBI / PSF infiltrators? Or shill spies from getting in? Then you gotta come to terms with the fact that we are most likely going to end up martyrs. Because the true powers to be will have no mercy, and do everything in their power to cull us.

       Walking in the Light (Ephesians 5:7-14)
      </p>
      <p>
       7 Therefore do not be partakers with them; 8 for you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light 9 (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 10 trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. 11 And do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them; 12 for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret. 13 But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light. 14 For this reason it says,

       The important distinction to make here is that God could have chosen to control every outcome of every possible situation in the world- but that would mean that you and I wouldn't have free will and the ability to make choices ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would also mean that any relationship that He would have with you or I would be completely insincere, and fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       God chose to allow people to have free will which has strong implications. Namely- that people are free to choose themselves over others, and to choose not to pursue God, who offers life. Satan is real, and has a vendetta against God. Satan rebelled against God, and has chosen to cause as much of God's creation to rebel against Him as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The testament of God's work is the redemption that He set into motion when Jesus provided his unblemished life as a sacrifice so that Satan would have no spiritual legal recourse against God's children that accept Jesus' sacrifice as a covering for their own separation from God. The testament of God's work has not yet been fully realized, but will be one day at the end of all things, and a new Heaven &amp; new Earth are created.

       I used to have that type of disdain in my heart but I can assure you, its nothing like that. Sure, God can step in and keep this place from being so jacked up but remember, he gave his creation free will including the angels which is why 1/3 fell. We, through or every day interactions with life, keep ourselves here.

       I think so. Most people I've met in my age group (mid-early 20's) see through a lot of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen things happen in folks in their mid-50s and 60s, but there's some discomfort and bias that follows them. They've been in the game too long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples: my father is a baby boomer, mid 60's, staunch conservative and republican. I've never seen him more "woke" in my life because of this whole election process...the media demonizing Trump, the DNC rigging Hillary, FBI investigation, etc. However, he still falls back into the trap of blaming Democrats for most of our problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work with a woman who's the same age, again conservative/republican. She's shockingly looked into pizzagate, Michelle Obama being a man, etc.....but she only does so because of her personal bias against Democrats and the Clintons I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a partial wake going on with older generations...problem there is that they've been conditioned for much longer, especially without the internet, so any digging they do is for bias confirmation not legitimate truth-seeking...at least that's my take.
      </p>
      <p>
       And from my personal experiences, this is not the case for my generation. So...yay I guess. Thanks Internet.

       I'd like to think that their is a peaceful solution. But I really think we are far far beyond it. The real powers to be will never ever listen to reason. So I think it's really out of the equation.
