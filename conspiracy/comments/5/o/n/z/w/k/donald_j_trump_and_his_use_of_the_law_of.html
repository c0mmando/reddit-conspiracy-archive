        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-18 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/sagittariuscraig.html">sagittariuscraig</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hear me out.  </p>

<p>By now, everyone has probably heard the very odd &quot;coincidence&quot; that our 45th president will be 7 decades, 7 years and 7 days old on his first full day in office, and that he won the electoral college vote by exactly 77 votes.</p>

<p>Article discussing it: <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/if-donald-trump-wins-he-will-be-70-years-7-months-and-7-days-old-on-his-first-full-day-in-office">http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/if-donald-trump-wins-he-will-be-70-years-7-months-and-7-days-old-on-his-first-full-day-in-office</a></p>

<p>Also, in 2011, a retired firefighter Mark Taylor from Nevada has testified that he was watching Trump on television, when he said God told him he’s listening to the president. Although Trump did not run in 2012, Taylor believed Trump was going to become president.</p>

<p>“The Spirit of God says, ‘I have chosen this man, Donald Trump, for such a time as this,&#39;&quot; Taylor said. &quot;For I will use this man to bring honor, respect and restoration to America. America will be respected once again as the most powerful and prosperous nation on Earth. The dollar will be the strongest it has ever been in the history of the United States, and will once again be the currency by which all others are judged.&#39;” </p>

<p>People have also openly discussed the power of &quot;meme magic&quot; and its influence on Trump&#39;s victory: <a href="https://pepethefrogfaith.wordpress.com/">https://pepethefrogfaith.wordpress.com/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Meme magic&quot; is no less than chaos magick, or as some with call it, the Law of Attraction.  </p>

<p>As American mystic Neville Goddard says in describing the nature of our Universe and how things physically manifest on this plane, &quot;The dream of life unfolds on this level, as well as on a higher one. On this level we see things happen and are given reasons for wars and revolutions, as well as the geological causes for the convulsions of nature. But we do not know and cannot perceive their HIDDEN CAUSE for IT LIES IN THE IMAGINATION OF MAN. All things spring, not from the ostensible causes to which they are attributed, but from that which is hidden - man&#39;s own wonderful human imagination!&quot; (<a href="http://realneville.com/txt/the_hidden_cause.htm">http://realneville.com/txt/the_hidden_cause.htm</a>)</p>

<p>Goddard also says the secret to manifesting our desires on Earth lies in the injection of PASSION into it, and stating clearly what we want as if we already have it. &quot;If you must believe you have received your desire in order to attain it, then you must start your game by believing it is finished,&quot; Goddard says. &quot;You must feel yourself into and partaking of your goal. And you must persist in that feeling in order to achieve it.&quot;</p>

<p>On <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, everyone seems fond of saying &quot;High Energy,&quot; and this is what creates our physical reality: energy.  High energy is nothing more than passion combined with that energy.  Passion + energy = manifestation. It&#39;s as simple as that.</p>

<p>The reason the liberal left lost badly is because they lack energy, and thus the power to manifest.  The supporters of liberal dogma are stuck in a victim mentality, believing themselves to be the underdogs, constantly attacked, judged and ridiculed.  </p>

<p>Because thoughts are things, and because &quot;what we think about, we bring about,&quot; that is exactly what they get. More ridicule. More victimization. More losing. More being attacked. More judgment.</p>

<p>This is how the Universe works.</p>

<p>As Goddard says, &quot;The game of life is won by those who compare their thoughts and feelings within to what appears on the outside. And the game is lost by those who do not recognize this law. Being consumed by anger, they see no change in their world. But if they would change their mood, their circumstances would change. Then they would recognize the law behind their world.&quot;</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t get any simpler than this.</p>

<p>Winston Churchill himself, before departing this world, once remarked, &quot;The mood decides the fortunes of people, rather than the fortunes decide the mood.&quot;</p>

<p>History is full of examples of people who have used the Law of Attraction to literally manifest their desires.</p>

<p>Jim Carrey, the famous actor, spoke openly about his use of the power of belief and visualization to achieve his success: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nev5iwoj0ps">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nev5iwoj0ps</a></p>

<p>&quot;Our intention is everything,&quot; Carrey said. &quot;Nothing happens on this planet without it. As far as I can tell, it&#39;s just about letting the Universe know what you want, and working toward it, while letting go of how it comes to pass.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe in manifestation,&quot; Carrey went on to say. &quot;&quot;I believe in putting a rocket of DESIRE out into the Universe. And YOU GET IT WHEN YOU BELIEVE IT.&quot;</p>

<p>For those who don&#39;t know, or are undecided, Carrey is also a staunch opponent of the Illuminati.  Several years ago he went on Jimmy Kimmel and this happened: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG9i7d8yfKQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eG9i7d8yfKQ</a></p>

<p>So there you have it.  Conviction / passion / desire / belief blended with intention = manifestation.  Meme magic. Chaos magick. The Law of Attraction. The Secret.  Whatever you want to call it.  It&#39;s true, and it works.</p>

<p>Now, you may be asking, how does <em>ANY</em> of this prove 100% - beyond a shadow of a doubt - that Donald J. Trump, our 45th president, is <em>NOT</em> an Illuminati tool, or the Antichrist, or the embodiment of the very &quot;swamp&quot; he says he will soon drain?</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;ll tell you.</p>

<p>The political establishment, and the elites that &quot;run the world,&quot; are commanded by demonic entities referred to in the Gnostic gospels as archons, or in some cultures as the Djinn.</p>

<p>These entities don&#39;t care if you believe in them.  As the old saying goes, &quot;The devil&#39;s greatest trick was convincing us he didn&#39;t exist.&quot; </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t &quot;Satan,&quot; but there are lower entities such as these, and they lack creativity and cannot manifest on their own. And they use people as an energy source, as they are so far removed from humanity that they cannot sustain themselves without us.  They have ruled over us in the form of the &quot;13 bloodlines&quot; for millennia, and their rule is coming to an end.</p>

<p>In testimony from &quot;bloodline&quot; family members Insider (2005: <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/403303/The-Revelations-of-an-Elite-Family-Insider-2005">https://www.scribd.com/doc/403303/The-Revelations-of-an-Elite-Family-Insider-2005</a>) and Hidden_Hand (2008: <a href="http://www.illuminati-news.com/00363.html">http://www.illuminati-news.com/00363.html</a>), members of these demonic elites say exactly who they are why they&#39;re here, and what their goals are.  Take it with a pinch of salt; they are evil incarnate, after all.</p>

<p>Sound crazy?  Maybe it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>We often ask why the elite would do what they do.  Why torture, rape, murder and steal?  Why cause so much misery?  They have trillions of dollars, and power and influence, after all. We chalk it up to, &quot;Well, they must have gotten bored, and power perverts eventually.&quot;  Right?  No, it&#39;s so much more.</p>

<p>See here: <a href="http://www.ascensionhelp.com/blog/2012/01/31/never-call-them-archons/">http://www.ascensionhelp.com/blog/2012/01/31/never-call-them-archons/</a></p>

<p>In the above article, the author - himself a victim of parasitic energy attacks - says clearly what we&#39;re up against:</p>

<p>&quot;These parasitic beings have chosen to experiment with the illusions of separation, fear, darkness, isolation, conquering, enslavement, pain, suffering, torture, etc. to the strongest degree possible.  In doing so, they have completely cut themselves off from the nourishing Light of Being that supports life in the universe.  The result is that they must energetically nourish themselves by feeding on low-frequency energies that resonate with their chosen mode of expression.&quot;</p>

<p>Sounds exactly like the elites, right?  That&#39;s because it&#39;s true, and is what they are, and it explains why they do what they do.  And the testimonies of Insider and Hidden_Hand correlate.  Add to this the infamous Seth Material (<a href="https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-56rRUG-ov0xn05ih/Jane%20Roberts%20-%20Seth%20Speaks_djvu.txt">https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-56rRUG-ov0xn05ih/Jane%20Roberts%20-%20Seth%20Speaks_djvu.txt</a>) and the Ra Material / Law of One (<a href="http://www.lawofone.info/">http://www.lawofone.info/</a>) and you start to see an awful lot of &quot;coincidences.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m here to tell you there are no coincidences.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason the elites now seem desperate.  They are.  Human consciousness is rising.  People are waking up.  We aren&#39;t falling for the propaganda any more.</p>

<p>Are some still in a coma?  Yes.  But it doesn&#39;t take all of us.  There are more people waking up to the lies, manipulation and thievery than ever before in human history, and we know this inherently.  We can FEEL it.</p>

<p>And this is why Trump won, despite all odds, and despite all of the trickery and distortions from the MSM. </p>

<p>As the author of the above article says, &quot;The ankle biters (the energy parasites/elitists) know that their time is almost up, and they are desperately doing everything that they can to keep human consciousness in a low-frequency state. One result of their increasing desperation is that they are aggressively interfering with anyone who is raising their consciousness and frequency rate.  That means you, and that means me.  This is war to them, and they will do whatever they can to keep you, me and everyone feeling sad, fearful, depressed, disempowered, etc.  One look at the news will confirm this.&quot;</p>

<p>Can any of us deny this elementary truth?  The MSM has become fully weaponized and doesn&#39;t even attempt to conceal their bias and agenda anymore.</p>

<p>So, again, this brings us to... Donald J. Trump, and his role in all this.  I&#39;ve already examined the fact that the number 777 resonates with him, and even the non-spiritual of us have to admit, something about all these 7&#39;s and synchronicity is very strange.</p>

<p>I&#39;m here to connect the dots for you.</p>

<p>Donald J. Trump is <em>NOT</em> the chosen one; he is not Neo from the Matrix, he is not &quot;the one.&quot; We are ALL the one.  And he has been given power from our beliefs, and from his belief in himself.</p>

<p>And if you look closely, Trump has been dropping hints that he utilizes the Law of Attraction, and that he understands the teachings of Neville, Churchill and others:
<a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/815992069412057088?lang=en">https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/815992069412057088?lang=en</a></p>

<p>&quot;I thought and felt I would win big, easily over the fabled 270 (306),&quot; Trump said. &quot;When they cancelled fireworks, they knew, and so did I.&quot;</p>

<p>He THOUGHT...and FELT... he would win big.</p>

<p>It&#39;s code, people. He&#39;s trying to tell you not just how HE did what he did, but how you all helped him.  Without even realizing it, you have literally &quot;memed this into existence.&quot; It&#39;s true, every bit of it.</p>

<p>As Goddard said, again, &quot;Feeling is the secret.&quot; (<a href="http://www.feelingisthesecret.org/">http://www.feelingisthesecret.org/</a>)</p>

<p>As the author of the above article says, every one of us that wakes up &quot;kicks the ant hill&quot; the archons/elites have built, disrupts their energy source:</p>

<p>&quot;Imagine hundreds and thousands of people all over the planet piercing the dark control grid... and that light spreading to everyone who can receive it.  Imagine the ankle biters dashing around frantically trying to repair the holes in the control grid while the people stand strong... in spite of the ankle biter’s attempts to get them to stop and think fearful or sad thoughts instead.&quot;</p>

<p>So it&#39;s clear we have power. But what many of you haven&#39;t connected yet is that Trump&#39;s use of the Law of Attraction - the same as Jim Carrey&#39;s, the same as you and I - is proof positive, that Donald J. Trump is not an Illuminati tool, and far from it.</p>

<p>How is their use of the Law of Attraction proof of where their allegiances lie?  Simply put: ARCHONS LACK CREATIVITY, AND CANNOT MANFIEST WITHOUT US.</p>

<p>This is why the elites do Satantic/Luciferian and occult &quot;spirit cooking,&quot; why they rape and murder children, why they abduct people and do experiments on them, why they mind control with MKUltra and try to reduce us to slaves. If they can make us afraid, they have control over us.  Without us, they literally have no power. None.</p>

<p>With Pizzagate and the pedo scandals breaking out, and with the knowledge of MKUltra mind control becoming more mainstream by the day, it&#39;s not difficult to see there is some truly dark stuff going on behind-the-scenes, and that the world&#39;s elite are involved in it, up to the very top of their hierarchy.</p>

<p>Some of the biggest false flags in history were nothing more than &quot;feeding frenzies&quot; for them, events intended to create mass hysteria, fear, paranoia and anxiety. Take 9/11 for example.</p>

<p>As Hidden_Hand said in their dialogue with forum users, in response to a question about the true nature of 9/11, &quot;It was a Ritual Human Sacrifice. That, and the obvious catalyst for the so called &#39;War on Terror.&#39;&quot; </p>

<p>Inherently, we all know this to be true.  Even the date of 9/11 was chosen for nefarious purposes, as the Luciferian cults believes that numbers have power.</p>

<p>To know how much power 9/11 creates for these demonic parasites, you need look no further than this study: <a href="http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2011/09/06/9-11-and-global-consciousness/">http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2011/09/06/9-11-and-global-consciousness/</a></p>

<p>As the article says, &quot;If you were one of the millions who stared in horror at the television images of smoke billowing from the crippled towers, you undoubtedly can recall the intense, excruciatingly painful surge of grief and anger and sadness that you felt.&quot;</p>

<p>This graph shows exactly what happened to mass consciousness prior to and after the terror attack: <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/9-10_to_9-121.gif">http://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/9-10_to_9-121.gif</a></p>

<p>The teal “pseudo data” is automatically generated random data to compare to the red actual data.  The black and white boxes on the zero line represent the following events:</p>

<p>8:46 am WTC1 hit
9:02 am WTC2 hit
9:37 am Pentagon hit
9:59 am WTC2 collapses
10:28 am WTC1 collapse</p>

<p>The article goes on to say, &quot;Princeton University researchers believe that so many people around the world were affected in the same way that their collective mental energy actually altered the operation of computers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Those findings, which have aroused some controversy in the scientific world, were produced by Princeton’s  Global Consciousness Project (<a href="http://global-mind.org/gcpdot/">http://global-mind.org/gcpdot/</a>), whose goal is to determine whether, and if so to what extent, human consciousness—that is, our minds’ awareness of the world in which we exist—can synchronize and act coherently.&quot;</p>

<p>Archons / the elitist bloodlines are akin to predatory cyborgs, lacking creativity, but can imitate with a vengeance. As &quot;The Apocryphon of John,&quot; from the Nag Hammadi Codices (<a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/nag_hammadi/apocjn.htm">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/nag_hammadi/apocjn.htm</a>) goes on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;They (the Archons) sought to overpower humanity in its psychological and perceptual functions… For indeed their delight is bitter and their beauty is depraved. And THEIR TRIUMPH IS IN DECEPTION, leading astray, for THEIR OWN STRUCTURE IS WITHOUT DIVINITY.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you hear that?  Archons CAN&#39;T connect with source, the one true God; they literally CAN&#39;T.  They are so far removed from the light that if they were to return, they would be totally destroyed. So the best they can do here is hold back the flood, and continue to try and keep us under their thumb, afraid and shaking in anger and disbelief.</p>

<p>The fact that these parasites rely on mass sacrifices - or do them at all - is evidence, 100% cold hard evidence, that the Gnostic gospel, the Law of One, and other documents bear fruit: these things - I refuse to call them human - literally cannot function without us as their hosts.</p>

<p>And those who use the Law of Attraction, or who employ meme magic, or &quot;the Secret,&quot; as it were, MUST BE HUMAN. If they were not, they would not have the ability to manifest, or to create, and would need to use the energy of others to create their desires.</p>

<p>Donald J. Trump is the living embodiment of the Law of Attraction. The &quot;coincidence&quot; of the 777 on his first day in office, or of the rise of &quot;Kekism&quot; and the realization of his suppoters in <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, that meme magic is indeed very real, and that hyper sigils not only exist, but have far more power than we ever dreamed possible, is music to my ears.</p>

<p>This much has been accomplished by those wallowing in shadows, who have barely recognized the essence of their power and the strength of their minds.</p>

<p>Donald J. Trump is not Illuminati.  He is not one of the bloodlines. He is not &quot;one of them.&quot; His use of the Law of Attraction is proof of his connection to the source of all that is, and that he is capable of manifesting on his own, without the use of rituals.  And that is all the proof I need.</p>

<p>We are creators. I am a creator. You are a creator. And together, we have undone the archonic control of this planet that have ravaged us for millenia.  </p>

<p>Their house of cards isn&#39;t falling; it already has.  We have already won. Enjoy the fireworks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fantastic post. My friend and I have discussed every aspect you mentioned but I lacked the knowledge and resources you provided on the topic so I didn&#39;t want to post about it unless I could perfectly articulate it. Very well done OP. </p>

<p>I am not a Trump supporter per se&#39;, but I absolutely believe in The Law Of Attraction, and I watched it work in real time for him. No doubt in my mind. I could <em>feel</em> the shift in energy and momentum, and I feel it was shortly after his speech at that dinner in NY when he roasted all the &quot;elite&quot;. </p>

<p>As you said, seeing the law of attraction work for him is what convinced me he is not &quot;dark&quot;. I will take the downvotes and criticism, but I&#39;m just being honest. Cyrus was kind of a prick too, and he cleaned up Babylon....I&#39;m not saying Trump is Cyrus, but what I am saying is that sometimes God or The Universe chooses a very unlikely soul to do it&#39;s work. </p>

<p>I recall saying to a friend in October; &quot;you know, what if Trump is our collective test? To drop our egos, drop our pride, and put THIS guy of all people in office.&quot; What I mean with that is; everyone was judging him for everything under the sun. Condemning him left and right. This creates a negative vibe. The test was whether or not we (as a collective conscience) could put aside our judgements to elect someone who isn&#39;t a naturally &quot;dark&quot; person. The collective vibration reached such a high level that the &quot;dark&quot; choice (Hillary) was not allowed to win. The DNC damn sure tried to rig the vote in her favor, and it STILL DIDN&#39;T WORK. Why? Because the positivity being put out by our minds manifested the best outcome for all of us, because collectively, we are all tired of being sheep.  </p>

<p>Trump vs Hillary was a test from God/The Universe. If our conscience would have allowed Hillary to be elected, then we would have sealed our fate and condemned ourselves to total &quot;darkness&quot;. Instead, we all made the conscience decision we were tired of the deceit and we collectively got Trump elected. </p>

<p>I do believe that THROUGH him, this nation will find it&#39;s footing again. So long as this wave of positivity and cohesion continues anyway. If we allow ourselves to be divided, we will lose all ground we have gained in this war. </p>

<p>I will say: Even though I&#39;m a Christian, I do feel like the writer of that piece is trying to shoehorn Christ into the equation. I think Washington was a deist but not necessarily a &quot;Jesus Christ died for my sins&quot; kinda guy. I know there are reports he didn&#39;t take communion, and was definitely a Freemason. </p>
