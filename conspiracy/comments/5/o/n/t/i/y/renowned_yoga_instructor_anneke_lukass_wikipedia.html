        As long as I was known only for founding Liberation Prison Yoga, there was a long article on me on Wikipedia, picture and all. As soon as the Real Women Real Stories video about my childhood as a sex slave to the elite spread around the world, my Wikipage came under scrutiny, and has since been removed. My page was redirected to "Positive Criminology." Today, I'm doing another shoot for #RealWomenRealStories. The main media and Wiki will catch up eventually. This is the video: htt p://ow.ly/wokh30851du

        Image may contain: 1 person, smiling, closeup

       Also: what the shit is up with 'image may contain: 1 person smiling closeup'?  When I selected the text blop, it got that as well, though it's not shown on the facebook page.  WTH?  Must be hovertext, white on white or hidden

       There is a revision history and a deletion log.  Sometimes they delete even the revisions and the log will say which mod
      </p>
      <p>
       You can search both the page and the revisions on archivers, andfandf even if the revision is gone, you can assume the URL based on convention and plug that into archivers also

       Now here's the bonus:  when I found out that Hillary had used the same design company for her logo as the RNC: "PENTAGRAM NYC" where they simply flipped the stars on the elephant into pentagrams, I knew Hillary's red arrow through the two towers logo was dupers delight and an occult message that she was absolutely involved in the 911 coverup, being as how she was senator of the state at that time
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I made a post about this linking to archive.org snapshots of pentagram, and those snapshots were delelted after the fact, which means archive.org was harassed by very likely the CIA to take those down, or legal action threats from pentagram, though I don't know what argument they could possibly make

       My point is I rang someone powrrfuls bell and got the attention of sauron, because of the quick and unusual suppressive moves they made
