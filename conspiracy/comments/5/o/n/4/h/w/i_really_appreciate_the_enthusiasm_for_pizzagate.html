       To me, the Panama papers are far more interesting than Pizzagate. If only researchers of pizzagate realised that if they could follow the money trails uncovered by the Panama leaks, they may actually find evidence of child trafficking by the worlds wealthiest/elites.

       This is kinda what I was thinking/getting at. If you're laundering
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       much money, it's probably because the mean of obtaining it are from selling illegal things, like drugs and humans.

       The so-called Panama papers affair was at the very least meant to kill Mossack Fonseca's operation in Panama, to provide competitive advantage to its main competitors (Rothschild), and to embarass enemies of the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the very insightful argument that drove me to that conclusion.

       I have no doubt it was used to discredit some of the USAs enemies, hence, why hardly any information has come out about offshore shell accounts for entities based in the USA. In fact, I agree with most of what you said, except for this part:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The so-called Panama papers affair was at the very least meant to kill Mossack Fonseca's operation in Panama, to provide competitive advantage to its main competitors (Rothschild)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The reality is a Rothschild bank is implicated as one of the top 10 banks that requested the most offshore companies for clients through Mossack Fonseca. See here:
       <a href="https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs/">
        https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs/
       </a>
       and here
       <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/search?c=&amp;amp;cat=2&amp;amp;e=&amp;amp;j=&amp;amp;q=rothschild&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, you can actually search for some (if not all) of the published details regarding Rothschild
       <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/search?c=&amp;amp;cat=0&amp;amp;e=&amp;amp;j=&amp;amp;q=rothschild&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">

       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/search?cat=1&amp;amp;e=&amp;amp;q=rothschild&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">
        officers
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/search?cat=3&amp;amp;e=&amp;amp;q=rothschild&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">

        intermediaries
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the US actually was behind the leak, they embarrassed some pretty close friends in the process, including Israel and the UK.

       I think the Panama Papers leak was actually an effort to kill off shore tax havens in general and push more illicit money into US safe havens. Of course the Papers were cleaned up to avoid showing some people but a few US fish had to be left in to avoid a total bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much illicit money floating around out there the business of banking it really is massive. When business deals get that large governments pull out the alphabet agencies to get an advantage.

       You tell them, make a compelling argument, something plausible. I'm game, Obama ran on hope and change and did nothing noteworthy other than getting a a peace prize for bombing and droning the shit out of people. I'm not falling for this "outsider" who has been propped up by the banksters. Crying about it won't help though, and inciting people to bicker for a difference of opinion won't either.

       How can you have anything in common with people that not only disagree with your initial paragraph, but align themselves with white supremacists, have a [crab bucket mentality] when it comes to healthcare or social services, do not care about the environment or animals if profit is to be made by corporations, and worship billionaires on the basis that "might makes right"?

       I say the same thing to everyone. We've been so divided, that people can't help but see anyone that disagrees as a polar opposite. I see it as a bit more nuanced. It's easy to get caught up in superficial aspects, all is revealed once you follow the money.
      </p>

       Ask yourself who controls the money, that's who deserves our hatred, they're the ones playing us off against each other.

       But why? I just don't understand why educated and empowered people in this post-Enlightenment age would actually believe human sacrifice is necessary for any kind of deity or satanic version of a deity to do whatever one dreams to achieve, especially when one has as much power and money as the elite do. It's not as if they can't make things happen on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most of this crap on here about Satan and devil worshippers and eating people is just paranoia from right wing Christians who don't like how their place in the world seems to keep slipping in the New World Order. They're  anxious and seeing Satanists behind every tree. It's paranoid fear-mongering. It's like group think and mass hysteria, as much as one can say that about  the numbers at this subreddit. Now the pedophilia at least makes some sense because a lot of men like teenagers. Are we to believe the elite like eating humans because they have a taste for it?

       It is a soros ploy that never exposes the powers that be. It's only uused to expose countries that soros wants to destroy. Note that wikileaks does not criticize israel and the intelligence as well.

       After they got to monopolize the data for their original reports in the press they opened up a database with some of the information. What's in the information they did not include? Who knows, you just have to trust them completely that it wasn't anything good.

        “US [government] funded [Panama Papers] attack story on Putin via USAID. Some good journalists but no model for integrity,” said Wikileaks in its initial tweet. The allegation included no proof of direct involvement aside from what appears to be a screenshot of the lower portion of the OCCRP’s website, which says it is made possible by a Soros-funded organization and USAID. What the screenshot failed to include is that the organization also lists the Swiss-Romanian Cooperation Program (SRCP) as a source of funding.

       No - he was critical because it was a controlled leak clearly designed to smear certain people/groups, while letting others escape scrutiny completely.  He was also wary about the protocol of the leak and the Guardian's subsequent handling of raw information.  Finally, he noted the Panama release coincided with Reno becoming the real tax shelter for American companies and hinted it might have been a distraction in that respect.  The entire leak didn't really pass his smell test, and I have to say I agree with many of the points he raises.

       It its not presented as news, is a theory that requieres further investigation, a hard one to investigate since really powerful and media controlling people are involved.

       Panama Papers shot to the top of Reddit and IIRC contained no US politicians of notes.  That alone is fishy AF to me.  Definitely would not be surprised if the USA was behind the Panama leaks

       Completely agree. IMO, anything that is widely reported by our MSM is fishy AF to me. We all can see what happens to the real information that they don't want us to know about.

       The Panama Papers were obviously a dump of a files by USA intelligence agencies to target foreigners. The only people affected were enemies of the CIA/NSA. The papers should have had dirty on thousands, instead only the enemies of the state got in trouble.

       We just need to point out they need to be looking at this source to help further the PizzaGate investigation. The Panama papers leak was huge, and very well could tie to pizzagate, being that if there is a big child trafficking service in DC, that money is definitely laundered, and we need to find that info.

       They are tied to Pizzagate. This is why it is so frustrating that it is being buried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta receives money from Troika Dialog which is funded by RAS Corporate Services which is funded by Sberbank, aka the Kremlin/Putin. That is a super real financial relationship that is ongoing and further proved by Wikileaks when 75,000 shares were revealed to have ended up in Podestas hands. Smoking gun that political activities in the US are bought and paid for by foreign entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta is, according to David Brock, the gay lover of owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis, who sells crappie satanic art to the Saudis for record prices. More money laundering. The original owner of the block that Alefantis' multiple businesses came from was owned by the Saudis.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, the Panama Papers confirm that money laundering is an aspect of Pizzagate.
