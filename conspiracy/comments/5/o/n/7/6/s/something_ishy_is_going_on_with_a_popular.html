        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The highly technical, advanced engineering talk discussing the WTC7 building and how NIST was completely wrong in how they modeled it, how they omitted bolts and beams and such.  </p>

<p>This video is now gone.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m nonplussed by this.</p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s links, everywhere, are totally dead.</p>

<p>This was a very convincing video that people were using to definitively demonstrate that WTC7 collapsed due to controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Now the videos of Dr. Hulsey working with students are still there, and the verdict videos where he discusses the findings to non-technical lawyers is still there, and all these &quot;we have to heal now&quot; type videos are there</p>

<p>But who cares!  They mean nothing if we don&#39;t have the engineering talk.  Because that&#39;s the shit that will convince other engineers and architects.</p>

<p>They need to put it back up pronto.</p>

<p>If any of you are in AE911Truth, you need to tell them.  I was a volunteer for a while but I burned my bridges because I got pissed off over how to do things so I can&#39;t help unfortunately</p>

<hr/>

<p>If any of you have this video, upload and link and we&#39;ll archive it and put it on freenet where it will live forever.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kicking mysef for not having a copy</p>

<hr/>

<p>UPDATE. </p>

<p>I think it is this video</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No not the student videos, the AE911 truth video that was one of the first &quot;justice in focus&quot; videos.  It was about an hour long, it was in a dark room with iirc a projector, with hulsey himself, alone at a podium, and at the very end he asks himself the probability of wtc7 falling due to fie he says zero.</p>

<p>Anyone who has seen of will know which video, it was the most significant</p>

<p>It was the video that is the most powerful evidence to date, that is why I am very suspicious it is gone.  I doubt ae911truth know its been deleted</p>
