       The highly technical, advanced engineering talk discussing the WTC7 building and how NIST was completely wrong in how they modeled it, how they omitted bolts and beams and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       This video is now gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm nonplussed by this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone's links, everywhere, are totally dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a very convincing video that people were using to definitively demonstrate that WTC7 collapsed due to controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the videos of Dr. Hulsey working with students are still there, and the verdict videos where he discusses the findings to non-technical lawyers is still there, and all these "we have to heal now" type videos are there
      </p>
      <p>
       But who cares!  They mean nothing if we don't have the engineering talk.  Because that's the shit that will convince other engineers and architects.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to put it back up pronto.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any of you are in AE911Truth, you need to tell them.  I was a volunteer for a while but I burned my bridges because I got pissed off over how to do things so I can't help unfortunately
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       If any of you have this video, upload and link and we'll archive it and put it on freenet where it will live forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm kicking mysef for not having a copy

       UPDATE.

       No not the student videos, the AE911 truth video that was one of the first "justice in focus" videos.  It was about an hour long, it was in a dark room with iirc a projector, with hulsey himself, alone at a podium, and at the very end he asks himself the probability of wtc7 falling due to fie he says zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who has seen of will know which video, it was the most significant
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the video that is the most powerful evidence to date, that is why I am very suspicious it is gone.  I doubt ae911truth know its been deleted
