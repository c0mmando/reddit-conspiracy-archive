       Their fuselages were capped with reinforced concrete or hardened steel in the nose, with massive stores of jet fuel where the passengers and luggage would usually be and the wings specially shaped and reinforced to cut through the building's facade (perhaps even with a few or a ton of evidence drops/dead bodies) and the jet fuel rigged to explode
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       after the plane smashes through the tower's steel and concrete facade and penetrating deep into it's main elevator shaft, devastating the structure and leading to completely unanticipated amounts of damage, thus only minute amounts of demolition charges were needed to keep the buildings in virtual free fall. Building 7 was simply demolished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what leads me to say such things? Well, for starters, those planes that hit the towers
       <em>
        greatly
       </em>
       exceeded their VNEs for quite a while (source:
       <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/911_Aircraft_Speed_Deets.html">

       ), which means Velocity Never Exceed, basically, you go faster than this for any significant amount of time, you're going to start losing parts of your airframe you'd probably want, like wings, and control surfaces, and much, much more. You see, when aircraft fly at 38000 feet, the air is much thinner and thus the plane only needs to push a small amount of air out of the way to go forward, while it's massive turbofan engines can suck in large quantities of this thin air and use it to propel the plane forward at blistering speeds. At low altitudes the air is much thicker, so the plane is being reacted and pushed back against much, much more by the denser air, this means the airplane can not go anywhere near as fast as it can at lower altitudes because the exponentially increased air resistance would put so much stress on the airframe that it would simply fall apart at the points of most stress on the frame and drag. Additionally, when you start approaching your VNE at low altitude, the plane becomes much harder to control because of all of the added air flowing over the control surfaces, making minor inputs major, but major inputs hard because the air flow is too much for the hydraulically boosted control surfaces and their mountings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the official story, some guys with box cutters, with extremely limited and basic flight simulation training, managed to take over a plane with tiny knives. So they pilot it into a building successfully after evading the most heavily defended airspace in the world, and yadda yadda, muslim boogeymen, oil, bullshit, same old same old rest is history. IF the plane were to hit the building somehow after surviving G force over stress turns while greatly exceeding it's VNE, it would be like launching a half empty coke can at a wall, the empty half of the can will crumple and the half with the liquid will burst and explode on the surface of the wall. An airliner is an empty tube of aluminium with a few volatile tanks full of massive amounts of jet fuel. An airliner could hit a light pole and that would shear it's wing clean off, that's how lightly built they are (it's also a testament to our ingenuity as to how we can shape things to be so light yet so strong, shoutout to our aeronautical engineer bros, you da real MVPs). The kind of technology necessary to fabricate a special plane with a reinforced concrete nose, jet fuel filled fuselage, delayed fuse, reinforced cargo bay for special passports and such, and wing leading edges made of lightweight reinforced cutting shaped metals (shaped like a saw blade you'd see mounted on the bow of a U-Boat to cut anti-submarine nets). It's the only way I could see actual flying objects other than cruise missiles hitting the twin towers, there's simply no possible way civilian airliners pulled off what happened on 9/11. I apologize for any typos, I'm very tired now and I'll fix any I see some time tomorrow.

       Yeah, I firmly believe something flew into the buildings, so many eyewitness testimonies and different footage, but it sure wasn't a unmodified Boeing full of passengers and their luggage. I think one of the potential reasons they did it this way was to study the impact results on such a large and heavily built building.

       I agree 100%. Something hit those buildings, but were not the reason they fell. It was all a part of the show. No way regular airliners could do that, but some type of reinforced military drone airliner? That's where I'm placing my bets... At the end of the day though, we just need more exposure and for people to realize their gov and others were the culprits, not some M/E patsies (who I think were flown (remotely hijacked) and crashed into the sea). If we can get that, hopefully the chips will fall where they may. May not get the whole truth (which is what I seek), but we may get some....

       What would happen if someone could do a big time funded/sponsored by genuine good-natured American companies event with a huge stage, free stuff (tshirt cannons), food (hot dogs, philly cheese steaks, pizza but only the best, and for a good price), kickass Powerpoint presentation with lasers in or in front of the capitol building/white house with cold hard facts like the VNE issue, additionally peacefully calling out and exposing those in our government and those who hold power over it who clearly do not have our nation's and our planet's best interests in mind. It pains me to see the evils we perpetuate as a nation that we could end overnight, thus solving the very issues the evils supposedly are put in place to prevent. It's plain as day to me, at least I fool myself into thinking that.

       It's far too extreme. Not only does this require a huge amount of resources to do, it also unbalances the plane. You can't just reinforce parts of a plane with concrete or steel and load it up with extra jet fuel and expect it take off on a normal runway or even to fly normally. How the hell do you steer an even more imbalanced plane beyond it's NEV? Going beyond NEV at sea level isn't just going to put strain on the wings, but also on the entire tail section, the wing tips and any flight control surfaces. Plus with the added weight you've now got an even more uncontrollable plane. This theory is only necessary to explain how the plane penetrated the building. Talk of timing jet fuel explosions and reinforced cargo holds for passports is beyond sanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simplest, cheapest way to accomplish this is the CGI fake 'no planes theory'. All you have to do is plant a few witnesses.

       It would not unbalance the plane, all you would need is a small tapered cap of concrete or steel in the nose to punch through the initial facade and damage the elevator shaft, and counterbalance this weight with extra fuel tanks since it's a one way trip.

      <p>
       I only added the part about delayed explosion jet fuel because in the footage you see of planes hitting the towers, the plane penetrates the facade, and then only after the plane has fully penetrated the building does the jet fuel explode, instead of the jet fuel simply exploding on the exterior of the building the moment it impacted.

       I believe that the planes were reinforced however, concrete would make them unflyable (is that a word?). They also had explosives inside the planes and the building timed to go off a second before the plane hit the building to blow a hole for the plane to enter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe the planes were going nearly as fast as the government says they were. What's more likely? That the government has super planes that can exceed VMO or that the planes were simply going slower?

       Just a small note, concrete located inside the body of the aircraft would have no impact whatsoever, as long as the weight was within the plane's rated max takeoff weight and it did not significantly alter the plane's center of gravity.

       Maybe the planes that hit the towers were made out of extremely light materials and shattered into thousands of pieces like "93" and "77". Witnesses at both of those crash sites said that there were no large pieces. That you could pick them up with your hands. When the planes hit the towers, it triggered explosives inside that made the holes seen on the outside. I don't think even concrete could cut through the steel beams on the outside of the building.

       No. It's not the material—it's the
       <em>
        speed
       </em>
       . I could literally kill you with a penny to the forehead if it's travelling 520 mph. That's how this worked. The plane's skin is made of aluminum, but, inside the wings, there is still a lot of steel. Aluminum cannot handle the flexing and stresses of flight if it's just aluminum. But, still, travelling at such a fast rate of speed would be nothing for the thin I-beams at that height.

       Who told you the plane was travelling that fast? They might have hit the throttle at the last minute but every pilot that has flown those exact planes will tell you that it's impossible for those planes to travel at those speeds so close to ground level..

       They were designed in the early 80s, without the aid of computers and simulated stress tests. The aircraft could exceed their VNE for a long period of time, and the airframes would take weeks or even months to eventually fail (due to stress tests). Although the VNEs were exceeded for a long period, the 767s were heavily over-engineered. This is common with this kind of engineering. The USS Scorpion, for instance, which was lost by the navy during depth testing, did not fail until it had exceeded its "VNE" (in this case, its max depth) by 40%. It was rated to 1400-1800 feet, yet instantaneously impoded around 3000 feet. Pop.

       We've all heard about how a tornado's fierce winds can propel blades of straw into telephone poles. It's all about kinetic energy. The energy imparted by the speed of the planes would have been more than enough to cut through the steel I-beams in the outer mesh of the towers. Why? Because, at that height, the loads the I-beams were carrying were only the loads of the floors above. This is an axiom of all building construction:
       <strong>
        Every floor must bear the weight of the entire structure above it.
       </strong>
       Therefore, at that height, the steel being used needed to be only 1/4"-1/2" thick, whereas, at the bottom, the I-beams were 4" thick steel. The first WTC impact happened around the 82nd-89th floor.In fact, one PDF I read about the towers states that only 2% of the entire WTC was above the first plane's impact zone. The buildings are tapered, essentially, with the steel thinning as it goes to the top. If the steel didn't thin down going up, the weight would have been too much for the bottom girders to bear.

       The planes' wings would
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       have to be reinforced in any way to fully enter the building and do damage.

       I'm not at all in doubt that the planes would be capable of greater performance than their stated maximums. My Buick was built in 1989 and it's built like a tank, they definitely overbuilt things in the 80's. If we are to assume that the planes were completely unmodified, the question for me would be how the inexperienced pilots could control the plane on the virtual limits of its capability and guide it perfectly into a building after coming out of a dive.

       You totally won't beleive this, but I was there and, though, I didn't see the first on hit, I saw the 2nd one. Both planes were level for a very long time. The first plane was not moving as fast as the second, obviously, as we've seen from the French video. And the 2nd plane was moving extremely fast, but, two things: 1) the plane did not come up out of its dive until well before it hit the WTC, and 2) the plane in fact struck a glancing blow to the tower (likely only glancing a blow off the core).

       The real flying "feat" that day was at the Pentagon, where it is 100% clear from the black box telemetry released that a very, very experienced pilot was at the helm.
