We know the DNC emails were leaked, and the Pedostaphiles were phished, and this is confirmed by emails from Pedosta to his IT guy.

<p>If there wasn&#39;t a smear campaign on Trump and the legitimacy of the election of claims he&#39;s controlled by Russia and that they influenced the election no one would be batting an eye at him meeting with anyone who happened to be Russian. It&#39;s absolutely related. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean it is kinda fishy being the only two removed. HOWEVER.....each of those topics/posts were, let&#39;s be honest, iffy at best. Pissgate is garbage haha. I can&#39;t believe people are actually buying that obvious shit from huffington post lol. This last one about the airport in Charlotte was kinda interesting. But it was only based on a twitter post, which OP didn&#39;t even link, and then made a lot of assumptions and said they definitely met. Without even providing what that could mean. Then almost all of the comments were complaining about the sub being pro-Trump, even though that article was on top, and also complaining about when the post would be removed. NO COMMENTS ADDED ANY CONVERSATION ON THE TOPIC. I READ EVERY SINGLE ONE.</p>
