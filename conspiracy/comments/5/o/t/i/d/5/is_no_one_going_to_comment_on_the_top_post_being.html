       Leaked DNC emails show them trying to pin a Russian narrative as far back as April. We know the DNC emails were leaked, and the Pedostaphiles were phished, and this is confirmed by emails from Pedosta to his IT guy. We also know that a democrat related to Hillary's campaign tried to frame Assange as a Russian spy and Pedophile. This is all fact. No Russian hacking, clear proof of them trying to frame their opposition as being controlled by 'the Kremlin.'

       Yes, but the idea that big bad Russia is doing all of the scary things is his point. They established they were going to use that narrative all the way back in April.

       And? Russia is not our enemy as the mainstream media would have you believe. Is it not publicly known that Obama is only pushing conflict with Russia because they are protecting Syria from being overthrown by US backed rebels and ISIS,

       If there wasn't a smear campaign on Trump and the legitimacy of the election of claims he's controlled by Russia and that they influenced the election no one would be batting an eye at him meeting with anyone who happened to be Russian. It's absolutely related.

       I mean it is kinda fishy being the only two removed. HOWEVER.....each of those topics/posts were, let's be honest, iffy at best. Pissgate is garbage haha. I can't believe people are actually buying that obvious shit from huffington post lol. This last one about the airport in Charlotte was kinda interesting. But it was only based on a twitter post, which OP didn't even link, and then made a lot of assumptions and said they definitely met. Without even providing what that could mean. Then almost all of the comments were complaining about the sub being pro-Trump, even though that article was on top, and also complaining about when the post would be removed. NO COMMENTS ADDED ANY CONVERSATION ON THE TOPIC. I READ EVERY SINGLE ONE.

       There was clear evidence of brigading, so they removed it and reported to the admins. You really want any brigading, even it may align with your point of view? That's the epitome of a hypocrite.

       I did make my own post and I didn't copy paste the actual content into my new post. I didn't think I needed to because it was already on the front page. It was deleted anyway as is this post as well, which is fine as the original poster made his new post and we are discussing there

       They didn't want to discuss the actual content of the post, so they decided to distract by talking about "artificial brigading" - they got scared when it reached
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       and grew even more... how does something even get brigaded by
       <a href="/r/all">

       ? Anyway...

       it's a classic disinformation tactic: Deflection. Five key ways of information warfare that Russian propaganda uses a lot: dismiss the critic, distort the facts, distract from the main issue and dismay the audience.

       No need.  Us free thinkers are quickly moving beyond petty politics and searching for greater truths. Join the journey my brother. These false idols will have no say in our reality once we understand we are on, undivided.

       But to become undivided, we have to come together and accepting hag the elites are against us all! As of now we have groups that understand that all elites are against us (me) but we have too much division in this sub regarding a president who is just like the rest of them, and I think we need to open their minds so they can see that there is no elite that is fighting for them, that's it's all a sham. And I think we have to discuss this before moving on, or else only some move on and others get stuck in the mud

       For sure,  we are all at different parts of our journey,  but moving towards the same truths.  So I agree with you. But if we only fight to beat tptb there will always be someone to take advantage and become tptb. We have to understand that when we fight,  it's for truth.

       You're right. I tend to get stuck and frustrated when there are so many that refuse to see they've been played rather than just accept it, see the truth, and we can move on. I want to try and show them the information they should see without patronizing or insulting so they can see for themselves what many others already see. Maybe we need middlemen like myself to help with the fight you're battling. What do you think?

       Dude it's tough. The best advice I read in this sub was "it starts with you". Meaning you have truth on your side.  You don't need to fight with anyone. Everyone is connected to you and because of this they already know the truth.  Darkness is covering their light (ctr) but soon people like you will shine light every fucking where and there will be more darkness.  Trust your gut and don't fight over the truth,  just enjoy living in the light.  Others are going to follow you
