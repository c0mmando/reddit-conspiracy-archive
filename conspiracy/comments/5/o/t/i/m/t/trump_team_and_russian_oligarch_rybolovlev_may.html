        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump team may have met with Russian billionaire and businessman Dmitry Rybolovlev, on November 3rd. A week before the election. Undeniable proof ignored by MSM... but if so, why did he meet Rybolovlev on that day?</p>

<p>We have pictures of this (see bottom of this post). Trump was scheduled for a rally in Charlotte, NC and parked his private jet in a small airport. The plane right next to it arrived that day, for a few hours, belonged to Dmitry. Since real-time GPS tracking of Trump&#39;s plane is disabled, we would not have known if someone hadn&#39;t taken pictures of it, that it was there on November 3rd. There <em>were</em> ALSO flight records of Rybolovlev&#39;s plane being there, as well as pics.</p>

<p>Why did the mainstream media not report this? He met with a Russian oligarch 5 days before the election. It is a very small airport. Rybolovlev did not make any other trips to North Carolina in recent history, just on that day. Why?</p>

<p>This Russian oligarch has a previous relationship with Trump. This man, Dmitry Rybolovlev, has immense political power in Russia because of his wealth? Need I also add that in 2008, he bought a mansion from Trump, which Trump made $60mill in profit off of? (Bought in 2004, $40mill, Sold for $100 mill).  Was this all a way of laundering money? It wouldn&#39;t be the first time a foreign businessman does that in the West - the Chinese do it all the time! If it was Clinton, we would have questions being asked. </p>

<p>The property he bought for $95 million from Trump, in 2008, he is trying to sell in 2016 and CAN&#39;T get profit. He divided it up into three lots and he barely broke even on the largest most expensive lot. Clearly not a good investment property.</p>

<p>Also interesting to note:  Trump&#39;s son made 6 trips in 18 months to Russia before 2008–then a Russian oligarch showers Trump with $95M. The realtor who sold the house has stated that he never moved in. </p>

<li><p>Comprehensive flight history: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/baZGv">http://imgur.com/a/baZGv</a> It is interesting to note that his recent flight history does not contain any trips to North Carolina otherwise. I think it is VERY LIKELY he was there to meet with Trump&#39;s team/Trump.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s undeniable that the Trump team, Trump and Rybolovlev were all at this tiny Charlotte, NC airport parking lot/TARMAC (tiny in comparison to Heathrow or LAX) on the same day the week before the election date. Their history with suspicious real estate deals is also undeniable. The important thing is WHY?</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>A user PMd me the following, thought it was interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/12/20/investigators-just-uncovered-two-trump-companies-russian-money-laundering-capital/">http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/12/20/investigators-just-uncovered-two-trump-companies-russian-money-laundering-capital/</a>
I read your comment about the airplane and then a few hours later I read this article. Clearly Rybolovlev is directly linked to Trump through the Bank of Cypress and Wilbur Ross, a Trump cabinet appointee. I figured you know this already but just in case you didn&#39;t, I thought I would share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what the numbers look like when the thread is organically upvoted.</p>

<p>Noone cares about this because most people want Russia and the US to be on friendly terms. The current situation where the US has encircled Russia with military bases and overthrew the democratically elected president of Ukraine and installed a puppet in order to get them to join NATO will lead to WW3.</p>

<p>It is much preferable to have the US and Russia on friendly terms. Unless you are saying that Trump is literally a Russian agent this is immaterial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why do you think we are not on good terms with Russia right now? For fun? Remember, Obama wanted to &quot;reset&quot; with Putin. Do you know what went wrong? Crimea invaded in a land crime from another country. Submarines lurking off nato allies&#39; coast. Supression of gays, of people with aids, of muslims. There is no free press, there is Putin press. The shooting down and denial of the Malaysian flight. Essentially you&#39;re saying this influence is cool, no matter how shady it is, because these people have been our ideological enemy for 70 years so let&#39;s stop. But there&#39;s a <em>reason</em> they&#39;ve been the enemy. You&#39;re okay with an enemy influence us? You really think they&#39;ll have our best intentions in mind? Really?</p>

<p>Nobody was worried about Russian influence when the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html?_r=0">Clintons sold off 20 percent of America&#39;s uranium production to them</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beyond mines in Kazakhstan that are among the most lucrative in the world, the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies. Among the agencies that eventually signed off was the State Department, then headed by Mr. Clinton’s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s very suspicious that they suddenly became concerned about Russia after Hillary decisively lost. Frankly, I&#39;m not buying the Red Scare 2.0.</p>

<p>Also, the mainstream media never questioned the $20 million donations the Saudis were making to the Clinton Foundation. Apparently the mainstream media was okay with Saudi influence over the Clintons despite the Saudis being a proven enemy.</p>

<p>Probably why the two times I&#39;ve been gilded were by a person/s whom never contact me to send the equivalent $ as Bitcoin to a fresh new address.</p>

<p>Anyone that has seen me regularly post on Reddit would have noted my mention of Bitcoin &gt; Reddit gold more than once (even a post where I asked for no Reddit gold yielded, you guessed it, Reddit gold).</p>

<p>An appreciative gesture but, especially given any deals/discounts are impractical for me in Australia (AUD/USD exchange rates /end argument), to me personally entirely pointless.</p>

<p>Nah, it&#39;s obviously <em>just</em> because this sub is &quot;pro-trump&quot; or like I&#39;ve been reading in those other subs, affiliated with the Russian government (lol, and <em>we&#39;re</em> the fucking delusional ones?) and people are tired of it.</p>

<p>But please - keep telling yourself, and your friends who love feeding off of made-up drama, that you&#39;re getting upvotes and gold from &quot;anonymous&quot; people who actually give a shit about what you&#39;re posting rather than the upvotes and gold coming from the asshats who&#39;ve been linking this post/following the (non-np) links to this post so that you/they can pretend there&#39;s some (false) consensus.</p>

<p>Most people have lives and don&#39;t spend hours upon hours on reddit without taking breaks. It&#39;s not only possible, but entirely plausible that someone will refresh, see a comment, and then get off reddit for a while.</p>

<p>Others on mobile, might not even have notifications active and will just reply when they go back to a thread. Being an ass to someone who hasn&#39;t replied to you or someone else quick enough for your liking just makes people want to ignore you and not reply at all.</p>

<p>Although we recognize that much of the content in this sub is in the realm of &quot;high octane&quot; speculation, when posts artificially rocket to #1 (and thus the front page of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>), they become subject to higher levels of scrutiny. </p>

<p>Original content is what makes <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> truly great, and we by no means want to discourage independent content. </p>

<p>I meticulously watched its rise from the beginning. </p>

<p>The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods have been on a heightened state of alertness as of late, mainly because shitposts are frequently being artificially voted to the top.</p>

<p>This particular post caught our eye immediately. It had 1,200+ upvotes in less than an hour...unheard of for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>I was initially baffled because it was barely in the top 100 on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>...then one of the mods discovered the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> thread and it became very clear.</p>

<p>The meteoric rise was initiated by <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. </p>

<p>As <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moderators, we will never let a subreddit like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> dictate what hits the top of our sub.</p>

<p>If a post is destined for <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, it will get there on its own merits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying that /pol/ or T_D haven&#39;t brigaded r/conspiracy but the thread you link is talking about one of the most (if not the most) popular politicians getting cheated out of the nomination by one of the most corrupt politicians. </p>

<p>The second highest post in that thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think Hilary is a treasonous weasel and <strong>Trump is a stubborn, sexist, idiot</strong>. I would have voted for Sanders any day of the week, but the media and the corrupt DNC took him out of it to line their pockets and continue on with their abuse of power and continued bullshit. </p>

<p>So honestly that is a horrible example to compare this thread too. Especially when the original thread had undeniable proof it was being brigaded by r/politics. The mods did the right thing and would do the same if there was undeniable proof of T_D or others influencing anti-hillary/DNC threads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Found this from 2012:
It turns out that the aircraft belongs to a company called Sophar Property Holding BVI (British Virgin Islands, I believe). The history of this company is somewhat mysterious, because some years ago it was bought by the Russian potash mining company called Uralkali, the head of Uralkali being a Russian oligarch called Dmitry Rybolovlev. At the time that it was bought, its only assets were an option to buy two private jets: a much smaller Falcon and this A319.
Somehow, when Dmitry lost his position in Uralkali, it seems that he was rather attached to these jets, so apparently he bought them back (effectively buying Sophar Property Holding at the value of the two aircraft). If this is so, then he can travel around in either of them.
The three overnight visits of M-KATE to Geneva this year have been on 15/16 March, 20/21 March and 28/29 April. Data from an aircraft tracking web site appears to show that this last visit came from Zurich and then went to Nice. Not exactly long flights from an aircraft which is said to have installed extra long-range fuel tanks.
Mr Rybolovlev appears to be another of the eastern European rich people who like to acquire Football clubs in Europe: he was at the head of a consortium which bought a controlling interest im Monaco FC last year. Another Russion, Roman Abramovich, has long owned Chelsea FC, and will have a prime seat for the European Champions League final shortly. Other East European adventurers have been less successful, including in Switzerland (Neuchatel Xamax!).</p>

<p>This is important because we can see that ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In June 2010, Rybolovlev sold a 53% shareholding in Uralkali to a group of Russian investors: Kaliha Finance Limited (Suleiman Kerimov, 25%), Aerellia Investments Limited (Alexander Nesis, 15%) and Becounioco Holdings Limited (Filaret Galchev, 13.2%).[24] The transaction price was not disclosed, but was reported to be around US$5.3 billion.</p>

<p>In December 2010, Uralkali announced plans to buy potash producer, Silvinit and form one of the world&#39;s largest potash producers.[25] The merger was finalized in July 2011, Rybolovlev had already sold the remaining 10% of his shares of Uralkali to a company owned by Alexander Nesis in April 2011.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So our Russian oligarch already sold his share before the jet was even delivered...</p>

I hardly ever post on ETS/Impeach trump - I only did today because someone on SubredditDrama told me to after this thread was deleted.</p>

<p>You can relax with the personal attacks. If I was being paid by CNN/CTR/whatever at least my parents would be proud I finally got a real job!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to know why it matters that he met with this person.  What if his intentions were to try and reverse the current mood and tension between Obama and Russia? </p>

<p>This whole notion that Russia is somehow the bad guys is laughable.  The US has done more intervention and nation building than anyone else, yet Democrats seem to enjoy antagonizing Putin.  </p>

<p>US created ISIS and they blew into Syria. For that Putin defends his ally.  US would do the same. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so sad when we lose sight of the fact that Russia is a better friend than foe.  As one commentator said;  even at the height of the cold war there was still dialog.  Obama and his cuckery seemed to throw that all away for reasons that he wanted to support the rise of the muslim brotherhood.   </p>

<p>Trump probably wanted to assure the oligarchs that a friend would soon be back in power.  Nothing wrong with that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So lets go through this claim by claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump was scheduled for a rally in Charlotte, NC and parked his private jet in a small airport.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is false, trump had a rally in Concord that afternoon.</p>

<p>Source:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article112242047.html">http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article112242047.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plane right next to it arrived that day, for a few hours, belonged to Dmitry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Supposedly through his connection to Uralkali...</p>

<p>From wiki</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In June 2010, Rybolovlev sold a 53% shareholding in Uralkali to a group of Russian investors: Kaliha Finance Limited (Suleiman Kerimov, 25%), Aerellia Investments Limited (Alexander Nesis, 15%) and Becounioco Holdings Limited (Filaret Galchev, 13.2%).[24] The transaction price was not disclosed, but was reported to be around US$5.3 billion.</p>

<p>In December 2010, Uralkali announced plans to buy potash producer, Silvinit and form one of the world&#39;s largest potash producers.[25] The merger was finalized in July 2011, Rybolovlev had already sold the remaining 10% of his shares of Uralkali to a company owned by Alexander Nesis in April 2011.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Rybolovlev divested from Uralkali by 2011.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/cYjOxF0.png">https://i.imgur.com/cYjOxF0.png</a></p>

<p>Shows that the plane was not delivered until 2012.</p>

<p>Moreover the owners of the plane is: Sophor Property Holdings </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/7OfKLlI.png">https://i.imgur.com/7OfKLlI.png</a> </p>

<p>No evidence is provided that Rybolovlev is involved with this company. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s undeniable that the Trump team, Trump and Rybolovlev were all at this tiny Charlotte, NC airport parking lot/TARMAC (tiny in comparison to Heathrow or LAX) on the same day the week before the election date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Charlotte airport is not tiny even in relation to LAX, its smaller. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of 2015, it was the 6th busiest airport in the United States, ranked by passenger traffic and by aircraft movements.[4] Charlotte is the largest airport in the United States without nonstop service to Asia. The airport serves as a major gateway to the Caribbean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Douglas_International_Airport">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Douglas_International_Airport</a></p>

<p>But lets grant for the sake of the argument that it was  Rybolovlev in that plane.   There is no evidence that he met Trump or talked to him.  </p>

<p>But lets even grant that they meet together... they have a recent business history together.</p>

<p>To try to link this to Lynch who has the power to prosecute Clinton with meeting with Bill somewhere should strike everyone as absurd. The conflict of interest is apparent. </p>

<p>As someone who is not a Trump supporter I think we should heed Greenwalds words carefully  when he said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes time to expose actual Trump corruption and criminality, who is going to believe the people and institutions who have demonstrated they are willing to endorse any assertions no matter how factually baseless, who deploy any journalistic tactic no matter how unreliable and removed from basic means of ensuring accuracy?</p>

<p>You&#39;re one of my favorite users axolotl, but I feel like all the mods here are missing the point if they think Hitlery-brigades should be free to spam this sub with retarded pro-establishment trash comments. Because more or less discussion is dead due to them, and it&#39;s been like this for months. Real users aren&#39;t going to stay forever if the Hitlery-trash paid for by David Brock continues to have free reign to spam and harass actual users of the sub.</p>

<p>The MSM, to my knowledge, does not use <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as a resource.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and then suppress any other attempted threads. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This thread is at the top of the sub now. It&#39;s not being suppressed. You&#39;re not a victim here.</p>

<p>Your original thread&#39;s title stated, unequivocally, that these two individuals met. The content of your post does <em>not</em> prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>

<p>Bullshit conspiracies get routinely submitted and downvoted to oblivion. They aren&#39;t worthy of flairs or moderation.</p>

<p>However, if a post from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> hits <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> with a misleading title, it automatically qualifies for greater scrutiny from the mods.</p>

<p>These two things aren&#39;t mutually exclusive...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to know why it matters that he met with this person.  What if his intentions were to try and reverse the current mood and tension between Obama and Russia? </p>

<p>This whole notion that Russia is somehow the bad guys is laughable.  The US has done more intervention and nation building than anyone else, yet Democrats seem to enjoy antagonizing Putin.  </p>

<p>US created ISIS and they blew into Syria. For that Putin defends his ally.  US would do the same. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so sad when we lose sight of the fact that Russia is a better friend than foe.  As one commentator said;  even at the height of the cold war there was still dialog.  Obama and his cuckery seemed to throw that all away for reasons that he wanted to support the rise of the muslim brotherhood.   </p>

<p>Trump probably wanted to assure the oligarchs that a friend would soon be back in power.  Nothing wrong with that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol dude, you realize that meeting a rich Russian dude makes complete sense for a rich American dude, and so does one selling the other a house... What worries you so much about their meeting? I&#39;m glad Trump has ties with Russians, he won&#39;t be outright hostile to Russia for no reason like a bunch of our politicians. I&#39;m not even talking about the current bout of hysterics, rewind to 2012. Our leadership tends to &quot;other&quot; Russia. It&#39;s always bothered me. I was very worried about Mitt Romney in 2012 for this reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plane right next to it arrived that day, for a few hours, belonged to Dmitry.  </p>

<p>Where&#39;s the picture of both planes next to each other? And if such a picture exist, why isn&#39;t there speculation that he met everyone else from all the planes around where he was parked?<br/>
For example, <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwYUx2KXUAArRoO.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwYUx2KXUAArRoO.jpg</a>, who&#39;s the owner of the tiny ass plane? Hasn&#39;t he met with that person?  </p>

<p>Trump team may have met with Russian billionaire and businessman Dmitry Rybolovlev, on November 3rd. A week before the election. Undeniable proof ignored by MSM... but if so, why did he meet Rybolovlev on that day?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Undeniable proof that they <strong>may have</strong> met?<br/>
And why do you immediately go to saying &quot;why did he meet&quot; as if that&#39;s been proven?<br/>
&quot;Why would he have met&quot; could make sense grammatically, because before asking why they met, you have to kinda demonstrate they did.</p>

<p>Seriously? That’s how you’re going to try and argue this? How about maybe because non of the other people at the Airport, on those planes, are Billionaire Russian Oligarchs with power and influence? How about non of those people are important. Huh, did you consider that? Did you try to use critical thinking at all?</p>

<p>If we found out Silvio Berlusconi also had a plane parked there, we may speculate that he met Trump as well, but not the RyanAir budget airline passengers on the next plane over. Use your brain ffs.</p>

<p>So, he meets a guy who bought a house off him. Is the guy supposed to have given him something? He&#39;s a fucking multibillionaire running for President, the only way for some Russian spy who now apparently exerts massive influence over a man richer and more powerful than him is to meet in person?

    <div class="md"><p>No... you are the one lying. It doesn&#39;t matter where Ivanka was, Trump did 2 rallies in NC on Nov 3rd. One in Concord and one in Selma. His plane landed in Selma that evening - where Rybolovlev&#39;s plane took off after but this doesn&#39;t matter. But his plane in the morning, was in Charlotte NC airport (it is too big to fit into Concord airport, see the pic of it at Charlotte airport, you can see the NC national guard building in the background) which is a 20-30 min drive from where his rally was held. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you are lying. Need I post pics of my abysmally low bank account? Who is paying YOU to lie?</p>

<p>Compare the pic of the NC guard building to the imgur links provided with donalds plane: </p>

<p>Anyway, Trump may very well have connections to Russia but to what extent is the real question. It&#39;s obvious though that US state propaganda is overestimating Russian influence on the selection... err.. I mean election.

<p>The first I was of this was as the #20 post on all. No politics &quot;brigade&quot;, despite the fact that anti-Clinton conspiracies are often based on more dubious evidence and are never touched. </p>

<p>All I see on my travels through all from this sub is anti-clinton, BS pizzagate shit. SHE LOST, GET OVER IT! I bet you&#39;ve used that a few times recently, eh mods?</p>

<p>That&#39;s twice now that anti-Trump rhetoric has been targeted by the mod staff. It&#39;s almost as if there&#39;s a conspiracy...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, stop trolling.</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/27/news/donald-trump-russian-deal-mansion/">In a 2004 auction, Trump snapped up the property from Gosman&#39;s Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Estate for $41 million, according to property records.</a></p>

<p>During the 4 year period, property prices were rising quickly. Assuming Trump made a decent deal, as he is known to do, puts some money into and flips it when the market peaks.</p>

<p>In such a situation, depending on how much he spent renovating it, he makes somewhere under $50m. </p>

<p>That represents .... 0.5% of his wealth. So 0.5% made from sales to Russia, and 99.5% made doing the exact same shit elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now, it is a nice deal and I&#39;m sure he enjoyed it. But...</p>

<p>He bought it at an auction. He didn&#39;t pay market price. He sold it at the peak of the market. </p>

<p>So, we aren&#39;t talking about getting $50m out of nowhere. You compare today&#39;s market value, but he CAN&#39;T get profit. </p>

<p>Neither can millions of other home owners. In fact, millions that bought at the peak had their homes foreclosed on. Others, who could keep them, CAN&#39;T get profit either.</p>

<p>Trump on Nov. 3 was not a public figure, had top notch security but needed to meet this Russian in person because ....</p>

<p>The important thing is WHY?</p>

<p>Why with the media hounding him about Russia and the best privacy money can buy, a huge staff, and a very public schedule with crowds meeting his plane would he give up everything for some random Russian?</p>

<p>A Russian who &quot;did not make any other trips to North Carolina <strong>in recent history</strong>&quot;. Wow, so you&#39;re a law student, eh?</p>

<p>Very cunning use of language. So, this Random Russian has been there before not too long ago. Gotcha.</p>

<p>Hmmm:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The realtor who sold the house has stated that he never move...the Chinese do it all the time!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t know if this is a clever play on words, such as he&#39;s been renting it, but (haha) he never moved in, or is just you providing a common example of what rich Chinese people do (I say this married to a woman from China): overpay and never move in?</p>

<p>This is one of my favourites:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump&#39;s son made 6 trips in 18 months to Russia before 2008–then a Russian oligarch showers Trump with $95M.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The opportunities for lawyerize abound. But let&#39;s go to the most striking. You go from just basic he bought it at auction for fair market price (he wouldn&#39;t), didn&#39;t renovate (he wouldn&#39;t), watch the property market increase by 55%, and then sold it for $95m, making a profit of $32m more than the worst case scenario and that becomes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a Russian oligarch showers Trump with $95M.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well done. </p>

<p>why?</p>

<p>because the only thing you could prove, was 100% FALSE, i..e when you make a cornerstone of a person meeting someone in a country...</p>

<p>then it&#39;s revealed that person has never even TRAVELLED to that place (prague)</p>

His family was in Italy at the time (sources have shown his daughters instagram there at the time of the supposed meeting.) He could have gone across borders and not been stamped, as that is how travel works once you&#39;re in the EU. Besides he only showed the cover of his passport as proof... have you ever flown?

<p>But from what I can see that picture of Trumps plane in the OP was not taken at the NC Airport... if you cross reference the two there is no way you can make them match up... NC only has a very small area with the &quot;parking lot&quot; lines painted on the pavement... and none of that area has the same configuration of Air Traffic Tower -&gt; Tree -&gt; Hangar -&gt; Tarmac as is seen in this photo.</p>

<p>The theory that they were both there at roughly the same time holds up... but the fact that the picture of Trump&#39;s plane was added in as some &quot;bonus photographic evidence&quot; detracts from the narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So folks, the proof that the plane is connected to a Russian oligarch is this:</p>

<p>We see this is false in several ways.</p>

<p>First the airplane belongs to Saphor Property Holdings a company from the British Virgin Islands</p>

<p>And Secondly it is not a 25 seat plane rather it is a 142 seat plane.</p>

<p>Evidence is here: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In June 2010, Rybolovlev sold a 53% shareholding in Uralkali to a group of Russian investors: Kaliha Finance Limited (Suleiman Kerimov, 25%), Aerellia Investments Limited (Alexander Nesis, 15%) and Becounioco Holdings Limited (Filaret Galchev, 13.2%).[24] The transaction price was not disclosed, but was reported to be around US$5.3 billion.</p>

<p>In December 2010, Uralkali announced plans to buy potash producer, Silvinit and form one of the world&#39;s largest potash producers.[25] The merger was finalized in July 2011, Rybolovlev had already sold the remaining 10% of his shares of Uralkali to a company owned by Alexander Nesis in April 2011.</p>

<p>&quot;A year earlier, when Rybolovlev’s future at Uralkali looked like blue sky, the company’s financial report for the six months to June 30, 2009, had reported: “On 27 January 2009, the Group acquired a 100% stake in the share capital of Sophar Property Holding Inc., the only identifiable asset of which as of the date of acquisition was a contract for the purchase of a corporate business jet. The total purchase consideration for the acquired subsidiary of RR 753 [million](US$ 23,196,232) was equal to the net fair value of this contract. At 30 June 2009, the Group paid in cash RR 462 [million]; the outstanding amount of RR 291 [million] was included in other payables.” In other words, Rybolovev had arranged for Uralkali to start paying for his new toy on an instalment plan. How much more Sophar’s aircraft-buying on Rybolovlev’s behalf was to cost Uralkali was not reported then – or later.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder of those three million votes what number wasn&#39;t a result of ballot stuffing and busing in illegal immigrants over the border to vote. The Midwest states (my home state of Michigan among them) remember what it was like to have jobs in their region, they remember what it was like to earn a livable wage independent of government assistance which only gives enough crumbs to quit them, they remember what life was like before NAFTA of which Bill Clinton signed, sealed, and delivered to the moneyed interest. The trade deal that ruined their lives and opportunity, they knew full well that Hillary Clinton would usher in the equally if not more destructive TPP and wanted nothing to do with it, and so, they went with man who said he would (and did) destroy the TPP, restructure NAFTA, and give them back their lives.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I voted for him and that&#39;s why he won. Now we&#39;ll see where this goes.&quot;.</p>

According to the flight history of Dmitry&#39;s plane, he had left Concord and flew to Charlotte well before Trump would have arrived.</p>

<p>Trump had an earlier speech at Noon EST in Florida. After his speech in Concord, he left immediately for another speech. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see some more evidence. At least with Bill and Loretta we had local news leaking the pictures, which led to the national news being forced to talk about it.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s real estate sale to Dmitry was already talked about in the news back in July, 2016. Looking into Dmitry&#39;s history it appears that he was trying hide a lot of money from his wife whom he went through a very messy divorce. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11946463/The-most-expensive-divorce-in-history-ends-after-Russian-billionaire-reaches-deal-with-ex-wife.html">According to the Telegraph</a>, the divorce started in 2008.</p>

<p>Did you even read the news last year? No one covered the human trafficking, the Russian money laundering connections, the mob connections. No one in mainstream media. The information was all there, but even MSNBC rolled over and spread their legs for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human trafficking wasn&#39;t able to be tied to Trump, Russian money laundering claims were suspect but no hard evidence, and mob connections were there. Definitely. But no evidence, even circumstantial evidence other than their connection. All are fishy for sure. You saw what happened when they put out ONE thing that was unverifiable and look what happened. </p>

<p>Point being, the media WAS in the tank for Hillary, but they wouldn&#39;t touch it because all of those are pretty serious so they need hard evidence. So something as simple as meeting a Russian billionaire that would be verifiable and make him look worse, would have been easy to substantiate if called on it. That story would have hit the airwaves quickly, especially with how much press his last minute stops in close states got. </p>

Even now, the most liberal stations are downplaying the words of our intelligence community in his favor.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow is this story going to blow up when the MSM gets it&#39;s teeth into it.  Doesn&#39;t seem to be any evidence of who met with who at the airport but there is sure a lot of smoke.</p>

<p>I disagree with your comment on &#39;history with suspicious real estate deals&quot;. Trump wouldn&#39;t be the first nor will he be the last to make a massive profit off a high value property. Sure bribing people could involve real estate purchases but that deal happened 10 years ago...what did Trump do for Russia to give him millions way back then?  You can&#39;t be implying Russia owns Trump and has owned him for 10 years now...are you?  I don&#39;t think Trump has given much value to Russia in all those years.</p>

<p>So far I only suspect a meeting. Trump meets lots of very rich people. This one is Russian. Difficult to make the leap to Election rigging and Quid Pro quo.  Good story to investigate however!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All governments understand that the transfer of power is a very critical and important time for a country. Reporting that Russia was supporting Trump was undermining his legitimacy. If evidence that Trump met with a Russian Billionaire piled on top of that you could honestly get worried some 5 star General might surround Washington DC and take Trump into custody prior to the inauguration. I know people will find that &#39;crazy&#39; but it happens all over the world and Russia has been the big scary boogy man for Americans since WWII. The military is serious about it&#39;s concern that Russia helped Trump win and if they suspect Trump is still connected to Russia they will implement already made plans to impose martial law and take control of the government.  Yes, they have made those plans.</p>

<p>I&#39;m doubting it. Generally the MSM doesn&#39;t spend time on stories that take more than 60 seconds to explain and involve more than 2 &quot;connections.&quot; You&#39;d think given the 24 hour cycle they&#39;d have time, but I think they just deem things like this too complex for the average viewer.</p>

<p>Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Monaco-based fertilizer king has a net worth estimated at $7.7 billion. In 2008, he bought a 17-bedroom Florida mansion, pretentiously named “Maison l’Amite,”or the Friendly House, from Trump for $95 million. </p>

<p>Now he says he wants to tear down the Friendly House, reportedly due to a mold problem, at a cost of $234,000. </p>

<p>Possibly owing to his divorce woes, Rybolovlev later told a court during a deposition that he didn’t even own the house. Trump replied in the press that “somebody paid me $100 million” for it.</p>

<p>I have a dream, and it&#39;s that when I wake up tomorrow, both Trump and Clinton are charged for their crimes and corruption. Meanwhile, the Democrats and Republicans realized they were all compromised, greedy assholes and decided that, for the good of the country, they&#39;re inaugurating Kasich and Sanders on Friday. In a quiet, non-denominational (I just Freudian-sliptyped non-<em>demoninational</em>) ceremony, at Camp David, and no one&#39;s leaving their posts just yet.</p>

I encourage everyone to search for the answers yourself. OP seems to be onto something BIG. Read into the details. Read between the lines.</p>

<p>P.S. Coming from +5 years at Reddit, it was clear as day that thread was being brigaded.. Last week was pushed so hard that they were easily called out. This last thread was a bit different, they learned.. They were trying to mask the manipulation. STAY WOKE.</p>

Also interesting to note: Trump&#39;s son made 6 trips in 18 months to Russia before 2008–then a Russian oligarch showers Trump with $95M. The realtor who sold the house has stated that he never moved in.</p>

What worries you so much about their meeting? I&#39;m glad Trump has ties with Russians, he won&#39;t be outright hostile to Russia for no reason like a bunch of our politicians. I&#39;m not even talking about the current bout of hysterics, rewind to 2012. Our leadership tends to &quot;other&quot; Russia. It has always bothered me. I was very worried about Mitt Romney in 2012 for this reason. You guys don&#39;t realize it, but you sound like McCain, Fiorina, all those twats. Do you really look up to them?</p>

I just started reading the Art of the Deal and in the first 30 pages or something he already talks about a project right across from the Kremlin that he was going to do in cooperation with the (at the time) Soviet government.. So he has had contacts there for a long time. And come on, Trump making a profit off of a house he sells is something he is very good at. He does this all the time with whomever I don&#39;t think its necessarily money laundering like you&#39;re assuming. What I do agree on though is that Trump&#39;s relationship with certain people from Russia goes back further than he&#39;d like to have you believe. But again, I don&#39;t see why this even matters - whats so bad about Russia? I think he&#39;s only denying the relationship he has because the media is making Russia out to be the new big evil all of a sudden..</p>

<p>OP has presented some interesting circumstantial evidence and half the supposed free-thinkers on here are dismissing it out of hand without even questioning it!</p>

<p>They’re immediately jumping in to back up and support the most powerful man in the world. </p>

<p>Usually the members of this sub talk openly and freely about these issues, about the corruption of the government, of our officials, of our presidents, but when it comes to Trump why does everyone have his back? Why aren’t you guys even trying to question him?</p>

<p>It sure seems like <em>everyone</em>, or at least the red-blooded <em>majority</em> by and far does have his back, doesn&#39;t it? Perhaps that&#39;s why he will be the next US President on Friday (Tomorrow. Wow!)</p>

<p>How about this imagine if 20% of the other 100&#39;s of conspiracies ran through here are true. That&#39;s why. That&#39;s why nobody seems to care about circumstantial evidence of airplanes at the same airport during a period of time when Trump and his every move was <strong>heavily monitored and documented</strong> by both MSM and sitting government.  You really think if they met, or even head-nodded a &quot;wassup?&quot; to each other <strong>a week before the US Election</strong> that CNN wouldn&#39;t <strong>still</strong> be running that story 24x7? </p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m aware of the term population density. I went to school and have learned some of the best words and terms. Have you heard of the term illegal alien? Do you believe that one or two... million of them happened to have cast a ballot? Were you sober while democrats were getting busted for fraudulently registering (dead) people to vote on multiple occasions? We&#39;ll never know the actual count of illegal or deceased voters, because, certain people seem to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-push-back-against-voter-id-laws/">lobby against voter integrity</a> even though that <em><a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/poll-8-in-10-back-voter-id/article/2565542">popular vote</a></em> you prize so much, would prefer we have them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does this specifically demonstrate Trump&#39;s connections to Putin? You do realize that <em>every</em> real estate investor worth their salt was investing in Russian properties in the 00s, right? It was even encouraged. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also interesting to note: Trump&#39;s son made 6 trips in 18 months to Russia before 2008–then a Russian oligarch showers Trump with $95M.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before he had political ambitions. Again -- this proves what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump team may have met with Russian billionaire and businessman Dmitry Rybolovlev, on November 3rd. A week before the election. Undeniable proof ignored by MSM... but if so, why did he meet Rybolovlev on that day?
We have pictures of this (see bottom of this post). Trump was scheduled for a rally in Charlotte, NC and parked his private jet in a small airport. The plane right next to it arrived that day, for a few hours, belonged to Dmitry. Since real-time GPS tracking of Trump&#39;s plane is disabled, we would not have known if someone hadn&#39;t taken pictures of it, that it was there on November 3rd. There were ALSO flight records of Rybolovlev&#39;s plane being there, as well as pics.
Why did the mainstream media not report this? He met with a Russian oligarch 5 days before the election. It is a very small airport. Rybolovlev did not make any other trips to North Carolina in recent history, just on that day. Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it were dirt on Trump it would&#39;ve been picked up by MSM.</p>

<p>The important question is what <em>you</em> think happened and why you&#39;re faking puzzlement while clearly implying that Trump is...conspiring with Putin through some thirdhand real estate investor. </p>

<p>&quot;Long before he became the 2016 Republican presidential front-runner, Trump snapped up the mansion at 515 N. County Road in 2004 at a court-ordered auction for $41.4 million. He then renovated the property before selling it to fertilizer mogul Dmitry Rybolovlev in July 2008, five months before the Great Recession hit Palm Beach.&quot;</p>

<p>This is important because we can see that ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In June 2010, Rybolovlev sold a 53% shareholding in Uralkali to a group of Russian investors: Kaliha Finance Limited (Suleiman Kerimov, 25%), Aerellia Investments Limited (Alexander Nesis, 15%) and Becounioco Holdings Limited (Filaret Galchev, 13.2%).[24] The transaction price was not disclosed, but was reported to be around US$5.3 billion.</p>

<p>In December 2010, Uralkali announced plans to buy potash producer, Silvinit and form one of the world&#39;s largest potash producers.[25] The merger was finalized in July 2011, Rybolovlev had already sold the remaining 10% of his shares of Uralkali to a company owned by Alexander Nesis in April 2011.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So our Russian oligarch already sold his share before the jet was even delivered...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been browsing this sub daily for years. Never before have I seen blatant favoritism of a politician. Any time anything trump related shows up, the mods do their best to lighten the narrative. </p>

<p>And then anyone critical of trump is a shill or from CTR. </p>

<p>Open your eyes. This is simply an anti Hillary sub (whom I also dislike)</p>

<p>This sub needs to stop taking sides on issues. </p>
