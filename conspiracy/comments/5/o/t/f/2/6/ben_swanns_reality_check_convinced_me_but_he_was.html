    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing, in this case you can&#39;t. It all could be still a massive coincidence and misunderstanding. But there has to be something going on, I get that weird Jimmy Saville vibe with this conspiracy. Especially with Podesta. Our only hope is video or photo evidence <strong>or</strong> enough victims that come forward. And that&#39;s the thing that also makes me kind of sceptical...why has no one accused Podesta yet? If this conspiracy is true there should be hundreds of victims...</p>

<p>Before that video I thought Pizzagate was utter bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did it take Ben Swanns &quot;reality check&quot; to convince you?  He just laid out the very basics of the evidence.  Why don&#39;t you just research the information on your own, that&#39;s the only way to make up your mind on a subject. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take long (after researching) to see that there is major substance to the accusations.  John and Tony Podesta hardly even hide the fact that that they are into children (and hurting them) if you just look into it. Their taste in artwork is a pretty big giveaway for example.  So many shady people have connections that run through comet/podesta it isn&#39;t even funny.</p>

<p>what Pizzagate is</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>specifically / originally:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>pizzagate was born from an online, collaborative examination/investigation of &quot;the podesta&quot; emails @ wikielaks.org, where john podesta discusses &quot;pizza&quot;, &quot;cheese&quot; and &quot;pasta&quot; in truly odd and even creepy context -- that led many to suspect these words were codewords related to pedophilia -- which led to the discovery of 1000&#39;s of pedophilia related twitter (ref: twittergate, when jack dorsey&#39;s own account was accidentally shutdown in twitter&#39;s &quot;rushed&quot;, anti-pedo sweep) and instagram accounts (including those of james alefantis, of comet ping pong, which is widely believed to be a showcasing and staging area of children for high-profile washington dc political pedophiles)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>broadly:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>pizzagate has come to represent the exposure of a global child trafficking (for rape and organ harvesting) ring that is currently blackmailing and extorting a majority of &quot;elite&quot; political figures - worldwide.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>how a seemingly innocuous triangle symbol could possibly indicate so much.</p>

<p><strong>it&#39;s much more than triangle logos:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ng1qb/for_all_the_new_people_and_shills_in_rconspiracy/"><strong>#pizzagate</strong></a> (aka #pedogate) is the new 9/11 rabbit hole -- i.e., yes, it&#39;s all (mostly) true -- and yes, difficult to swallow.  But yes...  it&#39;s very real -- i.e., there are real children who are being trafficked, raped and murdered right now through these channels., right now. </p>

<p>And it needs to be stopped.</p>
