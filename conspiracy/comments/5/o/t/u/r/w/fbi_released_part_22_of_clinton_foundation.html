        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Pdf file can be found here: <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/william-j.-clinton-foundation/william-j.-clinton-foundation-part-02-of-02/view">https://vault.fbi.gov/william-j.-clinton-foundation/william-j.-clinton-foundation-part-02-of-02/view</a></p>

<p>On pages 505-506, basically the only two pages that were not redacted. It seems at first as bunch of crazy gibberish, but what stood out to me were the repetitive mention of Stevia and FDA.</p>

<p>So I started looking into that.
In 1994 FDA denied Stevia for commercial use as &quot;artificial sweetener.&quot; Someone lost a lot of money right there. BTW Japan has been using stevia since 1970 as such. </p>

<p>In 1994 Bill Clinton was our President, but what matters the most is who he appointed for US Drug and Food Administration, the agency overseeing FDA.</p>

<p>This guy: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_R._Taylor#US_Food_and_Drug_Administration.2C_1991-1994">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_R._Taylor#US_Food_and_Drug_Administration.2C_1991-1994</a></p>

<p>As you can see he advanced rather quickly. </p>

<p>Now, why is this important. </p>

<p>Well Montesanto is of course not going to roll over for some new artificial sweetener that is 200 times sweeter than sugar, a natural plant , that is very easy to grow...</p>

<p>You guessed it, our man Mr Taylor From 1981 - 1991 worked in private law practice at King &amp; Spalding, one client of which was the biotechnology company Monsanto.[3] He established and led the firm&#39;s food and drug law practice.[1][2]</p>

<p>Do I need to go deeper? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my first post here, since I was never huge conspiracy guy. However this connection that appears as neglected by the FBI is somewhat troubling to me. </p>

<p>First, some dude sends three envelopes with white substance and one of them is Clinton foundation.</p>

<p>He mentions Stevia and FDA in terms that leave no doubts that someone is seriously &quot;butt hurt&quot; about it.</p>

<p>The connection is very easy to make and of course it leads to Clintons... Like wtf?? No body goes and looks deeper into it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, I&#39;m relatively new here too.  It&#39;s cool to stumble upon something like you have.  Great post man, I hope it takes off! It should be investigated. Check out the sidebar and you&#39;ll see alot of stuff that is very troubling in the &quot;List of Confirmed Conspiracies&quot;.  Anyway, keep posting!  This sub needs more insight that is well thought out and mind stimulating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, this was me just out of pure curiosity looking into what the hell that dude was talking about. Montesanto gave nice donations to Clintons just as a side note. What prompted someone to go off the deep end is usually the secret someone wanted to keep deep down under the rug...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. I say keep giving er. </p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely all about money. Why would they allow us to have something cheaper and healthier (I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s healthier than the chemical sweeteners)? </p>

<p>Sorry for being off topic, but was that a FUBAR quote (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98LirWo82M&amp;amp;t=0m19s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p98LirWo82M&amp;amp;t=0m19s</a>), or are you Canadian?</p>

<p>Anyway - agree - it&#39;s <em>always</em> about the money.</p>

<p>I used to smoke, then vaping became popular, so I switched. And now I watch Big Tobacco&#39;s attempts at killing off anything that isn&#39;t their cig-a-like products. Fuckers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, yes, I&#39;m Canadian. Good catch. </p>

<p>I used to smoke and vap as well. The tobacco companies definitely put out some fake studies on vaping to try to dissuade people back to cigs. It worked on some people. </p>
