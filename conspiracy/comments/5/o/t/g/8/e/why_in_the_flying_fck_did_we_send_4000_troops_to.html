        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Mine was when this guy that looked like my brother returned from his second tour in Iraq.<br/>
When he joked/hinted that there were no WMDs, that it was all based on lies after his first tour the sheeple wanted to stone him so he was/is a critical thinker absolutely.<br/>
We argued about him going on his second tour, I say &quot;argued&quot; but mean &quot;raged&quot; at each other, well, I RAGED at him.<br/>
I screamed that he knew it was b<em>llshit, that he&#39;d done his time, that every day of every time he went I hung on hooks waiting for the call that some kid with an average throw caught his rotor just right and that I needed to buy a black dress.<br/>
Too calmly for my liking, he explained that he&#39;d just heard that some kid fresh out of flight school had gone down, been killed because he didn&#39;t have the time, the experience flying in the desert, that its different in the desert, that he had that experience. That if he didn&#39;t go back they&#39;d send another kid...that he&#39;d couldn&#39;t risk some other kid.<br/>
He argued that yea, he knew it was b</em>llshit but that if he didn&#39;t go, if they didn&#39;t somehow succeed in establishing a democracy in some form that it would have all been for nothing, all his dead friends, all the dead...would have been for nothing, would stand for nothing and he couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t accept/allow that to happen.<br/>
I said/screamed back that it would better that I lose my brother? that somehow that would what? right everything? bring people back? mend broken hearts, people and families?<br/>
I said/screamed that it wouldn&#39;t, that I refused to sacrifice my brother to some made up b<em>llshit based on lies.<br/>
I threatened to break his knee/knees with a baseball bat, making it impossible to fly his decades old huey.<br/>
I explained/growled that I loved him enough for him to hate me, hate me forever if need be to keep him here, give him a shot at a  life.<br/>
We watched each other, he knew I meant it absolutely and I saw that it had no effect at all.<br/>
He was too invested, had lost too many brothers, seen too much, done too much.<br/>
He knew it was b</em>llshit but for the ones that gave all he&#39;d made a pledge and it didn&#39;t involve me or politics or right or wrong so he went back.<br/>
He came home again or rather a shadow of him did, this guy that looked vaguely like my brother except his eyes were darker and a gray veil seemed to shadow his face. He was filled with anger, rage, his laugh was hollow and never reached his eyes, didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t need or want any help with anything, he&#39;s good, oorah.
My brother was the only person I ever truly trusted to keep me safe and now he scares me, I&#39;m afraid of him, can&#39;t be around him.<br/>
I lost my brother in a b*llshit war based on lies.<br/>
They twisted his honor, his integrity and used it against him.<br/>
They broke my brother&#39;s heart, his soul with their lies.    </p>

<p>I should have used the bat, there still was some of him left in there, I should have...    </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want anyone else to lose a brother or a sister, a son or a daughter, a mother or a father or a friend to lies...to b*llshit.    </p>

<p>G<em>D D</em>MN IT this sh<em>t has to stop.... go</em>d d*mn it.          </p>

<p>EDIT-grammar   EDIT2 - logged in this has 198 points, logged out it has 204...huh??  EDIT3 - finished EDIT2 went to 205....weird, weird stuff, maybe its just me and mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you fully and am sorry for what you have experienced. All I can offer is that I wholeheartedly agree that this Red Scare 2.0 is 100% complete bullshit that is soooo fucking obvious that it hurts when people actually fall for it. I think more and more people are waking up and realizing that this &quot;reality&quot; that we have been fed is bullshit. We are starting to think for ourselves again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice is hard for me, when it happens it actually kind of hurts, I blame this on being brought up by cops and Marines (shudder right?) lol<br/>
Anger feels better to me than despair but thank you for the kind words/thoughts.<br/>
What I really want, what the little girl/little sister hiding inside this forty-five year old broad really, really wants is my brother back, I want my brother back. (more jaw clenching)(deep breath)    </p>

<p>I agree that people are more aware I just don&#39;t want it to be &quot;awareness&quot; of &quot;business as usual&quot; and all of us that learned this lesson, can see it happening again just letting it happen, again.    </p>

<p>Why have we been in Yemen with no apparent reason since what 2006? Why are we in what over thirty African countries with no good reason? Why is the supposed democratic beacon of the world killing thousands with drone strikes without even the appearance of due process or evidence or conscious?!<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I have this friend that had a massive psychotic episode which resulted in him making several cuts from wrist to elbow on both arms in his first failed attempt, subsequently being diagnosed with bipolar disorder then ten years later his second attempt was swallowing every bottle of his prescribed medication which resulted in several weeks in a coma.<br/>
So when I meet this guy years after all of this, he was off his meds and manic but I couldn&#39;t tell.<br/>
I kept saying how much he was like my brother, how my brother used to joke that he was on the &quot;monorail&quot; in terms of thinking speed and I was on an ole rickety steam train or something.<br/>
He kept saying &quot;I think your brother might be bi-polar, there&#39;s different kinds, some have big highs and lows, some are elevated for longer, like guys that can get into flight school, helicopter school,  I think he&#39;s crazier than you think...&quot;<br/>
I was like &quot;...wait...&quot; and he was like &quot;you&#39;re used to it....can keep up with him...follow him...&quot;
Here&#39;s the thing...the whole &quot;kicker&quot;...my friend? he was in the navy, his first &quot;episode&quot; was the year of or year after he got out, he was one of those guys in the secret room that even the captain needs clearance to get into....and yea, my brother, in since &#39;91 and two tours...<br/>
In the short time I could still be around him, when he got back, he told me that the only thing that kept him from suicide was my sister and me. Somehow in his head his job was to keep up safe, he had to stay for us but that if it were up to him he wouldn&#39;t be, that he could see it, looking up at us from a hole in the ground crying and he couldn&#39;t stand that, wouldn&#39;t be the cause of it.<br/>
I responded that being draped in a flag wouldn&#39;t make it any easier.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing stories ... Thank you for taking the time and effort to write them all out! It most certainly hasn&#39;t been in vain, as I hope to chime in with my very similar experiences and potentially offer some more insight and closure.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in the military myself, albeit not very long, in an allied NATO army. I merely went through the first year of the army officer&#39;s military academy, but became gravely ill after what I believe was a round of vaccines of which I was never told the contents. All I remember was getting food poisoning like symptoms almost instantly, shivering like crazy in the middle of a summer heathwave and lying awake delerious for entire nights just prior to getting sent out to an advanced training camp. I never dared to see a doctor about that, since I thought it would be considered as &quot;showing weakness&quot;, which was pure lunacy because it literally cost me my career. Compounded by the systemic sleep deprivation so typical for anything concerning a military regime, it sent me overboard faster than any 17 y/o kid could ever figure out what the hell was going on. </p>

<p>Almost overnight I was turned into a disfunctional hollow shadow of myself, barely cognizant, weak, agitated and fearful, as if I had just received a chemical lobotomy. </p>

<p>To make a long story short: flunked out very soon after that, never returned to baseline mentally/physically/cognitively, developped severe skin problems, lost my hair, spiralled in and out of suicidal depressions, even became manic and psychotic once and was branded bipolar. The psych meds they fed me were making me even worse and it took years to quit them and to recover to a barely functional level. </p>

<p>Just a few months ago, I saw an interview with an army nurse who did nothing but vaccinate soldiers for years on end just around the first Gulf War. She was crying out her eyeballs asking for forgiveness, because she knew that certain vaccines had lethal effects on a much more common basis than was being admitted to. She tried to tell a superior and he said to never ever bring it up again if she valued her career in the military. Very shortly after, she was sent to a psych unit for evaluation, wanted out but wasn&#39;t allowed to, got demoted and was basically kept in the mil. for another year or so being put through very demeaning situations that were obviously serving as a form of punishment. </p>

<p>She went on by saying that she believes that some vaccines are meant to make sure veterans don&#39;t live long into retirement age, merely to diminish the cost of their upkeep, like senior working dogs being put down because they serve no real purpose anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sister actually lol, and I agree.<br/>
I get &quot;sparked&quot; with sending our military personnel anywhere without proof though, I&#39;d prefer a smaller military and a different set of leaders and guiding principles.    </p>

<p>&quot;Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story....&quot;<br/>
&quot;Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism...&quot;<br/>
&quot;And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should....&quot;<br/>
&quot;With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.&quot;    </p>

Uhm, ok...do this, read anything other than msm, use your critical thinking skills and try to suss out whether having troops in Poland is to &quot;help&quot; in Crimea or screw with the ever and always scary Putin/Russia in order to fit/bolster tptb red scare b.s. narrative and possibly provoke a response and war with Putin/Russia.<br/>
After that, read some more, then some more, think, then think some more, then think before you speak, then one more time and decide not to peddle you msm/tptb shill crap with me specifically, about this topic specifically......... mmkay??<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Again...justify why &quot;boots on the ground&quot; are required anywhere for anything.<br/>
We have the tech and the hardware to poke Putin&#39;s left eye out from a ship in the Persian Gulf.<br/>
Troop movements are ramping up tensions and hostilities and a dangerous &quot;mine is bigger than yours&quot; b.s. game.<br/>
We KNOW ours is bigger, so does he, he makes a move on Poland we can destroy his entire country and he knows that too.<br/>
Moving our troops within spitting distance is like actually paying attention to the lonely unf<em>ckable dbag at the end of the night in a now brightly lit bar.<br/>
I&#39;m more interested in why I need to justify questioning the msm narrative, or the government&#39;s and shut off my own critical thinking skills.<br/>
According to several well-respected &quot;sources&quot;  &quot;maybe&quot; some Yemeni troops thought it would be a great idea to fire on one of our ships, you know, the most powerful, well-armed military in the f</em>ck World.<br/>
Now, I look at that and think,<br/>
&quot;That seems odd, why would a country currently suffering untold death and destruction just randomly lob sh<em>t at us? Why when these people are currently under attack would they attack someone else? Why were we near Yemen to begin with? Why have we been using drone strikes in Yemen since 2006 without having any &quot;conflict&quot; or reason declared? Why would we, the same people who just sold the Yemen attackers, Saudi Arabia, billions of dollars worth of destroy-whole-country-materials, need a &quot;reason&quot; to be in the area, need to justify our ships off their coast? What&#39;s more reasonable to believe....that a couple of Yemeni troops lost their heads/possess balls the size of grapefruit, thought picking a fight with us was a great idea or that it was a b.s. story to justify us in the area and justify our future &quot;official&quot; involvement with Yemen&#39;s destruction??!!!<br/>
BBC and the Guardian ran the Yemen story too...<br/>
Long Story Short...there&#39;s no good G</em>D D*MN reason to send troops into Poland...none and our Government has lied and continues to lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.   </p>

<p>Some points to remember.   </p>

<p>-In 1939, the Russians invaded Poland. The brutal occupation that followed lasted for 50 years.<br/>
-In 2014, Russia annexed the Crimea. That is to say, they stole a large piece of territory from another country by force.<br/>
-Russia has shifted it&#39;s forces to their western border. Even with the American deployment, Russia has a lot more hardware along their northwestern border than NATO does.<br/>
-Russia moved their forced to the region <em>after</em> Russia did.<br/>
-You would have to be stunningly ignorant of reality to think that NATO was contemplating a land invasion of Russia via eastern Europe. </p>

Point - We have more hardware than NATO and Russia combined.<br/>

Point - We don&#39;t need &quot;boots on the ground&quot; anywhere to defend our friends and allies.<br/>
Point - If we have the tech/hardware to fight whole wars without personnel (i.e. Gulf War One) the movement of troops is nothing more than a &quot;p*ssing contest&quot; and agitation of an already hostile/delicate situation.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>OKAY...I&#39;ll repeat myself for the third and fourth time -<br/>
POINT - We can defend ANYBODY from several time zones away.<br/>
POINT - We &quot;won&quot; Gulf War One with tech and hardware not &quot;boots on the ground&quot;<br/>
POINT - The movement of troops this close to the Russian border is ABSOLUTELY/DEFINITELY poking a stick at a big bear and unnecessary (see the Second Point above) as WE have more hardware than NATO and Russia combined<br/>
QUERY - Please remember what help we offered Georgia or Crimea at any time in the past in terms of help with Russia which was &quot;F*CK ALL&quot; or rather no help at all, so again the question is &quot;Why now and not then....what could the effects of this be now and later and globally or financially and for whom and why....who benefits?&quot;<br/>
POINT - Moving this many troops to Russia in this way is AS dangerous plus some as the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br/>
QUERY - If Russia moved 4000 along the Mexican or Canadian border for whatever &quot;sheeple-pleasing&quot; innocuous or acceptable reason they came up with...how exactly would WE respond/feel? Would it improve a situation or send it off a cliff do you suppose?<br/>
REMARK - I don&#39;t believe that within this post nor in any of my responses have proven that I am &quot;stunningly ignorant&quot;, in fact, I think I asked some relevant questions and thought about this and the how and the why of it, a great deal more than most if some of the questions keep receiving such easy, obvious answers IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a difficult subject since there was a lot of support for that decision from inside Crimea.</p>

<p>Think of it this way, if one of Mexico&#39;s provinces (states? districts?) wanted to join the US, (held a public vote and it was decided that the majority wanted to join) but the Mexican government wouldn&#39;t allow it, would it be legal for the US to send troops to defend the decision of their new friends in the south? Perhaps having to fight opposition groups with force?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know man, but international politics is based on antiquated conventions (Westphalia for example). It&#39;s really difficult to determine if an outcome is right or wrong. All I know is that we shouldn&#39;t be invading countries based on the decisions of the few, or the frenzied masses, for the sake of resources or political power</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing your genius. I&#39;ve been trying to piece together the actual whole truth about Ukraine for years now. You described it in a way I couldn&#39;t for so long. I never considered the angle that Ukrainians have a hatred for the Russians living in their own country. It&#39;s so obvious though, Ukrainians constantly lament over Stalin&#39;s genocide against them. Stalin has little to do with present day Russia, however, so it is plainly an irrational hatred. Neo-Nazi is a fitting moniker. It helps validate the claims that easterners were fingered as traitors for protesting the new government, and casts light on the killing of 60 anti-maiden protesters in an arson.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly you know nothing other than what the mainstream media has fed you on that situation.</p>

<p>Crimea has wanted to join Russia for quite a while. Virtually every poll showed a majority. The US enacted &quot;the most blatant coup in history&quot; according to the head of Stratfor, and propped up fascists and neo-nazis such as the Svoboda Party which is very openly racist with a very long history going back to being Nazi collaborators.</p>

<p>The protests were roughly 30% comprised of these degenerates and there are videos of the violence they spread. They attacked ethnic Russians and just about anyone they felt like.</p>

<p>Of course, America has a special relationship reserved for fascists, as we&#39;ve seen in the 1930&#39;s and throughout Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. John McCain and the State Department met with the head of Svoboda. Giving legitimacy to a vicious racist.</p>

<p>Russia was right in this case, although it was grossly mishandled. Putin later admitted he sent troops to safeguard the ethnic Russian population, but if he had announced it to the world as it was happening then they would&#39;ve faced what you&#39;re doing and be accused of all sorts that really is just American projecting since they&#39;ve done far worse, whereas plausible deniability prevents that.</p>

<p>Also, people seem to forget the special relationship between Israel and Russia, due to the massive Russian-speaking population. That raises quite a few questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing.  I&#39;m sure many military men/women become invested too much in their patriotism/feelings for their fellow soldiers to be able to see what the USA has truly done over in Iraq.  We destroyed the country, created chaos and funded/trained Iraqi torture/death squads modeled on our Phoenix Program from Vietnam.  On top of that we installed a government which the country of Iraq did not want.</p>

<p>The USA at this point <em>needs</em> conflicts and wars to keep the taxpayers forking over Trillions into WAR, INC. (USA).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said anything about an invasion?<br/>
Point - We have more hardware than NATO and Russia combined.<br/>
Point - We don&#39;t have to be within five time zones to defend Poland.<br/>
Point - We don&#39;t need &quot;boots on the ground&quot; anywhere to defend our friends and allies.<br/>
Point - If we have the tech/hardware to fight whole wars without personnel (i.e. Gulf War One) the movement of troops is nothing more than a &quot;p*ssing contest&quot; and agitation of an already hostile/delicate situation.<br/>
Query - Who exactly is the &quot;You would have to be stunningly ignorant...&quot; comment directed towards?    </p>
