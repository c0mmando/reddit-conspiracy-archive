       Mine was when this guy that looked like my brother returned from his second tour in Iraq.
       <br/>
       When he joked/hinted that there were no WMDs, that it was all based on lies after his first tour the sheeple wanted to stone him so he was/is a critical thinker absolutely.
       <br/>
       We argued about him going on his second tour, I say "argued" but mean "raged" at each other, well, I RAGED at him.
       <br/>
       I screamed that he knew it was b
       <em>
        llshit, that he'd done his time, that every day of every time he went I hung on hooks waiting for the call that some kid with an average throw caught his rotor just right and that I needed to buy a black dress.
        <br/>
        Too calmly for my liking, he explained that he'd just heard that some kid fresh out of flight school had gone down, been killed because he didn't have the time, the experience flying in the desert, that its different in the desert, that he had that experience. That if he didn't go back they'd send another kid...that he'd couldn't risk some other kid.
        <br/>
        He argued that yea, he knew it was b
       </em>
       llshit but that if he didn't go, if they didn't somehow succeed in establishing a democracy in some form that it would have all been for nothing, all his dead friends, all the dead...would have been for nothing, would stand for nothing and he couldn't/wouldn't accept/allow that to happen.
       <br/>
       I said/screamed back that it would better that I lose my brother? that somehow that would what? right everything? bring people back? mend broken hearts, people and families?
       <br/>
       I said/screamed that it wouldn't, that I refused to sacrifice my brother to some made up b
       <em>
        llshit based on lies.
        <br/>
        I threatened to break his knee/knees with a baseball bat, making it impossible to fly his decades old huey.
        <br/>
        I explained/growled that I loved him enough for him to hate me, hate me forever if need be to keep him here, give him a shot at a  life.
        <br/>
        We watched each other, he knew I meant it absolutely and I saw that it had no effect at all.
        <br/>
        He was too invested, had lost too many brothers, seen too much, done too much.
        <br/>
        He knew it was b
       </em>
       llshit but for the ones that gave all he'd made a pledge and it didn't involve me or politics or right or wrong so he went back.
       <br/>
       He came home again or rather a shadow of him did, this guy that looked vaguely like my brother except his eyes were darker and a gray veil seemed to shadow his face. He was filled with anger, rage, his laugh was hollow and never reached his eyes, didn't/doesn't need or want any help with anything, he's good, oorah.
My brother was the only person I ever truly trusted to keep me safe and now he scares me, I'm afraid of him, can't be around him.
       <br/>
       I lost my brother in a b*llshit war based on lies.
       <br/>
       They twisted his honor, his integrity and used it against him.
       <br/>
       They broke my brother's heart, his soul with their lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should have used the bat, there still was some of him left in there, I should have...
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want anyone else to lose a brother or a sister, a son or a daughter, a mother or a father or a friend to lies...to b*llshit.

       I agree with you fully and am sorry for what you have experienced. All I can offer is that I wholeheartedly agree that this Red Scare 2.0 is 100% complete bullshit that is soooo fucking obvious that it hurts when people actually fall for it. I think more and more people are waking up and realizing that this "reality" that we have been fed is bullshit. We are starting to think for ourselves again

       Nice is hard for me, when it happens it actually kind of hurts, I blame this on being brought up by cops and Marines (shudder right?) lol
       <br/>
       Anger feels better to me than despair but thank you for the kind words/thoughts.
       <br/>
       What I really want, what the little girl/little sister hiding inside this forty-five year old broad really, really wants is my brother back, I want my brother back. (more jaw clenching)(deep breath)

       I agree that people are more aware I just don't want it to be "awareness" of "business as usual" and all of us that learned this lesson, can see it happening again just letting it happen, again.

       Why have we been in Yemen with no apparent reason since what 2006? Why are we in what over thirty African countries with no good reason? Why is the supposed democratic beacon of the world killing thousands with drone strikes without even the appearance of due process or evidence or conscious?!

       I think what he was saying is it is never a one simple word answer. It's not just Israel - it's the CFR, it's our shadow gov't, it's our media being owned and manipulated by a handful of people, it's the Military Industrial Complex. If it wasn't Israel, it would be some other holy war. We have to call out all the bullshit - not just say "blame Israel"

       Except it's not Israel leading ours or any other nation into wars and secret drug and human trafficking. It's our own leaders. They might be influenced by Israel and use the Zionist religious motive, but you have to include all the mob employees with the mob boss. Israel didn't create itself, or did it?

       2 of my best friends I grew up with, in a crew of a dozen, did Iraq and Afghanistan. They went in 2 years apart, and while they weren't in touch with each other, both told me that 'the voices' started after getting vaxxed for anthrax, and that the voices increase while deployed.

       I have this friend that had a massive psychotic episode which resulted in him making several cuts from wrist to elbow on both arms in his first failed attempt, subsequently being diagnosed with bipolar disorder then ten years later his second attempt was swallowing every bottle of his prescribed medication which resulted in several weeks in a coma.
       <br/>
       So when I meet this guy years after all of this, he was off his meds and manic but I couldn't tell.
       <br/>
       I kept saying how much he was like my brother, how my brother used to joke that he was on the "monorail" in terms of thinking speed and I was on an ole rickety steam train or something.
       <br/>
       He kept saying "I think your brother might be bi-polar, there's different kinds, some have big highs and lows, some are elevated for longer, like guys that can get into flight school, helicopter school,  I think he's crazier than you think..."
       <br/>
       I was like "...wait..." and he was like "you're used to it....can keep up with him...follow him..."
Here's the thing...the whole "kicker"...my friend? he was in the navy, his first "episode" was the year of or year after he got out, he was one of those guys in the secret room that even the captain needs clearance to get into....and yea, my brother, in since '91 and two tours...
       <br/>
       In the short time I could still be around him, when he got back, he told me that the only thing that kept him from suicide was my sister and me. Somehow in his head his job was to keep up safe, he had to stay for us but that if it were up to him he wouldn't be, that he could see it, looking up at us from a hole in the ground crying and he couldn't stand that, wouldn't be the cause of it.
       <br/>
       I responded that being draped in a flag wouldn't make it any easier.

       Amazing stories ... Thank you for taking the time and effort to write them all out! It most certainly hasn't been in vain, as I hope to chime in with my very similar experiences and potentially offer some more insight and closure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been in the military myself, albeit not very long, in an allied NATO army. I merely went through the first year of the army officer's military academy, but became gravely ill after what I believe was a round of vaccines of which I was never told the contents. All I remember was getting food poisoning like symptoms almost instantly, shivering like crazy in the middle of a summer heathwave and lying awake delerious for entire nights just prior to getting sent out to an advanced training camp. I never dared to see a doctor about that, since I thought it would be considered as "showing weakness", which was pure lunacy because it literally cost me my career. Compounded by the systemic sleep deprivation so typical for anything concerning a military regime, it sent me overboard faster than any 17 y/o kid could ever figure out what the hell was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost overnight I was turned into a disfunctional hollow shadow of myself, barely cognizant, weak, agitated and fearful, as if I had just received a chemical lobotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       To make a long story short: flunked out very soon after that, never returned to baseline mentally/physically/cognitively, developped severe skin problems, lost my hair, spiralled in and out of suicidal depressions, even became manic and psychotic once and was branded bipolar. The psych meds they fed me were making me even worse and it took years to quit them and to recover to a barely functional level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a few months ago, I saw an interview with an army nurse who did nothing but vaccinate soldiers for years on end just around the first Gulf War. She was crying out her eyeballs asking for forgiveness, because she knew that certain vaccines had lethal effects on a much more common basis than was being admitted to. She tried to tell a superior and he said to never ever bring it up again if she valued her career in the military. Very shortly after, she was sent to a psych unit for evaluation, wanted out but wasn't allowed to, got demoted and was basically kept in the mil. for another year or so being put through very demeaning situations that were obviously serving as a form of punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       She went on by saying that she believes that some vaccines are meant to make sure veterans don't live long into retirement age, merely to diminish the cost of their upkeep, like senior working dogs being put down because they serve no real purpose anymore.

       This is seriously creepy. I've heard things about soldiers being medically experimented on. They are basically property of the government after signing up and lose their right to refuse.

       Sister actually lol, and I agree.

       I get "sparked" with sending our military personnel anywhere without proof though, I'd prefer a smaller military and a different set of leaders and guiding principles.

       The people of Poland want us there, they are an Allie, and we've been doing this for years. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's bad. Saying our troops need to refuse just shows how ignorant you are to this kind of stuff.

       <br/>
       Uhm, ok...do this, read anything other than msm, use your critical thinking skills and try to suss out whether having troops in Poland is to "help" in Crimea or screw with the ever and always scary Putin/Russia in order to fit/bolster tptb red scare b.s. narrative and possibly provoke a response and war with Putin/Russia.
       <br/>
       After that, read some more, then some more, think, then think some more, then think before you speak, then one more time and decide not to peddle you msm/tptb shill crap with me specifically, about this topic specifically......... mmkay??

       We have the largest, best armed military in the world...period.

       We have ships that aren't even the largest ships that have missiles with like a 2500 mile range.

       msm? wait, the cia has a source right? Rumsfeld? Cheney?

       Yea, ok.

       Until I see something, real proof of anything really happening from a source I actually trust, which precludes msm and any government entity, not buying it or anything.

       <br/>
       Quantity over proof is all you need?
I don't know maybe European news source? BBC? The Guardian? The Intercept?
       <br/>
       People in the region even?
       <br/>
       Please, please tell me that you're questioning whether or not it is believable for me, here in a Conspiracy sub, to trust msm reports or our government...please do that, lol.

       We do annual training there, and other countries, for years now. It is not ramping up for war. 400 troops wouldn't do shit. It's training, and showing our Allie that we support them. Russia does the same thing, everyone does the same thing. 400 troops in a temporary training event is not mustering for war lol

       Could that possibly be because the US has spent years building a nuclear-capable missile base in Poland? It opened in May last year and the Russians then moved their missiles up in November. The best part is, the US claims that their missile base in Poland is there to protect against a threat from Iran.

       Some points to remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       -In 1939, the Russians invaded Poland. The brutal occupation that followed lasted for 50 years.
       <br/>
       -In 2014, Russia annexed the Crimea. That is to say, they stole a large piece of territory from another country by force.
       <br/>
       -Russia has shifted it's forces to their western border. Even with the American deployment, Russia has a lot more hardware along their northwestern border than NATO does.
       <br/>
       -Russia moved their forced to the region
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       Russia did.
       <br/>
       -You would have to be stunningly ignorant of reality to think that NATO was contemplating a land invasion of Russia via eastern Europe.

       Who said anything about an invasion?
       <br/>
       Point - We have more hardware than NATO and Russia combined.
       <br/>
       Point - We don't have to be within five time zones to defend Poland.
       <br/>
       Point - We don't need "boots on the ground" anywhere to defend our friends and allies.
       <br/>
       Point - If we have the tech/hardware to fight whole wars without personnel (i.e. Gulf War One) the movement of troops is nothing more than a "p*ssing contest" and agitation of an already hostile/delicate situation.
       <br/>

       OKAY...I'll repeat myself for the third and fourth time -
       <br/>
       POINT - We can defend ANYBODY from several time zones away.
       <br/>
       POINT - We "won" Gulf War One with tech and hardware not "boots on the ground"
       <br/>
       POINT - The movement of troops this close to the Russian border is ABSOLUTELY/DEFINITELY poking a stick at a big bear and unnecessary (see the Second Point above) as WE have more hardware than NATO and Russia combined
       <br/>
       QUERY - Please remember what help we offered Georgia or Crimea at any time in the past in terms of help with Russia which was "F*CK ALL" or rather no help at all, so again the question is "Why now and not then....what could the effects of this be now and later and globally or financially and for whom and why....who benefits?"
       <br/>
       POINT - Moving this many troops to Russia in this way is AS dangerous plus some as the Cuban Missile Crisis.
       <br/>
       QUERY - If Russia moved 4000 along the Mexican or Canadian border for whatever "sheeple-pleasing" innocuous or acceptable reason they came up with...how exactly would WE respond/feel? Would it improve a situation or send it off a cliff do you suppose?
       <br/>
       REMARK - I don't believe that within this post nor in any of my responses have proven that I am "stunningly ignorant", in fact, I think I asked some relevant questions and thought about this and the how and the why of it, a great deal more than most if some of the questions keep receiving such easy, obvious answers IMO.

       That's a difficult subject since there was a lot of support for that decision from inside Crimea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way, if one of Mexico's provinces (states? districts?) wanted to join the US, (held a public vote and it was decided that the majority wanted to join) but the Mexican government wouldn't allow it, would it be legal for the US to send troops to defend the decision of their new friends in the south? Perhaps having to fight opposition groups with force?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really know man, but international politics is based on antiquated conventions (Westphalia for example). It's really difficult to determine if an outcome is right or wrong. All I know is that we shouldn't be invading countries based on the decisions of the few, or the frenzied masses, for the sake of resources or political power

       I disagree with the antiquated "agreements".

       I totally believe we have been running a protection racket worldwide for decades.

       We've got the big guns and we're certainly not afraid to use them, they might justify crap with an old "agreement" but in reality its "our way or the Invasion way".

       No one can or will stand up to us because of the size of/number of our guns and proven not giving a flying f*ck about anyone not us, hell, not of the 1% really.

       our state dept, along with soros, backed the kiev color revolution, then we worked with the neo-nazi's to decide which was most presentable to be the face of their coalition. those of us paying attn have noted how similar what is happening here now, is to the various color revolutions...in fact we even have a color too--the purple revolution. the similarity has not been lost on putin either.

       Thank you for sharing your genius. I've been trying to piece together the actual whole truth about Ukraine for years now. You described it in a way I couldn't for so long. I never considered the angle that Ukrainians have a hatred for the Russians living in their own country. It's so obvious though, Ukrainians constantly lament over Stalin's genocide against them. Stalin has little to do with present day Russia, however, so it is plainly an irrational hatred. Neo-Nazi is a fitting moniker. It helps validate the claims that easterners were fingered as traitors for protesting the new government, and casts light on the killing of 60 anti-maiden protesters in an arson.

       Clearly you know nothing other than what the mainstream media has fed you on that situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crimea has wanted to join Russia for quite a while. Virtually every poll showed a majority. The US enacted "the most blatant coup in history" according to the head of Stratfor, and propped up fascists and neo-nazis such as the Svoboda Party which is very openly racist with a very long history going back to being Nazi collaborators.
      </p>
      <p>
       The protests were roughly 30% comprised of these degenerates and there are videos of the violence they spread. They attacked ethnic Russians and just about anyone they felt like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, America has a special relationship reserved for fascists, as we've seen in the 1930's and throughout Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. John McCain and the State Department met with the head of Svoboda. Giving legitimacy to a vicious racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia was right in this case, although it was grossly mishandled. Putin later admitted he sent troops to safeguard the ethnic Russian population, but if he had announced it to the world as it was happening then they would've faced what you're doing and be accused of all sorts that really is just American projecting since they've done far worse, whereas plausible deniability prevents that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, people seem to forget the special relationship between Israel and Russia, due to the massive Russian-speaking population. That raises quite a few questions.

       Thanks for sharing.  I'm sure many military men/women become invested too much in their patriotism/feelings for their fellow soldiers to be able to see what the USA has truly done over in Iraq.  We destroyed the country, created chaos and funded/trained Iraqi torture/death squads modeled on our Phoenix Program from Vietnam.  On top of that we installed a government which the country of Iraq did not want.

       It's all well and good to have these feelings and to see the truth. But if you really care about your family you will just let it go and get your brother some counseling for PTSD. You don't stop the military industrial complex. You just get disappeared. Take a chill pill and think about what you can actually accomplish.

       What you are saying is exactly how I feel.  I start to wonder when it went wrong.  JFK assassination?  No, before that.  You keep going back.  Native American killings with the "manifest destiny".  It never was what it seemed.  A sad shame, was a depressing moment or two.  So when I hear make America great again, I am hopeful but then think at which moment is the ideal?

       Of course I still love him but he scares me, real deal, I'm scared of him.
       <br/>
       I want him to get help and he doesn't think he needs any help.
       <br/>
       Its a scary, deeply sad situation and breaks my heart and its far, far too common and never discussed.
       <br/>
       People cheer our military in parades and at football games, shake their hands and wish them well but when they go, go away into various h*lls on earth are hurt and broken, forever changed they don't seem to get the same "gung ho" reception.
       <br/>
       I agree, its not his fault, its theirs...their lies, their greed and also my fault, like I said, I should have used the bat.

       The US doesn't force it's military bases upon countries. Countries typically ask for them. For protection against bigger countries. Like Russia.

       Also, Russia has more land-surface area as pluto. It's hard

       I don't think it was "conditioning" necessarily.
       <br/>
       My brother told me that for every level he moved through he found more guys like him.
       <br/>
       Like these guys just kinda ARE the few, the proud, gravitate towards this profession because they already believe in honor and tradition, taking a bullet for your friend/brother, protecting and serving, etc...
       <br/>
       "They" used my brother, any and everyone that served, used all the best qualities of them for the worst cause, lied right to their faces, let them be hurt, killed for nothing...nothing but death and destruction and money, g
       <em>
        d d
       </em>
       mn money.
       <br/>
       He went back to somehow try to honor his fallen brothers, to soothe his survivor's guilt, to somehow make sense of it, find a different answer to "why" than the one he'd found.
       <br/>
       He didn't go back for the Government, he went back for his Marines.

       That is the sort of thing I meant by conditioning. There is no reason to feel duty towards people who sign up to be globalist pawns except that they beat that sense of camaraderie into their minds during bootcamp.

       Who said anything about an invasion?
       <br/>
       Point - We have more hardware than NATO and Russia combined.
       <br/>
       Point - We don't have to be within five time zones to defend Poland.
       <br/>
       Point - We don't need "boots on the ground" anywhere to defend our friends and allies.
       <br/>
       Point - If we have the tech/hardware to fight whole wars without personnel (i.e. Gulf War One) the movement of troops is nothing more than a "p*ssing contest" and agitation of an already hostile/delicate situation.
       <br/>
       Query - Who exactly is the "You would have to be stunningly ignorant..." comment directed towards?

       Such ridiculous thing could never ever happen again...or could it?

       I kind'a get the paranoia surrounding this subject.

       Especially when you mix it with nonlinear warfare, which is widely used today.
