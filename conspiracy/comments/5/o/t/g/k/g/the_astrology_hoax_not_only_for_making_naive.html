      <h1>
       The Astrology hoax - not only for making naive waste their time
      </h1>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Introduction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       As some of the illusions used to control the minds of people turn to be less and less efficient (like
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/4zrqa7/the_ufo_coverup_not_only_for_making_naive_waste/">
        UFOS &amp; Co.
       </a>
       ), the system uses always more and more astrology.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Astrology - a mind control weapon, used always more and more
       </strong>
       <br/>
       To illustrate this, just answer this question: what do all the women's magazines, from the U.S. to Germany, from Norway to Italy, have in common, in their December 2000 edition cover ?
       <br/>
       The answer is: the horoscope for the next year.
       <br/>
       Astrology, even in its more simple form, as it is presented by these magazines (based on the date of birth alone) proves to be in fact one of the more efficient mind control weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Answering the questions ...:
       <br/>
       - how easy is it to expose the astrology hoax ?
       <br/>
       - if it is so easy to expose it,  why can the system continue to use astrology (more and more) ?
       <br/>
       - how is astrology used as mind control weapon ?
       <br/>
       ... might be a big help to let you understand the answers to the fundamental questions of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How easily can astrology be  debunked ?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       All you have to do is to use the blind test technique.
       <br/>
       ask the astrology experts to give their horoscope for the twelve zodiac signs for the next period and to use a scale (say from 1 to 5) for each item (say health, love, money):
       <br/>
       - seal their predictions;
       <br/>
       - ask, after the end of the period, a statistically significant universe of people (say 100 persons for each sign, so a total of 1200 people) how do they value each item in the same scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now compare the results. You will see that:
       <br/>
       - each astrologist has valued each item differently, according to the sign (say - Love-4.5, for Taurus, Love-1.5 for Sagittarius);
       <br/>
       - the results of the average will be more or less the same for the people's answers (say - Love-3.7, for Taurus, Love-3.1 for Sagittarius). The people you will use in this experiment, the more the results will be similar (say - Love-3.3, for Taurus, Love-3.2 for Sagittarius).
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is an easy way to prove that astrology is an hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why can the system continue to use astrology ?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The first reason is the simple fact that all the media is totally controlled. So even it is so easy to debunk astrology, the system will make sure this will not happen.
       <br/>
       To understand the second reason, consider this question, that was posed to a statistically significant number of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a certain town there are two maternities. In maternity A there are 50 births average each week. In maternity B there are 5 births average each week. The chances of a baby being a boy are exactly the same as of being a girl (fifty-fifty).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now consider the question: where are the chances higher, in a particular week to have 60% or more of the new born being boys ?
       <br/>
       What do you think is the right answer:
       <br/>
       - maternity A;
       <br/>
       - maternity B;
       <br/>
       - both the same.
       <br/>
       Before continuing to read, please think a bit about YOUR answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let me tell you what the results were: one quarter of the people answered A, one quarter of the people answered B, and 50% of the people said both the same.
       <br/>
       The right answer is: maternity B. Just think about this: you can expect this to happen each two weeks in maternity B. In an average week, one out of two times there will be three boys and two girls born. And that means that the condition is true - more than 60% boys were born.
       <br/>
       The results shows one of the errors that many people make: they make their conclusions based on a small number of observations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But - and this is what statistics is all about - you need a relevant number of observations to get valid conclusions. This is why the test mentioned above, that could easily debunk astrology to the masses, will never be carried out by the system mass media.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How is astrology used as mind control weapon ?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Once you believe in astrology, you give up the capacity to think.
       <br/>
       This leads people to not react to even primary events - the ones where their survival is at stake.

      <p>
       Ever heard of irony?
So how many links to the FULL STORY on "structures", secret societies, and the occult can you be credited with?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is clear the difference between our views:
- you think that operations like 911, Oslo, London 7/7, Madrid 3/11 or Arizona Mass Shooting are possible without being orchestrated by "an organization whose activities and inner functioning are concealed from non-members" (Wikipedia's definition of secret society).
       <br/>
       I do not. And as obvious, it is in all cases the same organization.
So the name of that organization is irrelevant and I do not understand why you focus your criticism on me naming them the illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, I would be interested to read your explanation of how any of these events could have been executed by "a small group of people who control a disproportionate amount of wealth and/or political power" (Wikipedia's definition of elite).

       Yes, I know. You screen shot me saying take what I say with a grain of salt (note - not hiding, still in my comments). Tis' true. I'm not hiding it Rocky. I'm admitting it right now. Take what I say with a grain of salt. I admit to not having the answers. You know why I admit this? Because I'm and honest person. If you think this is a "gotcha moment", you are sorely mistaking.

       There's a major difference between saying that you might not know an answer, and telling people to take what you say with a grain of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might as well have said something like :"
       <em>
        I'm a lying son-of-a, but here's what i've got to say"
       </em>
       - And expecting people to take you seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's nice that you're honest about your lack of sincerity.

       Look at moon.

      <p>
       See it is whole, with no signs of split.

      <p>
       Check research, see researchers conclude no sign of split

       What's there to explain? When you tell people to take what you say with a grain of salt, you're announcing your word isn't worth anything.

       You might as well pretext every comment with
       <em>
        "The following may be nonsense"

       . In fact, you should do that. Just so people know to take you with a grain of salt.

       False.

       You're the only user i've ever seen on this website to openly discredit yourself. So I find it hilarious whenever you make a certain claim, after you've told people to take what you say with a grain of salt.

       See varying nonsense about religion, the nature of reality, the observable universe, unicorns, magic, resurrections, talking animals and whatnot. People in the past believed some retarded shit.

       Quote where OP is "all over the place" and does not follow a concise narrative.

      <p>
       Ever heard of irony?
So how many links to the FULL STORY on "structures", secret societies, and the occult can you be credited with?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is clear the difference between our views:
- you think that operations like 911, Oslo, London 7/7, Madrid 3/11 or Arizona Mass Shooting are possible without being orchestrated by "an organization whose activities and inner functioning are concealed from non-members" (Wikipedia's definition of secret society).
       <br/>
       I do not. And as obvious, it is in all cases the same organization.
So the name of that organization is irrelevant and I do not understand why you focus your criticism on me naming them the illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, I would be interested to read your explanation of how any of these events could have been executed by "a small group of people who control a disproportionate amount of wealth and/or political power" (Wikipedia's definition of elite).
