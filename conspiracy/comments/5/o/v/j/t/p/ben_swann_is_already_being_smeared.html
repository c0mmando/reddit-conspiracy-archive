Trump also kicked him out of the club as soon as it was discovered while Bill &amp; Hill have not distanced themselves to nearly the extent. Plus, there are multiple pics and claims by underage girls involving Bill and Hill whereas the Trump ones have been Gloria Allred&#39;ed. If Trump is proven to be guilty, then so be it.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, and what do you think of the quotes in my original posts?  It&#39;s fair to say they knew each other well, isn&#39;t it?  My only real point is that it seems many of the people that I&#39;ve interacted with have had an agenda.  Basically that people aren&#39;t going where the evidence leads them, they&#39;re leading the evidence.  I still believe Pizzagate to be an exercise in selection bias.  That&#39;s not true of all of them, of course, just an observation.</p>

<p>Well it&#39;s a good thing he didn&#39;t make any extraordinary claims. In fact,  he went out of his way in the report to state numerous times that there was in fact &quot;no tangible evidence&quot;. </p>

<p>As far as things being &quot;taken out of context&quot; - well that&#39;s just a lazy way to dismiss something. The guy(s) in question have some pretty...questionable interests, to say the least. Not to mention the pictures with children in them do at the very least seem a little bizarre. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s been taken out of context, then please, put it back into context. By all means I would love to see someone explain all that creepy stuff. But as it stands now, all the pizzagate nay sayers have really said is the same rhetoric - &quot;fake news&quot; - without actually explaining how it&#39;s fake or even bothering to provide a real explanation. It&#39;s a strange sort of cognitive dissonance where they participate but only insofar as they can deny it without a reasonable explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok someone brought up this pizza/hot dog thing yesterday.</p>

<p>How do you think Obama eats a pizza? Does the chef grow the tomatoes and make the sauce themselves? Do they harvest the milk and make the cheese themselves? No? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like they sent cooked hot dogs/pizza to the white house. They were sent there, where there are cooked (prepared). This really isn&#39;t that crazy of a concept.</p>

<p>Nice try though.</p>

<p>*I saw an explanation for this yesterday and thought it to be interesting, what do you think?  credit to <a href="/u/superiority">/u/superiority</a> -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is the explanation: some random guy who votes Republican saw a random blog post shared on Facebook about how OBUMMER was WASTING TAXPAYER MONEY on such FRIVOLITIES as PARTIES with CATERING, and referenced that blog post in an email to coworkers. It was never based in fact. It was just a partisan talking-point that got circulated among some dude&#39;s friends and co-workers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The show is called &quot;Reality Check&quot; and deals with all sorts of stories, true or false, where he points out the claims, facts, and lies. If you had researched him first you&#39;d be aware of this.</p>

<p>LETS CORRECT THE RECORD! You know how? Not hate and lies and spam, BUT ACTUAL TRUTH.</p>

<p>Tell Clinton-Bush that we BEG OF THEM to sue for libel. Hang all those who spoke against thy masters, but prove to us that it&#39;s lies.

<p>Sue Ben Swann, sue all our sites, sue all the users and posters, PLEASEEEE. Then as you try to prove your claims, we&#39;ll have discovery, we&#39;ll know what your clan is up to. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s not CP and trafficking, and simply other immoral and illegal shit, i&#39;ll take myself to jail. Cause obviously SOMETHING is wrong here, but it may not be child abuse related, even if I think it is, so please, PLEASE FFS CTR, sue the shit out of all us unpatriotic twats who just wont stfu with our slanderous lies.

    <div class="md"><p>Man...The Streisand Effect <em>sooo</em> needs to go into overdrive gear on this issue.</p>

<p>There is literally a war going on right now, ladies and gentlemen - and it&#39;s beginning to rage, and rage, and rage harder - between the 99% and the 1%.  It&#39;s becoming more and more stark and obvious, such that any halfway intelligent person just can&#39;t really deny it.</p>

<p>This is a <em>real</em> opportunity for the masses to push back, fight back.  We are seeing <em>right in front of our faces</em> that these MSM media outlets are NNNNOOOT on our side and are <em>not</em> there for our best interest.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like this very moment right here is an opportunity for a significant portion of the population to <em>all</em> wake up to the Matrix and all become veritable Neos - and you can feel (or at least I can feel) the MSM collectively coming together and showing their hand big time as they hunker down and act like the collective representation of Agent Smith, trying to shut the collective consciousness down and keeping it back under the lid of ignorance.  The MSM is working hard to make sure and keep the society dumbed down, ignorant, and unaware of something that is looking more and more real the more you study it.</p>

<p>There is a pitch battle going on between &quot;the powers that should never be&quot; and all the people they&#39;ve been ruling over.</p>

<p>We need to <em>not</em> stop pushing back and not stop trying to educate ourselves to the reality of what&#39;s really going on on this planet, folks.</p>

<p>DON&#39;T <em>STOP</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is indeed a lot to take in and take on.  Go through it in small to moderate chunks - piecemeal.  Internalize the information slowly.  One has to educate themselves about the good, the bad, and the ugly about this planet we live in...and there&#39;s a <em>lot</em> of bad and ugly - quite overwhelming it seems sometimes.  However, the more we simply keep taking information in and refuse to turn away, the better informed we will be when it comes to making decisions about ourselves, our lives, and everyone around us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll repeat what I asked on the Wikipedia thread:</p>

<p>Does anyone know when Ben Swann <strong>first</strong> mentioned <strong>anything</strong> to do with reporting on Pizzagate? Like when he first mention he would look into it or began researching it?</p>

<p>There was absolutely no mention of him and any &quot;Sandy Hook conspiracy&quot; at the last edit on the 29th of November 2016: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Swann&amp;amp;diff=752011946&amp;amp;oldid=752011628">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Swann&amp;amp;diff=752011946&amp;amp;oldid=752011628</a></p>

<p>But then suddenly editor <strong>Mvblair</strong> pushes in an entire section claiming he supports the Sandy Hook conspiracy theory on the 9th of December 2016: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Swann&amp;amp;diff=next&amp;amp;oldid=752011946">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ben_Swann&amp;amp;diff=next&amp;amp;oldid=752011946</a></p>

<p>This looks like a deliberate pre-planned attempt discredit him before his Pizzagate segment.</p>

<p>That Sandy Hook section? Created entirely on random articles that mention vaguely and in passing that he once reported there <strong>may</strong> have been a second shooter, according to original reports he read. </p>

<p>Which apparently required an entire section to be suddenly included on the 9th of December 2016...despite the articles it&#39;s sourced with <strong>being from 2013</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I find the most damning, the lack even a remotely serious discussion (aside from Swanns) about it in the media or law enforcement. I am a healthy skeptic of pizzagate but I also feel that there is probably enough circumstantial evidence to, at the very least, warrant an investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s difficult because there&#39;s just so much Pizzagate out there.  Seeing some of the claims and their absurdity makes it easy to dismiss.  I often say that PG is an exercise in selection bias, but if they can trim the fat (tons of bullshit and partisanship) it will be much, much harder to dismiss it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily.  It could mean that they&#39;ve no respect for actual, objective reporting and only have an interest in bashing people because they disagree with them.  It&#39;s an all too common occurrence with online media.  You see it every day with HuffPo, Breitbart, Drudge etc.  I know I&#39;m getting off-topic a bit, but I believe our media is feeding the divisions in this country.  Ease of access with a pinch of confirmation bias kinda ensures this.  I hope this hyper-partisan craze dies off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy used to work at a local station in my city before he was well known and to this day he is the best news reporter I&#39;ve ever seen around here. I used to watch the news JUST for his reality check segments  (he&#39;s been doing them for years). It genuinely pisses me off that people are going after him like that. I think this was a perfectly reasonable explanation of the pizzagate issue right now. It is way the fuck out there in terms of believability, but at the same time there are so many coincidental occurances that it is hard to see them all as just coincidence.  </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t verify or debunk pizzagate, if anything this might (doubt it) put a little more pressure on law enforcement to do their job and investigate. </p>

<p>It is surprising to me the amount of backlash that this conspiracy has gotten. Its ok to talk about human reptiles, underground ufos, the cult, devil worshipping, flat earth theory, chemtrails, government assassinatioms, poedeophilia from other elites around the world, but don&#39;t you dare bring up a pedophile conspiracy of our elites cuz alot of our friends in this subreddit don&#39;t want to have the conversation.</p>

<p>Just to be clear I dont think pizzagate is a real thing, however Im not cocky enough to pretend I know everything and there are too many dots that connect for me to just completely dismiss the conspiracy outright. It is worthy of a conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody needs to see this. Understand that its not farfetched for government officials to sex traffic children. Either the Russians hacked them or the emails are made up, CTR you can&#39;t use both narratives. And let&#39;s not forget the conversations about Dennis Hastert in the emails, how after Anthony Weiner&#39;s laptop got seized the FBI made the LARGEST CHILD TRAFFICKING BUST IN U.S. HISTORY, and Jimmy Saville having the BBC and NYT get caught trying to cover up his sex with children.

    <div class="md"><p>How does pushback make it any more real? They&#39;re right across the board: there is still no evidence for Pizzagate and there never has been. The media is right to try to keep it down, as false accusations can do a huge amount of harm. Some idiot already shot up Comet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is indeed a lot to take in and take on.  Go through it in small to moderate chunks - piecemeal.  Internalize the information slowly.  One has to educate themselves about the good, the bad, and the ugly about this planet we live in...and there&#39;s a <em>lot</em> of bad and ugly - quite overwhelming it seems sometimes.  However, the more we simply keep taking information in and refuse to turn away, the better informed we will be when it comes to making decisions about ourselves, our lives, and everyone around us.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
