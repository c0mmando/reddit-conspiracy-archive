        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">56</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-01-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/sagittariuscraig.html">sagittariuscraig</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Dolores Cannon (1931-2014) (<a href="http://www.dolorescannon.com/">http://www.dolorescannon.com/</a>) spent her career as a hypnotherapist specializing in past life regression. Her career spanned almost 50 years and had taken her on an incredible journey along countless fascinating destinations. </p>

<p>In her 600+ page 2011 book, &quot;The Three Waves of Volunteers and the New Earth&quot; (<a href="http://amzn.to/2jVPQia">http://amzn.to/2jVPQia</a>) (which I highly recommend and now own!), Cannon documents how, through her hypnosis work, she has discovered three waves of spiritual &quot;volunteers.&quot; Some,she says, have come direct from the &quot;Source&quot; and have never lived in any type of physical body before. Others have lived as space beings on other planets or other dimensions. Because all memory is erased upon entry to the Earth dimension, they do not remember their assignment (they suffer from &quot;the veil of forgetfulness). Thus these beautiful souls have a difficult time adjusting to our chaotic world. &quot;These souls,&quot; the book says, &quot;have a vital role to play as they help all of the rest of us ascend to the New Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>So where is the proof that this relates to the Mandela Effect (ME)?  Well, let me back up a step and say first that: I am convinced that those of us experiencing this effect are &quot;awakened&quot; and by nature more skeptical and questioning of the status quo.  I&#39;m guessing most of us are aware of the plans for a &quot;New World Order&quot; and oppose it, along with all of the false flag attacks, central bank ponzi schemes, and everything else that goes along with it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not certain if I&#39;m personally one of the &quot;volunteers&quot; the book refers to, but that&#39;s beside the point.</p>

<p>Many of us experiencing the ME recall being from an earth on the Sagittarius arm of the Milky Way Galaxy, and those of us who are from that arm seem to recognize all of the same ME&#39;s/changes, so there&#39;s definitely something we have in common.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s where it gets crazy.</p>

<p>One of the things I noticed that immediately struck me about this &quot;new earth&quot; is the new wildlife and hybrid animals, as well as the much more diversified types of plants.  One of the most beautiful new trees I became aware of was the &quot;rainbow eucalyptus&quot;: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rainbow+tree&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdv63n-MnRAhUEyGMKHW9cA1kQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=607#tbm=isch&amp;q=rainbow+eucalyptus">https://www.google.com/search?q=rainbow+tree&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdv63n-MnRAhUEyGMKHW9cA1kQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=607#tbm=isch&amp;q=rainbow+eucalyptus</a></p>

<p>You can see my post on new plants/animals/diversity here: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbm59/orion_spur_earth_is_way_more_colorful_and_diverse/">https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbm59/orion_spur_earth_is_way_more_colorful_and_diverse/</a></p>

<p>And my post on hybrids here: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbgdl/the_prevalence_of_hybrid_animals_and_intergenus/">https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbgdl/the_prevalence_of_hybrid_animals_and_intergenus/</a></p>

<p>Many of you fellow ME experiencers have noticed these new animals, the new human anatomy, and the new geography... not to mention the fact that we are now on the Orion spur (or so they say) in the Milky Way galaxy, over 80,000 light years away from our original home.</p>

<p>So, get this: after becoming aware of the &quot;rainbow trees,&quot; I became very fascinated by all of new things nature had to offer, and got very curious about those things.</p>

<p>A bit later, I became aware of all of the people commenting about how their own friends, family, etc. had been &quot;acting strange,&quot; or not like themselves, and how people who had previously been friendly were acting downright hostile whenever the ME was brought up.  This got me wondering, who are these people exactly, why do some recognize the ME&#39;s while others appear, for lack of a better word, to be &quot;asleep&quot; and either totally unaware anything has changed, or unconcerned even when it&#39;s obvious to them something HAS changed?  And why are all of them so quick to change the subject, or &quot;put off&quot; by our trying to discuss it?</p>

<p>This question led me to the work of Dolores Cannon (see above), and to a video discussing &quot;back-drop&quot; and &quot;back fill&quot; people: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gc1mGdoHRg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gc1mGdoHRg</a></p>

<p>See here for more articles about this: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dolores+cannon+people&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=607&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB2Z6b-snRAhVI1WMKHSaGDnYQ_AUIBygA&amp;dpr=0.9">https://www.google.com/search?q=dolores+cannon+people&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=607&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB2Z6b-snRAhVI1WMKHSaGDnYQ_AUIBygA&amp;dpr=0.9</a></p>

<p>The above supposes that although many of us crossed to the new earth, for various reasons others either didn&#39;t get here yet, or never will, and that many people were simply energy-beings and never &quot;real people&quot; in the first place.  That&#39;s a tough pill to swallow, I&#39;ll be honest. But it may explain why people are acting strange... almost robotic, it seems.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been posting theories I&#39;ve found that I&#39;d <em>NEVER</em> heard of before, that seem to explain why some of us are experiencing the ME.</p>

<p>Take my &quot;9 Veils&quot; posting, for example: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbrj6/the_harder_we_try_to_explain_what_we_are_able_to/">https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nbrj6/the_harder_we_try_to_explain_what_we_are_able_to/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve also discovered a  70+ year old &quot;prophecy&quot; that seems to explain - almost to a T - what is going on with us, and what the &quot;Mandela Effect&quot; really is.</p>

<p>See my post here, about the prophecy of Peter Konstantinov Deunov and his 1944 prophecy:  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nby6s/explanation_for_the_mandela_effect_peter_deunov/">https://np.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/5nby6s/explanation_for_the_mandela_effect_peter_deunov/</a></p>

<p>Now, are you sitting down?</p>

<p>Good.</p>

<p>Because the next thing is going to blow your mind.</p>

<p>I felt drawn to look into Dolores Cannon&#39;s work more, and bought one of her books (see above) on Amazon.  I read it in a single day.</p>

<p>On page 518-522, there is a particular interesting conversation she had with a client from Australia, named &quot;Christine.&quot; You can read it here:
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_UFcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT466&amp;lpg=PT466&amp;dq=new+earth+orange+trunks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FycUzDawRf&amp;sig=zIeIEvo3sq2cDRu6AbG00EYfq5M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKkpD288nRAhVGjFQKHQXdDtgQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%20trunks&amp;f=false">https://books.google.com/books?id=_UFcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT466&amp;lpg=PT466&amp;dq=new+earth+orange+trunks&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FycUzDawRf&amp;sig=zIeIEvo3sq2cDRu6AbG00EYfq5M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKkpD288nRAhVGjFQKHQXdDtgQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%20trunks&amp;f=false</a></p>

<p>Or you can read pretty much the whole book here:
<a href="https://issuu.com/earthcat/docs/the_three_waves_of_volunteers_and_t">https://issuu.com/earthcat/docs/the_three_waves_of_volunteers_and_t</a></p>

<p>My understanding is the material was printed as far back as 2007, in Cannon&#39;s earlier book, &quot;The Convoluted Universe, Book 2&quot; (<a href="http://amzn.to/2jvWDlK">http://amzn.to/2jvWDlK</a>).  This was WELL before anyone experienced the Mandela Effect, folks - and it all coming true / became true.</p>

<p>Read on...</p>

<p>This is what Australian client Christine told Dolores Cannon under hypnosis:</p>

<p>&quot;You see, the new Earth is not this dimension. The new Earth is another dimension.And we will move into that new dimension. And in that new dimension, there&#39;ll be these trees that have purple and orange intheir trunks. And there will be beautiful rivers and waterfalls. And the energy will be brought back.&quot;</p>

<p>She goes on to say, &quot;I&#39;m seeing us stepping through. (Starled) Oh! What I&#39;m seeing is that the people who are going to the new dimensions will step through into this new world.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: While the other one is being cleaned?</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we just walk across.&quot;</p>

<p>About changes to our body / anatomy and DNA changes she says will be hoisted upon us during the shift, the client says.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s like a car. Imagine a car that has an old body. It&#39;s just the same old car you&#39;ve been driving. And then you put a new engine in it. And suddenly that car begins to perform differently, even though it LOOKS THE SAME. And then you get another engine, and you replace it. And the car keeps getting faster and faster, and brighter and smarter. And then before you know it, the car is doing such good things, that the body starts to change. It&#39;s like the energy of the new engine starts to reform the body. And before you know it, the chap has turned into a sport&#39;s car. A beautiful, glossy, attractive vehicle. And THAT&#39;S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. The energies that are coming in have the ability to transform the vehicle. And it will start to be different. It&#39;s going to look smarter and younger. The cells of the body, the vibration of the body is changing, and is matching the vibration of the incoming energy. And the physical changes will be next.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: What will those physical changes be?</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! The body&#39;s going to change to be LIGHTER. And I&#39;m getting that it will look TALLER. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s going to be taller.  But the energy from within is somehow going to become visible on the outside. And it will make the body seem taller, elongated, slimmer. And more transparent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The people have all been given that choice [to evolve]. If they want to evolve with the Earth, they will evolve into this NEW HUMAN BEING. It will LOOK DIFFERENT.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And these things are going to continue to happen until the cleansing is complete. Those who are here to stay [on the new Earth] are taking this race of people into a very new and different civilization. These people are being tested now,to see if they can hold the light when there is disaster, and not be sucked in. They&#39;re the people who will move ahead with this planet.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: Almost like a last test?</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. The TESTING IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. Whatever each being needs to test them, to see what they&#39;re capable of giving back to this program; how firm their commitment is. How willing they are to serve. That is all being tested now.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: So each one is having their own individual test?</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. And THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FINDING IT TOUGH NOW ARE THE ONES WHO ARE STAYING. They&#39;re the ones who are going through the tests. But some of them are not coming through.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: I was told by other people, that some would be left behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Each soul is given the choice. And if they are not moving and evolving, it&#39;s because they are choosing not to. And they will reincarnate into another place of their choice. And it&#39;s all right. Because it&#39;s only a game.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;ll stay in the old Earth (those who do not choose to evolve.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The new earth is so beautiful. You will see colors and animals and flowers you never imagined possible. You&#39;ll see fruit that is perfect food.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: Are these fruits and vegetables we don&#39;t have on earth now?</p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t have them. They&#39;re mutations in some ways. I&#39;m seeing a custard apple as an example of what happened. We will have a fruit called a &#39;custard apple.&#39; And it doesn&#39;t look like an apple. It has a rough exterior, and it&#39;s about the size of two oranges put together. And then you open it. It&#39;s like custard inside.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point I stopped and said, you have GOT to be kidding me.  There&#39;s no such thing as a custard apple.</p>

<p>So I looked it up:
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=547&amp;q=ciustard+apple&amp;oq=ciustard+apple&amp;gs_l=img.3...152.1327.0.1428.14.7.0.5.0.0.116.720.1j6.7.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..2.6.603...0j0i10i24k1.efBSaqDaDqc#tbm=isch&amp;q=custard+apple">https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=547&amp;q=ciustard+apple&amp;oq=ciustard+apple&amp;gs_l=img.3...152.1327.0.1428.14.7.0.5.0.0.116.720.1j6.7.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..2.6.603...0j0i10i24k1.efBSaqDaDqc#tbm=isch&amp;q=custard+apple</a></p>

<p>Holy. Shitake.</p>

<p>And then it was obvious to me.</p>

<p>Folks, we&#39;re on the new earth. We raised our vibrations, and we were more than the required 51% positive: <a href="http://in5d.com/what-is-this-51-percent-that-everyone-is-talking-about/">http://in5d.com/what-is-this-51-percent-that-everyone-is-talking-about/</a></p>

<p>We did it.</p>

<p>This is why we see the Mandela Effects and the others don&#39;t.</p>

<p>We crossed, and they didn&#39;t. We&#39;re the ones &quot;being tested,&quot; both my this, and it sounds like, disaster up ahead.</p>

<p>Cannon goes on to say that those of us being tested will be a calm in the storm, and we will see through all of the hate, negativity and propaganda. And that not a hair on our heads will be harmed if we believe and remain positive.</p>

<p>To me, the info in this book is 100% confirmation that we crossed.</p>

<p>There were no rainbow trees on Sagittarius arm Earth, and no custard apples.</p>

<p>Everything they said is true.</p>

<p>Now that we know, can we begin working together to form a true community and work to manifest positive change in this new Earth?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s dispel the darkness, and be the candles in the night.  </p>

<p>We can do it.  I know we can.  :)</p>

<p>Edit: minor typos</p>

<p>TD;LR  Everyone is wondering what is causing the Mandela Effect, blaming it on D-wave computers/CERN, or some other gov&#39;t conspiracy, or a Biblical &quot;demonic deception.&quot; But the truth of what is causing this is in the trees - the rainbow trees - which are new to everyone experiencing the ME. And it was documented well before the Mandela Effect was given a name or was recognized, back in 2007, in a book by hynotherapist Dolores Cannon. And the book and it&#39;s client testimony is 100% proof that those experiencing the ME are part of the group of people that made it to the 5D &quot;new earth.&quot; The ascension came like a thief in the night, and is upon us. The anatomy changes, the geography changes, all of the collective shared memories everyone insists is &quot;faulty memories,&quot; it all makes sense now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm.  I hate to say it, but it makes some sense.  I&#39;m not sure about the whole new age, and dimensions slant, but...  Maybe.  I&#39;m not sure what &quot;testing&quot; I would have passed, though.  Up until a couple years ago, I would&#39;ve considered myself failing.  So I&#39;m not sure why I would be in a fancy new place.</p>

<p>I pretty much gave up researching on M.E. a few months ago, since I was spinning in circles, getting nowhere with it.  This theory seems pretty common, but I hadn&#39;t seen these specific references to Cannon&#39;s work.  Nice catch :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you &quot;hate to say it&quot;?  Would you rather believe in the Vatican-promulgated myth of a biblical apocalypse where we all die? The &quot;testing&quot; is likely the earth changes itself, and feeling like we&#39;ve gone crazy while the majority are unphased by everything, or not noticing the changes.  The testing, however, could also be the upcoming upheaval.  We are about to witness the death throes of the NWO/cabal, and I would imagine that&#39;s going to create some havoc as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re done being &quot;tested.&quot;  We were graded as being 51% or more positive, and so we &quot;made the cut&quot; and were able to ascend beyond the 3rd density earth. But we&#39;re in a &quot;holding area,&quot; right now, and our actions here will determine, it seems, what the new earth is going to be like, exactly.

    <div class="md"><p>The Rafflesia was first discovered on Java in 1791, however it is <em>not</em> a carnivorous plant. It has no roots of its own because it&#39;s a holoparasite plant, that parasitizes  a specific genus&#39; vines. </p>

<p>I just did some googling and found a very incorrect article stating it is a carnivorous plant, but don&#39;t be fooled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an odd story that matches the timing of all this.  My twin sister and I were in college 2003/4-8 .. she had started out highly successful while I failed out year one.  I go on a.d.d. meds and to community college while she finishes bachlors and is about to finish 2 masters.  </p>

<p>Turns out she had been abusing narcotics since 2006 and right before finishing her masters she drops out and has been a robot to relapse ever since.  I went back to the same university she had left and finish my bachlors and go on to be as happy as can be managing a restaurant, moving out and moving on. </p>

<p>Its just that non of what happened felt right.  Within a year around 2007 it felt like we both left our orignal path and jumped on an opposite one.   Ever since then ive been waking up, digging deep, reading, researching this dark conspiracy stuff all while remaining positive and happy.  Mean while she keeps bouncing around from rehab to half way house, depression to despair.  This may just be some story that feels like its connected but it felt good to share anyway.  </p>

<p>Sketchers is a shoe brand similar to Nike and Adidas. I&#39;ve had a few pairs and always remember it as &quot;Sketchers&quot; now it&#39;s actually &quot;Skechers&quot; which looks ugly..</p>

<p>Forrest Gump ME is pretty popular. In the movie his famous quote is &quot;Life IS like a box of chocolates&quot; now if you go back and watch he says &quot;Life WAS like a box of chocolates&quot; which is a weird way to say that sentence.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Agreed. Not sure whats up with these trees? Never heard of them. </p>

<p>I really can&#39;t tell if the whole ME thing is just something that&#39;s been around forever that we are just putting a name to now.. Where one person comes up with an obscure difference and so many people who hear it just go &quot; Yeah I thought sketchers&#39; had a &#39;T&#39; too ! &quot;. But really it&#39;s just a subconscious little alteration that the brain is happy to make in leiu of remembering . And the &quot;uproar&quot; from a group of people saying that&#39;s the way it used to be makes us want to believe it even more.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love it if OP were right! At this point I think it&#39;s just as likely OP&#39;s answer as it is a psyop as it is some group of people fucking with the &quot;ME believers&quot;  </p>

So far, most of the MEs I&#39;ve heard about have been for subtle things like spelling and logos. I think this is so people can ease into the idea that there is more to reality than what we&#39;ve been taught. As more and more people awaken, I think we&#39;ll start seeing bigger and bigger changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sagittariuscraig, just the fact that you&#39;re aware of this tells me that you&#39;re on the right path.</p>

<p>Had you not been on the right frequency you wouldn&#39;t have ever been led to this information (nor accepted it once you found it).</p>

<p>I experienced the Mandela Effect a few years before it was named. My jaw dropped when a politician who had died years before [Walter Mondale] was suddenly alive again. My wife, too, remembered him dying. </p>

<p>I recall sharing this information with a friend and she looked at me like I was nuts. (I, too, felt a little insane. But I know what I remember.)</p>

<p>I was shocked a few years later when others started experiencing the same disjointed experiences.</p>

<p>Fast forward to eight months ago. I was lying in bed, trying to remote view. I fell asleep and was shunted out of it by the feeling of something hovering over me as I lay on my stomach. I then felt a jolt of electricity hit the back of my head (where my skull met my spine). It felt like energy radiated from that point and overspread my body. (To this day, it&#39;s the single weirdest thing that&#39;s ever happened to me.) I was terrified.</p>

<p>I felt like when I was remote viewing my brain had shifted into a frequency in which something could establish communication. And that something reached out. </p>

<p>A day or two later, I stumbled upon Dolores Cannon. (In retrospect, it doesn&#39;t feel like coincidence. It feels like I was intentionally led to discover her books.) I was brought up short when I opened her volume and she talked about interdimensionals having trouble communicating with humans because we&#39;re so low-frequency. If they try to open up a dialogue too fast it might actually harm us. (Something about too much energy and our primitive neurological system.) So, according to one of the people Cannon put under hypnosis, they try to raise your vibrational frequency. One of the ways they do this is by touching the chakra at the base of your head (where the skull meets the spine). </p>

<p>I was shocked when I read this account just days after my experience.</p>

<p>What are the chances that (after having such a bizarre experience) I&#39;d find not only an exact description of it, but a detailed explanation for what had happened.</p>

<p>As I said: It felt like something led me to that book. As if it were trying to explain itself.</p>

<p>(It may sound banal to an outsider . . . to someone who hasn&#39;t felt that electrical jolt . . . but it remains one of the freakiest experiences of my life. So imagine my shock, as I kept reading, and she even covered the Mandela Effect subject that had also been unfolding. Basically, you would have never been aware of the shift had you not already been of a sufficient vibrational level.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I entertained your post as if it were describing reality. It was convincing, but in my opinion, still has holes.</p>

<p>I look at a tree and see a unique individual which may have sentience. There is enough evidence to make the case that trees are intelligent and communicate intentionally.</p>

<p>I see the connections between everything.</p>

<p>IMHO, the universe is consciousness, and consciousness is God, so to speak. Or perhaps more accurately, consciousness is a form of energy, in the same way that matter is a form of energy.</p>

<p>I pick everything apart, not because I&#39;m trying to find something to discount, but because I&#39;m trying to make sense of it, to weigh the accuracy of an idea.</p>

<p>Einstein was wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the Law of One (Ra Material) and many of Dolores Cannon&#39;s regressive hypnotherapy clients, trees and other plant-life are, in fact, alive and sentient, as well as the earth.  &quot;Inanimate&quot; plant life is actually a lower form of 2nd density (2D) creation and seeks to become conscious, as we do, and self-aware, at which point it ascends to 3rd density (3D).  Animals are 2D as well, but farther up the 2nd density ladder.  Rocks/minerals, etc. are 1st density (1D).  </p>

<p>So I can&#39;t discount your idea; in fact, I agree with it.  Everything is connected to Source, the Infinite Intelligence that created us all. And all seeks to become one with its source again someday. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good read. It&#39;s an interesting topic. I&#39;m pretty skeptical of any huge claim but if it intrigues me I&#39;ll consider it and sit with it for a while, maybe try it out. One day maybe I&#39;ll subscribe.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2015 I was at this music festival. Albeit I was on drugs but the course of events felt serendipitous. The fact that I was high is why I remain skeptical of it but it&#39;s interesting and I&#39;ll tell the story. </p>

<p>I was making a round to the beach stage to hear a electronic violin set, but after a short time I felt obliged to move on and headed back to the center point of the festival. Upon entering I felt very nauseous and immediately knew a toke would help me out. Twenty feet to my left I see a guy lighting a pipe and approach him to ask for a toke. Which settles me perfectly and we proceed to connect. I immediately ascribed to him the familiar sense I had. I&#39;m typically the victim of this, I&#39;ve never been to a place like this without having at least one person who definitely  &quot;knows me&quot;. It was interesting to be on the other foot because it&#39;s so rare. We get on topic of a creative project I was developing while at the fest and he invites me to see a creative endeavour he&#39;s done so we head to his camp. This is where it gets interesting.</p>

<p>He stood up and towered over me. He felt like a father from his body language and demeanor to his speech. I was pretty certain he was a guide. As we walked towards camp, I began to have dejavu over and over again. It was uncanny. Every lamp post was completely identical, same placement of objects around. Same slope, same puddles, same placement of the sparse trees. It seemed obvious and felt strongly as though I was walking through different dimensions. Every one felt different and my friend&#39;s height changed in each one. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even really believe it but I&#39;m open to considering all sorts of things and have noticed the ME alot more since then.</p>

<p>A couple years prior I met a guy who claimed he jumped dimensions, noting how his whole friend group dynamic had shifted. Different people dating, male best friendships changing as well.</p>

<p>Has anyone else had this experience? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mention testing in your OP. I&#39;ve noticed that many people that report experiencing the ME or whatever were a part of rigorous abstract and intellectual testing while in school and were involved in AP, Honors, Excel, AGATE, AGAPE, or some other accelerated learning programs.

I have heard also that many experiencing the ME seem be &quot;thinkers,&quot; as it were, but I haven&#39;t looked into the correlation between ME/AP courses and that.  Probably because I don&#39;t see it being &quot;the reason&quot; by any stretch.  There are many intelligent, wonderful, open-minded people, highly spiritual, who did poorly in school, for the exact reason that I did well: they think.  Some rebelled, whereas I &quot;played the game.&quot;  We all realized it was a game, though.  We just had different goals in mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that correlation does not equal causation here, but it is very interesting to note that many people who have experienced ME have been tested for high intellect, whether they followed through with the program or not. </p>

<p>I also agree that many intelligent people did poorly in school. One piece of anecdotal evidence is that of my three siblings from the same father, we all started out in accelerated learning programs, but I&#39;m the only one who followed through with it. I graduated hs in the top ten of my class, was consistently in AP, honors classes, and am a premed in college. I took a nine year break for the army as a medic. My younger sister, who has a higher iq than me, dropped out in 11th grade and got heavily involved in drugs, and my younger brother dropped out in 9th grade and went to prison at age 15 following heavy drug use and a murder. They are both smarter than me, but didn&#39;t play the game at school for different reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP, I&#39;ll probably be posting several small comments, I just checked your older post regarding odd new flora.</p>

<p>What does it mean when I <em>do</em> remember the giant lily pads, several of the carnivorous plants, from my youth, yet <em>not</em> the rainbow eucalyptus, or many of the other non-manufactured coloured plants? Also, that custard apple doesn&#39;t look like it contains custard, unless custard is no longer a dairy product. I vaguely remember it, but not the name.</p>

<p>2007 is when I feel I lost my way in life, in what I want, suppose this; is it possible that Sagittarius me and Orion (cmiiw) me have failed to blend together properly? Retaining conflicting memories from both sides? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never read that book series in my life, but I could swear it&#39;s Berenstein. </p>

<p>And how <em>new</em> are we talking regarding the flora and fauna? Discovered just this past year, or discovered so long ago that you would&#39;ve known about it? </p>

<p>As I&#39;ve understood, the earth&#39;s biodiversity is beyond what we&#39;ve always estimated, and that they&#39;ve been finding new bugs and plants in jungles monthly since at least the 70&#39;s. Sadly usually nothing major enough to interest the majority of plebs.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s something weird, maybe unrelated;</p>

<p>When I was a young preteen going into puberty, I remember identifying as an otaku. I was proud of this, there was no stigma to it where I grew up.</p>

<p>Now, apparently, what I was is actually called a &#39;weeabo&#39;, and otaku is supposedly something much tamer, or even more insulting. </p>

<p>I had never heard of the term weeabo until somewhere last summer, never before in the almost 8 years I&#39;ve spent utterly obsessed over Japanese culture. It&#39;s even on knowyourmeme and urbandictionary as early as 2006, and I lived off of those sites for years. So unless someone is retroactively adding definitions for modern day words, I&#39;m either going crazy, or this Mandela effect (which I could swear is supposed to be spelled Mandala) has more than fair ground.</p>

<p>Needless to say, yet I&#39;ll say it anyway, I&#39;m kinda maybe freaking out a little. </p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s fascinating on one side, yet on the other I don&#39;t feel ready to accept this. I need to know more from you guys, I&#39;ll probably read that book soon too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to check out OP&#39;s other posts now...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think multiple timelines are merging into a single &quot;optimal timeline.&quot;  Imagine life like a Wikipedia article, where anyone can edit things at any time, but so can anyone else.  That&#39;s an oversimplification, to be sure, but look at/consider how Wikipedia handles multiple edits.  The one that ends up being accepted is the one that the majority believe in, or which is most cited.</p>

<p>So this perhaps explains &quot;residue.&quot;  The group consciousness of a bunch of people &quot;mass remembering&quot; something different results in those people having an influence on the Orion spur earth, simply by folks from that timeline being here.</p>

<p>It seems Sagittarius and Orion were the two most dominant timelines, and of the two, Orion appears to be &quot;more positive,&quot; though it&#39;s far from a utopia... yet.</p>
