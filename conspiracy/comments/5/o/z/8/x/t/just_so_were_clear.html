       The entire planet is run by an ancient death worshipping cult of psychopathic geniuses who have manipulated our physical, mental, and spiritual faculties for millennia. History is a lie and everyone in the higher class of every country has been coerced, recruited, or killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The news is fake and there to scare you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings are infinitely more powerful than we are told. Your attitude and behavior towards other life forms is what shapes our perception of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep fighting and learning the truth. It is painful, yet rewarding; difficult, yet fair; and harsh, yet kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth will come out in our lifetime, the question is if we will accept or reject it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 1: post got a lot more chatter than expected. If anyone wants to conversate privately or has interesting information about Ancient Mystery Religions, feel free to PM me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: from the bottom of my heart I would like to thank everyone who participated in this discourse; r/conspiracy is truly a bastion of freedom, and though our community is relatively small, each one of us can make a huge impact. Each of you has impacted me. I hope I have done the same for you. I wish the best for all of you. You are our last, greatest hope.

       When you finish, spend a little time thinking about the first time we, as a species, first tested and confirmed this.  Eratosthenes, who I'm assuming you're emulating, did this in ancient Greece and was surprisingly accurate.  It's pretty amazing to think how far we've come in just a few thousand years!

       Doubt is a powerful deception tactic. Wether the earth is round or not I don't know. In my experience, most flat earth theories merely place doubt around the round earth rather than prove it's flat. There are even some good real world examples that prove the earth is round and what direction the earth is spinning such as the coriolis effect. If you have stumbled upon any thing that I could read about the flat earth that are convincing I would be forever grateful.

       I do want to address one thing, which is that I just got done with my studies of Human Sacrifice, and, essentially, I would have to say, Human Sacrifice is within the divinity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Old World, Human Sacrifice continued until 1000 AD, typically at a rate of ~1,000 or so person a year. In the New World, it was infinite, with the Mexican religions sacrificing the most frequent, say 50,000 a year up till 1500 AD ish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then comes war, in which the one who eats grain, prospered, and the ones that ate flesh (natives) killed and ate the flesh of their enemies, in periods of famine, and later as custom.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's the nature and causes of human sacrifice that I find most intriguing. Sacrifice, as was most practiced in Mexico, represented the differing between the societies of man and the societies of the divine. Which is to say, as the Mexicans realized the chasms so great, that that felt it was but little right not to sacrifice, near all of man.
      </p>
      <p>
       And within the Hindu culture, the sacrifice of ones life was but enlightened suicide. To realize the bodily form has no meaning, and to voluntarily take ones life. In such a way, the mass sacrificial nature of Mexico and the individualistic practices of India were same. A service to divinity, not say of punishment, but of relief from punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then I think of christian culture. Which is to say, with Jesus sacrifice was to 'stop', as he paid for our sins. However, that is wrong. So wrong, as it absolves ourselves from the actions of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is the great danger of christian teaching, the weakness it creates, the immorality it perpetuates. The separation from life and duty, society and punishment, others and self. A christian can witness the killing of others with a clean conscious, where as the Hindu will kill themselves first, as Gandhi teaches.
      </p>
      <p>
       In such a way, human sacrifice is the most noble, moral of religions. Society is to birth and rebirth until an apex, but once born, one becomes fixed, like a tool. Fixed within a primitive system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, however, as OP has stated, the Old Primates of man, the ones in which the hereditary wealth has been passed done for centuries, millennia, have not changed, or kept up with Man. Confined within their ancient beliefs, mixed with the absolution of guilt that came with Christian teaching, the rulers have perverted the means up which they sacrifice, until now, where it has no meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rulers of Man, in their beliefs, sacrifice in a way akin to the ancient sailors that would cast off a soul in order to change the wind. For they understood not the meanings of the world around them. And likewise, as we are unable to grow without progress, we too shall sacrifice, mostly others, but occassionally ourselves, through bombs, blood sport, discontinuity, and prisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until at last, the mass of man learns to sacrifice themselves for the good of the whole. And the collective error is internalized, for always.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, to expedite this process, to reduce the failings of man, we must cycle, birth and rebirth. And no where are our failings more prevalent than in the nature of hereditary wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the money, the units that influence society, when some 50% of these units reside within the lives of so few, it creates a chasm, insurmountable. For they understand Human Sacrifice, but as the way of the most primitive. A prayer to an alien god. They sacrifice children, not themselves. They eat from the flesh of the punished.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that will be the difference. When society is individually, and collectively prepared to pay for such crimes as war, and attrition, then the end will be near. None will settle for the accepted state of things, that so few will dictate so many. That the progress of man shall be locked into an archaic past.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is to say, we shall sacrifice ourselves, for the good of all, and sacrifice those in control in proportion to their monstrosity. Collectively and individually, we will participate in the outcome, for all will accept the burden, and through such a way, the societies of man as we know them. Will end.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will be as we were intended to be. An evolving species.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mayans predicted the world would end in 2012? Holy fucking hell were they close. The evolution of our species is likely less spiritual, and more calculable, than we'd be prone to suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so will be our history. One of primates ascending to heaven.

       9/11 , Beau Biden. Are the sacrifices of primitive man, of the innocent, of the other. A prayer to a nonexistent god.

       When we sacrifice ourselves to the all, to the new. That is when it will end, the primitive race of man.

        And then I think of christian culture. Which is to say, with Jesus sacrifice was to 'stop', as he paid for our sins. However, that is wrong. So wrong, as it absolves ourselves from the actions of society.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is the opposite of Christian teaching. That's why the book of James is in there, to counteract super-spirituality and antinomianism.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A christian can witness the killing of others with a clean conscious, where as the Hindu will kill themselves first, as Gandhi teaches.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I carry a gun everywhere I go, in case I need to stop an evil man from killing. And this is virtue in Christianity:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle." (Psalm 144:1)
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus died in our place SO THEREFORE we do good works. Martin Luther King put Gandhi's words into action, in perfect harmony with the teachings of Jesus Christ.

       Agriculture. In context, native Americans primarily ate meat (or some tribes). It was said that the ones who ate grain would flourish and multiple, while those that ate meat would struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thus the white man would overcome the native Americans, in the end, regardless of intention. Or rather, a society and a culture must evolve, or die.

       That's a bit of a dark look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe your right but I think it's much more likely given the evidence I've seen that time and history are cyclical,and that we are
       <em>
        always approaching
       </em>
       another golden age and another Kali Yuga; or dark age.
      </p>

       All that exists is the "now", the present moment. If we become spiritually responsible than happiness, awareness, and integrity become second nature; isn't that the goal?

       ...the more I see, the more I think the Hindu creation myth is the most accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately for your premise, that means that these cycles of history are gigantic; interglacial millenia at least. The pithy saying I took from the subcontinent is,
       <em>
        "The world is many things: it is neither Good nor Bad."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Worrying about the ultimate fate of our species takes our minds away from the Now, the only time we can affect our condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect that you made this topic, but I cannot agree with your conclusions. The future of Truth you claim inevitable can only be found with great effort, but I would not be so bold to claim that we are on such a trajectory while the possibility of the cults you mention fully consolidating their position to the detriment of the rest of us.

       I fully understand your position, and your not wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe we are in the Dwapara Yuga or the "Grey Age". Basically it's the time when there is still some good in people, before we inevitably reach a point of absolute degradation in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, we may be entering the Kali Yuga very soon, which would really not be a fun experience, as all morals and goodness erode from man for an age.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you have to take the long view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything will be okay, and the sun will rise again. I personally love human life and all of its wonders and I was born very, very poor and into a strict religious household.

       We are already changing the timeline from what was already planned, Another great wave of awakening is on its way. Forums and places for us all to chat and expose corruption,banding together as brothers/sisters of the fight gets us all connected. The more minds connected the stronger the global consciousness is. The elites are scared, Their dark satanic blood over intent system doesnt work anymore.

       It's a good question, fate? Does it exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can honestly tell you that I don't know. What I do know is that justice is an absolute and so is balance. The universe exists the way it does
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       of balance.

       Those poor people placed on the back burner of history played their part. Every farmhand and factory worker from Beijing to Brooklyn matters and lives on in the mind of history.

      <p>
       Somewhere somehow I believe their stories continue to be told.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might say, perhaps that is wishful thinking. But, doesn't the fact that little old me would say what I'm saying, alone, give their stories meaning?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now multiply that by millions, because there are many like me; many more every day; who see the value and dignity of human life clearly.

       Great comment. I do appreciate it. If you don't mind, I have a question. It's the mother of all questions but is relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think is the meaning of life?
      </p>
      <p>
       Loaded questions: Do you think that our time in this existence is to make us reach enlightenment? Do you think that we're all one and collectively we will reach a higher state or we do so as sole souls (heh)?

       As far as your question, it's the great mystery. But I do believe everything you said is correct one way or the other. I think the universe
       <em>
        adapts
       </em>
       the same way we do, on a much larger scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps a being(s) who created Earth or the physical universe originally intended something much different and, like a clock maker, wound up time and let it loose upon itself. Maybe someone (something) altered the "machine"; changed its "programs".
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps everything is derived from an original distortion or accident, and we are truly the only creative soul; in a universe such as this we are just infants; with aeons of discovery waiting for us beyond the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps every single cell and every single moment in life; every single sound and song, and experience and thought all come from a cosmic library somewhere in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the mind itself creates these stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you keep digging into yourself you see that there is a gentle, child like appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the universe, and wa la
      </p>
      <p>
       You've arrived. 
There is no more fear of anger, only bliss.

       I tend to lean toward the pursuit of knowledge collectively creating the universe through the underlying human consciousness. With quantum physics, they say that a particle exists in multiple states until it is observed. What if through observation of things, both tiny and across large distances, we collectively shape our universe?
      </p>
      <p>
       We discovered cells, which gave way to atoms, followed by quarks. After telescopes we found other planets and galaxies. I mean, what if Earth really was flat until someone decided to check, and then it became round when it was observed to be that way? Crazy I know lol 
On the other hand, I believe if you keep zooming in on 'empty space' you eventually get to the Planck length, which supposedly looks pixellated, so maybe we are in a simulation of our universe, who knows?
As far as religion, I don't have one, but I do believe in an overarching 'cosmic energy' permeating all existence. Maybe all matter is is manifestations of that energy.

       Everything you just said resonates with me and I at least believe is possible, of not outright fact. It really is a wonderful mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think our destiny is to map our this cosmic terrain and become higher beings of intense pragmatism and benevolence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe there exists cycles as I do, it's possible we're the only intelligent beings
       <em>
        left

       in the universe.

       All the ones we've been in contact with may be ghosts.

       Maybe the universe will be ours' for the taking; and we can create a new civilization in our image; just like "god" did before us.

       Sorry to butt in, I believe this to be true. When you think about it, the only true thing that can be gained or taken away from life is knowledge. Sort of like when you play a video game... you can build things, buy things, earn money/credits and build things but once it is turned off, all that is left is the knowledge of your experience with it that improves your next experience with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every existence has experiences to learn from, some greater than others, but none the less there to learn from. Whether you choose to follow the "story quests" and advance or just "mess around" and not advance, is entirely up to you, but each life has certain meanings to learn from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before someone says, "What about a stillborn baby, what could you learn there?", well, if you look from a mother or fathers perspective, the doctors, nurses, relatives, etc., every different perspective is affected by what in a macroscopic view can seem irrelevant or miniscule.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, yeah, in a nutshell, I do believe the goal is to learn how to peacefully interact with other perspectives and ideals.

       'What's the meaning of life'? Hardest question in the world ain't it heh. That's what set me off years ago, still haven't found the absolute answer, but the more ya delve, the more ya learn, no doubt about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       After years of reading, fooling myself, learning, guessing and hoping, I've ended up with a bunch of answers that I didn't even know there was a question for if that makes sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember first starting out years back (maybe twenty), I was determined to find 'answers' to the 'mysteries' I'd convinced myself existed from the past and also to discover wtf I was even supposed to be doing on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened for me was, I couldn't stop 'going back in time' it was always a case of 'this is interesting but what did people think/do before that,'. So from reading about 'Mysterious Wales in the 1600s', I ended up in Ancient Sumeria learning about their mysteries and religion. Not quite sure where I'm going with this now I've been papping for ages! Think I was gonna say, start with what interests you and see where you end up, you'll be amazed at the answers you'll find!
      </p>
      <p>
       Must admit after years of delving, I'm kinda on the right path (I think) of discovering my/a 'purpose'. Haven't a clue what to do next but I'm gonna carry on searching, even if I'm just kidding myself, I've learnt so much along the way, I can only be a better person as a result surely? Hope so anyway heh.

       We are in the end times, to me it's really strange that these globalist satanist are aware of it, but still worship their symbols and do the most sickening things, and even islam knows this. If they are aware of the Bible and the rapture, they obviously know it's going to happen, but they rather just say no, its worth having those few years on earth to finish our agenda, then spend eternity paying for it.
I just don't get it.
But we are the end times for sure. We might get another 3.5 years, or several more years, but I don't think it's much longer than that and I DO NOT WANT to be here if I'm "left behind" the world is going to be hell. 
Globalists getting to be public with what they do behind closed doors and inflicting it on everyone? As well as chipping people, imagine ISIS controlling every country. Islam is Satans key, it pops up during history trying for world domination, and gets crushed back down, but no, it will rise and it will be they key for all of this.

       it means that "just becoz a book a a shitty as cover, that doesn't mean it can't have some amzing kick ass stories or information
       <em>
        inside
       </em>
       that shitty

        looking

       cover"
      </p>
      <p>
       after all, books are for reading the ideas inside, not  gawkng at the cover wouldn't you say? You don't stay on the first page of a magazine do you either? It's
       <em>
        what's inside
       </em>
       that counts!

       i agree that the world is run by death cults.
      </p>
      <p>
       christianity is a death cult itself, one of the most cynical, right up there with buddism?
      </p>
      <p>
       the whole premise is to put your faith in an invisible messiah who will reward you with eternal happiness...the catch being you have to die first.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reason death cults rule the world is because they were one of the only effective means of suppressing upprisings from the underclass, because (a) they acknowledged life is suffering (which it invariably is for the slave and underclasses), (b) it offerred a jack and the beanstick bargain to those with no bargaining power--5 beans for decades of labor, to take you to heaven upon deatn, and (c) it provided an outlet for the rage and dispair people felt caused by their unjust, inequitable treatment by promising that their persecutors would get what's coming to them when they died...and of course no one could come back and expose the fraud, because, well, they were dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       the heroic religions that the death cult religions replaced, all said, "death sucks, being dead sucks, the place you go when you die sucks, so enjoy life"--with one exception, the only way to motivate people to risk their lives in battle when they believed being alive is infintely preferable to being dead, was to create eternal blisses for soldiers--valhalla and the elysian fields for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       peoples who never developed rigid, oppressive class systems and/or were not belicose, retained animistic shamanism, being one with the world. where everything in existence is one and all time is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       the one exception, the only unique religion, which is simultaneously not a religion, is confuscianism. though confuscianism's stricture on knowing and accepting one's place in society, functions like a death cult, without the bribery.
      </p>
      <p>
       as more and more people become a-religious, they become harder to manage. the "don't worry, it gets good once you're dead" doesn't sell anymore. the "accept one's place in society" doesn't have traction in a democratic worldview. dying for glory died at verdun.
      </p>
      <p>
       the oligarch have always been the leaders of the death cults, but the reaction of the public is no longer awe and fear, it is meh and ewww and wtf.
      </p>
      <p>
       we are on the verge of returning to the eternal now, those who feel oneness with all else is growing. i think we will not achieve your goal until we embrace oneness.

       What you see today as Christianity has zero basis or bible truth. According to the Bible the earth was created for humans and heavens were created for spirit beings. We were meant to live in harmony and without death until a rebellion happened giving humans the opportunity to show if we have what it takes to rule without the creator. This experiment has utterly failed as you can see all around you. The new age is coming swiftly and everything will be restored and renewed.

       Actually that is kinda how it works lol. In the Bible it says that after this current age ends there's 1000 years of life under the kingship of Jesus, then after that there's a second permanent death of all those opposed to life under those conditions. Then after that the entirety of the will of the creator will be complete and humans will live forever in a glorified state once again like the conditions of the garden of eden.

       We absolutely won't achieve anything as an individual (spiritually speaking) until we accept oneness and the brotherhood of the universe. Religions have been taken captive, this is true; but the kernel of truth within them is invulnerable, an absolute truth; that there IS something beyond our idea of existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       That something is within us. It's always been there. When you watched the nerdy kid in school get picked on, and did nothing; when you watched the innocent homeless man beg for money and respect but sat idle; that something was tugging at your heart strings.

       Within Christianity, it's the Bible. The church has taught all kinds of horrible, twisted distortions of what it says (sex is evil, God hates fags, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you sit down and read the text freshly, and are willing to put in the work to interpret it properly (historical context, understanding literary genre, etc.) it is remarkably different from the caricature most people reject.

       Some people think being nice is being weak. So being human is weak? So spreading joy is weak?

       I agree with that, look at the two political parties, both sides are convinced that one another are the devils despite the fact that the very devils they both openly despise find both sides of the aisle. There was, is, and never will be a left vs. right paradigm, only the illusion of such a thing. If people saw this then they could upend and destroy the chains that bid them to servitude, instead they just go on ignoring this and pretend their lives are just a game of political football with devastating actions in there wake.

       Oh boy, there's a lot. Off the top of my head, Jesus' discussion (rooted in the book of Zechariah) of the good and bad shepherds, and the book of Jude are good places to start.

       Confucianism is a religion?

      <p>
       In what sense?

      <p>
       (It's a philosophical system.)

      <p>
       Just like Buddhism originally was.

       It was no more a "religion" than Greek stoic philosophy.

       I think some people use a more basic definition of religion in which it simply means "a way of life." Sure, a better word for such exists, but I do think that might be what's occurring in this instance.

       buddhism doesn't teach "it gets good when you're dead" or "life is suffering" lol it teaches it'll be a dream-like cycle of pleasure and suffering for infinity and if you want to get out of that then you might be able to do it one day by becoming more aware of your being part of the universe.

       They use geniuses todo their bidding. And some of them were in fact geniuses; Albert Pike, Napoleon, Karl Marx, Adolf Hitler, etc; history is riddled with "mighty men" who played heroes but were in fact villains.

       This is nonsense. The world is perfect and none of this is true. If it was, my favorite celebrities and politicians would have told me so! They would never lie to, or purposely misguide me. Anyways, back to my iPhone 17, gotta upload 15 more selfies because of the narcissistic personality traits I've devolved thanks to our hedonistic, celebrity worshipping society.

       How is this any different than religion and doomsday/rapture predictions?  At least theirs give a date other than "within our lifetime."

      <p>
       I agree with the overall premise of your claims and your intentions, but some form of this global manipulation has been ongoing for generations upon generations.  This, coupled with the fact that you have to use poetry to convey meaning doesn't add to your assertion that this will all fall in the near future.

       What truth are you expecting? With the internet, ideas can be spread faster than any other time in human history. The truth might come out faster if you state it, rather than cryptically hinting at it.

       It's sort of a metaphor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth I'm speaking of is the knowledge of human dignity; our true history as a species, our unparalleled innovation and determination; our ability to love so purely as to envelop all other dispositions. We are creators not creations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, we have been lied to; many people realize this, albeit at varying degrees of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is that someday we will reach that boiling point when enough people are mad and curious about enough stuff, that we tip the balance in or favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, on a spiritual, individual level (the most important and sacred level) this has already been achieved by many of our ancestors and constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a macro-level we are the first generation in known history to have access to the power of Truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not hinting at anything. It's all around you. Breathe in the delicate, tense air. War is coming; a war between good and evil, between the soul and the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now do you see what I mean? The truth is out. It's the ability to see, perceive, and
       <em>
        accept
       </em>
       truth that we are lacking.

       If Humans can unhinge emotion from intellect we will truly make great strides.

       I love this post, thank you!

       For anybody looking for a little backup info, this video is the very, very tip of the biggest conspiratorial iceberg humanity has ever seen.
       <a href="https://www.gaia.com/video/message-humankind">

       I watched this and scoffed at the person who showed it to me. But then I got curious. I started watching more. Yes, theres a subscription fee. But, the first month for a Gaia subscription is 99 cents and I watched the whole series in that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence just piles up. I was not much of a  conspiracy theorist before I watched these. I knew the US orchestrated 9/11, but I didn't think the mass shootings were false flags. I knew extraterrestrials existed, but didn't think they were here. I knew the politicians were corrupt, but I didn't know they were literally satan worshipping baby eaters. I went from Berniebro to Alex Jones in less than a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I also had a serious hunger for the spiritual mysteries, and Cosmic Disclosure actually led me to the most incredible resource I've ever read: thelawofone.info , a summary derived from The Law of One books.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things pieced together so well, I voraciously devoured the material. I'm still working through it all. One thing is certain, it's changed my life. Take a look for yourself. With an open mind, there's no limit to the truth you can discover.

       Keep reading my friend, every source you named with exception of Alex Jones has
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       to offer you.

      <p>
       I would listen to Alan Watts, Terence McKenna, Manly P. Hall, Aleister Crowley (most mysterious man of the 20th century, be careful; could be a trap but great context material), Graham Hancock, David Icke (with a grain of salt), and there's like them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also go back and read Zechariah Sitchin and the early sci-fi work in the 50's and 60's.

       More truth than fiction in some those books.

       That's funny you say that, prior to my introduction to the Cosmic Disclosure, I was binging every Terence McKenna lecture I could through The Psychedelic Salon podcast. I'd say he's the one that divorced me fully from scientific materialism, authorizing my ascent to non-organized-religion-based spirituality.

       Well, you have to realize that human brains are made to pay attention to 2 things in particular:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Danger
       </li>
       <li>
        Sex
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You'll have a hard time to ignore those 2 signals, in whatever for, they come in. Your brain will pay attention to it. The television and telemarketing people are very aware of this and purposefully using it to their advantage. There's a good reason some publicity on the radio will start with car horns so that your brain will pay attention to their publicity. Likewise, the television folks like to remind us of imminent dangers to keep us glued to their channel, to get more profit.

       Anyone can step up and be a leader. You just have to have balls.

       It is round. Very similar to a "Snow Globe". It is a holographic sphere that only projects what is being observed. A simulation within a simulation. The "Dark Mirror" episode "White Christmas" shows it quite clearly..

       Yeah I've been having a difficult time lately feeling like everything is artificial, and finally knowing what "living in a simulation" ACTUALLY is. I've always read into different theories since I was 11..and I don't know, it finally just crushed me this past week. It's making it really difficult and hard to wonder why they say -people could rise against the government - but WHY DONT WE? WHY DO WE LET PEOPLE WHO WORSHIP A SATAN CULT THAT PUT SYMBOLS UP AND RITUALS AND BUILD SHIT IN SHAPE FOR IT, LIKE WHY DO WE LET THEM DO THIS? WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE THEIR WAY? WHY DO THEY LIVE ON A DIFFERENT REALM, CREATE A FAKE REALITY FOR US, THEN JUST DO THE WEIRDEST FUCKING SHIT THAT THEY LITERALLY PUT EVERYWHERE? 
WHY DO WE PUT UP WITH IT?
WHY DON'T WE SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM THEM? WHAT IF THERE WAS A COUPE AND WE NO LONGER LIVED UNDER PEOPLE WHO WORSHIP SATANIC BEINGS AND DO THE MOST FUCKED UP SHIT.
D.C. SCARES ME THE WAY EVERYTHING IS SET UP AND WHY THEY SET IT UP THAT WAY, DENVER AIRPORT MAKES ME REALIZE ITS ALL ARTIFICIAL.
I'm sorry I'm just really trying the past week to find a way to compose all these thoughts.

       The Order of the Quest, The Brotherhood, Illuminati, whatever you want to call these people...have engineered out ENTIRE reality. It really is mind boggling when you scratch your neurons together. Is it really just a group of people in a secret society(ies) controling the world for the past however many thousands of years?
      </p>
      <p>
       One day did 5000 years ago some friends come together and say, "Hey you know we have a lot of knowledge about the world, our bloodlines can take it over eventually and hoard all the information about the universe and our reality, what do you guys say?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Have we actually been controlled by reptilians from the lower 4th dimension? (Seriously, why do so many people discredit this? You don't even know what a fucking black hole is, how do you know there aren't being in other dimensions controlling us? I totally get people shitting on this theory, but fuck it really is annoying that people don't try to give ANY thought towards more "crazy" theories...they are engineered this way though!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Are the Greys controlling us? Other aliens? Is it Anunnaki from Nibiru who genetically created Humans to be their slave race such as Zacheria Sitchen claims? Or are we just in a simulation, and the elites figured this out? Are we vastly powerful spiritual beings expiring a life in the third dimension, have always been and always will be? Or do we just zonk out into blackness and the non-existent when we die? Why would the elites give a fuck to do all of this? So they can live their measly 90 years on Earth kind of ruling it from behind the veil? So their kids can rule it? Honestly, it makes me think there is more to life, after death, and all that because of everything they are doing. Do they really value their offspring that much to try to make them the rulers of the world? I mean 100 years ago the elites didn't totally rule the planet, and today they don't. They don't have their one world government, one religion yet. So why do it, for their kids some day, or their kids kids? Or do they know something, do they know they'll be around after this life?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are the royal bloodlines ruling us made up of the same DNA that we are, they just figured out how to rule the planet long ago and have been working on it ever since? When was that, Roman times?
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of knowledge are they hoarding? Do these satanic rituals really work? Is it simply just tradition, or is there real purpose? If there is real purpose, that means there is some kind of force the general public does not know about. Is it spiritual, magic, who the fuck knows but it sure isn't in our realm of knowledge if there really is something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is their end goal...everyone says its to kill off 99% of the worlds population right? Is that after they use us to build their infrastructure, or what? We know they are soft-killing us, AIDS, cancer, vaccines, wars, H1N1, etc..idk. Too many thoughts for this evening!

       i have a very unpopular theory on all this i'd love to share.
but i haven't made all the links i want to make just yet to make it make as much sense as possible.
once i get it all sorted out i'll probably make a post.

       Well history is written by the victors. Let's just say there were no good guys in WWI or WWII. Our current world civilization is derived from that false war.

       That's just what has happened in the last generation though. The elite have been influencing wars and political uprisings since Ancient Egypt.

       Tenochtilan was the largest city in the world in 1500. 19 years before Hernan Cortes massacred the populace.

       The entire history of the Aztecs and Maya were compromised. They had relics of a past civilization now erased from the memory of history.

       I don't know, I know all kinds of stuff about the disappearance of the American cultures. I know this because I've read about half of 1491, a book by an American. There are Muslim scholars studying Jesus. Historians, in general, study events, and generally they are very far removed from the situation, certainly if more than 100 years have passed since, and they're often neither the victor nor the loser, who may both be long dead, and the end result is that history may not, in fact, be written by the victor in most cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       History is written by Historians.

       They will, but historians will not necessarily take their word for it. Certainly not after everyone involved is dead.

       Reading half a book doesn't make us an expert. I also don't really understand your argument. Your correct that historians are usually far removed from the periods they write about, but that doesn't have anything to do with the actual control of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       If tomorrow Trump and all the other word leaders decided Christianity isn't okay anymore and is punishable by death, hen bibles would burned, entire groups of people would cease to exist, and the memory of Jesus would be irreversibly forgotten over the course of a few decades; when a new generation grows up without hearing about him.

       I wasn't saying I'm an expert on ancient American civilizations, I was saying that a book about them exists. Written by someone who is neither victor nor loser, analyzing history in an impartial way.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       The victor usually doesn't destroy all information about the loser. Virtually every war we know about had a losing side, and if someone who is uninvolved knows anything about the war, they know about the losing side, and if they're not actively controlled by the victor I don't see why their perception of the losing side wouldn't be impartial.

       As happened many a time before. We know about these conflicts, both sides of them, one was the victor but we see both sides as primitive tribal cultures, because history was written by modern historians.

       The prominent culture would be prominent. And that would be part of history, when it's written a hundred years later, by impartial historians.

       This is spiritual warfare.  This is the plot of every book you have ever read, every movie you have ever seen.  Good vs Evil.   These people are not only evil but calling on evil forces and have been since the beginning of time. 
The sad thing is this... God has become a dirty word.  God (good) has become something to be mocked.  What chance do we have against this evil without our own spritual forces to fight against them??

       Ancient its not, but since rome founded the Vatican eradicated our pagan (hindu) heritage and started its recent history project. Basicly eveything is based on Lies and this is an on going project. These are total psycho people we are dealing with and they will fail eventually because they are in the dark obsessed with power and control. The light and truth is more appealing to the human side of us which will eventually overcome the madness...

       This is a cyclic thing. Corruption of power, Corruption is purged and light enters to lead with heart and knowledge....

       Ah the scientific mind, no. 
Truth is, the truth has been under your nose the whole time. We're all just too scared and selfish to look.

       I'm simply trying to express what I know to be true; that is, that the world is very very dark, but, like all stories, of we stick through it together, the light will shine again.

       I fully understand your position, and your not wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe we are in the Dwapara Yuga or the "Grey Age". Basically it's the time when there is still some good in people, before we inevitably reach a point of absolute degradation in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, we may be entering the Kali Yuga very soon, which would really not be a fun experience, as all morals and goodness erode from man for an age.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you have to take the long view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything will be okay, and the sun will rise again. I personally love human life and all of its wonders and I was born very, very poor and into a strict religious household.
