       You are really underestimating the_donald. Bots and scripts are highly scrutinized over there. It is one of the most active subreddits, and when it is time to be heard, the hivemind makes it happen.

       That's 16,548 active users as of when I took that screen shot moments ago. Bots would not register as individual active users in the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless we're all just bots talking to each other. When it's time to get the point across, upvotes do more than comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, "A" and "J" are the hot keys to Upvote and next post. If you want me to explain the computer science behind why bots wouldn't register as individual users. That's going to have to wait until I get home.

       I know exactly why myself and tens of thousands of others were upvoting literally every post. It was a reaction. A call to arms as you will. Reddit is waiting for any excuse to ban the_donald. Any talk of script or bot voting is prohibited and bannable as it jeopardizes the sub.

       It has seemed to me they are deeply afraid of what they would unleash were they to shut it down. Here's more examples, again at around 13.k, again I picked posts that were not shitposts.

       most of us vote up posts without looking at them. But more of our users are silent up voters voting posts with nothing to add to the conversation. if you haven't been able to tell, we are VERY different from the rest of reddit

       Welcome to The_Donald. I know our levels of high energy are off the charts and that of which you will likely never reach, but that's no reason to call us fake bots. It's people like you and OP that spark the energy to all the users making us want to go and upvote everything we see there just to trigger you(:

       And I will add my rebuttal to that from the thread we were just discussing this in:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I see what you are saying, and I would normally agree with you. But, there are special circumstances in regards to t_d. At one point in time it was so heavily brigaded by just about everyone, the response was for all the users to upvote every post. And they do, that is part of the game, and was part of the gaming of /all that led to t_d being blocked from reaching there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part of the meme of t_d is rabid bandwagoning. Go look at the current state of the sub. It is entirely made of the same pic of DJT, to many many pages deep, I honestly couldn't find the end of it. This is the typical silly over-reaction that is typical of the sub, and completely organic. Overposting, shitposting, anything taken to absurdity is the name of the game.
       </p>
       <p>
        T_d users consume the entire sub, from new to best, and vote on every goddamn post whether they read it or not. That is the game, that has been the game for months. And it isn't bots. Or, if there are bots they amount to about +35 votes. At least that has been my observation, the battles between the 2 sets of bots results in a net +35 or so. When that baseline changes, that is when I know there is organic brigading probably going on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Specifically looking at the post you mentioned, which you would expect to get a lot of interest, there is another behavior on t_d that caused your confusion. Every post of interest is posted at least 20 times. So, while that seems interesting to you, I have already seen it a bazillion times. And I might vote on it to get it off my feed, but I will not go into it or comment.

       I don't really think they are jealous, it is unfathomable, and unbelievable. And the best part is we do all that, and it isn't that serious. People outside of t_d take t_d fuckin wayyy more seriously than any of the users.
