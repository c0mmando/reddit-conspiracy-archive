<p>That&#39;s 16,548 active users as of when I took that screen shot moments ago. Bots would not register as individual active users in the sub. </p>

<p>Unless we&#39;re all just bots talking to each other. When it&#39;s time to get the point across, upvotes do more than comments.</p>

<p>Also, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;J&quot; are the hot keys to Upvote and next post. If you want me to explain the computer science behind why bots wouldn&#39;t register as individual users. That&#39;s going to have to wait until I get home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I will add my rebuttal to that from the thread we were just discussing this in:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see what you are saying, and I would normally agree with you. But, there are special circumstances in regards to t_d. At one point in time it was so heavily brigaded by just about everyone, the response was for all the users to upvote every post. And they do, that is part of the game, and was part of the gaming of /all that led to t_d being blocked from reaching there.</p>

<p>Part of the meme of t_d is rabid bandwagoning. Go look at the current state of the sub. It is entirely made of the same pic of DJT, to many many pages deep, I honestly couldn&#39;t find the end of it. This is the typical silly over-reaction that is typical of the sub, and completely organic. Overposting, shitposting, anything taken to absurdity is the name of the game.</p>

<p>T_d users consume the entire sub, from new to best, and vote on every goddamn post whether they read it or not. That is the game, that has been the game for months. And it isn&#39;t bots. Or, if there are bots they amount to about +35 votes. At least that has been my observation, the battles between the 2 sets of bots results in a net +35 or so. When that baseline changes, that is when I know there is organic brigading probably going on.</p>

<p>Specifically looking at the post you mentioned, which you would expect to get a lot of interest, there is another behavior on t_d that caused your confusion. Every post of interest is posted at least 20 times. So, while that seems interesting to you, I have already seen it a bazillion times. And I might vote on it to get it off my feed, but I will not go into it or comment.</p>

 They just don&#39;t understand how we work and to be honest, I think most of reddit is jealous of our energy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really think they are jealous, it is unfathomable, and unbelievable. And the best part is we do all that, and it isn&#39;t that serious. People outside of t_d take t_d fuckin wayyy more seriously than any of the users. </p>

<p>They miss the most important lesson there too. People can be powerful, even if it is just banging a comment forum raw doggie. People can have unbelievable power when they work together.</p>
