        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Something interesting/suspicious about John Brennan, current CIA director under Obama:</p>

<ul>
<li>1996 Brennan is head of CIA in Saudi Arabia</li>
<li>Brennan CEO and president of TAC (private intelligence contractor) in 2005</li>
<li>In early 2008, TAC caught accessing records of President Obama and John McCain, creating a scandal - for purposes not made public. </li>
<li>Late 2008 Obama puts Brennan as front runner for CIA director position, but his ties to Bush admin and torture of captured terrorists prevent this nomination from being successful</li>
<li>Obama places him as Homeland Security Adviser and Deputy National Security Adviser for Counterterrorism, a position which requires no nomination and Obama has full authority over.</li>
<li>Brennan openly covers up war atrocities committed under Obama in 2011</li>
<li>2013 Brennan finally confirmed by congress to be CIA director</li>
</ul>

<p>Does this suspicious sequence of events sound like Brenna dug up some political dirt to worm his way into Obama&#39;s administration, did Obama dirty work, and eventually got nominated to CIA director, after also having DEEP ties to Saudi Arabia?</p>

<p>Full timeline here:
*** In November 2005, John O. Brennan was appointed president and CEO of The Analysis Corporation (TAC) - an intelligence contractor with ties to nearly every intelligence agency in the US. The Analysis Corporation (TAC) was the Intelligence Solutions business of Global Defense Technology &amp; Systems, Inc. (&quot;GTEC&quot;), now renamed Sotera Defense Solutions, a defense contracting company. Since its inception in 1990, TAC has been working on projects in the counterterrorism and national security realm by supporting national watchlisting activities as well as other CT requirements.
*** In early 2008 TAC found itself in the midst of a scandal when a State Department spokesman revealed that a TAC contractor, formerly a retired State Department employee, gained unauthorized access on March 14 to the passport records for Barack Obama and John McCain.
*** In late 2008 Brennan was the reported choice for Director of the CIA in the incoming Obama administration. Brennan withdrew his name from consideration because of opposition to his CIA service under President George W. Bush and past public statements he had made in support of enhanced interrogation and the transfer of terrorism suspects to countries where they might be tortured.
*** In January 2009, Mr. Brennan was selected by President Barack Obama to serve in his administration as Homeland Security Adviser and Deputy National Security Adviser for Counterterrorism. In March 2013, Brennan was appointed director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
*** In June 2011, Brennan claimed that US counter-terrorism operations had not resulted in &quot;a single collateral death&quot; in the past year because of the &quot;precision of the capabilities that weâ€™ve been able to develop. (THIS WAS PROVEN TO BE A LIE)
*** United States President Barack Obama twice nominated Brennan to serve as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, first on January 7, 2013.</p>
