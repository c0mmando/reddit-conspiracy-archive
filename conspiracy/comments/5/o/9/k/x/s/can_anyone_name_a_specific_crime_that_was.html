<p>I have noticed that in all those threads that get psuhed down our throats, no actual evidence for any crime related to pizzagate is presented.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m wondering why this narrative gets pushed to hard. What&#39;s the endgame?</p>

<p>Probably some kind of datamining or databasing of people less than able in using rational thinking?  </p>

<p>Or maybe it&#39;s just to create just enough discord in the conspiracy community to make the able minded people give up and leave?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok... the guy with the gun allegedly fired once (no witnesses reported any gunshots and we&#39;re surprised when the reports of shots fired appeared in media). That one shot destroyed the computer in the establishment.... </p>

<p>Coincidence? The guy supposedly investigating fired one shot that destroyed any hope of retrieving any evidence of what was hidden behind the strangely encrypted pizza menus that were far too large to be an actual menu... hmmmm. </p>

<p>So what kind of evidence are you looking for? There&#39;s plenty of evidence that the owner collects and publicly displays artwork that depicts child abuse, sometimes ritualistic or group abuse. There was also the penis ejaculating slices of pizza on the wall, a hallmark for any family establishment (as claimed by the website). Don&#39;t forget that the business logo was the EXACT &quot;triangle swirl as drawn by a very young child&quot; that was shown in the fbi disclosure of symbols before this all started and the establishment immediately changed the logo. Why further encrypt the pizza menus available on the Web page if there isn&#39;t something hidden in them (which it was already obvious there was)? The band&#39;s that frequently play there have an odd obsession with the topic of graphic child abuse as well. </p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more just surrounding this one guy and he&#39;s the tip of the iceberg. I really feel that the name pizza gate was intended to place doubt on anyone investigating, but I don&#39;t doubt that this pizza guy has things he&#39;s hiding. At the very least he&#39;s inclined towards pedo-art. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it says cheese pizza on urban dictionary. </p>

<p>If used commonly enough  (which as evidenced by the emails this code word or slang is heavily used) a term will be shortened but retain it&#39;s original meaning to those &quot;in the know&quot;. Think barbee as short for barbecue or a slew of other examples.</p>

<p>You would like to hang on this one point and it&#39;s meaningless. They could be talking about a black market shipment of headphones and it still wouldn&#39;t mean that this guy isn&#39;t associated with pedorists and doesn&#39;t enjoy pedo-stylized art. </p>

<p>I believe you&#39;re conflating a trial with an investigation. One does not require a lot of concrete evidence to initiate, the other does. Are you aware there is a difference?</p>

<p>You can be investigated because of a minor error on your tax returns, or because you look slightly like someone else who is wanted for a crime. </p>

<p>Bringing an investigation to trial requires legitimate evidence, and enough of it to convince a jury.</p>

<p>Because in those case there&#39;s an actual suspicion of an actual crime that has been committed - pizza-gate still lacks this, so the conjecture still doesn&#39;t matter a bit, without a crime to tie it to, conjecture is just a bunch of claims.  </p>

<p>The guy can pose a creepy a public image as he likes, since that&#39;s isn&#39;t illegal.<br/>
<em>If</em>, and only if someone could actually point to a specific crime that this guy could possible be involved in, yes then there might be reason to investigate him. But creeping some people out, is and should not, be reason for opening a police investigation against someone.</p>

<p>If your neighbor hears you yelling and slamming shit around</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah - he <em>hears</em> you slamming shit around - but no shit is being slammed around, other than people slamming shit online on a guy that owns a pizza place, of course he&#39;s not getting investigated, he&#39;s the one getting harassed by keyboard warriors and people shotting up his pizza place.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a well placed bullet will destroy a hard drive.  </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t answer the question, how does the fact that a hard drive is destroyed make it impossible for the police or anyone else to retrieve information from it? - I know that you can&#39;t use in your computer anymore, when it has been shot, but doesn&#39;t keep you from getting the information, and just putting it on a another harddrive if you want to read it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever you believe doesn&#39;t alter the difference between a court case and an investigation. His business associates, prefered bands, and friends all have pedorist themes in common. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at our hypothetical situation again with that in mind. We can even start from your perspective. Angry neighbor calls police for no reason because you gave them a dirty look once and claims there&#39;s domestic abuse taking place at your house on a regular basis. They also hand the police a video from a couple of years back when you threw that awesome party at your house. They point out the artwork on your walls is super misogynistic and violent and that the band playing at the party sings almost exclusively about beating women. When the police knock on your door they are greeted by some legendary wife beater. Chris Brown or someone like that. Would you expect them to investigate? Maybe do a sweep and just make sure everything is on the up and up? Ya.... not even a sweep for the pizza guy. He&#39;s just auto-innocent. I was ready to call it a hoax until the msm started their fake news chant. How panicked must these people be to discredit their own industry in such a way? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all true but there&#39;s something here or the backlash would have carried a completely different tone. </p>

<p>Hard drives provide all storage capacity for a computer. The bulk of information is here. W/o a hard drive you would get very little information aside from the last things viewed on the pc. Forensic investigators have a very hard time retrieving data from a destroyed hard drive and someone who is intentionally destroying it and knew where to put the bullet could destroy all the data permanently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still theres nothing of what you&#39;re saying that is convincing me why this guy should be investigated?<br/>
I guess its the same with the police, even though they don&#39;t need hard evidence to start an investigation, they would need just a shred of something that actually gave anyone the idea that any law has been broken, before they start an investigation.<br/>
In the case you present, i guess the legendary wife beater has previously actually committed the crime of beating his wife, but if the police shows up and the guys either single or the wife is not even there, what is there to investigate? Which is the case here, no prior crimes and no recent crimes, no victims etc.   </p>

<p>and just because forensic investigators have a hard time doing it, doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t - doctors also have a hard time making triple bypass surgerys, but that doesn&#39;t keep them from doing them. It just means that they get payed a lot, because the have job that is difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there you go then. Maybe that&#39;s all there is to it. The police won&#39;t investigate because having a large group of powerful friends get together and share their different forms of pedorist artwork isn&#39;t illegal, and neither is having renowned pedos over</p>

<p>Does that disprove anything? Why isn&#39;t this dude just 100% transparent about things since he&#39;s going on interview to disprove the claims? Sure didn&#39;t help anything that he lied about the basement. Why mention it at all if you aren&#39;t going to be honest? </p>

<p>I want to believe it&#39;s all bullshit. I have a hard time believing it though when I look at history. Look at the Pentagon scandal that Anderson Cooper reported a few years back. 8 month investigation closed due to lack of resources. There&#39;s your pizzagate whether the pizza guy is part of it or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can agree with you on this. I think the name pizza gate was a label intended to discredit the whole thing since the beginning and now all anyone that hears about it wants to discuss are the allegations against this one pizza guy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m less interested in the pizza guy than the rest of what&#39;s involved anyway. The investigation should be around human trafficking and people in government since that&#39;s what it&#39;s really about and that&#39;s where the money is.  Scotland, Australia, UK, Vatican.... it&#39;s definitely happening here too as evidenced by the Pentagon scandal. Human trafficking is also one of the most lucrative businesses to be in apparently so it would be tempting to the greedy psychopaths that get in to politics to appease their need for power. It would also make sense that traffickers would have the cash to buy political influence. </p>

<p>I think the investigation should start at the Pentagon where it left off. The American people should stop putting faith in to the characters these political actors portray on TV, admit there&#39;s fuckery afoot, and move forward under the assumption that there are good and bad people on both sides of the Isle that will require heavy scrutiny in order to determine which is which instead of constantly creating excuses for them and saying things like &quot;owell, all politicians are like that.&quot;. </p>

<p>I also think that we should reestablish our frame of mind surrounding public service. Politicians are public servants and should be treated as such. They are there to serve us but wield these awesome powers. Fine. If you want power and political influence then I think that you should be forced to make great sacrifices in order to attain them. In fact I&#39;m not averse to the idea that public servants should be made to live stream their entire lives uncensored for a certain amount of time before running for public office. It&#39;s gotten that bad. Only people who get in to politics for the right reasons deserve to be there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t disagree with much of this either  </p>

<p>Pizzagate disturbs me for several reasons:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>People that support pg seem more than eager to write away any form of legal rights that these people have, without ever thinking how taking away people&#39;s legal rights might come back to bite themselves in the ass - you know like sheep to the  slaughterhouse.  </p></li>
<li><p>The eagerness to spend real police resources on made-up crimes, which would take away police resources that could be spend fighting actual crime. If the police go and investigate some pizzaplace, because reddit and likes &quot;sure thinks theres something fishy to this&quot;, well that&#39;s time spend away form something else.  </p></li>
<li><p>The discord that it creates in the conspiracy community. This sub used to be about outing goverment injustices and looking out for police harassment, whereas now there&#39;s a bunch of people actively crying out for less justice, and more policestate - without realizing that is what they&#39;re doing, and without ever giving it any rational thought to <em>why</em> they&#39;re doing it, because its you know, it&#39;s about kids. There was even a guy that claimed to have gotten death threats, for asking critical questions about pizzagate in here (whether or not the threats were true, i don&#39;t know).</p></li>

The connection to the restaurant comes from the exchanges about Alefantis from the podesta emails.
Again, the pizza places appear to be just the front where the victims are displayed.
The crimes happen by the thousands everywhere around the world, but if any victim survives and comes up with it, they are ridiculed and dismissed by the media whose bosses are compromised, like New York times editor in chief who defended Jimmy Saville and now is defending the ones involved here.</p>

Must be where the molesting is happening because the chairman for the democratic presidential candidate emailing about a fundraiser must be pedo speak and not him literally doing his job.</p>

<p>For CPP, you will get talk of instagram, basements, and satanism.  You ask for evidence and they move the goalposts to some vague international pedophile ring which happens to entail any arrest and news article of any pedophile ring.  </p>

<p>You will ask,&quot; what does some pedo ring in Norway have to do with Podesta or CPP?&quot;  They will give some vague answer about global pedos and they are getting closer, but they aren&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>Finding victims and witnesses is unlikely until a break occurs. Jimmy Savile fucked kids since the 1960&#39;s and nothing came out until after his death in the early 2000&#39;s. There was certainly enough rumors that insiders at the BBC had heard about his behavior, but nothing came out.  </p>

<p>Bill Cosby partied away for the better part of his career also, but it wasn&#39;t until multiple women came forward did the story truly break.  </p>

<p>So, if you consider the accusations about pizzagate involve the global elite who are also potentially tied in with intelligence agencies and private military corporations, I think finding a body or witness it going to be pretty damned unlikely for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, part of your question was if there were witnesses or victims. There were no witnesses or victims in the Dahmer case either until a fridge full of heads got found.</p>

<p>Just like pizzagate there was a <em>lot</em> of circumstantial evidence in the Dahmer case. Residents noticed smells and noises and even reported it to the police. The police even found Dahmer with one of his drugged victims and let him go. </p>

<p>So, yes there is plenty of circumstantial evidence (see pizzagate.wiki) but until a warranted police raid occurs and court trial happens we, the public, aren&#39;t likely to see or hear about it. The best we can do is pressure authorities to investigate much like residents in Dahmers apartment building did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>support for, backing for, reinforcement for, grounds for &quot;they found evidence of his participation in the burglary&quot;  </p>

<p>See pizzagate.wiki because there is ample evidence that supports, backs up, reinforces or provides grounds to believe the situation is real. </p>

<p>Physical evidence and that which verifies, substantiates, corroborates, affirms, authenticates, attests, or documents the case would be attained through warranted police searches of suspects. Whether or not those warranted searches have occurred is beyond my scope of knowledge. I suspect they haven&#39;t because local DC police deiced that there was insufficient evidence to pursue investigation based on the fact they thought claims were silly, and not based upon a review of any evidence presented to them. <em>(sounds a lot like the Dahmer case here).</em></p>

<p>So... is there a body? No. 
Is there a witness? No. 
Is there evidence? Using your own criteria, yes. </p>

<p>I live in scandinavia, and there we have had a few very public crimes committed by by self identified satanists, church burnings and assaults, rapes and murders - these guys where not really trying to hide anyting when doing these crimes.  </p>

<p>So in the few documented cases involving satanists, they were not trying to hide anything about their satanism, which just makes me wonder why some people claim that satanists hide, and claim to know about the symbols and codes that satanists use - you would have to either be &quot;in the know&quot; yourself, or more likely just making stuff up (or just passing it on for either of the mentioned)</p>

<p>To investigate what??? - you still need a fuckinig crime to have something to investigate, what do you suggest that circumstantial evidence means - its means that you might be able to tie the circumstance to the crime, but here we still have no crime, so what specific crime do you suggest that all this evidence circumstantially proves?<br/>
Its making up your own damn ideas about what justice is, why don&#39;t you think these guys have legal rights, like other people have? Why don&#39;t you think that the law should be followed when incriminating people in ways, that potentially can ruin their lives.<br/>
Trying to ruin a business and really, really wanting a guy to get in trouble with the police, because some it was decided online that this things are bad and evil, doesn&#39;t make you the good guys, - seriously, what do expect to get out of this?   it won&#39;t save the world from pedophilia, it won&#39;t make crime any less in the world - only thing it makes you, is a person that has joined a witch-hunt and taking part in trying to ruin someones life, because of internet rumors </p>
