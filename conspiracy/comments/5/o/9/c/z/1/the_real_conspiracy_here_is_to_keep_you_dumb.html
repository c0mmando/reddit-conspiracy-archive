       The public education system in this country is a scam and it starts in kindergarten. its basically paint by numbers now. They cater to the lowest common denominator.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want your kid to be well educated you have to pay $20k+/year K-12. This ensures people of means have a huge leg up over the middle/lower classes. It is not by accident.

       Of course. I'm not sure why people, even here, continually like to believe one side is better/different than the other. It's all theater. As far as Presidents go, ask yourselves just what power he actually yields. As in

       It's your kid. As a parent, take some responsibility and educate them yourself. Fill in the gaps where the public at large fails them.

       Ignorance is no longer an excuse.
Having the 'means' is not an excuse either.
Put up or shut up.

       Its not even about that. Youre a reflection of your environment and youre kinda locked within your own set  reality. Thats why one christian dont understand how one can be a muslim and fail to recognize if those two swapped locations at birth you wouldve also swapped religion and beliefs. Its social conditioning and the bar is set low.

       My point was that education allows people to use their full potential. Sure that person maybe able to help his small village to some degree or another, but even if he/she had the potential to surpass Einstein, they would never be able to make such amazing discoveries as others with similar potential but with formal education.

       What do you think it is? We would still be living in a jungle flicking dingle berries if people did not pursue technological or scientific advancement(In attempts to make jobs easier). What was it that allowed space travel, computers, instant worldwide communication, and a relatively luxurious lifestyle?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets not forget that technological advancement is what allowed us such great potential in the first place. If people didn't start cooking foods, we wouldn't be able to gather enough energy from the foods we eat for our brains to function properly. Cooking is pre-digestion which allows for more proteins/nutrients to be released from what we eat. Cooking is also a technological advancement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, my same logic still applies to even your question. Science and technology are currently the
       <em>
        known
       </em>
       pinnacle of human's intellectual potential. If we do not pursue greater potential, we will not find it. If we aren't educated, by ourselves or others of this greater potential, we will never know of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what is your opinion of human potential?

       Retarded people might make jovial, dedicated workers, but someone will need to crack the whip; I wonder who they would be...  Ah, retarded workers, felon managers, and discharged soldiers. Throw in a few refugee $2 per hour workers, and you can see the future of the workforce.

       We home school,  schools are just a shit babysitting/ indoctrination centers run by the ministry of truth so you can go be a slave wile child learns to be unquestioning slave. Any real learning done is in homework that is sent home for you to help the child with.

       I home school too but I'm not a teacher. I expect teachers to be more knowledgeable than me on a subject since they are required to study it. This isn't the case anymore. 30 years ago it was very much the case.

       we are not teachers either imo we kick any teachers ass in general knowledge.  My big problem was with curriculum, here it is load of crap. We live in a trashy  place aswell and the kids were picking bad habits off other kids. I think primary school teachers pretty good these days but high  school teachers are a joke,  its exact opposite of when i went to school .

       I still have them in school but most of the learning they do is from us, school is like soccer practice basically where they just apply what we taught them. I am very displeased with the level of toxicity in the social environment at these public schools.

       Elon Musk pulled his kids out of their top selective private school, poached a couple of the teachers and established a home school which his employees' kids also attend.  So even some of the richest are unsatisfied with the standard of schooling and choose the home schooling route.  (By the way the movie "Captain Fantastic" really highlights the dumbing down of contemporary children's education in an interesting scenario.)

       Education now is a trade of knowledge for compliance.  If you have proven to comply then you are granted knowledge and a title and certificate to go with it.  If you don't comply they "weed you out."
