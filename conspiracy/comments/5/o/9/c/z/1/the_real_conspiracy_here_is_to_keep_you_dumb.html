<p>Of course. I&#39;m not sure why people, even here, continually like to believe one side is better/different than the other. It&#39;s all theater. As far as Presidents go, ask yourselves just what power he actually yields. As in <em>him</em>, personally. It&#39;s all nonsense.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is necessary in public school.</p>

<p>It&#39;s your kid. As a parent, take some responsibility and educate them yourself. Fill in the gaps where the public at large fails them.</p>

<p>What do you think it is? We would still be living in a jungle flicking dingle berries if people did not pursue technological or scientific advancement(In attempts to make jobs easier). What was it that allowed space travel, computers, instant worldwide communication, and a relatively luxurious lifestyle?</p>

<p>Lets not forget that technological advancement is what allowed us such great potential in the first place. If people didn&#39;t start cooking foods, we wouldn&#39;t be able to gather enough energy from the foods we eat for our brains to function properly. Cooking is pre-digestion which allows for more proteins/nutrients to be released from what we eat. Cooking is also a technological advancement.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my same logic still applies to even your question. Science and technology are currently the <em>known</em> pinnacle of human&#39;s intellectual potential. If we do not pursue greater potential, we will not find it. If we aren&#39;t educated, by ourselves or others of this greater potential, we will never know of it.</p>

<p>So, what is your opinion of human potential?</p>
