        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So where to begin?</p>

<p>Let me start out by stating the bottom line - matter is holographic. What do I mean by this?</p>

<p>I mean that each and every atom contains the mass/information of every other atom in the Universe, <strong>literally.</strong></p>

<p>So let&#39;s start with some knowns:</p>

<p>We know for a fact that our physics is incomplete - we cannot model the large by the small parts we know to make it up.</p>

<p>We know for a fact that our models and hypothesis for how consciousness arises is incomplete, and contrary to what a neuroscientist might say, &#39;Consciousness as an epiphenomenon of brain activity alone&#39; is just as much as a belief as anything else.</p>

<p>So how could it be possible that protons are holographic?</p>

<p>There are a few mainstream physics theories that have been combined, to show that the quantum vacuum is riddled with wormholes - you may have heard the terms quantum foam - describing a turbulent vacuum manifold in which distant parts of spacetime are connecting and disconnecting extremely quickly, creating a network of bridges through space.</p>

<p>Well there is another theory called the holographic principle, which postulates that the surface of a black hole can encode all of the information in the volume, geometrically.</p>

<p>The most important concept to this whole holographic proton thing is something called a planck unit. A planck unit is a fundamental set of measurements that define the &#39;quanta&#39; that makes up fields such as electromagnetism.</p>

<p>I.e. EM waves are not sent as a continuous radiation, it is actually discrete quanta. This planck sized quanta has a mass, a length, and a time - its simply a wave fluctuation.</p>

<p>When we add up how many planck unit masses there should be in empty space, we get 10<sup>93</sup> grams / cm<sup>3</sup> of space.</p>

<p>This is so high, its simply written off. It&#39;s the planck density, and it&#39;s supposed to be the energy of the vacuum, since electromagnetic fields permeate the entire Universe, and they are made of planck sized packets.</p>

<p>The first thing we will &#39;change&#39; from mainstream physics is using a sphericalized planck unit as the basis of the structure of the vacuum - an omnidirectional lattice of overlapping planck spherical units, which are the diameter of the planck length and mass of the planck mass - this is opposed to the cubic packing normally used.</p>

<p>This overlapping circles grid may be familiar to you, and that&#39;s because it&#39;s been blasted on the walls of temples for centuries - the famed flower of life.</p>

<p>So what happens when we take the proton volume, and see how many planck spherical units (PSUs) fit inside?</p>

<p>We get 10<sup>60,</sup> which multiplied by the planck mass just so happens to be 10<sup>55</sup> grams, which just so happens to be the estimated mass of the Universe.</p>

<p>Remember, the planck mass and planck length are non-anthropomorphically defined, these are constants that come out of other constants.</p>

<p>So remember the holographic principle? If each proton contains the mass of all protons holographically, maybe we can apply it and see why each individual proton only <em>expresses</em> a tiny amount locally, the rest mass of a proton is 10<sup>-24</sup> grams.</p>

<p>If we take the amount that fit on the surface (10<sup>40),</sup> and divide the amount that fit in the volume (10<sup>60)</sup> - and multiply 2 * planck mass, we nail the standard mass of the proton at 10<sup>-24</sup> grams.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/3bzsyl/since_i_wrote_this_out_in_a_comment_might_as_well/?ref=search_posts">Here</a> is the wolfram math for all of this</p>

<p>There are other things to note with this calculation, namely you can go backwards from rest mass -&gt; radius, and deduce a new proton radius which has recently been confirmed by the most accurate proton radius experiment to date at the Paul Scherrer Institute. This deviates some 4% from standard model predictions.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s take it back to the wormhole structure of space. Because space is actually teeming with an exorbitant amount of energy, we create something known as a Bose Einstein Condensate, a property that allows for macro-quantum effects - the vacuum of space allows for wormholes to crisscross the entire Universe, simply because of the amount of energy in each point - entangling all protons.</p>

<p>In other words, imagine that there is enough mass at each point in space to create tiny black holes that string together to form a wormhole, which is essentially what a wormhole is - a stretched black hole. </p>

<p>So - each surface PSU on the proton is a termination of a wormhole that goes right through the BEC structure of space, and to another proton. 10<sup>40</sup> surface connections lead to 10<sup>40</sup> protons, each leading to 10<sup>40,</sup> which gives us 10<sup>80,</sup> which is the estimated amount of particles in the Universe.</p>

<p>So - each proton contains the mass of the Universe holographically, however only a tiny amount is expressed locally, the rest is instantly distributed throughout this wormhole network of space.</p>

<p>There is a specific geometry for the sphere packing of empty space that allows for the immense energy to be unperceivable, but for now we can simply think of the difference between matter and vacuum is that matter is simply co-moving, spinning vacuum - spinning PSU&#39;s, spinning light.</p>

<p>The implications of this theory are astounding. For one, it implicates morphic resonance, which is a theory by a prominent biologist (Rupert Sheldrake) that postulates there is an unseen field that stretches the Universe, and allows for resonance between form/matter - allowing for example rats on one side of the world to solve a maze faster after it has been done by rats they have no contact with.</p>

<p>However, this goes beyond biology. This same mechanism is the explanation for cosmological evolution, why the Universe seems to be continually complexifying.</p>

<p>Whatever forms &#39;work&#39; in the Universe become more prevalent in the holographic singularities, allowing the blueprint of the form that works to be more easily duplicated through resonance, creating a feedback/feedforward system in the structure of space itself - which leads to cosmological evolution - from cosmogenesis to consciousness.</p>

<p>There are three very important papers that lay this theory all out (this is <em>not</em> my theory)</p>

<p>The original paper solving quantum gravity via a holographic proton</p>

<p><a href="http://resonance.is/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1367405491-Haramein342013PRRI3363.pdf">Quantum Gravity and The Holographic Mass</a></p>

<p>Extension of the holographic solution which solves for all elements and the electron mass
<a href="http://haramein.resonance.is/wp-content/uploads/EHM.pdf">Electron and the Holographic Mass</a></p>

<p>A paper detailing the cosmological evolution, and the Universe&#39;s evolution towards consciousness as an intrinsic part of the Holographic Universe
<a href="http://15qrvx2p7q0ipwico11bd3e1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The-Unified-Spacememory-Network-__-Haramein-Brown-Val-Baker-__-July-2016.pdf">The Unified Spacememory Network</a></p>

<p>The implications for the occult are also astounding. The holographic nature of consciousness and matter allows for collective coherence, shared consciousness patterns that behave just like memes in the real world - these can be looked at as the &#39;archons&#39; that are discussed here - essentially electromagnetic patterns in the holographic mass in which human consciousness interacts -super archetypical patterns or discrete consciousness&#39; that can be manipulated or &#39;fed&#39; by focusing energy.</p>

<p>However, the reverse is also true. Chanting for example - people &#39;imprinting&#39; a feeling-state along with a chant into the holographic mass, will allow others to pickup on this &#39;archon&#39; via resonance in the holographic mass.</p>

<p>This goes on and on and on - but this <em>is</em> the theory that knits everything together in a logical, intuitive, mystical package - it has helped the cohesiveness of my worldview in a tremendous way.</p>

<p>Checkout <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> for more information - there are also two documentaries of note <a href="https://vimeo.com/user33402009">The Connected Universe</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbE5bVl8r2g">Lecture 2015 Connected Universe</a></p>

<p>The first is a documentary narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart - it isn&#39;t as physics packed as the second one, which is more lecture style and has more technical information.</p>

<p>I hope you take some time to look into this theory, it took me months before I accepted it as correct. All I can ask is an open mind and heart!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, after ten years of being an atheist, I stumbled upon ways to peer into the beyond. It&#39;s a long story but now I believe all of life is what we call God and we are all types of mini gods having a human experience in a dream like matrix set in one of the 7 time space universes. There are many beings and phenomenon across these 7 time space universes which encircle a timeless universe and at the center of the universe is the nucleus where Gods headquarters and our final destination are located. We are in a sort of rags to riches story timeline where we start as a particle and evolve back into God. So ya, God isn&#39;t formed inside the matrix simulation yet but he exists in real life which is the center nucleus of the universe it seems. I have read that all actions in physics are handled by higher level beings and nothing actually happens by accident. </p>

<p>This shit is so fascinating and there is so much information that it would take me days to explain it all but it all matches up perfectly. I have a masters in psychology and the bigger picture is very heavy in physics and psychology. Mind controls it all. The universe is a mind. We are just harvesting experience here on earth to help us appreciate paradise. We continue to ascend and become much more intelligent as we do. They even have phsycs people in the higher dimensions. The whole thing is designed like a video game and one set of people, our group, is the ascension team meaning we decend to a particle and work many lives towards restoring our original selves in totality. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still digging as there are thousands of pages here. I know that the law of one is popular in physics so I&#39;m sure you have read that one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nucleus of the total universe is called paradise and doesn&#39;t move. The central universe moves clockwise around it and is a timeless eternity. The 7 superuniverses move counterclockwise to the central universe. There are also 4 layers of outer space where particles are learning to form and stuff and they all rotate in different directions. </p>

<p>7 is in everything just like 0s and 1s are in all computers. The universe is more like 7s, 0s and 1s. This is all about the mechanics of how it works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s real after reading parts of it and measuring it&#39;s value ect.. There was a team that went through it looking for discrepancies and couldn&#39;t find one in a 2000 page book. </p>

<p>The way 7 works precisely is this. </p>

<p>God split himself into 3 parts for efficiency purposes. These are called the 3 sources of life. These 3 deities can act alone or in unison so you get 7 possible actions. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s mark each deity as 1, 2, and 3. Now see combos below. </p>

<p>1</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>12</p>

<p>13</p>

<p>23</p>

<p>123</p>

<p>As you can see, the original 3 deities can act alone or in a combination of each other in a total of 7 possibilities. These 7 can break down into smaller groups of 7 an unlimited amount of times. This is according to Urantia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for explaining this but i disagree with your definition of God.God by definition should be one and alone and if he splits himself into three even for efficiency purposes then he stops being God because that&#39;s the entire point of being God.I think whoever wrote the book is desperately trying to keep it in accordance with the Trinity concept in Christianity so that the book appeals to modern day Christians that are turning away from their religion.I am not here to bash any religious people and their believes so I am sorry if it offends anyone.Also i would love to hear your thoughts on this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True or not, the book says that all beings are the same person. Although there is a trinity of gods, the same person is playing all 3 roles. Let&#39;s call say this one persons name is Bob. Bob is all of life itself and if it cuts itself into 2 halves, it is still bob but now there are 2 bobs. The trinity is essentially 3 bobs. All beings and things in existence are one of the bob forms. </p>

<p>So, the book is saying that we are all Bob in many different forms. There are low level intellect bobs like humans and high level bobs like the trinity plus everything in between. </p>

<p>The bobs that are experiencing being a faulty human is us. The faulty wiring of humans was intentionally placed there and that&#39;s a whole different story. Still, we are all Bob. We are the same person in a gigantic system designed to entertain us in the end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal take on it is that if the same God we&#39;re talking about has existed outside of all time beyond our comprehension, then—knowing the timeline of all mankind and therefore the progression of knowledge via the spreading of information through a variety of means—He would&#39;ve understood that the best way to represent himself <em>most accurately overtime</em> was to personify Himself in a manner humans for many many years would understand; a tangible and timeless system operating on the basis of personal interpretation various life recommendations (recorded in terms the people of the day and age understood). </p>

<p>Now to your point. It&#39;s not far fetched to me that this eternal God could in theory have conveyed the message of:</p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys, I know this is really hard for you to understand given your current time period, but think of me as:
• A Father who&#39;s always looking out for you from beyond (&#39;Our Father, who art in heaven...&#39;). 
• His most precious offering (the sacrificing of His only begotten Son; it&#39;s not a sacrifice if it doesn&#39;t hurt and I can&#39;t imagine anything more heart-wrenching than that) to you out of pure love, beckoning you to seek Him. 
• A daily presence in your life, constantly whispering wise words of guidance and love into your year (a Holy Spirit following you around all day).&quot;</p>

<p>Does that mean He truly exists in 3 distinct forms always and all times? Not in my view, but who am I to say what a divine being from beyond my realm is or is not? To me His agenda works toward an agenda unrestricted by time, and as long as it helps mankind understand Him better He&#39;s ok with it, generally speaking. I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts, it&#39;s always nice to bounce ideas off people familiar with the concept. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your point of view and where you are coming from but i was merely pointing out that technically this does not make sense.From your post i am assuming that you are Christian.So to address your point i have to address Christianity and their believe in God of Trinity.So Christians believe the God came to the earth in the form of man for the benefit of mankind and i have no problem with their believes except that it does not make sense for a logical and rational mind.By definition God is an infinite being that exists outside this Universe and time so it is wrong to say that an infinite being can exist inside a finite being.I am not saying that God cannot do this,he can, but as soon as he turns into a man he stops being a God in that form so even he cannot claim that he is a God in his manly form because that will be technically incorrect.So by definition God has to be unseen and un imaginable for him to say that He is God so even if he turns into a man he will not call himself God.If a human being like me can arrive at this conclusion rationally then an all knowing God will also know this so he will never do this.So if God cannot come to this Universe in his Godly form then it means that the only way for him to make us realize he is God is to give a human being among us the knowledge that he is God and thats what he is been doing, giving his messages to chosen humans among us via his angels and we call them Prophets last of which is Prophet Muhammad(PBUH).Keeping this in mind when we check Bible we find out that Jesus never claimed to be a God.There is not a single unambiguous statement from the lips of Jesus that he was God or worship him infact it was the church(google council of nicea) .So the concept of a Trion God is completely irrational and illogical  for any rational human being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At some point in this cycle (there are endless cycles), we, as perfected beings, have to go back and experience a contrast to paradise so we can remember what the ungodly feels like so we can then compare it to the godly which enhances our lives much more. So we descend to level 1 in far outer space which is the particle experience. Animals, plants, and particles don&#39;t have a personality yet but they have a mind. They are also very natural so they are connected to the universe. </p>

<p>Level 1: particle life in outer space. The main purpose of this stage is awareness. </p>

<p>Level 2: animal, plants, minerals in time/space. Main purpose is growth. </p>

<p>Level 3: Humonoid like beings who have the ability to follow darkness or light in time/space. If people follow darkness they take a negative path that leads them to a darker path which will later make them regret everything and choose light. The main purpose here is understanding self awareness and who we are. </p>

<p>Level 4: We become a hybrid of spirit and body and we learn about the true powers of love here. I think this is still time/space</p>

<p>Level 5: mostly spirit beings that learn about wisdom. This is in a timeless eternity. </p>

<p>Level 6: This level is a bit confusing but we are perfected here and working on the gateway to enter deeper into god. </p>

<p>Level 7: We become resides of the central isle of paradise and the sublevels are kept a secret here because they are all surprises. </p>

<p>As we climb these levels, we will be able to operate our own sectors of the universe. </p>

<p>Also, this is our timeline. There are many groups of beings and we do this one. There are groups of beings that start at 7 and descend down to particles while other groups don&#39;t descend or ascend at all but are stationary in heaven. Most everyone has a task or job but it&#39;s more fun than work. </p>

<p>See, I keep reading this claim, but I simply don&#39;t see it in the historical records. The New Testament has a mountain of manuscript evidence supporting the text.

    <div class="md"><p>The books say the Jesus part was less tampered. It&#39;s all the BS about a jealous, murdering, vengeful, demanding, angry God that is all BS. </p>

<p>The books say that people made a mockery of God. I understand the personality of God more now and I can say he&#39;s more like the coolest MOFO you&#39;ll ever see. He never judges, never condemns, never changes his opinion about people, he loves equally, he likes to have fun, ect..  Hell, we are God but we are God experiencing being human so he I said not going to hate himself. Humans are meant to make mistakes because these mistakes give us an idea of pain which is later used as a contrast to paradise thereby making paradise seem so much cooler. </p>

<p>All that shit about Jesus dying for our sins is bullshit too (according to these books). Jesus was an advanced being who already mastered time/space but reincarnated to help us. This is his sector of the universe and he has a vested interest in our development. </p>

<p>Think of Gods personality in 5 fold. Love, peace, unity, fun, freedom. Also, imagine that everyone including God is the same person. God is just our highest possible self and the most optimized version of any being in existence. </p>

<p>Thank god the Jesus parts weren&#39;t toyed with badly. As you can read, all he talks about is love and pleasure and unity and enjoyment ect..  This is all true. These are the things that will take humans from a level 3 to level 4 sometime soon in the future. </p>

<p>Also, the elite really confused people by tricking them that sex, wealth, and power are totally evil but they are not. They are good things unless they harm other people somehow (i.e. You can&#39;t hog all the money in the world or have sex with animals). Sex is a holy act but we all think it&#39;s unholy so we have fucked our way out of the many benefits of regular sex with a variety of people. Marriage itself is considered fail too because we end up with only 1 person for decades. There is a lot to the stories. </p>

<p>See, even this stuff I find odd. If you read the Old Testament in its proper context (which, admittedly, is very hard), I don&#39;t think God is this way.</p>

<p>For example, some people are offended by &quot;the ban&quot; requiring the Canaanites to be killed. At first, this seems genocidal. But before the Israelites were ever sent, God gave them several centuries to repent. They could have fled the land, and they knew the Israelites were coming.</p>

<p>Further, the Canaanites were absolutely genocidal. They sexually abused and killed children (just like some elite Moloch worshipers do today), and routinely pillaged and slaughtered opposing cultures. We would certainly give these people the death penalty today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus was an advanced being who already mastered time/space but reincarnated to help us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you understand this? What do you believe was the purpose of his coming and death?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the elite really confused people by tricking them that sex, wealth, and power are totally evil but they are not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah. Jerome, in particular, taught a bunch of horribly false doctrines that still hold sway over most churches.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a whole book (Song of Solomon) on how God is totally cool with sex for pleasure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why the Old Testament is so messy but I know religion is supposed to refine itself and grow daily like science but it stopped 2000 years ago so the info is so outdated. We aren&#39;t even sure who wrote it or why but the book gives hints (i.e. The elite wrote sex is against god to lower the world population and avoid unwanted births). </p>

<p>Jesus&#39;s main goal on earth was to spread knowledge on spiritual matters which is a requirement he had to fulfill. As we grow, he grows. This is his sector of the universe. The big secret about the devil is that the devils true identity is the ego. Ego isn&#39;t an actual person but rather a code designed to corrupt humans through the thinking systems in our brains. The ego acts like a devil on the shoulder. </p>

<p>In a huge nutshell, Jesus died because the ego tricked people into marking him as a bad guy and killing him. The ego said that a man of this much innocence is blasphemy to God. Jesus proved them wrong as he resurrected and so this resurrection really got the humans thinking which leads to spiritual growth and so Jesus accomplished one goal here. He defeated the ego and enhanced the human experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have this little hypothesis I&#39;m playing around with, based in part on the holographic principle, that says the magnetosphere is intimately tied to mammalian consciousness.  It&#39;s a little vague at this point, as I&#39;m still kind of working on it in my head, but here it is sketched out, in a nutshell.  </p>

<p>Photons are the only thing in our physical universe that are essentially eternal, i.e. they do not experience time (a reference frame moving at the speed of light will see clocks in slower frames as moving infinitely slowly).  So if there is an eternal component to our consciousness, it would be intimately associated with EM fields (&quot;go into the light...&quot;, a common NDE trope).  </p>

<p>Also, given the holographic principle, the 3-dimensional state of the world (or at least a neighborhood)  for each moment would be stored on a 2D surface.  To experience movement in time, one would need a (topologically) 3D space/manifold to encode the data.  If time is quantized, it would have to be regenerated with the same granularity as our sensory experience, on the order of 0.01 to 0.05 seconds (think of the classical film speed of ~25 frames per second).  It just so happens that the Van Allen belts are about 0.01 to 0.05 light-seconds away from the surface of the earth.  </p>

<p>So, what I wonder about is whether the Van Allen belts, or the Earth&#39;s magnetic field in general, holographically encodes the conscious experience of the planet (or at least the mammalian portion thereof).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I encourage everyone to visit <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> and read some of what <a href="/u/d8_thc">/u/d8_thc</a> and others have written. I can only speak for myself, but as soon as I started down this track, so many previously unfathomable things about the universe have come into focus. Don&#39;t take my word for it, just investigate for yourself. The community is very open to explaining things and at the very least you&#39;ll broaden your perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great work.  Some things id like to see addressed that I&#39;ve come across recently:  </p>

<p>tetrahedrons and the shape of energy at rest.<br/>
(Vacuum void)</p>

<p>Aliens and their appearance as a deviation from humans.</p>

<p>Humans center of gravity being in the gut and claims that humans don&#39;t need food to survive.</p>

<p>Human electromagnetic manipulation.  (YouTube electric eel man, I feel it has to do with chakras and control of emotional energy)</p>

<p>Sparkles (points of light seen suspended in air by children and illuminated humans, many of which claim it to be due to migraines.  Some people claim they can move them and even a person claims he lifted a page of a book by tucking one under the corner with his mind....insane implications)</p>

<p>I really think that the connected universe explains all of these mysteries simply using math and geometry.  You and others are up to amazing work and we are together finding a new logic to life.  The information of truth is scattered and we are getting closer to gathering the fragments and uncovering something unseen in comprehension to the public.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are more awesome mysteries I&#39;ve come across that tie in, but overall everything just keeps pointing to the new Age of Enlightenment of mankind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question for the OP: </p>

<p>Are the theories referenced in this post all based on the same founding arithmetic?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure holofractal is based on sacred geometry.  Does this include calculations for aether?</p>

<p>Quantum theory is based on its own arithmetic?</p>

<p>The macro model is based on the standard mode of physics, which I am aware some scientists refute due to rounding errors on constants used in calculations.  I know gravity and the speed of light allegedly fluctuated before 1970 and since then the math has built from &quot;nice round numbers.&quot; (According to some outcast scientists)</p>

<p>Do we start from scratch and use one model to re-explain the standard and quantum models so they align with sacred geometry and divine number systems?  Is it at this point that we learn about the errors in our technology that have seemingly held us back until the &quot;new geniuses&quot; come about to showcase the somehow already privatized new tech?</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re all on to something very complex that has been left in the hands of &quot;experts&quot; because we &quot;depend on them&quot; for their interpretations.  Perhaps they are so buried in what they think is the only way that they are building a crooked tower of knowledge?</p>

<p>Questions will bring about more questions until we find the truth together.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The EM Drive is one practical application that while not proven yet, can be explained by holofractal. I think the biggest thing this could change is our use of energy. If there is a black hole inside every proton, that means we have an enormous amount of untapped energy available to us. As of right now, almost no one in mainstream science thinks this is possible, so it may take some time to see practical applications. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Leaving this here</strong>, may the people who are supposed to read it do.</p>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t have the pretension of holding all the answers. I prefer sticking to facts. The number one existential fact is the answer to the question: &quot;who am I?&quot;. </p>

<p>To that answer, I can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum">only reply</a> &quot;I am conscious&quot;. I can infer nothing beyond that, insofar as I cannot directly perceive the world around me. I know it to be an illusion, for my perception of it relies on my physiological senses, which do an excellent job at summarizing, condensing and presenting &quot;reality&quot; to me but do not paint an accurate picture of it.</p>

<p>For example, a brown table is not made of brown particles. Actually, it&#39;s made mostly of empty space. The solid feel to it is a function of electromagnetic forces between distant particles. Its color is a sensitive (subjective?) translation of the light&#39;s wavelength when it bounces off the table. Furthermore each particle is a wave (probability) function, it does not even exist <em>a priori</em> the way we intuitively think it does (more on that below).</p>

<p>But fortunately, although we know we cannot fully trust our senses, we have instruments (and our minds) to observe reality; theoretical and experimental physics in particular provide clues as to what the universe is made of.</p>

<p>So the question becomes: &quot;what is consciousness?&quot; A corollary to that is: &quot;is it fundamental in the universe, or is matter the fundamental, prime component?&quot; . If consciousness is secreted by the brain, then all emotions are mere chemical reactions. Love, empathy and melancholy correspond to nothing &quot;real&quot;, they are synaptic impulses, they can be fundamentally tampered with psychotropic medicine, and I should despise them as archaic, primitive reflexes.</p>

<p>If however consciousness is a fundamental substance in the universe, these are not only chemical reactions, they have an absolute quality. It means there exists Beauty, Love, and Truth (note the capital letters). </p>

<p>So what does science tell us? Which preconditions the existence of which, between matter and consciousness?</p>

<p>Look for this into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment">double-slit experiment</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation">Copenhagen interpretation</a> of quantum mechanics (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc">ELI5</a>)</p>

<p>In a nutshell, a particle of matter is a wave (probability) function up until it &quot;collapses&quot; (i.e emerges into reality) when it is observed (more precisely, when an observer is made aware of it).</p>

<p>If the observer reads the result 1 hour after the experiment, the particle didn&#39;t exist in the hour between the experiment and the reading, even though its result was recorded.</p>

<p>Otherwise said: if an instrument records the particle, but the instrument is destroyed before any reading (by a so-called &quot;observer&quot;) is ever made from it, that particle has never existed materially. A cosmic &quot;particle&quot; that &quot;arrives&quot; unseen from space and is not observed when it &quot;reaches&quot; Earth never existed in the first place. Quantum events are &quot;retroactive&quot;. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser">See this.</a></p>

<p>So particles exist in reality insofar as they exist as &quot;knowledge&quot; in an observer&#39;s mind. This is what contemporary science teaches us.</p>

<p>This issue embodies one of the main differences between Platonism and Aristotelianism. Descartes played an important role in that discussion in the 17th century. Among well-known Platonist philosophers are also Spinoza and Kant. Coming from different perspectives, others such as Jung or Einstein have also postulated (in substance) the Universe is a &quot;mind&quot; (rather than a mechanical/deterministic ensemble), which also puts them in the Platonist camp.</p>

<p>However most in the scientific establishment still deny the &quot;observer&quot; in QM needs to be conscious (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_%28quantum_physics%29">this</a>). Nonetheless, experiments in the 20th century (e.g. the double-slit experiment) seem to give credence to the Platonist view (in an overwhelmingly Aristotelician / mechanist world). I&#39;ll add to that the <a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu/">Princeton Noosphere</a> results, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnA8GUtXpXY">Rupert Sheldrake&#39;s</a> statistical experiments  or anything coming out of the <a href="http://www.noetic.org/">Institute of Noetic Sciences</a>. As you know you need but 1 contradictory reproducible result to falsify a hypothesis.</p>

<p>They say paradigms don&#39;t change because experts change their mind; rather, old experts die and new ones take their place.</p>

<p>TLDR: intent produces and drives the universe, and everything inside it. Even rocks. You are consciousness. The material world you experience is an illusion. If you realize all your sensory experiences, emotions and thoughts are projections on a screen, and if you learn to notice the screen, and the light that shines on it, you will achieve self-realization and peace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nucleus of the total universe is called paradise and doesn&#39;t move. The central universe moves clockwise around it and is a timeless eternity. The 7 superuniverses move counterclockwise to the central universe. There are also 4 layers of outer space where particles are learning to form and stuff and they all rotate in different directions. </p>

<p>7 is in everything just like 0s and 1s are in all computers. The universe is more like 7s, 0s and 1s. This is all about the mechanics of how it works. </p>
