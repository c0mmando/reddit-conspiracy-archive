       First of all hi guy!
      </p>
      <p>
       Alright so for nearly a year now we have been being spoon fed a copious amounts of propaganda to try and convince everyone Trump is a bad person. Of course as we all know its all a bunch of lies. Nevertheless Trump won the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I've been racking my brain wondering why they let him win. Considering the idea that perhaps the system isn't rigged and the relentless criticism of Trump was a sign of him being truly an outsider.
      </p>
      <p>
       So of course by this point in the game I am really over the countless excuses they make towards why he shouldn't be in power. Until today's latest shit show, Oh they are suing Trump for sexual whatever fucking lie. When I heard that, I automatically though it was just another attempt to make him seem bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I realized this is how they are going to take over. They have lied so many times that I don't even believe any of it now. So when they come on the TV and say that he is rounding people up, its going to just sound like another lie! He has the power to do a number of horrible things while most of us will still support him thinking that it's just another lie. Holocaust 2.0 might be right around the corner.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's if Obama doesn't impose martial law in the next 48 hours or the CIA assassinate Trump. Which to be honest, seems far more likely to happen. But we shall see...

       Right I should have thought of that analogy. So as they continue to rally the extreme left to riot and destroy, they can grow the anger on the right. Until it seems like we only have one option to control the chaos. Stricter laws will lead to the left overflowing the prisons. Then before you know it they need to make housing (internment camps). While we are all marching in the street say hail Trump. Social pressure will force everyone to pick sides of either supporting the movement or being forced into a camp. How can we stop it at that point!

       I'm not sure. We are reaching a tipping point for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only thought of that analogy recently when having a debate with one of the deluded left in the comments section in a news thread. Even pointed out something similar to your post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's important to not get to worked up in a frenzy of what could happen, but defo stay mindful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pro trump, but like fuck am I blindly and unconditionally pro trump.  I see extremes both side, but the left are becoming predominantly extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this place, and places like it, come back to balance so trump can be kept under reasonable watch. But, as this post points out, it's become hard when there is so much batshit crazy stuff popping up over the news and social media.  Reddit has engineered itself so the crazies dominate r/all now, which is just pushing more people into the pro trump camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I say, tipping point is near and it's gonna be ugly/interesting.

       Yeah I see him. I wonder if this is his first visit to r/conspiracy. With any luck he'll look around and possibly learn something. Yet I'm think CNN is probably on his TV right now.

       He's already used the term conspiracy nuts, but you ever know.

       I think it's great that he kinda fits into the discussion about how loopy some of the left are. He's already self declared unhinged.

       That's another subject entirely, yet it does baffle me how all I'm doing is reading words on a screen yet when you read the words of the left it mostly seems like they are yelling. While the other side seems calm and analytical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny how they are falling for the biggest conspiracy of all while simultaneously thinking that anything that counters they're narrative must be the words of a mad man. Where do you find the will to continue arguing, is it even realist to believe the far left can be reasoned with at this point?

       Oh there's no hope, for sure, but it's only early here and I'v got an evening on the sofa with Reddit in the background.  You never know, he may read some stuff and at least be curious to check in every now and then to get multiple view points, even if he does think they are mad.

       It's interesting. Try reading along as devils advocate. It becomes interesting joining some of the dots then coming to your own conclusions and relating it to some of the corporate sponsored news.

       Sure there's some far out stuff knocking around, but there's generally more unbiased and raw news here than in places like r/politics and r/news

       Nah man I grew out of this stuff a long long time ago. Also just to comment on what you said to the other bloke " I guess he wants me to vote hillary in 2020 and crazy behaviour will swing it?". and "I think it's great that he kinda fits into the discussion about how loopy some of the left are."
      </p>
      <p>
       I already told you I'm a conservative myself, plus I'm not even American, PLUS I fucking despise Hillary Clinton, she's a corrupt piece of shit. Not everyone who calls you up on your bullshit is a 'leftist'. This is a massive mistake young conservatives keep making. It's people who make up false claims that are damaging conservative thinking world wide because for some reason a lot of younger conservatives are really into crazy conspiracy stuff. So you claiming that there were multiple threads celebrating Manning's pardon over on t_d is really damaging, don't you see that? You purposely went into the thread and posted several times that these posts existed on t_d when they didn't. I asked you plenty of times now and you can't link me, and I looked for myself anyway, I linked you to the one thread I found and the posts were the opposite of what you claimed. Don't you see the irony in that? You're on

       Falsifying stuff is bad. That is a major point to all of this and the main reason the left is falling. If you can't search a subreddit for keywords to see that the anti-manning post you found in t_d is not indicative of the entire 'conspiracy pansy trumpeters' or whatever nasty stuff you came out with, then what's the point. You're blind to reason. The posts you think don't exist are there in plain site. Difference is you've been rude from the get go and at times loony, like the stalking and edgy comments, so you shouldn't be to shocked at the trolling and dismissive responses. A mod removed one of your comments in the other thread because it was so mean spirited and obnoxious.  I think it was well showing of things and wish at had have been left up. You expect a decent convo acting like that?  Then you come here and call entire community nuts. You are lost, dude.

       I'm not gonna link, im on a sketchy mobile device and it's near impossible without switching and crashing.  The manning posts and comments are plentiful, yet you linked a cherry picked post with almost no voting or comments. There are good and bad posts and comments over there, sure, but the pro manning stuff reigns. Geesus, just search manning and read through. It takes a second. You genuinely can't find anything positive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think you're on to something here and the entire t_d is in meltdown over the manning news?! If it's that you think I was posting that there was positive stuff when there isn't, that is not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I came straight from a t_d thread where people were celebrating and posting things like 'thanks.... Obama. Didn't think I'd say that' and 'this is a great call, 35 years was wrong' and 'finally'. With that in mind, I then went straight to that r/news thread to read about how t_d was in a meltdown and made the post that you took so kindly to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, It is a boring night. Globally it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Words are just words. But don't expect a decent conversation when you scream out leftist lunacies.
      </p>

       I live between the uk and the us and Germany.  You don't come across as someone on the right... at all. But all the power to you whatever you're stance may be.

       I fucked up the spelling of sight... again... sketchy mobile device, hence the new iPad.

       I spelt geesus like that on purpose and I like to use ... as an extended kinda comment.

       You can still enjoy and be interested in r/conspiracy without being a paranoid wreck. It's never all or nothing, right?

       Good day to you. Stick around and try and enjoy some of the conspiracy theories you once liked.  The lizard people stuff has come a long way.

       I didn't cherry pick anything. For the last time mate I didn't find ANYTHING about Manning other than that post I linked to you. Not a single one, that's no word of a lie. Why would they have just disappeared? I done a search on the sub and still found nothing, that's why I asked you repeatedly to link me, I really wanted to see their reaction to the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well if you don't think I seem like I'm on the 'right' you haven't spent enough time in the the U.K. or Ireland. Right wing over here is completely different than right wing in the states. The democrats would be considered right wing over here, that's how far left Europe is. I'm a centre-right kinda bloke but in the states you possibly would consider me left but that's just because your politics is fucking mental and you've been fed endless bogeyman propaganda concerning the great red threat of Russia for the last 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't say nor do I think anybody was in meltdown, I just can't get my head around the stupidity of lies like that. Anybody can visit t_d and search submitted posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't be sticking around here I'm afraid, I'm too old for this stuff these days. Take care.

       Keeping this lean, I'm not sure what to say. It is very odd you can't find ANY manning posts there other than the one you originally linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least the peyton manning posts should be showing following the tucker interview or the ones surrounding Assange's tweet about manning.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can, try searching on a different app or web browser. Hopefully then you can see that there are many posts there, many positive, but, also many different opinions explored... which is a far cry from r/news and politics.  I can assure you any other person who has had the misfortune of stumbling on this back and forth convo has checked and seen.

       That being said, you really want people to believe you aren't left leaning with the name "Literalllly". That is a dead give away. Not to mention you have no idea what I'm talking about, which admittedly you stumbled into r/conspiracy so you should be a little lost. Yet still you can't grasp the idea of the fake news propaganda. Thus you must believe the news, don't you?

       Fake news has been around since the beginning, we call it tabloid news, it's nothing new. It's the same as all the mad stuff that was going around about Obama being an African muslim who's plan is to destroy America, and Bush before him was a lizard person. Just the same as some of the mad stuff going around about Trump. It's all just entertainment, designed to get you to read and click. It's been happening for a long time, just go out and live your life without this paralysing paranoia you carry around with you :) Peace out mate

       Really, come on man. You are a lot closer to the precipice of the immigration problem than I am. So surely you can see what is going on. Europe is falling apart do to the immigration policies. Surely you don't think that the politicians are ignorant to the effect of accepting some many refugees?

       Obama's birth certificate has been proven to be a fake. Proven. Then he has increased the natural debt by 14 trillion dollars. Plus I'm not sure if you get our news over there but we have riots all the time and race relations in America are worse than they have been in 20 years. Either Obama sucks at his job or he was trying to destroy America.

       Unless you mean the all out chaos that is already starting do to the mindless ones on the left. Yet if you are saying that this chaos is strong another to destabilize the United States. I don't see it happening, the same people that are rioting and burning shit are also the ones that need "safe spaces" and believe in "political correctness". As we have already seen, there is fights breaking out within the left between the subsections. The cultural enrichment they believe in has already been shown to destroy it's self. Thus making a movement with very little power to destroy anything. So please do tell how making Trump look bad is going to destroy Society?

       Alright yeah, I see what you're saying, I did get a little political at the end there. While driving away from the main idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well I came down from the Agenda idea to the globalists concept for that last bit. In which I really do worry the globalists are threatened by Trump and would want stop him by any means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I suppose to dethrone him at this point in the game would play back into the Agenda of civil war.

       Falsifying stuff is bad. That is a major point to all of this and the main reason the left is falling. If you can't search a subreddit for keywords to see that the anti-manning post you found in t_d is not indicative of the entire 'conspiracy pansy trumpeters' or whatever nasty stuff you came out with, then what's the point. You're blind to reason. The posts you think don't exist are there in plain site. Difference is you've been rude from the get go and at times loony, like the stalking and edgy comments, so you shouldn't be to shocked at the trolling and dismissive responses. A mod removed one of your comments in the other thread because it was so mean spirited and obnoxious.  I think it was well showing of things and wish at had have been left up. You expect a decent convo acting like that?  Then you come here and call entire community nuts. You are lost, dude.

       I'm not gonna link, im on a sketchy mobile device and it's near impossible without switching and crashing.  The manning posts and comments are plentiful, yet you linked a cherry picked post with almost no voting or comments. There are good and bad posts and comments over there, sure, but the pro manning stuff reigns. Geesus, just search manning and read through. It takes a second. You genuinely can't find anything positive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think you're on to something here and the entire t_d is in meltdown over the manning news?! If it's that you think I was posting that there was positive stuff when there isn't, that is not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I came straight from a t_d thread where people were celebrating and posting things like 'thanks.... Obama. Didn't think I'd say that' and 'this is a great call, 35 years was wrong' and 'finally'. With that in mind, I then went straight to that r/news thread to read about how t_d was in a meltdown and made the post that you took so kindly to.

       Yes, It is a boring night. Globally it seems.
