    <div class="md"><p>Since you asked: The mass media uproar about a &quot;fake news story&quot; and basically the birth of the fake news moniker. You can immediately realize how strange this is since pizzagate is not a news story and is not confirmed fake or not. Pizzagate is an ongoing grass roots investigation which has not been corroborated since no official investigation has happened yet. Also, it falls in line with other exposed happenings of a similar nature. So the media response and immediate denial is very suspect. Also, the mischaracterization of &quot;a child sex group run by Clinton in the basement of a pizza parlor&quot; as opposed to what it really is, a major child sex ring with deep ties to DC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you provide me to links to those media sources? The earliest you could give me the better</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it falls in line with other child abuse investigations and I hate how the ok there have gotten lumped together with pizzagate. In those other cases you had victims and witnesses coming out; whereas, with pizzagate you don&#39;t have a single witness to anything odd or a single victim to come forth.</p>

<p>What you have is an investigation that began because of a 4chan post claiming they had deciphered the code words and that the emails make perfect sense if you use those code words (who plays dominos on a child? I could see dominos on cocaine, though).</p>

<p>4chan is not a credible source. The same people pushing the code words that came from 4chan are using 4chan&#39;s capability to troll to argue against trump&#39;s dossier. Well, which is it? Are they a trustworthy group of investigators? Or are they a bunch of people in it for the lulz? You can&#39;t have it both ways</p>

<p>From there the investigation was linked to a pizzeria, I believe based on financial ties? Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I very well could be. Would love the source of how they&#39;re tied, actually, if you want.</p>

<p>Then it took off as a collection of instagram posts, spirit cooking (the video of which went viral right before pizzagate), and pictures of different art.</p>

<p>From there people have been trying to force more pieces into the puzzle with conjecture that&#39;s taken out of context and is emotionally driven.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the safe haven for pizzagate is a website that hosts jailbait content, which is aimed directly towards pedophiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to argue whether pizzagate is real or not. The code words could very well be drugs, it could be trafficking, it could be nothing. My point is since there has not been a formal investigation, and all the evidence remains inconclusive, the overly aggressive &quot;fake news&quot; narrative is suspect. There is a strange mountain of circumstantial evidence. If it is nothing whatever, but it deserves an investigation. I found it odd that Alefantis was invited onto Fox news and called the accusations false several times but never once said they were disgusting, offensive to him, wrong, etc. The whole thing is just strange... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it&#39;s the combination of prior events like the Franklin scandal, the Watchers, Colonel Michael Acquino, and how our government and others have consistently worked to cover these up, despite the government being directly linked to pedophilia and ritual abuse. Then when you add in the Clinton Foundation&#39;s ties to human trafficking in Haiti, Monica Peterson&#39;s death, and the testimony of people like Cathy Obrien, it makes all of the details of pizzagate seem a lot more ominous and probable</p>

<p>And it needs to be stopped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>4chan. Everyone takes one look and says &quot;no way - that&#39;s completely bogus&quot;.</p>

<p>They (I am not a part) are a true hive-mind of nerds. They belong to a fairly predictable demographic (Asperger&#39;s spectrum) of the mind + technology + geography that computes. They play lots of games. There are a few that are older than 25, but basically a very young and angst-ridden forum.</p>

<p>It&#39;s relatively hard to trace what&#39;s going on - depending whatever. At any rate, they feel free to communicate in crazy ways the outside world simply cannot understand. Like gang codes or hand signals. For instance, the hive-mind knows what memes are totally fake and what memes have traction to push buttons in the living world. The interface between game-play and real-world is only clear to insiders, and even then, it doesn&#39;t really matter.</p>

<p>They are politically off the boards, but totally incorrect all directions - whatever you try to label will get thrown back. They literally cannot be boxed in, a weird combination of extremes - left and right hardly means anything. The closest thing the hive-mind might agree to as a political position has to do, vaguely, with the Singularity and transhumanism, which as far as they are concerned, is happening right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Normally when you turn over some otherwise ordinary looking rock, you may or may not find something unpleasant that&#39;s been living under it, but in this case there seems to be a whole lot of very nasty and unpleasant looking things living underneath this one, and the more you look, the more of them there just continually seems to be.</p>

<p>What began as no more than one or two highly suspicious and unusual facts led to more and more of them that are all consistent with the premise that there&#39;s some child trafficking and sexual abuse going on that Comet Pizza seems to be something of an &quot;underground hub&quot; for, both literally and figuratively. </p>

<p>Certainly enough facts to warrant a full and thorough police investigation of the owner, his known associates, and his source of income just for openers. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like know to why that hasn&#39;t been done or isn&#39;t underway given the insidious and highly covert nature of such crimes, not to mention that it&#39;s crime that uses and hides behind a cloak of respectability with perpetrators that have every appearance of being upright and respectable and who have gone out of their way to cultivate relationships with highly respectable people in various positions of power and authority who worry more about preserving their own reputations and will quickly reject and ridicule any of those kinds of allegations as if they were somehow under suspicion as well.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say what or when the straw that broke the proverbial camel&#39;s back was for me beyond the fact that I&#39;ve yet to see a convincing argument against doing everything it is possible to do and then some to make absolutely sure that what certainly look&#39;s like a duck, and walk&#39;s like a duck, and quack&#39;s like a duck, isn&#39;t one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geeze where to begin... I&#39;ll go into what convinced people I talk to in person about it (I gave up any digging on it bc where it was going was too risky)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The video where joe biden tells a 13 year old how horny he is. Ive yet to find another audio translation of the video that sounds remotely like what is subbed on that vid. The only defense ive seen is &quot;you dont know 100% if that is what biden is actually saying&quot; all from new profiles that seem to be for the sole purpose of railing against pizza gate.</p></li>
<li><p>The encrypted files that were being distributed on comet pizzas website. You can still access that portion of the website, you now just hit a login screen. The encrypted files (which no one has cracked) have dates matching with pizza emails in the podesta emails.</p></li>
<li><p>The stratfor pizza sites. There were files with disgusting names like buzzardpussy and roach cunt. They seemed to be mp3s for 3 minute song that exceeded 900mb in size and were shown to definately have stenography. Most of the stenography hasnt been cracked, but what has is odd and matches up with the occult shit in the podesta emails. Also, many of podestas strafor contacts were caught in the stratfor leaks as nambla members and open make refference to diddling kids. None of the admitted stratfor pedos have ever been prosecuted or questioned.</p></li>
<li><p>The creepy honey traps to send messages to diggers. I am only an observer, however when the files started getting dug up phone numbers came available and scripts were used to scrape your info if you were not smart enough to 7 proxie your shit. Normal people looking into it got cryptic threatening emails from ananymous email addresses. There was someone who posted calls they were getting on youtube and when they called the number back they would get a little child laughing. Then those videos were completely scrubbed.... I dont mean taken down, i mean they are no longer indexed and no one archived it.</p></li>
<li><p>The twitter stuff. I dont even want to talk about this. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is where shit got too spooky for me. Worse case and best case scenario become exactly the same... If I dig and do crack any of whats being uncovered and do find exactly what I suspect proving important political players are raping children, Id be a criminal for posessing kiddie porn, would not be able to release the evidence anywhere due to it being illegal material and end up getting arrested with none of the abusers seeing jail time.</p>

<p>Goodluck to all the 4 and 8 chan diggers braver than I. I aint downloading that shit</p>
