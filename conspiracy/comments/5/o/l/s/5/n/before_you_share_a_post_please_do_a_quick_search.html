       I know it's sometimes difficult to find any info or articles that can verify the claims made in the articles we share, but if the claims are true, often there will be at least one source that can help verify it. We've obviously had a shill influx recently, and I'm starting to feel like part of their strategy is to post/upvote articles that are clearly false to destroy our credibility with people even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA officers/drug smuggling post is a perfect example. No offense to the guy who posted it bc it would be great if true,but it got a lot more upvotes than I thought it would seeing as how pretty much every single comment continued to disprove it. I'm not accusing the OP as being a shill, but I think shill forces most certainly unite to upvote bullshit stories. How does this get 1k+ upvotes but other ones with so much more credibility top out around 400-500? It doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just do your research and try to verify your posts at least somewhat. Please :)

       Fake News, that article being the perfect example, is an intentional program to discredit conspiracy theorists and alternative news sources there's no doubt in my mind. and when discovered they just claim satire even if there's no comedic value detectable.

       The CIA's already been accused of not only smuggling drugs but caught with plenty of evidence to prove it numerous times before so it's more believable that this account was just another in a long string of drug-running incidents that have been previously uncovered and documented although precious little was ever done to put a stop to them or convince the public that they wouldn't simply be a little more careful to not get caught doing it again in the future only to see it happen again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The incident may be a completely false and fictitious fabrication in this case, but the accusation itself is still a perfectly legitimate and valid one and no one that believed it due to that falsehood has actually been mislead in any real way at all when it comes to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything the CIA does outside the borders of the United States is illegal and against the law inside those borders where they can safely plan all kinds of covert, illegal and reprehensible acts against other states to "assist" or "promote" what can be done legally and above board according to International Law by the US government acting in an "official" capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pure hypocrisy based on nothing other than the fact that other countries do it too and puts paid to any idea that you're in any way better, or defending some higher purpose than they say they are, either.
