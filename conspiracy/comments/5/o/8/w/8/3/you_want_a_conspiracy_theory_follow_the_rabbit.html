    <div class="md"><p>John Astor was richest man in 1912
Astor was in investor in Tesla
The Tower wasn&#39;t finished because of lack of funding due investors (JP Morgan) jumping ship when tesla changed his designs to compete with Marconi
John Astor died on the Titanic
The Titanic went down April 1912
December 1913 Fed reserve is instituted 
Futility or wreck of the titan appears to be a prediction of the titanic? 
John Trump was trumps uncle specifically an electrical engineer </p>

<p>Trump and Astor were both anti establishment rich real estate guys? 
Trump speaking at the Waldorf Astoria I&#39;m not sure I see the connection. Tesla took out mortgages on his wardenclyfe property from the previous owner of Waldorf Astoria to cover expenses and never paid those back</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I follow. The current owner of the Waldorf Astoria is a Chinese company...
What are you getting at?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what?  I&#39;m actually <em>very</em> happy that you responded with this message.  When I initially came across the information, it was mind-blowingly revelatory to me - it was a paradigm shift, and it change my perspective to a significant extent with regard to how I look at things, the world, etc.  A good portion of <em>why</em> I saved and keep linking this practically &quot;ancient&quot; (by Redit standards anyway), four year old response still is because I feel if I can help another come to the same insight that I arrived at when I came across the information, then I will have helped another enrich their awareness and understanding of the world, of this civilization, and of their collective and individual existence in it in the way I feel mine was raised as well when I came across the information.</p>

<p>As such, and for that reason, I - again - thank you for coming on here and making this response.  It lets me know that my efforts have not been in vain or fruitless.</p>

<p>If at the end of the day, you are literally the only person who ever gets anything out of my linking this response, then - as far as I&#39;m concerned - my linking it has been worth it.</p>
