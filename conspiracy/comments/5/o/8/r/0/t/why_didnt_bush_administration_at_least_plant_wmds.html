       I think because they couldn't... I don't know shit about that stuff but I know everyone in the world made a big deal about Hans Blix heading in there to look for them... I'm guessing he was a guy that wouldn't adhere to the narrative for the CIA I guess?

       That's what I recall too. Found some suspicious shipping containers (32?) and sent them back. The news about it  was faint to hardly seen at all . Those of us who were watching and a lot of military personnel were practically everywhere anything could be hidden.

       It's difficult and risky to sneak the really bad WMD's in somewhere. Not finding them and going "welp, at least we brought them democracy" could have been determined to be the safest course of action.

       Because Rumsfeld remembered giving chemical weapons to Saddam in the 1980s for the Iran/Iraq war. WMD was just doublespeak to make the U.S. pubic think Saddam had a nuke. Somehow Saddam got rid of them before the invasion to embarrass Bush.

       They would easily just have actors or something go to the "polls" and put it on tv. All they'd need is like 20 people if that, and they can make it seem like 4,000 people went there. Do you think it's that easy? This is a WAR on FREEDOM. If you want to win, you better fucking fight with your life, not just not showing up to vote when voting doesn't mean shit anyway. IF we could rally and unite EVERYONE, than we could do a lot more than just "don't vote".

       From what I know from people I know who were too generals at the time and stationed over there, there were WMDs. They were found, and then "lost" (strategically moved to another country). They were not nuclear but chemical.
