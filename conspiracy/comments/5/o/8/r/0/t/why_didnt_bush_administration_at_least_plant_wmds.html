<p>U are talking about ppl who openly lied. Look at shilldog &amp; co. They aren&#39;t the smartest. They are brazen as they know they are untouchable. U are a peon. And ant. U are shit. This is how u are treated. If u aren&#39;t doing something everyday to stop it u are welcoming it. </p>

<p>Also never vote. Don&#39;t be complicit in these crimes. If no one showed up to the polls see how long they&#39;d keep the charade on for. </p>

If you want to win, you better fucking fight with your life, not just not showing up to vote when voting doesn&#39;t mean shit anyway.
