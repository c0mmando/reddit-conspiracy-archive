        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s look at the evidence. In 2014 a study was done showing that up to ~2.8 million non citizens could have voted in the 2008 election. <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/non-citizensvote/">http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/non-citizensvote/</a> Now remember that there are much more illegal immigrants in the U.S. than there were eight years ago. In California they have extremely loose voter ID laws, and you also do not need a drivers license or SSN to register to vote also. <a href="https://covr.sos.ca.gov/?language=en-US">https://covr.sos.ca.gov/?language=en-US</a> Outside of California Hillary lost by 1.7 million votes to Trump. Ask yourself how Hillary, in a state she did not need to campaign in at all, won the state by such an immense margin, even beating the total amount of votes Obama got in CA in 2008. </p>

<p>The government and mainstream media claim that voter fraud is not an issue at all in America, but a NY election commissioner admitted on hidden camera that voter fraud is a real problem. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUDTcxIqqM0&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUDTcxIqqM0&amp;t</a> James O&#39;Keefe&#39;s hidden camera video also shows Democratic operatives in pro-Hillary super PACs (that colluded with HRCs campaign) plainly stating plans to commit mass voter fraud, and to bus people around to vote as many times as possible in states with loose voter ID laws. </p>

<p>A temporary employee in Broward County, FL walked in on SOE officials filling out stacks and stacks of absentee ballots in a back room. She was fired the next day when she showed up to work. <a href="http://ijr.com/opinion/2016/11/261634-florida-voter-fraud-broward-county/">http://ijr.com/opinion/2016/11/261634-florida-voter-fraud-broward-county/</a> Sworn affidavit <a href="https://cdn2.ijr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AffidavitRedacted.pdf">https://cdn2.ijr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AffidavitRedacted.pdf</a> It was also reported that Hillary Clinton herself met with Broward County, FL Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes just weeks before the general election. <a href="https://archive.is/ujtYb">https://archive.is/ujtYb</a></p>

<p>More circumstantial evidence - Hillary and Kaine were known to have struggled greatly with rally attendance; <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/wow-tim-kaine-holds-rally-30-people-show/">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/wow-tim-kaine-holds-rally-30-people-show/</a> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3240170/Empty-seat-syndrome-Sparse-crowds-Hillary-New-Hampshire-Jeb-Nevada-Trump-s-audience-overflows-thousands.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3240170/Empty-seat-syndrome-Sparse-crowds-Hillary-New-Hampshire-Jeb-Nevada-Trump-s-audience-overflows-thousands.html</a> <a href="http://usuncut.com/politics/how-this-weekends-bernie-sanders-iowa-rally-compared-to-hillary-clintons/">http://usuncut.com/politics/how-this-weekends-bernie-sanders-iowa-rally-compared-to-hillary-clintons/</a> <a href="https://www.conservativeoutfitters.com/blogs/news/media-caught-lying-about-the-crowd-size-of-hillary-clinton-rallys">https://www.conservativeoutfitters.com/blogs/news/media-caught-lying-about-the-crowd-size-of-hillary-clinton-rallys</a></p>

<p>They were even known to have cancelled scheduled rallies due to complete lack of interest <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/07/31/second-day-on-campaign-trail-and-clinton-kaine-cancel-cleveland-ohio-appearance/">https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/07/31/second-day-on-campaign-trail-and-clinton-kaine-cancel-cleveland-ohio-appearance/</a> and even two weeks from the election, Kaine couldn&#39;t fill high school <em>auxiliary</em> gymnasiums. <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/tim-kaine-holds-ohio-rally-cant-even-fill-small-high-school-auxiliary-gym-video/">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/tim-kaine-holds-ohio-rally-cant-even-fill-small-high-school-auxiliary-gym-video/</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Trump was filling out stadiums, sometimes leaving thousands outside due to capacity restrictions. <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dj1L0TNNHTg/maxresdefault.jpg">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dj1L0TNNHTg/maxresdefault.jpg</a> <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwdKXTIXUAAFuwb.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwdKXTIXUAAFuwb.jpg</a> <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/trump-rally-north-carolina.jpg?w=640&amp;h=272">https://theconservativetreehouse.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/trump-rally-north-carolina.jpg?w=640&amp;h=272</a></p>

<p>All mainstream outlets peddled polling statistics that had been skewed by under polling republicans and independents and MSM also claimed a Hillary win was basically a sure thing. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-cubs-have-a-smaller-chance-of-winning-than-trump-does/">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-cubs-have-a-smaller-chance-of-winning-than-trump-does/</a> <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-04/market-indicator-gives-trump-86-chance-winning-election">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-04/market-indicator-gives-trump-86-chance-winning-election</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?_r=0</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/high-probability-clinton-winning_us_581d0399e4b0e80b02ca2498">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/high-probability-clinton-winning_us_581d0399e4b0e80b02ca2498</a> </p>

<p>Now ask yourself how someone who seemingly has support from every government agency, mainstream media outlet, sitting/former presidents, and a myriad of popular celebrities loses the election at all. My claim is that Hillary lost the election through the electoral college <strong>AND</strong> the popular vote and tried to steal the election through coordinated mass voter fraud, most of which came from illegal immigrants in California, a state that arguably has the loosest voter ID and registration laws, as well as voter suppression with a &#39;Trump is hopeless and melting down&#39; mainstream media narrative.</p>

<li><p>California has a population of 39 million people. It&#39;s not out of the question, actually pretty probable considering the political leanings of the state, that Hillary would get enough to surpass Trump in the popular vote by legitimate means. Large-scale fraud there would also be unnecessary, of course. The electoral votes are still what matters in the end. </p></li>

<li><p>There&#39;s still no evidence of large-scale voter fraud. Only allegations, disputed numbers from studies with shaky methodology, and undercover videos that may be missing context (bussing people legally is actually a thing)</p></li>
<li><p>Many polls purposefully undersampled republicans because there are statistically fewer people who identify as republican than democrat. This is why republican politicians are the most active in redrawing district lines and suppressing votes from certain demographics, because they are always more likely to lose when more people vote. As for why the polls obviously differed from the results, I think that has to do more with the reliance in the term &quot;likely voter&quot;. Hillary had less hype than any presidential candidate I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime. People may have just disliked Trump, assumed he&#39;d lose anyway, and didn&#39;t care to waste their time voting for someone they&#39;re not very excited about. There&#39;s also no evidence falsely reporting a Hillary lead would even do anything to help her. It&#39;d probably hurt their campaign strategy, if anything. </p></li>

<p>Not in states that generally vote republican. Here&#39;s one clear example that was reported on where they did this in Arizona. Republicans won by over 8% in 2008 and 9% in 2012. In this poll this year, when you look at the numbers they overpolled democrats by 34%, which still only gave the image that Hillary had a five point lead. These are the kinds of polls that were peddled to the American public to make it look like Trump had zero chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for one thing, I don&#39;t think any over-reliance on a single poll is good. I hated when the media would freak out over 1 poll showing a new 10-pt lead for Hillary or something when that&#39;s not what the aggregate would show. </p>

<p>This case you&#39;re talking about is likely just a consequence of their methodology. Not every poll takes a representative sample of parties. Some are just random, and you can end up with R+30 as well. This sometimes has to do with where the samples are drawn from. It&#39;s hard to be truly representative with that, and you can accidentally skew your demographics to any side, but it&#39;s also a much easier way of conducting polls. </p>

<p>The important thing here, though, is that they&#39;re showing you this. If they were purposefully manipulating the polls, they could just as easily give something like an R+5 and report Hillary winning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a vote but none of the votes were counted. They were all thrown out and the CIA faked the results. You can&#39;t view any of the votes because they don&#39;t exist, it&#39;s why the governor of Kentucky refused to allow 3rd parties to view votes awhile back.</p>
