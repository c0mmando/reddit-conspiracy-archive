       I've heard the spiel about supposed technology.  I've heard the spiel about a "foothold" in the middle east.  I've heard the spiel about how they have a right to exist, due to an outdated religious belief system.  I don't believe any of it.
      </p>

       Israel is a huge liability.  It will be interesting to see what, if anything, changes under Trump.  It's looking doubtful, and there will probably be even more illegal settlement building on Palestinian land.

       I thought Jewish belief was to only return to Israel upon the arrival of the son of god?

       I personally think Israel is an instigator. The moment Netanyahu went to the UN with a cartoon cut out, I knew they were going to be a great asset to the military industrial complex.

       I used to think it was because Israel was a beacon of democracy surrounded by the barbarian hordes around them.  Maybe they used to be.  Today's israel seems so much like the old South Africa apartheid I've read about.  I get they are sensitive and defensive as they've been hunted through the years but it now seems like the bullied is now the bully.

       To the OPs point, I am unsure what we get from thrm other than SodaStreams in Walmart no one buys because it is cheaper to buy already made 2 liters.

       As far as BDS goes, they are not a peaceful group. Their actions provoke both sides of the conflict and are making peace negotiations even more difficult.

       That's odd, I seem to recall Israeli's rather openly threatening the lives of the BDS leaders.  BDS is about boycotting Apartheid like treatment.  How is a boycott wrong.  If you don't agree with something you should be able to avoid trade with that entity.  Somehow Israel is making that illegal, in various places around the world.  So, which side is provoking?

       I don't recall Israel threatening the lives of BDS leaders. I'd like to see a link if you have it. But that is very wrong of Israel if that is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       A boycott is OK, but the BDS movement takes it much further.  The group demonizes Israel and doesn't honestly describe the situation on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have other issues with it. Mainly I believe that the boycott and anti Israel rhetoric the BDS movement condones will never lead to peace. It will only encourage extremism on both sides.

       Maybe now you could explain how a boycott is in any way "extremism"?  I know Jews take money very seriously, but a boycott is one of the most basic of human rights.  Maybe you could also explain how you would feel if after over 70 years of being treated as the Jews were in the Warsaw Ghetto, how you refrain from being uncivil?  There are roughly 10 killed Palestinians to ONE Israeli.  How is it Israel is always the victim?

       Nah. The Palestinian population is growing. The Israelis and Palestinians just signed a major water agreement which is a good sign. Israel has to agree to a two state solution in order to remain a democracy. It may not happen any time soon since extremists are in charge on both sides. But it will eventually happen.

       PS, I always hear this touted by online defenders.  I'm sorry that these people just refuse to die easily for the Israelis.  Hey, maybe they could just set up some ovens, or gas chambers?  They've already become the nazi's, quite a while ago.  Look at how one sided our press is, and it has been since about the 1980's.  Israeli's by and large view themselves as superior, and the Palestinians as animals.

       Funny, because I always hear the crap you are spewing from the anti Israel folks. I especially like how you guys always use the false equivalency of Israelis being Nazis. It's a land dispute. Not some mass extermination. If the Israelis really wanted to get rid of the Palestinians, they have the capability of doing it in a total of about 5 hours.

       I'm still trying to figure it out too. I don't have answers to your specific questions, but I recently watched some David Ike video on Israel that presented an establishment that was most likely set up on false pretenses (brought to light by author Shlomo Sands) and by individuals that didn't necessarily have the best interests of the Jewish people.

       I'm still trying to figure it all out too. If the US truly has an agenda to conquer the middle east, then Israel would be an ally to help police the lands in the aftermath. There's evidence that ISIS is formed in coordination between Israel, US, and Saudi Arabis...

       I don't know what you are trying to accomplish, but Israel is run by a psychopath named Banjamin Netanyahu.  He and Ehud Barak, Richard Perle etc, are also instrumental in 9/11, along with the Bush administration, to promote a never-ending war on terror, which is really a war to destroy all of Israels enemies.

       Maybe ask the UN.  There have been 77 resolutions against Israels illegal land grabs since its existence, yet all of the countries in the UN, including the USA, do jack shit about it.  Perhaps it's because they are the pre-emanate terrorists in the world?  People that go against Israel, tend to end up dead.

       we have whats called a ZOG(zionist occupied government). israel has zero benefit for Americans whatsoever. yet the ZOG continues to steal our money and send it to them so they can continue atrocities and genocide in their alleged state of zionist terrorists. israel should be condemned by those who consider themselves ethical and for human rights like Saudi Arabia is condemned

       If you can do without material things, you can do it.  But I also never wanted kids, so I'm not trapped as most are.  The only tax I will willingly pay, (besides the many built-in gas taxes, etc, and we have no sales tax) will be our property tax. That's it.  This decision wasn't really one I wanted to choose, I feel this life was more forced upon me.  I went to college.  I have never been in trouble.  But as someone said, americans are only given one single chance to make it.  The rich get chance after chance without falling into debt.

       doesnt it strike you funny that we're the only species that pays to live? of course the nature of things is give and take, but the global forms of currency is used to control it all. the sooner people realize that money is worthless, the quicker we can quit our jobs, free ourselves and become self sustaining

       Remember Israel coming to America's aid during Hurricane Katrina amd Hurricane Sandy? What about when they sent troops to fight alongside Americans? No? I don't remember either! But if politicians agree to send Billions to Israel, Millions will be donated to them come election time. It's a wise investment.

       They are the MICs number one customer and a way to move massive sums of taxpayer money to private hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tax money is collected and given in aid packages to places like Israel/KSA/anywhere who then turn around to buy weapons from the likes of Boeing or Lockheed-Martin. The tax payer money enriches these shareholders who are of the donor class and props up employment stats with some jobs at least until it goes fully automated.

       Maybe now you could explain how a boycott is in any way "extremism"?  I know Jews take money very seriously, but a boycott is one of the most basic of human rights.  Maybe you could also explain how you would feel if after over 70 years of being treated as the Jews were in the Warsaw Ghetto, how you refrain from being uncivil?  There are roughly 10 killed Palestinians to ONE Israeli.  How is it Israel is always the victim?

       Maybe ask the UN.  There have been 77 resolutions against Israels illegal land grabs since its existence, yet all of the countries in the UN, including the USA, do jack shit about it.  Perhaps it's because they are the pre-emanate terrorists in the world?  People that go against Israel, tend to end up dead.
