    <div class="md"><p>Umm, he was against Snowden when Snowden first leaked. Just like most of America when all we knew was what the MSM told us to know. They framed the news as high treason. Only later when the truth came out did our position change. Trump has not commented since but keep in mind he was against Assange at one point too. People are allowed to change their mind </p>

<p>Granted, this is Donald Trump we&#39;re talking about. He could have just been saying to boost ratings. Maybe he had a <em>Ding-dong The Traitor&#39;s Dead</em> champagne in production at the time which was later scrapped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t care who snowden is working with or why he released the data. </p>

<p>we had a right and a need to know the contents of the data he released.</p>

<p>if trump makes executing snowden a thing, he will lose those of us who are not his voters, who don&#39;t particularly care for him, but detest hypocrisy and are well enough versed in what our govt has actually been doing to know that nothing trump proposes is different from what is already the law of the land and common operating procedure.</p>

<p>we have been taking far more shit for being put in the position of defending trump, then trump supporters because we are surrounded by the vichy left, not the  likeminded. </p>

<p>i was screamed at just this morning by my parents for correcting their belief that buzzfeed is a quality news outlet. it devolved into their hysterical ranting about how happy i will be when we are all russian citizens. i haven&#39;t dealt with this kind of insane bullshit since war games came out.</p>

<p>we are taking a stand now for him, because we believe in the rule of law, and because of our contempt (and fear) of the unprecedented efforts to create a case for trump to be charged and convicted and hung as a traitor, as the opening salvo to WW3.</p>

<p>he really shouldn&#39;t antagonize those of us fighting from the libertarian left on his behalf.</p>

<p>if he persists with the snowden threats, or follows through, then we will step aside-- &quot;live by the sword, die by the sword.&quot; he needs us. the old war between the libertarian left and the deep state has been revived.</p>

<p>after the election, much of counterpunch was unreadable ZOMG!! TRUMP?!?!!! bullshit. it is now taking a righteous stand against the blatant coup and ginning up for war in progress, despite having no use for the individual it is fighting for (same as jimmy dore).   </p>

<p>trump needs us. the country needs a untied libertarianate--from the left and the right. we have far more in common than we don&#39;t and in age of inverted totalitarian facisim (which has been the case for decades), what we have most in common is the most critical issue right now..</p>

<p>snowden and assange are non-starters. regardless of who they may ultimately be working for, the information they have provided has been invaluable, even if it has an agenda. nothing in the world is free of agenda.</p>

<p>vichy left=rank and file progressives/liberals/democrats, who are opposed to neoconservativism and neoliberalism and kleptocratic crony plutocracy, but who are willfully blind in their unquestioning support of the democractic party establishment&#39;s betrayal of all they believe in, because it is their team and because they&#39;ve been brainwashed to believe that all sins can be forgiven so long as you toe the line on identy politics. like the vichy govt, they are collaborators, the left&#39;s version of good germans.</p>

<p>they hate the libertarian left even more than they hate republicans. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>i don&#39;t care who snowden is working with or why he released the data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The data he released are far more important than the reasons why they were released, I agree, but looking at with/for whom (if anyone - personally I think it likely that Snowden is &#39;just&#39; a whistleblower) he was working provides useful context and additional information.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If Snowden was working alone, and didn&#39;t release the data due to some outside influence, then it and his statements regarding it can be taken &#39;as-is&#39;</p></li>
<li><p>If GPs suggestion that Snowden is working for the CIA against NSA, then that suggests at least one of the agencies is acting against the government to some degree. Ostensibly, both agencies are answerable to the government, so any in-fighting suggests that control is dysfunctional (either because CIA and/or NSA consider themselves not answerable to the government, or because the political leadership is providing contradictory orders/guidance to the various intelligence agencies)</p></li>
<li><p>If Snowden is working with another state entity (e.g. Russia or China, but there are plenty of other candidates), and they chose to make the data public, then there are likely other data/agents working for that state (otherwise they have burnt their advantage - knowing information that few others do - for little reason). This is speculation on my part, but that &#39;deeper&#39; access could be something like access to the actual tapped data (rather than just generic knowledge of what could be tapped) or the ability to manipulate that data feed in some way (which given the increasing ability to rely on that data for broader purposes, and techniques like parallel construction which disguise the source and thus may obfuscate any evidence of tampering, grants the ability to criminalise and manipulate people relatively easily) </p></li>

I like to believe that as he ran, he learned how truly evil and corrupt the system is, more so than he could ever imagine. Trump has basically said himself that he trusts Wikileaks over some of the stuff that comes from the CIA. I wonder if his opinion on Snowden has changed at this point </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mistake. His execution statement was made a few years ago. However, just before the election, when asked by Anderson Cooper how he would handle Snowden, Trump remarked that since our relationship with Russia is going to be so big league, he&#39;s going to work out a big league deal to have Snowden extradited, at which point he will deal with him &quot;very harshly&quot;. Make of that what you will. Sounds pretty big league to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good conspiracy involves a few things: very small group of very loyal like-minded people and plausible debiability.</p>

<p>To fake a popular vote on a massive scale in the US would be very difficult.  Anyone can volunteer on election day, hell I did it.  To fake the popular vote you would need thousands and thousands of people in every polling place in the US.  You would need access to a huge array of ballots, and access/control of a variety of voting machines.</p>

<p>It is very hard to disrupt even one polling place (people have tried before) but to do it in many districts nation wide?  Someone is going to see something and speak out.  Its why &quot;Russians hacked the election,&quot; is poor rhetoric, as it implies something about the way ballots were counted were wrong.</p>

<p>Big conspiracies often end up getting leaked.</p>

<p>It would be more plausible to say that the dossier on Trump being a foreign agent is a conspiracy to encourage divisiveness.  There are 6? Or so sources listed in the memos and as of yet non have been verified by an intelligence agency, though I&#39;m not convinced that even if the allegations were true the community would come forward with it.  Treason and having to execute a president of the United States would cause us to lose a lot of face, encourage divisiveness, and possibly cause ramifications that are worse than a pro-Russia foreign policy.  But it is much more likely that is part of a smaller group effort.  Christopher Steele has gone missing and is not commenting on it.</p>

<p>We still don&#39;t know the whole truth about the JFK hit, 9/11, and the most mind-boggling one of all (because the coverup seems to involve an entire community, including people with seemingly nothing to gain by participating), Sandy Hook (I know that one might rattle some people--I didn&#39;t believe it was a hoax either until I did some very deep digging). I assure you that if you take the time to do the research, Sandy Hook just doesn&#39;t add up. The evidence of a coverup is staggering. </p>

The evidence for this premise is weak, kept secret, and generally smells of propaganda. Even so, if it&#39;s accepted Russia helped Trump by hacking the DNC, you need at least another premise to prove Trump&#39;s ties to Russia and generalize something about collusion.

<p>Buzzfeed had the details and all the docs and they were the ones who released it and then this became an issue. 4chan foreshadowed this, so yeah I trust 4chan over some MI6 agent who has admitted to working for a vengeful Jeb.

<p>Maybe. He was briefed a while ago. Buzzfeed may have also released it since Trump already had a news conference planned the very next day to talk about his business and conflicts of interest. The morning after Buzzfeed published Trump had his conference.</p>

<p>In fact, the fact that Trump and Obama were only recently briefed on it (early January) suggests the intelligence community didn&#39;t have it until now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After host Sean Hannity talked about the penny plan, [relevant exchange begins around 7:25] Trump said, “except the military.”</p>

<p>He was then asked, “[Y]ou would increase spending on the military?” Trump responded, “I would increase on the military.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump said in a speech to the Union League of Philadelphia that he will ask Congress to reverse cuts to defense spending enacted under the 2013 budget sequester once he takes office and submit a new budget to rebuild the US military, which Trump described as unprepared to confront the threats the US faces.
Trump did not say whether the increase in military spending would match or exceed pre-sequester funding levels, but a senior campaign aide said Trump would most likely seek to boost defense spending to higher levels than when the sequester went into effect in 2013 after Congress failed to reach a new budget agreement, slashing both defense and domestic spending.
Trump did not outline how large the increase would be, but the senior campaign aide said eliminating the sequester would amount to a roughly $500 billion reinvestment over 10 years, which Trump said he would seek to &quot;fully offset&quot; through &quot;common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks.
&quot;History shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest. We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military dominance,&quot; Trump said as he lamented the cuts to defense spending, which he said is &quot;on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy.&quot; The US spent more than $600 billion in defense spending in 2015.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression…from our adversaries,&quot; Trump declared with sweeping rhetoric that described a world in chaos after the foreign policy decisions of the Obama administration. &quot;Our adversaries are chomping at the bit.&quot;
&quot;It is so depleted,&quot; Trump said. &quot;We will rebuild our military.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad Trump has spoken about this, but the US has already spent $400 billion on those jets and only 200 of them have been built (there was a huge acquisition this year incidentally). For a while now the Air Force has wanted to shift away from long, expensive programs like the f35&#39;s to faster more dynamic programs in order to stay competitive with other militaries as technology evolves, and to do that it&#39;s been acknowledged that we need to halt the f35 program because it&#39;s just so fucking expensive. Any money that will be saved by ending it will likely just be diverted to these new programs (we can expect this especially since Trump has already promised to raise the military budget), and we&#39;ve already sunk such ridiculous sums into it anyway and for such a poor return (1-2 billion per jet if we stop today?) that it still looks like we got pretty well screwed no matter what Trump does now.

<p>I&#39;m not a supporter, and it&#39;s bullshit I have to announce that now before giving an opinion, but he seemed to lose momentum after meeting with Obama.  It seems like he was either told things he wasn&#39;t aware of, or he was forced to, or he is attempting to appease those that oppose his presidency.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s the last option, what he doesn&#39;t understand is, it&#39;s not his values they are against.  Most people are anti-trump because he is Trump.  They have no logical reason.  There are many logical reasons to oppose, but most of the opposed are only hating because he isn&#39;t Clinton.  Which is kind of funny, because a good portion of his voters voted for him...because he isn&#39;t Clinton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to add to that last part there, and no I don&#39;t give a shite about either too, but I did find that: the people who voted for trump because he wasn&#39;t Clinton did so under that premise to begin with and later actually learned a few things. Vice versa, it&#39;s a total shit show. How could someone just vote for someone because they were told/showed numerous scandalous stuff, (which may or may not have been true, or just taken out of context) without then looking for a candidate who was actually better. Why research one and not the other? Silly &#39;mericans.</p>

<p>I think he&#39;s a bit narcissistic and probably partly did it for the fame/infamy but I don&#39;t think it was controlled. It&#39;s easy to say it now if you ignore just how hard several major outlets tried to bury the story at the time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think Snowden is a terrible threat, I think he’s a terrible traitor, and you know what we used to do in the good old days when we were a strong country — you know what we used to do to traitors, right?” Trump said.</p>

<p>“Well, you killed them, Donald,” said fill-in host, Eric Bolling.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump’s response: Well, he is damaging America.</p>

<p>“This guy is really doing damage to this country, and he’s also making us look like dopes. We can’t allow this guy to go out there and give out all our secrets and also embarrass us at every level. We should get him back and get him back now.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, Trump&#39;s new CIA director:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He should be brought back from Russia and given due process, and I think that the proper outcome would be that he would be given a death sentence for having put friends of mine, friends of yours, in the military today, at enormous risk because of the information he stole and then released to foreign powers.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think Snowden is a terrible threat, I think he’s a terrible traitor and you know what we used to do in the good old days when we were a strong country, you know what we used to do to traitors right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty strong implication of what he wants.  Keep in mind that this was back in 2013, but I have yet to see any indication that Trump&#39;s position has changed.  Back in February, Trump&#39;s CIA director pick said <a href="https://reason.com/blog/2016/11/18/watch-trumps-reported-pick-to-run-the-ci">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s absolutely the case that we have not been able to secure all the American information that we needed to, and that we&#39;ve had the traitor Edward Snowden steal that information. He should be brought back from Russia and given due process, and I think the proper outcome would be that he would be given a death sentence for having put friends of mine, friends of yours, who served in the military today, at enormous risk, because of the information he stole and then released to foreign powers.</p>

<p>There is still a thing called execution.... You have to take a strong hand (or &quot;strong end&quot; maybe).... Unless the retribution is swift and really strong, you&#39;re going to have other people coming out with more information than he&#39;s had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mistake. His execution statement was made a few years ago. However, just before the election, when asked by Anderson Cooper how he would handle Snowden, Trump remarked that since our relationship with Russia is going to be so big league, he&#39;s going to work out a big league deal to have Snowden extradited, at which point he will deal with him &quot;very harshly&quot;. Make of that what you will. Sounds pretty big league to me. </p>
