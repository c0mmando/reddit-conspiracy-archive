       His official story doesn't add up. He claims it was probably a Xanax overdose. But she died 9-12 hours after the initial ingestion of Xanax. Xanax has a very short half life (90 minutes or so). It would've peaked in her system within 3 hours. 9 hours later there would hardly be any left. It's like he's ignorantly trying to throw detectives off the trail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even mixed with alcohol, she wouldn't still be breathing 9 hours later, then dying sometime in the next two hours. Even if mixed with painkillers or other drugs, the timeline doesn't make any sense. If you die from a drug overdose or drug cocktail, it doesn't happen 9-12 hours later. It happens relatively quickly, when the drugs peak in your system, not while your body is rapidly breaking them down into harmless metabolites.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/arts/patton-oswalt-ill-never-be-at-100-percent-again.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       6 months later, the coroner has still not declared a cause of death. What's taking so long? Are detectives trying to put together a case? Unlike NYPD who prides itself on perp-walking celebrities and business big-wigs, the LAPD loves to defer to celebrities and gives them a pass on things even when they're really suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, his behavior after his wife's death. His FB posts about his alleged grief turn into unrelated political rants within a few sentences, like he completely forgets how devastated he claims to be about the situation. Which is also a bit strange. He's milking his wife's death for publicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also claims to be trying to "get to the bottom" of his wife's death. You know what they say about criminals loving to investigate the scene of their own crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying he definitely killed his wife. But damn is it suspicious. The more you dig the more fishy it looks. He's lying about something. Maybe his wife was a massive drug-addicted mess and he's covering for that. But his story, "she took a xanax, went to bed, and the xanax killed her 11 hours later" is just fucking nonsense.

       Most likely that he's covering her (and probably his) drug abuse to try and protect her reputation/save face.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for milking it and political rants? He's a liberal comedian, that's what they do. Add in grief from a dead wife and I'll bet he just doubled down on his 'cause'.

       Fair point, however, there are some policies that do cover suicide; though they are scarce and probably have numerous provisions and increased premiums. From what I recall you have to had the policy for x? amount of years prior to suicide

       ive wondered the same about a few friends ive lost to OD's. much easier to just shoot that last strong dose and just be done with addiction forever than make it through rehab again, as fucked up as it sounds it makes more sense to me than a straight OD.

       yeah, especially when youre that deep. death sounds so much easier. suboxone/methadone usually just leads to another drawn out addiction as well.

       Subs and methadone are both strong ass drugs. I havent touched dope in over a year and methadone rocks me pretty hard whenever i do it. plus alot of times doctors will throw benzos on top of that. Speaking from experience benzo withdrawal is even worse than dope

       I lost a friend at age 24 because she doubled her dose of a new anti depressant and had a glass of wine.  On the old medication she got a mild high. With the new medication, she did not wake up.

       Barely any at all.
I've had a really high tolerance to everything I've ever tried, but a friend gave me ONE square of a 4mg pressed bar. So like an almost unnoticeable amount, 1mg? That's nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is weird because of the white bars, I've had a whole bar with no effect at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently my body thought it was plenty.
At first I kind of enjoyed it, it felt exactly like smoking weed, without the paranoia. I was happy, had munchies, giggly, my eyes even got red and I had cottonmouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the first hour or so it was great. Then I felt really dizzy. But I was too weak/tired to move. About a minute later I sat up and Hollywood style projectile vomited across my god damn bed and room.
      </p>
      <p>
       An overwhelming feeling of nausea came over me, and I felt horrible. I felt like my motor skills no longer worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't move, I couldn't talk. Something as simple as the fan blowing on my felt like it was burning my skin. All sensation felt magnified by 100x. Not in a good way.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the while my conscious thoughts were fine, I could think in my head normally, but I was unable to put any of my thoughts into action. I sat in my vomit while my girl cleaned me and everything up. (Saint).
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt like I was moving, but at slower than a snails pace. To her I wasn't moving at all,but I thought I was.
      </p>
      <p>
       She tried to reposition me, but every movement hurt and made me want to get sick again.
It was hard to breathe, my throat felt swollen. The only easy way to breathe was to make a small noise. 
Think of a pained "huuh" every now and then when I needed to get some air, lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize it sounds exaggerated, stabbed, shot,and blown up, and nothing compared to this feeling. It was terrible. 
When I closed my eyes prior to getting sick I'd see ridiculous geometric shapes pulsing with colors.
Now it was just red.
      </p>
      <p>
       This continued for about 4 hours. Vomiting, unable to breathe, Nausea and feeling displaced, paranoia crept in, unable to move, until I passed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I just had an allergic reaction to something in the pill, but I'm not allergic to anything as far as I know.

       I don't know enough to comment on the rest, but in regards to his FB behavior it's not something odd if he lost someone he cared about.  Grief affects different people in different ways, depending on their mental stability and any number of factors.  I recall people saying his wife was his rock, so with her gone he might easily become unhinged.  Grief turning to anger isn't an odd thing, even quickly and within a few sentences.  He could easily feel powerless, the anger builds, and the smallest thought(like about politics) gives him some way to vent that anger even though it's not constructive.
      </p>

       Look at Kanye West.  After his mother died he supposedly started acting very uncharacteristically and crazy.  People said his mental state was deteriorating from grief, and I think he finally went to a clinic not that long ago to deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is this; whether or not Patton killed his wife or is covering up something about her life/death, his grief-into-political-anger thing could honestly be a real reaction to her death.  Maybe he's even angrier due to the secrets he is keeping, and he has no catharsis so he just lashes out blindly.

       No he is making two claims:
1. Patrons story does not add up
2. Her death is suspicious.

       He didn't suggest, he suggested the events of her death are suspicious. You are putting things in quotes, attributing them to things the OP said. But he didn't say any of those things.

       You're mistaking  overall Half-Life with Peak potency.  Peak potency is where you will get into trouble with death. Half life longevity is simply referring to the body processing the drug and the length of time it takes to metabolize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Xanax Peak potency is about 90 minutes. Probably even less.

       Okay but what if she took some other drugs, in a less lethal dose; metabolic interaction could explain a death especially if a high amount was taken within a certain time frame.

       Sure I it could be a drug interaction but I wouldn't think so as benzodiazepines are very tolerated fairly well with other drugs. I think the point at hand here is that a woman died and they blamed it on Xanax which is highly unlikely. I would definitely agree that there's more to her death then just a Xanax.

       His feelings must be hurt because some strangers on the internet are talking about the possibility of him killing his wife so we should just stop talking about it. You're right. We all promise to stop talking about it so just never visit this sub again and trust that we will stop. And don't under any circumstances question whether or not the discussion has stopped because we care very deeply about this sub and would be tremendously hurt if you didn't trust us to follow through with the promise to stop discussing it. Go away.

       This is a perfect example of why people hate conspiracy theorists. You lack any sense that accusations hold weight. Based on nothing you're insinuating that a man murdered his wife. So many other popular theories around here are repulsive in this same way, just on a much larger scale. People hate you not because they shy away from harsh truths, but because you pull shit like this... or claiming that people whose children were murdered were collaborators in a newtown conspiracy... or calling people who got limbs blown off actors... or baselessly accusing pizza parlor owners of pedophilia because they like different art than you. You should feel ashamed to do this.

       Based on a bullshit story he told about the untimely death of his wife. Why is he lying? His wife died under mysterious circumstances and he lied to the public about it. His official story is ludicrous to anyone with basic medical knowledge. When a husband lies about the cause of his wife's death, questions deserve to be asked. Homicide of one's spouse isn't exactly a rare phenomenon.

       His explanation that "sleep until you wake up" refers to parents not getting any sleep with kids makes 100% sense. It very clearly means "I'll watch the kids, just get some sleep." That you suggest instead that it's creepy says more about you than him. That he offered a guess of how his wife died does not mean he lied. It's not the same and you're a total piece of garbage.

       Yes but you claim the coroner hasn't released a cause of death based on an article from October. How do you know nothing has come out since then? Just because it wasn't made public? Maybe they deemed it a suicide and Patton is keeping quiet about it.

       People are just asking questions and pointing out strange things with this particular case. You never know what the truth is unless you look into it and not just take someone else's word for what happened. This thread isn't hurting patton, he's not looking at this and crying because some strangers think his wife's death is suspicious. Discussions aren't harmful. Thought policing and discouraging people from questioning major and minor events alike, that's what is harmful because when we stop questioning things, bad things are able to continue with no opposition or fear of being found out. If you don't like researching and discussing current events and their possible conspiratorial nature then you should just leave. And take your emotional arguments with you. They mean nothing.

       "Just asking questions." How do you people still say this with a straight face after a dude "just asking questions" walked into a pizza parlor with a rifle. One thing you guys love to do is convert "just asking questions" into "this thing is 100% happening based on 12 different evidence-like nothingburgers I found on 4chan and instagram." I think there's no doubt Patton Oswalt will soon hear that conspiracy theorists are claiming he murdered his wife, since you asshole junior investigators will hound him with it now that you've gotten it into your heads he's a murderer. Patton Oswalt is not a current event. This is not a political conspiracy or a phony casus belli. This is a random comedian who y'all are in the process of smearing.

       Good point. This sure doesn't sound anything like a wild accusation framed as a question in an idiot's attempt to shift the burden of proof to those who don't believe baselessly that Patton Oswalt is a murderer: "I'm not saying he definitely killed his wife. But damn is it suspicious. The more you dig the more fishy it looks. He's lying about something. Maybe his wife was a massive drug-addicted mess and he's covering for that." That y'all are still sticking with the "just asking questions" frame after years of people telling you why it's so goddamn stupid would be hilarious if it weren't so sad.

       You didn't say it explicitly. I just assumed that because you said that
       <em>
        expressing sincere love for your wife
       </em>
       does not imply that Patton didn't kill his wife, which looks very much like a "HURR DURR WHODUNNIT" type.

       Just asking questions is not the same as walking into a place with a rifle and firing off a round, stupid.For you to say that this type of discussion caused that actor to shoot a rifle in that pizza shop is nonsense. We didn't cause that. We aren't responsible for anyone else's actions. We aren't smearing patton. Junior investigators lol. Do you think we're all sitting at home jerking off thinking about how we will be able to bring this information to the DA and proudly state that we figured something out with strangers on the internet? No. We're talking about stuff that interests us with similar minded people. That's it. Nobody is getting boners thinking they'll be able to prove patton wasted his wife. Look at the other comments here. Most people "have it in their heads" that the official story is bogus but don't allege patton killed her. That's not smearing him.

       Yes, I do think you're "all sitting at home jerking off thinking about how we will be able to bring this information to the DA and proudly state that we figured something out with strangers on the internet." That's exactly the tenor of people who still think 9/11 and Pizzagate are going to get blown wide open... ANY DAY NOW.

       Peak plasma concentrations will be reached within one to two hours, but the elimination half-life is

       FWIW, I scarcely even know who Patton Oswalt is (I've heard the name a couple of times, that's about it), so don't have much of an opinion on the rest of your post.

       Benzodiazepenes have a "shelf" on respiratory depression and taken alone, it's near impossible to fatally OD. The risk for fatality is when mixed with other agents that cause respiratory depression (ie opiods, barbituates, or alcohol).

       Thanks for your insight into the 'what may plausibly happen' and fact instead of just more 'what if' and evidence of absence.

       The conspiracy community shouldn't be harmed by the mechanisms of science, since a smart

       Oh, sry. "Your" Rule 4. Yes, very important.  And, to that I say that you are amazing. Spending your time and energy to stop people from filling any insignificant amount of space with something other than their own selfish, unimportant, often pointless and largely petty waste of time. And your hard work paid off.  You got me. I tried to pull a fast one but you caught me...

       BTW, maybe when playing a game should I have to Google a silly made-up term (blogspam) which to you, is  fuckin rule 4.  Having said that, I really hope you'll fuck off.

       You didn't say it explicitly. I just assumed that because you said that
       <em>
        expressing sincere love for your wife

       does not imply that Patton didn't kill his wife, which looks very much like a "HURR DURR WHODUNNIT" type.

       You're mistaking  overall Half-Life with Peak potency.  Peak potency is where you will get into trouble with death. Half life longevity is simply referring to the body processing the drug and the length of time it takes to metabolize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Xanax Peak potency is about 90 minutes. Probably even less.
