        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Disclaimer: This is fake news.  A satire article written by a lunatic off his meds</p>

<hr/>

<hr/>

<p>If you follow George Webbs stuff on youtube, you will find something very refreshing and welcome in the &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; world.  Someone who makes a proof, using mainstream media journalism from accepted, international sources, simply linking things together and explaining this very complex situtation.  </p>

<p>In a short phrase, he describes the Clinton Foundation&#39;s illegal empire-building activities of toppling countries with private armies, installing administrators to take over the deposed leader and then expropriate the resources there.  She&#39;s successful because she&#39;s made relationships with the most corrupted people in our administration, in offices of incredible power.  People like Gen. Petraeus, James Comey, McCabe, even Obama.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In other words, Clinton is the most successful capitalist the world has ever seen.  But this is why we didn&#39;t hire her.  It&#39;s not ethical to gas people and take their shit and that&#39;s what Captialism has become.  We don&#39;t want america to be defined by her warped psychological projection</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;We must fight the terrorists&quot; ==&gt; vs ==&gt; We create terror around the world, gassing people and taking their shit and leaving them in ruin is terrorism, not war.  It&#39;s wickedness.</li>
<li>&quot;We must stop conspiracy theories&quot; ==&gt; Fake news is a conspiracy theory, Wikileaks getting info from Russia is a conspiracy theory, Russia emminent attack on US is a conspiracy theory, Trump having ties to Putin is a conspiracy theory</li>
<li>&quot;Alt Right&quot; ==&gt; No, <strong><em>you</em></strong> are the alt-right.  You&#39;re not even a blue dog democrat, you&#39;re so hawkish you are a crypto-superneocon!!  (that&#39;s what a neoliberal is, a fascist globalist terrorist) </li>
<li>&quot;Trump is a Nazi/Bigot&quot; ==&gt;  No, Ms. Clinton, you and your husband knowingly let a crony sell HIV and HEPC tainted blood and it killed 800 hemo kids and coinfected 60k others, foreshortening their lives.  &quot;Superpredator&quot; --&gt; you are a bigot. </li>
<li>&quot;Shame on YOU Obama&quot; ==&gt; No, you should be ashamed, you flipped on gay marriage, you called Trump a Nazi while you literally gassed people, you sold out america on capitulating to 9/11&#39;s fake news, you created fake news. Shame on YOU Hillary Clinton
<em>you</em> Hillary Clinton</li>
<li>&quot;Superpredators&quot; ==&gt; You are predatory on ENTIRE COUNTRIES.  <strong><em>You</em></strong> are a superpredator!</li>
<li> &quot;Trump&#39;s issues with women&quot; =&gt; Google Bill Clinton Rape</li>
</ul>

<p>Enough of my <em>completely-fair-but-will-be-contrued-as-Trumplove</em> comparison.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Back to George&#39;s work.  The interesting thing is that George&#39; work isn&#39;t conjecture, it&#39;s akin to a mathematical proof.  It&#39;s not just from repetition but from his sources.  His conclusions are sound.  His thesis is--in my opinion--the most accurate reality-model to date.  Here is one of his videos.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO4zw_dJScM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO4zw_dJScM</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Sorry I made you sit though the backstory, now the meat of this post</p>

<ul>
<li>After Obama&#39;s Porton Down testing of the contaminated soil in Allepo came back as Libyas, </li>
<li>This is exposed by Seymour Hersh in Red line versus the Ratline</li>
<li>Russia came back with a team and did testing of their own.  They were attacked, and found the Sarin was NOT Assads.  (awkward!)</li>
<li>An investigative journalist in Syria exposed the white hats as human traffickers from areas that were gassed.<br/></li>
<li>Gassing areas where the pipeline from Saudi to Turkey is going to be</li>
<li>So Russia is taking Sarin evidence to the world court, to basically sue the US for nuremberg war crimes</li>
<li>This is why the US&#39;s media is in full force to demonize Russia.<br/></li>
<li>As a total distraction about this information, but also to &#39;prep&#39; the US into accepting Russia as again, the bad guy and give consent for war if it comes to that.</li>
</ul>

<p>What Trump should do, according to George is come clean: </p>

<ul>
<li>Yes that gas was from Libya, and the people who did it are Clinton Foundation&#39;s private army</li>
<li>We&#39;re going to round them up and offer them as sacrifice</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Or Trump is a giant pussy and folds to the shadow government and becomes a puppet of Obama&#39;s, who would now be running a shadow government (<strong>&quot;7th floor group&quot;</strong>) from a shadow whitehouse using a confederacy of various people like Mccain, Petraeus, Comey, etc.  The usual suspects.</p>

<p>And of course, they will have their war with Russia, all over again and we go into a scorched earth mode</p>

<p>Neither side goes nuclear though.  They just basically run a drone war on each other, while muslim refugees flood in.  They will of course use these people as scapegoats for the domestic terrorism (9/11 times a thousand) on first world countries to continue the NWO, only it&#39;s possible that Russia and US are only fighting a pretend propaganda war a this point to keep everyone distracted and each country is running their own drones against their own people, but painting the others&#39; flag on it.</p>

<p>We live in interesting / hopeful / terrible times :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey what are your thoughts on trump after being through Webb&#39;s connections to Dyncorp and feinberg?  Setting up the plan that saves all of this from being exposed fully?  </p>

<p>The way Webb lays things out makes it sound so ridiculous that the public thinks the FBI or anyone is actually doing their job.  They blatantly disregard protocol and set up criminal enterprises.  </p>
