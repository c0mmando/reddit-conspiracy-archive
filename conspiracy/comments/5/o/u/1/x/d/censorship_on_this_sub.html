I don&#39;t see why people who enjoy bipartisan conspiracies/making their own decisions can&#39;t view any conspiracies about Donald trump because anything posted is deleted or censored, which is ironic since this is considered the subreddit to go for free, uncensored speech. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing whether or not politics brigaded, but that&#39;s hypocritical, since The_Donald has bombarded this place with anti Hillary conspiracies (which is totally cool with me). What I am arguing is that people should be able to view all conspiracies and make their own judgements.  </p>

<p>Tldr Mods, stop showing an incredible amount of bias and let me read Trump conspiracies plz thx</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR: Trump is just as shady, but there ARE people in this sub currently brigading the FUCK out of this place to push last minute <em>Oh shit we lost to this guy</em> smear. </p>

<p>You want to discuss Trumps cabinet picks? Cool. You want to speculate on how he might concentration camp the gays? Awesome etc. etc.... </p>

<p>But the TWO posts that have clearly been manipulated to the top have been removed per the rules. Posts like this pop up to discredit a large majority of this sub by saying that its alt right sympathetic or just flat out biased. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to figure out whats happening here.</p>

<p>So thanks for these :) Lets me know someone on here is close to a truth or two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion the smear campaign is directly against this sub. There is a constant effort to post threads of this nature, complaining that the sub is too &quot;Donald&quot;. I wouldn&#39;t really care if it was once a day or so, where actual discussion took place and a fair exchange if ideas occured, but that&#39;s not what is happening. The constant stream of anti-sub posts indicate that a segment of reddit is determined to subvert this sub.  </p>

<p>There is a couple of things to consider when looking at the threads in this sub;  </p>

<p>1) The popular vote was T-46% C-48% which is roughly an even split. Logically 46% of the political threads in this sub will be pro-T. If more are successfully up voted, then it is an indication that the current view of the sub looks more favorably upon C-conspiracies than T-conspiracies. Likely the reason is because of item 2. </p>

<p>2) In the past year there has been significantly more dirt exposed on C than T. The DNC and Podesta emails reveals quite a lot of collusion, backed by evidence which has effectively been confirmed as legit evidence by the FBI. Furthermore, the Podesta emails spawned pizzagate which is still a conspiracy many feel is still burning hot.  Additionally there is the potential of even more leaks to be revealed if the Wikileaks twitter feed is to be believed.  </p>

<p>3) The conspiracies surrounding T are currently flimsey at best. There is no where near the evidence supporting any of them like there is for the C conspiracies. The primary supporters of T conspiracies are the MSM, Democrats, and their supporters. The credibility of these bodies was shatterd by last years WL dumps. Their co plete lack of credibility and obvious partisan support for T related conspiracies simply lend support to the C related conspiracies.  </p>

<p>3) There have been flagrant shilling attempts (by both sides) on this sub in the past year. Once /new and /politics became a DNC echo chamber reddiors were left with few options where they felt even dicsussion and reliable reporting could occur. This sub is one of those places, and remains so today. Unfortunately that venue for fair discussion has been identified by those who wish Reddit to carry a specific narrative, and as such have launched many campaigns to destroy this subs credibility. In many ways the attacks have been successful, but in many others it hasn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With your logic 50% of all dirt should be on trump as well, since &#39;dirt&#39; was uncovered on him very recently. Realistically, this sub is right wing leaning with no intention of looking at each conspiracy without a bias for their candidate.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m just confused, when you say flimsy, do you mean like a pizza restaurant being a center for a pedophilia ring for thousands of politicians. Give me a break, I&#39;m not even denying pizza gate but if that&#39;s a conspiracy theory that gets a lot of traction don&#39;t even pretend that Trump, a man you said 50% of people disagree with, is not an interesting and quick growing topic within the Reddit community. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean flimsy as in only the very sketchiest vague evidence has been provided and none of it is verifiable other than some intelligence guys saying <em>&quot;Trust me, we&#39;re totally sure this is legit...&quot;</em>. This is unlike the evidence of the Clintons ongoing corruption where we have evidence dating back to the 1980&#39;s of  their questionable behavior and also documented verifiable evidence of her breaking the law and mishandling sensitive information, as well as documented verifiable evidence of the DNC rigging a primary and colluding with more than 40 or 50 members of the media in a concerted effort to defeat Sanders and attempt to defeat Trump. The evidence can be independently verified also. <strong>These things</strong> present a conspiracy that this sub finds of value because while there is intriguing aspects to the Trump conspiracy, with Clinton we see a trend of greed, deception, and law breaking and yet no prosecution ever seems to follow.  </p>

<p>So while I agree that 50% may find Trump distasteful or repugnant, my opinion is that part of that 50% still see more import on pursuing a verifiable criminal who seems to be involved in a <em>conspiracy</em> to evade prosecution or accountability. If you add the 50% of Trump supporters to the x% of anti-Trump/anti-Clinton supporters you will likely find the reason for what you and others see as a disproportionate representation of political favoritism.  </p>

But you know what, they Rolex the dice and they lost. They wanted Hillary vs trump thinking they could force her whore ass on us. They lost. As much as I hate trump, he beat a faction of the political elite. In the big scheme of things Donald J Trump was able to buy the presidency from the outside the political system. I didn&#39;t vote for him, I don&#39;t trust that mother fucker, but he won. I will continue to question trump, I will continue to voice my opinion. This is not r/politics.

<p>A) I hate this theory. I really do. But if there is validity to it, so be it. That&#39;s what were here for.</p>

<p>B) The PG8 posts <em>don&#39;t reach the top of the page in 50 minutes.</em> Generally posts here throughout the day reach a third of the upvotes over 12 hours. Be it <em>sigh</em> flat earth, lizard Illuminati, UFOs, etc....  Its not hard to spot the artificial stories. If you&#39;ve been on for ANY amount of time on here you can see it.</p>

<p>C) PG8 is government agencies as a whole. Its not if Trump has a piss fetish. PG8 focuses on a network as a whole (It just doesn&#39;t help that the clintons are wrapped up in the allegations)</p>

<p>Yet your connection is literally NOTHING smoke and mirrors, with 0 even circumstantial evidence that could point towards this other than &quot;DEMS SAID IT WAS RUSSIAN&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it was never the dems that said it, it was a former MI6 agent. And it was clearly credible enough for them to feel the need to brief Obama and Trump on it.</p>

<p>And by your logic if Ican find that Trump had a friend who was into piss parties than suddenly the claim is valid? I mean this evidence isn&#39;t even good enough to be called circumstantial, it&#39;s completely invented. You created a connection where there was one, you decided he was guilty of something and looked for evidence that confirmed it. That&#39;s why all the evidence surrounding pizzagate is pretty circumstantial/coincidental, you were looking for things that agreed with your theory. Which is why it will never be investigated, police start with a crime and look for evidence that leads to a criminal, where you started with a criminal and looked for evidence of a crime.</p>

<p>I hope it goes without saying when I say you I don&#39;t mean you speciically but the royal you.</p>

<p>Pizzagate has sufficient evidence but Donald Trump having piss parties doesn&#39;t?</p>

<p>Lol. Lets level the field and assume BOTH of the theories are a 4chan troll and incredibly fake:</p>

<p>PG8 implies a child pedophilia network.</p>

<p>Pissgate implies that Russia has dirt on Trump....because he likes being pissed on...by prostitutes.... </p>

<p>One of these things is not like the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah one is way more plausible than the other. Whats more likely a guy has a weird fetish or that a pizza parlor is running a massive child sex trafficking ring. I mean seriously, I don&#39;t particularly believe either one, but on premise alone Donald Trump&#39;s piss parties are more likely than a pizzeria child sex ring. And the evidence behind both is certainly equally credible.</p>

If you look at my comment history around the primaries I openly criticized Hillary for rigging the election, but she is now irrelevant, and trump is the main concern right now in my book. How many times will you dismiss my opinions and others with the term &#39;shill&#39; instead of digging a bit deeper and seeing that both candidates are not good people, why do you protect the merits of one person but bash Hillary to a pulp when both are shady and corrupt figures?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say: &quot;fuck off&quot; to all brigades. When there is evidence for it, it should be removed in the current context of the website and rules. Am I for it, ultimately? No, I&#39;m for free uncensored speech, but it&#39;s not in context to what we have. People trying to shit on the mods here, have an agenda, IMO. I will continue to stick up for them (mods), even if they ban me for good (that&#39;s on me). They are some of the most fair and genuine on Reddit, imo. Being a mod means walking a fine line, and you&#39;re damned if you do, damned if you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>The post on the frontpage was brigaded, and I knew it the second I saw it on the frontpage here, with no vote count, until entering the thread. Also, add that we had ~3k+ people here = brigade. We usually only have ~900-1k on average, and even that is high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No but pushing false narratives as hard as those 2 posts shows the fucking disgusting tactics just to try and control the content. Most of us have been on Reddit a loonnggg time and we&#39;ve seen all the tactics thrown around to try and control the agenda. prefect example being: r/politics. All the way up until 6 months ago r/politics was pretty reasonable for years. Now it&#39;s a straight propaganda show. Discussions used to be a thing in threads and now it&#39;s a shilled out shit show with really shitty trump jabs. They cannot overtake r/conspiracy like they did r/propaganda but they need mod spots and they can&#39;t get in from the inside. Their tactics aren&#39;t working here no matter how much money they are throwing. At this point they need Reddit admin to do their dirty work.</p>
