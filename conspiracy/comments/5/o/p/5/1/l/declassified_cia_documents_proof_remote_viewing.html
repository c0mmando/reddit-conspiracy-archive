<p>The CIA came to him back in the day and finance him to train people into remote viewing. He did this for the CIA for 10 years. And if you take the time to listen to what Targ says on the subject, he sure doesn&#39;t believe this is &quot;pseudoscience&quot;.</p>

<p>And if you think the CIA didn&#39;t kept working on this on their side with what they&#39;ve learned from Targ, that&#39;s being naive.</p>

The CIA launched the studies knowing they wouldn&#39;t actually find anything credible and that knowledge of the studies would leak to the Russians.  They simply needed some way to justify the intel coming from their U2 spy plane technology that was, at the time, heavily classified and way more advanced than what the Russians had.  </p>

<p>He has been known to change the peramiters of the agreed upon challenges as well as given himself the ability to read the data any way he sees fit. You also aren&#39;t allowed legal recourse if you don&#39;t agree with his findings.</p>

<p>So this great prize that is some how always used to discredit magic by skeptics is created by a man with preconceived bias &quot;regarding the challenge, I always have an out. Because I&#39;m right!&quot;. Who has given himself the ability to lie and taken away any legal consequences for him to do so.</p>

<p>Here is a man who has used remote viewing to find out what was in Randi&#39;s mystery box set aside for exactly that purpose. But Randi didn&#39;t feel like successfully doing the challenge he himself created was good enough for the prize money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really some fascinating work.  While it&#39;s a broad study, I&#39;ll only focus on the relevant topic of remote viewing:  </p>

<p>First, there is a historical precedent of the CIA working with universities in their studies.  We learned about this with MKULTRA.  Given that precedent, it&#39;s a possibility that this Princeton study was influenced by the CIA who would already have an agenda to validate the study.  </p>

<p>Second, I would say that the study was likely flawed due to an unaccounted variable of a third party.  We know there are at least two participants: the remote subject and the &quot;percipient&quot;. And it&#39;s stated that the percipient didn&#39;t know the location of the remote subject.  But what we don&#39;t know:  Did the percipient know the remote subject at all?  Were they friends?  Because that&#39;s a factor.  Another is the factor of the examiner.  Did the examiner know the location of the remote subject?  If so, the examiner could have unconsciously transmitted information to the percipient.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you and I are doing this experiment and we have a 3rd person who is our remote subject.  You are the percipient and I am the examiner.  Here are some scenarios that could flaw the results:   </p>

<ol>
<li><p>You are friends with the remote subject and you have an idea of what places they might choose to visit or for any given place, what visual things they might focus on.  Imagine the remote subject is in Central Park, NYC.  That person, depending on their personality, might say &quot;I&#39;m in a city&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m in a park&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m near children&quot; etc...  There are so many ways to describe a scene and knowing a persons personality influences the answer.  I am, for example, a nature buff, so if you knew me, you&#39;d know I would focus on my natural surroundings more than, say, a kid riding a bicycle.  </p></li>
<li><p>You don&#39;t know the remote subject at all.  But I do, since I am the examiner.  I also know where the subject is and have an idea of what he&#39;s seeing.  When you talk about what you see as a percipient, I am unconsciously giving you cues when you&#39;re right or wrong.  I can&#39;t help these microexpressions.  When you say something right, my pupils dilate.  When you say something wrong, I look down at my paper.  In fact, I&#39;m giving all kinds of tells that you might pick-up on if you were a poker player.  I have tainted the experiment.    </p></li>
</ol>

<p>When you examine the Princeton study, you see that the results show a minuscule variance from the random control set, but enough of a variance to be quantifiable.  That is, the statistically anomaly is too small to be evident in practical use, but does show up when calculated.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, either of the two scenarios I&#39;ve outlined above could account for such an anomaly.  </p>

<p>The additional conclusion made by the team that the anomaly declines as distance increases I think supports my theory because as distance increases, so does unfamiliarity with surroundings.  That is, I know you, I know what places you might visit in a 100 mile radius, but not in a 1000 mile radius.  Which shouldn&#39;t matter because we are talking about distant telepathic communication.  Either distance doesn&#39;t matter or the communication operates on the electromagnetic spectrum and suffers from the same problems as radio interference.  But if that was the case, the amount of EM radiation require to transmit at those distances would already be well known and detected.  We know humans are not radio transmitters so it leaves only one other possible explanation:  Flawed study.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s speculation that impugns the academic integrity of those researchers involved in this project. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Now you&#39;re showing ignorance of the protocols set up by SRI. Originally, they used <em>map coordinates</em>. And after that, coordinates unrelated to maps that could not be recognized by the &quot;experiencer&quot;. </p>

<p>Which means, they got a positive correlation past random chance. Which is an amazing result! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be clear what you mean by &#39;another dimension&#39;. Because physicists use the term to denote additional axis of motion. Even when the dimension is compacted, as in string theory. If you want to talk about a multiverse - parallel universes or (alternate realities) - David Deutsch is your man (following up on older work by High Everett). </p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget David Bohm and pilot wave theory. </p>

<p>Nobody knows yet. Nor have there been experiments proposed and run to actually test for a verifiable answer. It&#39;s still throw up your hands and guess. </p>

<p>But getting back to RV and PSI experiments, there have been so many experimental runs with a positive result the outcome just can&#39;t be just hand waved away. The problem is, there&#39;s absolutely no physics to explain a mechanism for why. </p>

<p>This is the link to the PDF. It looks like a kind of bullet point briefing going over the project. Inside there is a part that says &quot;Early Findings&quot; which is what I was talking about.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen some things like the inside of an atom and a deep underground base when I was under ketamine, but I have no way of knowing if it was real or imaginary.</p>

<p>Yes!  That&#39;s what I saw!  It&#39;s not an exact match!</p>

<p>How much of a match</p>

<p>Maybe 90%?</p>

<p>Not necessarily proof it&#39;s real, or effective if it was real</p>

<p>Ahh define real?  </p>

<p>Just because you can see something dose that make it real?  </p>

<p>What about something you can touch, just because you can touch something does that make it real?  </p>

<p>Does it make it real that someone, somewhere with a white lab coat stands up and points to something and speaks in gibberish saying it&#39;s real make it real?</p>

<p>It all those circumstances above most would says at least one of the 3 would make it real for them, but yet all 3 can be easily faked.  </p>

<p>So either everything is real; just in various states of developing or just have yet enough <em>evidence</em> to say... see real.  Or is everything is unreal?  </p>

<p>In either case, what the above cites still exist in either case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stargate was closed by congressional order in &#39;95 after Ted Koppel devoted a Nightline program to revelations of its existence. But if Thomas Drake - NSA executive and whistleblower once charged with espionage - is to be believed, psychic information continued to be used at NSA. Furthermore, he stated he valued intelligence gathered by psychic means. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.starpod.us/2014/09/11/former-nsa-official-tom-drake-confirms-psychic-warned-cia-of-911-attack/">http://www.starpod.us/2014/09/11/former-nsa-official-tom-drake-confirms-psychic-warned-cia-of-911-attack/</a></p>

<p>Follow that link and you&#39;ll find audio for an interview of Drake conducted by George Knapp on Coast2CoastAM where he discussed being in contact with psychic Chris Robinson on official business. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knowing some of the people involved, I&#39;m highly skeptical.   In another article on Starpod.us, Col. John Alexander is quoted as saying he doesn&#39;t believe the NSA claim because the remote viewing talent pool is small and everyone knows each other.  </p>

<p>Col. Alexander and the informal networks he&#39;s apart of have looked at a lot of these claims, and there&#39;s almost zero evidence of anything.  Only some people with impressive background voicing their interpretation of public knowledge and others&#39; claims; and not directly witnessing anything substantial.  </p>

<p>And if Chris Robinson&#39;s work with the NSA was valid, why would he be selling psychic services on a Hungarian porn kingpin&#39;s streaming site?  (oranum.com)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. Col Alexander, along with Gen Albert Stubblebine, are the guys who hoped to kill a goat by staring at it (See: <em>The Men Who Stare at Goats</em>). And walk through walls. His focus has been on developing nonlethal weapons programs and mind control and psyops. And he&#39;s pretty weird. And scary. But he&#39;s entitled to present his opinion and Gary Bekkum to solicit and publish it. </p>

<p>I will say that Thomas Drake was a highly placed NSA executive. He was charged under the Espionage Act, though those charges were dropped for a lessor charge of (I think?) misusing government computers (something like that). And he&#39;s definitely on the out. Whereas Alexander is still on the in. So I&#39;d argue Drake has more latitude to speak his mind... as long as he doesn&#39;t reveal anything he knows is classified information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of them are just government/military employees who are conspiracy theorists wrapped up in their own soap opera.  I don&#39;t think Drake is one but it&#39;s easy to be persuaded by others in that world.  And he wasn&#39;t too clear on when or why he saw Chris Robinson speak, only that Robinson didn&#39;t know who he was.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 99% certain that nothing paranormal the CIA ever investigated revealed anything significant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so during the cold war thr american army infiltrated a new unit to spy on the russians/Chinese using some kind of psychic abilities. In conclusion they found out the results were more than mere chance and a lot of times it was sucesful but not enough for it to be fully operational so it got disbaned. Or atleast thats what they want us to think...   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stargate was closed by congressional order in &#39;95 after Ted Koppel devoted a Nightline program to revelations of its existence. But if Thomas Drake - NSA executive and whistleblower once charged with espionage - is to be believed, psychic information continued to be used at NSA. Furthermore, he stated he valued intelligence gathered by psychic means. </p>

<p>Follow that link and you&#39;ll find audio for an interview of Drake conducted by George Knapp on Coast2CoastAM where he discussed being in contact with psychic Chris Robinson on official business. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Knowing some of the people involved, I&#39;m highly skeptical.   In another article on Starpod.us, Col. John Alexander is quoted as saying he doesn&#39;t believe the NSA claim because the remote viewing talent pool is small and everyone knows each other.  </p>

<p>Col. Alexander and the informal networks he&#39;s apart of have looked at a lot of these claims, and there&#39;s almost zero evidence of anything.  Only some people with impressive background voicing their interpretation of public knowledge and others&#39; claims; and not directly witnessing anything substantial.  </p>

<p>And if Chris Robinson&#39;s work with the NSA was valid, why would he be selling psychic services on a Hungarian porn kingpin&#39;s streaming site?  (oranum.com)</p>
