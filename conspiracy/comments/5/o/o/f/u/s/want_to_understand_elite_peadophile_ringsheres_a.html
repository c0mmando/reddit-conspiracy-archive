<p>Scopolamine? Isn&#39;t that the drug from Colombia? I read an article a while back in the daily fail aka daily
mail - people under its influence emptying bank accounts, getting raped, donating organs etc </p>

<p>I always wondered with that- surely the individuals in questions must have some recollection of events - or else how would they know it was the cause?
Actually I guess the evidence would be whatever uncharacteristic activities you were engaged in.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Vice story is propaganda. I don&#39;t doubt they have a drug that does that and I don&#39;t doubt that its used by spooks but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s an analogue. Scopolamine is actually very similar to another famous drug in the region and it would make sense if they found it trying to synthesize something else. Spooks would&#39;ve discovered it during MK period. </p>

<p>Remember only 20k docs were found but the program was massive and prob had hundreds of thousands of pages of associated paperwork. It involved the head of the psychiatric association, hospitals, students, universities, etc. </p>

Its far wiser to have your thralls both fear your wrath, but also depend on you for sustenance. What&#39;s $1M to these guys?! They control the Fed aka the dollar printing machine. A few taps of a keyboard &amp; <em>voila</em> Aforesaid thrall then proceeds to upgrade their lifestyle further with the ill gotten gains (as you&#39;d do), in time they come to depend on that additional cash to <em>sustain</em> their life, and those of their family.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;ve got them coming and going - airtight.  </p>

Sure, it might obviously make things a lot easier, but in essence anybody could be victimized.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that is the case at all. No matter  what  Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) did that day he was going to be killed. Harris (Denzel Washington) was desperate to try and pay off the Russian Mob, he spent the day setting Hoyt up. There is no way a tight team like the one Harris has assembled would put their faith in a new cop in one single day, even if he had taken a wad of cash. There is a huge difference between taking cash and killing a drug dealer in cold blood. If you think by taking the cash Hoyt would have saved himself you need to go back and watch the movie again. From the moment Hoyt got in the car with Harris the clock was ticking. It was pure chance that saved him. </p>

<p>Imagine the conversation back at the police station:</p>

<p>Arresting Officer: &quot;At the time of your arrest you were found with 5 ounces of crack cocaine, partitioned into vials, ready for distribution- care to explain?</p>

<p>Suspect: &quot;I&#39;d be happy to Officer- but first I&#39;d like to clarify- I was <strong>actually</strong> in position of 9 Oz also known as a 9bar. You see I&#39;d just got the reup from my man Carlos other in Washington Heights, same as I do every week....&quot;</p>
