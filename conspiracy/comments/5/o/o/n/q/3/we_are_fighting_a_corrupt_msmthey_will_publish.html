    <div class="md"><p>From Gary Webb&#39;s wiki in November 2014:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Webb alleged that the 1997 backlash was a form of media manipulation. &quot;The government side of the story is coming through the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post&quot;, he stated. &quot;They use the giant corporate press rather than saying anything directly. If you work through friendly reporters on major newspapers, it comes off as The New York Times saying it and not a mouthpiece of the CIA.&quot;[19] In 2004, Webb wrote a long piece, &quot;The Mighty Wurlitzer Plays On&quot;, describing the role the Internet played in bringing the &quot;Dark Alliance&quot; story to international attention in 1996, and describing at length the backlash against the story, at first externally through the larger newspapers, later internally by the paper&#39;s editors:</p>

<p>I found myself involved in hours-long conversations with editors that bordered on the surreal.</p>

<p>&quot;How do we know for sure that these drug dealers were the first big ring to start selling crack in South Central?&quot; editor Jonathan Krim pressed me during one such confab. &quot;Isn&#39;t it possible there might have been others before them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There might have been a lot of things, Jon, but we&#39;re only supposed to deal in what we know,&quot; I replied. &quot;The crack dealers I interviewed said they were the first. Cops in South Central said they were the first. and that they controlled the entire market. They wrote it in reports that we have. I haven&#39;t found anything saying otherwise, not one single name, and neither did the New York Times, the Washington Post or the L.A. Times. So what&#39;s the issue here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But how can we say for sure they were the first?&quot; Krim persisted. &quot;Isn&#39;t it possible there might have been someone else and they never got caught and no one ever knew about them? In that case, your story would be wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>I had to take a deep breath to keep from shouting. &quot;If you&#39;re asking me whether I accounted for people who might never have existed, the answer is no,&quot; I said. &quot;I only considered people with names and faces. I didn&#39;t take phantom drug dealers into account.&quot;[20]</p>

<p>James Aucoin, a communications professor who specializes in the history of investigative reporting, wrote: &quot;In the case of Gary Webb&#39;s charges against the CIA and the Contras, the major dailies came after him. Media institutions are now part of the establishment and they have a lot invested in that establishment.&quot;[19]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A quote from last year:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We know the corporate news LIES to us.</p>

<p>We know they manipulate us.</p>

<p>We know they are CIA-DoD bootlickers and have LIED us into wars–costing the U.S. trillions of dollars (in addition to the loss of 1 million+ dead Iraqis, the 5,000+ U.S. soldiers who died, the destruction of countries/regions, the refugees which the wars create).</p>

<p>We know that even when the Corporate News tells us the truth–it often is not presented in a timely manner and most likely contains glaring omissions. Think about the 18 months the NYT held back the James Risen Patriot Act article which revealed the FISA court abuses (and helped GW Bush win a 2nd term).</p>

<p>Obviously there are others to choose from as well–Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, LA Times, cbs, nbc, abc, fox–but NYT and cnn both laid off workers in January 2015 and are low-hanging fruit.</p>

<p>We need to kneecap these LIARS and lower their traffic volume, which ultimately will lower their advertising revenue. Until we do — it will be business as usual — the LIES will keep coming, the disinfo will continue to manipulate our society.</p>

<p>The media conglomerates are planning on making $4.4 billion from the federal elections this year–maybe we can surprise 2 of them…</p>

<p>Please consider boycotting the New York Times and cnn…do NOT buy the NYT, do not watch cnn, do not visit the NYT or cnn websites, do not link to their articles…(find alternative sources for the articles…or post with the Wayback Machine…or just copy/paste the entire article).</p>

<p>Voting new leaders into office is only part of the equation–the media cabal must be hit hard, too.</p>

<p>I am, frankly, frustrated to tears. Dear friends, people who I know to have their hearts in the right place but not enough time on their hands to consider alternatives to the legacy media narrative they&#39;re being spoon-fed, are lining up rank and file - repeating ad nauseam the current Democratic Party line.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a for instance for you woke folk. Friend of mine posted the following. How do I gently poke him into consciousness? </p>

<p>This incoming regime built on lies has been working to discredit the news media for months, and more recently has been intentionally trying to blur how we define what actually is &quot;fake news&quot; in an attempt to confuse and mislead. In this environment, who can we depend on to give us the truth? Is there anybody? What are we supposed to do and who are we supposed to believe? I don&#39;t know the answer and it&#39;s sad we have to ask. But maybe we start with the orgs that do this and ONLY this--that don&#39;t have an entertainment wing. Let&#39;s get a list going. I&#39;ll start, please add to it!!</p>

<p>If I hadn&#39;t known this person for more than a couple decades, I would swear he was working for CTR. But I know he&#39;s not - he&#39;s just a very scared Democrat (former Berner) who wants peace and harmony, but can&#39;t see the woods for the trees.</p>

<p>He&#39;s willing to consider alternatives. I had posted a Chris Hedges piece awhile ago that he commented favorably on - it was his first exposure to Hedges. But for every ten articles I put in front of his eyes, he might read half of one - and only if it has some derogatory click-baity anti-Trump tone.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t just him. It is both sad and a bit scary watching the Democrats I know personally grabbing onto any bit of media that reinforces their world view, rather than engaging in the necessary introspection that would lead them to a clearer view. (For the record, I&#39;m not pushing a Trump agenda either. I find him almost as disgusting as the former alternative.)</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m asking for a little help here. I&#39;m not going to spam these people with the links you&#39;ve provided (though I fully appreciate the collusion they depict) - again, they don&#39;t have the time to sift through. They&#39;re working people with mortgages, kids and student loans. I need a very short and to-the-point wake up call to share to, as I said, gently nudge these friends toward realizing they are being propagandized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some background as to how and why the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; was popularized:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/conspiracy_to_tell_the_truth_interview_with_lance_dehavensmith/">CIA Popularized &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; Term to Silence Dissent</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abby Martin talks to Lance deHaven-Smith, Florida State University 
professor and author of &#39;Conspiracy Theory in America&#39;, about some of 
the US&#39; most controversial events and how labeling truth-seekers as 
&#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; damages democracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The use of “conspiracy theory” to deter citizens from 
investigating historic events is paradoxical, to be sure. It suggests 
that those who commit criminal conspiracies can only be relatively 
powerless people who happen to live on the most strategically important 
lands, and conspiracies among rich, powerful people are impossible or 
absurd.</p>

<p>Basically, our entire legal system is based on the idea of 
conspiracy. Despite this fact we have been conditioned by the government
 and the media to blindly accept the official reports and to treat any 
questioning of those reports as “conspiracy theorizing.”  That is, you 
are a conspiracy theorist if you don’t believe the government’s 
conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>This cultural phenomenon goes back to 1967. At that time, in 
response to questions about the Warren Commission Report (which 
President Ford helped create), the CIA issued a memorandum calling for 
mainstream media sources to begin countering “conspiracy theorists.”
 In the 45 years before the CIA memo came out, the phrase “conspiracy 
theory” appeared in the Washington Post and New York Times only 50 
times, or about once per year. In the 45 years after the CIA memo, the 
phrase appeared 2,630 times, or about once per week.</p>

<p>Before the CIA memo came out, the Washington Post and New York
 Times had never used the phrase “conspiracy theorist.” After the CIA 
memo came out, these two newspapers have used that phrase 1,118 times. 
Of course, in these uses the phrase is always delivered in a context in 
which “conspiracy theorists” were made to seem less intelligent and less
 rationale than people who uncritically accept official explanations for
 major events.</p>

<p>President George W. Bush and his colleagues often used the 
phrase conspiracy theory in attempts to deter questioning about their 
activities. When questioned by reporters about an emerging scandal in 
September 2000, Bush said the idea that his presidential campaign was 
flashing subliminal messages in advertisements was absurd, and he added 
that “conspiracy theories abound in America’s politics.” When in 
1994, Bush’s former company Harken Energy was linked to the fraudulent 
Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) through several 
investors, Bush’s spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, shut down the inquiry by 
telling the Associated Press — “We have no response to silly conspiracy 
theories.”</p>

<p>Because Bush’s campaign had, in fact, been flashing subliminal
 messages in its advertisements, and Harken Energy was actually linked 
to BCCI, people began to wonder what Bush and his colleagues meant when 
they made diversionary comments about conspiracy theories.  More 
importantly, that track record raised questions about Bush’s statement 
after the 9/11 attacks, in which he said in a televised speech — “Let us
 never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of
 September the 11th.”</p>

<p>There is no question that criminal government-sponsored 
conspiracies exist. History is replete with them and they usually 
involve the government claiming that the country was under attack from 
“terrorists.” This was true of Hitler’s Reichstag fire and it was true 
of the attacks that occurred in 20th century Western Europe under the 
guise of Operation Gladio. An example more relevant to 9/11 was the 
conspiracy behind Operation Northwoods, a plan drafted and approved in 
1962 by the highest levels within the U.S. military.</p>

<p>Author James Bamford wrote of Operation Northwoods that it 
called “for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, 
D.C., Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did
 not commit; planes would be hijacked. [This would provide] the public 
and international backing they needed to launch their war.” The 
signed documents are available to everyone today and because of this we 
know that high level U.S. government representatives do conspire, on 
occasion, to commit crimes against the American people for 
the purpose of starting wars.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Crimes_Against_Democracy#Relation_to_Conspiracy_Theory">State Crimes Against Democracy: Relation To Conspiracy 
Theory</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The origins and rhetorical function of the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; 
constitute an important subject matter for SCAD theory and research. At 
least since the 1970s, the conspiracy-theory label has been applied 
pejoratively to a wide range of suspicions and allegations of official 
wrongdoing that have not been substantiated by public officials 
themselves. The label suppresses mass suspicions that inevitably arise 
when shocking political crimes benefit top leaders or play into their 
agendas, especially when those same officials are in control of agencies
 responsible for preventing the events in question or for investigating 
them after they have occurred.</p>

<p>Communication scientists Ginna Husting and Martin Orr, both 
professors at Boise State University, have studied the use of the 
conspiracy-theory label as a putdown and have explained how the label 
works to silence suspicion. The conspiracy-theory label challenges 
the very rationality of persons who voice suspicions and thus shifts the
 subject of discussion from the suspicions to the speakers’ competency 
or lack thereof.</p>

<p>DeHaven-Smith has shown that the conspiracy-theory label was 
popularized as a pejorative term by the Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA) in a propaganda program initiated in 1967. The program was 
directed at criticisms of the Warren Commission’s conclusion that 
President Kennedy had been assassinated by a lone gunman. The propaganda
 campaign called on media corporations and journalists to criticize 
“conspiracy theorists” and raise questions about their motives and 
judgments. The CIA told its contacts that “parts of the conspiracy talk 
appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.”</p>

<p>SCAD scholars hypothesize that the CIA’s role in inserting the 
conspiracy-theory label into the American lexicon of political speech is
 only one of many instances when U.S. intelligence operatives have 
manipulated domestic opinion by structuring the terms of discourse. For 
example, deHaven-Smith has argued that the nomenclature surrounding the 
Global War on Terror—terms like “axis of evil,” “ground zero,” and 
“homeland security” that are associated with World War II - and the meme
 “9/11” used to denote the terror attacks in the United States on 
September 11, 2001 - emerged too quickly and were too sophisticated to 
have been developed without the expertise of public relations 
specialists.</p>

<p>By their very nature, SCADs are events that present a profound 
challenge to citizens’ most closely guarded beliefs about government and
 democracy. Laurie Manwell has written extensively on the many 
attitudes, biases, and faulty beliefs which can prevent people from 
processing information that challenges these pre-existing assumptions 
about government, reasoned dissent, and public discourse in a democratic
 society. In contrast to other academics’ suggestions on how to deal 
with conspiracy-related speech (e.g., Sunstein and Vermeule’s 2009 
suggestions for taxing, fining, or banning conspiracy-related speech or 
for government-orchestrated cognitive infiltration of private and public
 beliefs) Manwell’s recommendations all involved more open 
discourse, greater public education and media literacy, and increased 
political knowledge, participation and tolerance. She argues that, 
for a functioning democracy to, at the bare minimum, survive, let alone 
thrive, “the right to dissent with the majority opinion, and the 
necessity to have this dissenting discourse within the public sphere, 
must be protected” (Manwell, 2010, p. 849).</p>

<p>b. To employ propaganda assets to and refute the attacks of the 
critics. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate 
for this purpose. The unclassified attachments to this guidance should 
provide useful background material for passing to assets. Our ploy 
should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (I) wedded to 
theories adopted before the evidence was in, (II) politically 
interested, (III) financially interested, (IV) hasty and inaccurate in 
their research, or (V) infatuated with their own theories. In the course
 of discussions of the whole phenomenon of criticism, a useful strategy 
may be to single out Epstein&#39;s theory for attack, using the attached 
Fletcher article and Spectator piece for background. (Although Mark 
Lane&#39;s book is much less convincing that Epstein&#39;s and comes off badly 
where confronted by knowledgeable critics, it is also much more 
difficult to answer as a whole, as one becomes lost in a morass of 
unrelated details.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the biggest things we can actually help accomplish on r/conspiracy is to explain to friends and family that legacy media is US deep stare/ government propaganda. Don&#39;t talk down to them, don&#39;t call them idiots, don&#39;t act all paranoid or try to tie it in with other things like GMO or pizza gate. Just gently explain the facts and history. Someone here gifted in the art of conversation could help us by coming up with a &quot;script&quot; to get started?  Similar to how infomercial/sales companies use a script to sell their products or services? </p>

<p>I also made this comment into a separate post for awareness. Stuff like this is something we have some power to change quickly. </p>
