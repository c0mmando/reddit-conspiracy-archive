Yet they literally believe without Russia influence and &#39;hacking&#39; we&#39;d have Hillary as a president. Yet somehow he&#39;s also a puppet for them? So let me get this straight. Chris Steel is told information the FSB about what leverage they have on Trump? So why the fuck would they tell Chris Steel what black mail they have on trump wouldn&#39;t that defeat the purpose of having the black mail in the first place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Facebook echo chamber of your average liberal redditor has been so full of that propaganda for so long that these people&#39;s world perception is far removed from reality. These people have been subtly trained to perceive the vocalization of any dissenting opinion as a form of oppression. </p>

<p>The important thing to remember is that it&#39;s not their fault -- powerful groups have been refining the art of public persuasion to a science for over a century, since Freud, really. His nephew, Edward Bernays was the father of propaganda, which he later rebranded as public relations. They&#39;ve been acquiring more and more control of the flow of information through the media and the internet, so the public&#39;s perception of reality is largely in their control. </p>

<p>Until we figure out a way to teach the public en masse about human nature/psychoanalysis and methods of information analysis, powerful groups will always be able to manipulate them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone with some experience here, I will state that teaching people basic Aristotelian logic, the trivium, and the existence of logical fallacies can work wonders.</p>

<p>Once people are hooked on that, they start sifting through the garbage on their own.  In other words, teach <em>how</em> to think (critically), not necessarily <em>what</em> to think.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it needs to be a internet-sourced effort. There are enough aware internet-savvy people who know how to make memes and youtube infotainment/educational videos that if we got the right group together, we could create a viral psyops education movement.</p>

<p>I think the first thing we need to spread is the information contained in this CIA book: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/">https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/</a> <sup><sup><sup>hi</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>CIA</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>bot</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>checking</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>out</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>traffic</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>directed</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>to</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>your</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>site!</sup></sup></sup></p>

<p>Once people start to investigate their own thought processes, they start to see the strings that have pulled their neural pathways in one direction or another. When they become more critical of the information they receive, they&#39;ll start to wake up to the reality of the world they live in. On a related note, I think it&#39;s important to teach the basic facts of the situation, but let people draw conclusions themselves.</p>

Baseless accusations of the Russian government having something to do with Wikileaks publications. She was threatening war with Russia because she claimed that Russia was involved in Wikileaks, nothing more. Even if Russia really was involved, even if it was 100% illegal hacks committed by Russian actors for a Russian agenda, do you think it&#39;d be appropriate to go to war over that? Because that&#39;s what she said she wanted to do, use the military to respond to what she believed Russia did with regards to Wikileaks. </p>

<p>If CNN hacked Putin&#39;s emails and released them for the Russian people to see, would it be appropriate for Putin to threaten the USA with war? Because that&#39;s exactly what Clinton did and the Democrats are still saber-rattling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure the CIA started this?  The narrative was inspired by a report from a former MI6 agent?  The agent that MI6 put in charge of investigating the polonium poisoning by Russia when it happened.  I guess the guy could be lying, but he would be a decently authoritative source.  I mean only if he&#39;s not lying and making it all up for some reason.  And if he is, is it the CIA or MI6?</p>

<p>Maybe he lied about the polonium poisoning too.  I&#39;m sure Russia says he did.</p>

<p>Then there is the other possibility that this former MI6 agent was fed disinfo from legitimate sources.  Keep in mind Russia could leak rumors of Trump-Russia connections now just to dick with the US.  We could be fighting each other over a rumor they decided to start.  That would be a very cheap and effective means of further destabilizing the political situation in the US.</p>

<p>Or it&#39;s all true and we&#39;re fucked.  There could be someone in the Russian government that believes that they went too far in doing all of this, and that if this goes any further the backlash, should definitive evidence come out, would be world war provoking.</p>

It&#39;s this horrid smugness that just fucking stinks. It&#39;s too bad that echo chamber of a sub didn&#39;t get atomic bombed instead of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After the release of that report a few weeks back (the one that somehow considers Russia Today to be the prominent source of news for &quot;people who disagree with me&quot;), people in the comments were, without a drop of irony, claiming that it was unreasonable for people to ask for any real evidence of any Russian hacking and interference.  They were seriously saying it was unreasonable to expect any real proof, and that people who wouldn&#39;t take the intelligence agencies at their word were the crazy ones.</p>

<p>It was kind of what I expected, but one of the few truly upsetting things I&#39;ve experienced in the past few years.  To most people, discussing &quot;politics&quot; means talking about how &quot;presidential&quot; someone is, polling numbers, how the &quot;other side&quot; will react and overall trying to be &quot;above&quot; it all.  </p>

<p>Nothing substantive, nothing about policy or ACTION, just surface level debate of rhetoric.  It&#39;s a strange world when the supposed &quot;liberal&quot; board on reddit is terrified of the Red Menace and fully willing to submit to the authority of the CIA.  To claim that there isn&#39;t some entity pulling the strings to create a divisive environment where REAL discussion can&#39;t take place is, at this point, insane.</p>
