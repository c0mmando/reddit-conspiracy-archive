       The following are some the secret teachings of Jesus from the Gnostic gospels that affirm reincarnation, revealing the secret knowledge:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Watch and pray that you may not be born in the flesh, but that you may leave the bitter bondage of this life." (Book of Thomas the Contender)
      </p>
      <p>
       "When you see your likeness, you are happy.  But when you see your images that came into being before and that neither die nor become visible, how much you will bear!" (Gospel of Thomas)
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Book of Thomas the Contender, Jesus tells the disciple Thomas that after death those who were once believers but have remained attached to things of "transitory beauty" will be consumed "in their concern about life" and will be "brought back to the visible realm".
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Secret Book of John, reincarnation is placed at the heart of its discussion of the salvation of souls.  The book was written by 185 AD at the latest.  Here is the Secret Book of John's perspective on reincarnation:
      </p>
      <p>
       All people have drunk the water of forgetfulness and exist in a state of ignorance.  Some are able to overcome ignorance through the Spirit of life that descends upon them.  These souls "will be saved and will become perfect," that is, escape the round of rebirth.  John asks Jesus what will happen to those who do not attain salvation.  They are hurled down "into forgetfulness" and thrown into "prison", the Gnostic code word for new body.  The only way for these souls to escape, says Jesus, is to emerge from forgetfulness and acquire knowledge.  A soul in this situation can do so by finding a teacher or savior who has the strength to lead her home.  "This soul needs to follow another soul in whom the Spirit of life dwells, because she is saved through the Spirit.  Then she will never be thrust into flesh again." (Secret Book of John)
      </p>
      <p>
       Another Gnostic text, Pistis Sophia, outlines an elaborate system of reward and punishment that includes reincarnation.   The text explains differences in fate as the effects of past-life actions.  A "man who curses" is given a body that will be continually "troubled in heart".  A "man who slanders" receives a body that will be "oppressed".   A thief receives a "lame, crooked and blind body".   A "proud" and "scornful" man receives "a lame and ugly body" that "everyone continually despises."  Thus earth, as well as hell, becomes the place of punishment.

       Thank you for this post! This is one of the biggest conspiracies there is - we all get told we've got just the one chance to get it right. It's so misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever read any Brian Weiss? He's phenomenal. He set me off on my own path of discovery many eons ago &amp; his words still ring so true for me. It's incredibly empowering to see the big picture for what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also lead me down a serious path with the practice of astrology as a map for soul agreements &amp; I have been overwhelmed with amazing things in my life because I learned to see this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Namaste, friend. Love your posts!

       Not a problem! That's one thing that's always bugged me about Christianity. What kind of journey is one life? I've never understood how people buy that, let alone the notion of suffering for eternity in hell.

       I have not read his work before but thanks for bringing him up! I'm always up for new reading material.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did you find out about your past lives? I haven't tried anything yet but I know one way is past life regression which seems pretty successful, I think different meditation states can give you insight into that as well or even accessing akashic records.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate it! The motivation to keep posting comes from sharing truth and light, something I hold dear. Glad you read them and thanks for replying! Much thanks

       Through Dr. Weiss. I used his guided meditations.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was the head of psychiatry at Mount Sinai, Miami. He was a hypnotherapist who dealt with early-onset trauma through regression hypnosis, only he accidentally regressed a patient to a past life. He accidentally stumbled onto scientific evidence of reincarnation! His first book,
       <em>
        Many Lives, Many Masters
       </em>
       , is my favorite, but they are all amazing.

       Before I give the deal on what's up.
       <strong>
        I implore anyone that comes across this
       </strong>
       to find the Gnostic book of Thomas, Mary and John. I bought this book for .99 on google books. It's a core experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you read it,
       <em>
        read between the lines.
       </em>
       Really. The keys were stolen by the Pharisees and scholars, locked up and selfishly hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will not get in to the gates, but they have an unknown amassed library of knowledge (that may or may not have been destroyed. I am seeking the answers to this currently.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        This may help save you. This may help you further your ascension. This may help you build a strong agency.
       </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 1945, 12 (13?) codices were found in sealed jars by 2 brothers. (This story is being muddled by many, many places.) Several pages were burned by their mother, who felt that they were "too strong" or "too powerful/evil" - mothers intuition, who knows what she felt compelled to do, but that's okay, she is forgiven for not knowing. The 2 brothers sought to gain money from splitting the books up and selling them. Long story short, they couldn't agree on what they wanted to do so they fought - the person in charge of "escrow" for lack of better term, put these up in public eye.
        </p>

          The Nag Hammadi Library
         </a>
         , a collection of thirteen ancient books (called "codices") containing over fifty texts, was discovered in upper Egypt in 1945.

       Many, many years ago, a pope decided what was best for us regarding what the masses would see and be able to read.
      </p>

       I say again, I implore anyone that has a happy coincidence to read this, get this book and find this rabbit hole.

       I agree with you that making a case from non-Canon is ridiculous, especially if you base it on the Gnostics, who were pythagoreanists.

       That said, metempsychosis is canon.  See John 1:21.

       I see you as more of a victim of the Romans, and a person who presents himself as an authority by repeating what others say.  Do some original research.  Learn Greek and Hebrew, and read that whole thing, and the texts of the contemporary competing religions.  You will be surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       The view that metempsychosis is canon is widespread among people who can read Hebrew and Greek.

      <p>
       The story that John 1:21 is about Trinitarianism can be traced back to the fraud of Polycarp.

       Fuck outta here you dork. You haven't read the Greek or Latin the Bible's are translated from either. If you want to believe in heretic beliefs then by all means I cannot stop you but you're a fool going around insinuating no one else has ever done research into their beliefs.

       One of us is swearing at the other and claiming to be the better Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
       No part of the Bible was originally written in Latin.  Yes, I did learn to read Koine Greek to read the original texts, and I also learned Syriac because in some cases, that is the original language.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of it was written in Latin.  You must be deeply convinced about the Roman heresy.

       Be specific.  What words did I put in your mouth?  Did put "fuck" in your mouth?  Did I put "... Latin the Bible's are translated from..." in your mouth?

      <p>
       About the only thing I can see along those lines is you didn't exactly say you are "the better Christian," but you do represent yourself as having an authoritative view on what the Bible says.  I should have said, "the more well-informed Christian."

       You can't be more well-informed if you think any part of the Bible was originally written in Latin.  That is a sign that you suffer under Satan's flail, called the Roman church, based on the fraud of Polycarp, and re-framing straightforward scriptures as actually being about made-up dogma.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't even know the difference between metempsychosis and reincarnation.  So, yeah, consider yourself more well-informed until you get an exorcism and wake up.

Psychologists have published a lot of work recently indicating that it is the conspiracy deniers who are mentally ill.  There's certainly no doubt that Clinton as Secretary of State was involved in running weapons from Morocco, through Benghazi, to Syria.  Open your own eyes, fool.

       Because I'm curious about his secret teachings.

       Doesn't make me ignorant.. Just curious. I don't have to understand all of Christian teachings to be able to post something about reincarnation, something I am familiar with.

       He didn't teach that though. You need to learn what the gnostics are. If 150 years from now I write a book saying hitler taught peace and love on earth that doesn't make it true. That's what gnostic scripture is.

       He didn't teach that though the gnostics did. You claim to know so much about Christianity but get basic facts wrong. Learn what bullying is also, being mean to someone isn't bullying. Go back to your hug circle fool.

       In discussions on reincarnation, I find the question always begged is that life in this reality is intrinsically awful somehow. What'd be so bad about being reincarnated? Is life really that bad? Why is the jesus/buddha character so willing to just accept that this is the case without any first-hand knowledge of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've visited places on DMT that I really would hate to be reborn in as opposed to being reborn here on earth. It doesn't follow that simply escaping this place ought to be goal one pursues.

       How would Jesus know about reincarnation? Because he is a son of God and an ascended master.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is what we make it, this is what a lot of people need to understand. Thoughts, feelings, and emotions, shape our environment and who we are and who we interact with.
      </p>
      <p>
       We choose certain life lessons before we incarnate on earth to help us learn new lessons, some can cause suffering or pain or torment but all foster fast spiritual learning experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's one advantage of living on a dual polarized world, the opposite of what we are pushes us in the direction we choose to go.

       You certainly do need to believe in Jesus to get to Heaven. You don't need Jesus preached to you to learn about Him. He talks to us directly in our spirit. That is what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means. We talk ti Him, He talks to us. It's not a religion.

       I would say no because they obviously never had an opportunity to reach the 'age of reason' which is not a certain age, but the moment we learn the difference between right and wrong.

       You can believe anything you want. But if you seek the TRUTH you will find it. There is only one TRUTH, and only one Spirit of TRUTH.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want the truth, and  not just some dead faith that you believe for no other reason than it appeals to you, then you have to seek it diligently. Seek and ye shall find.

       My understanding after watching a documentary with John Henrik Clarke is that Jesus was a story borrowed from African folklore and used as a Christian deity. This is the apparent reason Black Jesus exists. Google it.

       Just to add to my other comment. Gnostic scriptures and Buddhism are kissing cousins. There's no reason to believe the early Christians disregarded such thoughts. Check out Valentinus for a spiritual mind blow.

       The Gnostic gospels were not included in the bible because they are not consistent with the rest of the gospels and the old testament. The 4 gospels are consistent with each other and with the old testament in that they are the proof Jesus was the promised messiah and fulfilled the prophecy and old covenant. Here you have multiple sources that say the same thing, and are once again consistent with the old testament. 
The church leaders called a council to decide what books were to be included in the bible. The only time books were removed from the Bible happened during the Protestant Reformation, 7 books were removed by Luther.

       It may be worth considering that much of what is included in these ancient texts (Bible, Quran, etc.) isn't meant to be taken literally, or at the very least, be interpreted both literally and spiritually/metaphorically. I read a quote somewhere that said "literal interpretation = religion" and we all know how much conflict and death organised religion has caused. Surely these great, historical texts are referring to things far more profound than some bloke chucking a pack of animals on a boat to survive a flood, for example.

       That's my uneducated take on the matter anyway! :)
