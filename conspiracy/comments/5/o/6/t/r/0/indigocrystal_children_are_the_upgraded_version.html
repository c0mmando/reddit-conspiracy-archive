       I'm an Indigo Child... escaped the drugging by playing outside... no one ever tried to tame me... I saw what happened to people that acted different... easy to fake being totally normal... Now I've been pushed... my energies are being transmuted to light... My ironic "Peace Monger" t-shirt is no longer ironic... Indigo Child turned Cyber Hippy.

       This article must have been written 20 years ago. The indigo children born in the late 70s are pushing 40 now. They are not kids or teenagers by any means. Indigo children books have been floating around for years and years. The idea of Indigo children may have some truth to them but their impact has been overstated. These star seeds aren't going to save the world. Humanity as a whole has to do that themselves.

       And that's what indigo children are doing. Earth has been on another collision course with destruction ever since atomic weapons were developed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of mankinds and the universal law of free will, outside forces couldn't directly interfere with us. But they came up with a plan and instead have been incarnating as earth souls to make change within.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes humanity has to do it themselves but the loop hole here to prevent another earth wide extinction event of mankind was to do it from the inside and incarnate from within.

       Even using this loophole the Indigo Children are not allowed to interfere with the evolution of the human race. Their role is only to act as observers and inspiration to the native population. If they go off reservation they can be karmically punished otherwise they are divinely protected. The human race has to choose its future of their own volition in accordance to free will. The Indigo cannot interfere and make that choice for us. If the human race chooses destruction and extinction then that choice has to be respected.

       But they have interfered with human evolution by incarnating here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because they are indigo's doesn't mean they can't still be human and affect change, that's a little absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       The indigos are here TO MAKE CHANGE, because if earthlings didn't have a boost from the inside, we would have destroyed ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indigos have changed humanity by reversing this destruction of self and earth, but by and large every individual soul on earth right now is affecting the earth, indigos included.

       There were 3 waves of these volunteers. The first are nearing forty and were sent in as a vanguard to incarnate here in order to raise the vibration of the field. They often felt completely alone and that they weren't from here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second wave were able to incarnate into the higher vibrational space that was being held by the first wave and although many also experienced strong feeings of being from somewhere else/separation, if they were able to overcome the progrmming of the mundane and connect with others, they could become highly activated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third wave are now coming in whole into a space where the vibrational level has been raised enough that they can very easily tap into their true soul expression without having to endure the trauma of separatedness that first and second wavers endured.

        Third wave fell flat on its' face as they became the SJW snowflake wave.

       That's an oversimplification. The first wavers are usually around 40. That's too young to have been the hippies. It was more the people that followed and evolved the hippy ideal but more as light warriors than flower peddling pussies.

       When you read Deloris Cannon's books you have to understand her work was based on seminars she gave 20 years ago. You have to add 20 years to everyone's ages.

      <ul>
       <li>
        40 years old = 40 years old in the 1990s so that is hippies

        teenagers in the 90s were born in the 70s.

       Dolores's book three waves and the new earth was first published in 2011. She gives those ages then.

      <p>
       It's not the hippies. The first wave weren't in any such groups. They were spread out throughout the population. If they were just the hippies then they wouldn't have had those feeings of isolation and separatedness. These were individuals lost in the society that still managed to radiate light. Even in the depths of their depression other people still felt lighter in their presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hippies were just mindless idiots getting manipulated by establishment artists like those from laurel canyon.

       If one believes in this, I would argue that the SJW snowflake types were never the Indigo children at all. That set is firmly entrenched in their own status quo. And they aren't all that creative; their thinking is limited.

       The first 2 waves caught the dark powers by surprise BUT they were prepared for the 3rd wave and knew how to deal with them. Volunteers are NOT allowed to directly interfere with human evolution so the dark powers baited them out to become involved. Now they are karmically entangled and thus have failed their mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is beyond any doubt SJW snowflakes are the 3rd wave of volunteers. If you read Valerian's "Matrix V" it states the 3rd wave of advanced souls will come to Earth in an androgynous and genderless form. They have evolved to the point where they no longer need to reproduce and thus gender is meaningless to them. There is no male or female in the higher dimensions. However, humans have not evolved to this state and still require a gender. Forcing this genderless state on humans too soon in their evolution has caused a negative feedback loop on the planet. Because of this the 3rd wave is now carrying a lot of karma due them disrupting society in a negative way. Through Karma this has caused the 3rd wave to fall flat on its' face.

       Man none of this resonates. None of what you said makes sense, I'm sorry. A indigo or crystal child would be beyond the primitive concepts SJW's preach and wouldn't even bother with such trivial nonsense.

       The dark powers used the idealism of the 3rd wave of volunteers against them. In a perfectly ideal world everything the SWJs want would be possible and in a highly evolved society would result in a non-judgemental utopia. However, the Earth is not a perfect world because karma is still in play. The 3rd wave mission to Earth was to encourage world peace by promoting genuine harmony among all races, acceptance for just existing among individuals, and a to put an end to the reincarnation karma cycle through genderless androgyny.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all became twisted by the dark powers. Harmony among the races was warped into a war against white people. Acceptance for just existing was warped into special little snowflake syndrome. Genderless androgyny was warped into a war against cisgenders. Social Justice Warriors is what you get when you become directly involved by creating negative Karma.
      </p>

       There are two ways to affect change in the world.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         One is to actively try to change the world. Actively interfering with soul evolution creates negative karma because some souls are not ready to evolve yet.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The second method to affect change is to passive align one's self to positive aspects and be the change you want to see. The passive method of leading by example uses the Law of attraction to affect change.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       For example: If you are a loving and kind person then the law of attraction would attract more of the same to you. The REAL mission of the 3rd wave was simply to exist on Earth in a peaceful, harmonious, non-interfering way and let the law the of attraction do the heavy lifting. The more peaceful and non judgemental souls that exist on this planet the more peaceful conditions will manifest on Earth due to the law of attraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       By becoming actively involved they failed the mission and turned into karma laden SJWs.

       Who are the dark powers?
      </p>
      <p>
       I get what you are saying about these forces baiting this wave of volunteers. But isn't it also possible that what we see as "SJW special snowflakes" were really false prophets to begin with?

       The dark powers are the Archons and Demiurge of the Gnostic gospels and whatever lackeys still bother to worship these devils. (They are also called the Sons of Belial or the Illuminati)
      </p>
      <p>
       The "false prophets" in the early SWJ communities were agent provocateurs designed to bait out the 3rd wave of volunteers.

       SJW's are the exact opposite of indigos let alone spirituality in general and lack the connection to such topics..
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk how you got SJW's out of that as SJW types are usually young souls still learning third dimensional concepts.

       Yeah. They are like the gullible upstarts. They also tend to reject religion and spirituality, in my experience. (As a former bona fide fangirl, I spent much time among them, and I saw them evolve [devolve?] in various fan communities from LiveJournal to Tumblr. )

       Indigo (SJWs) are gullible because they had their memories wiped when they incarnated here and in their previous lives they lived on worlds that had been at peace for millions of years. Now they have been trust into HELL with no memory of who they are and what their mission is. Earth is a hell planet. This is why everything triggers them and they need their safe spaces. The ONLY thing they have is their intuition in their heart and in their gut they know this world is NOT right. This is why they gravitated toward social justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOT saying every SJW is an indigo but a good lot of the overly sensitive Asperger ones are indigo children.

       Good I'm glad you said that.  Because, I see varying degrees of snowflake these days and it is unsettling.  It would be even worse if there was any kind of serious movement to make them superior.

       Such a movement would fail because no one is superior than anyone. We are all equals, created equally in spirit as we are all one. Anyone claiming to be superior is merely overcompensating for their perceived lack of equality and power they hold.
