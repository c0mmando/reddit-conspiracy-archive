I personally do not think this is true ( wen basic income is done right )<br/>
If it pay,s for housing healthcare and food.<br/>
And a lot of jobs are replaced by automation ( giving us more free time )<br/>
We humans will fill that time by being more productive in other fields.<br/>
Those fields will be Media / news / music.<br/>
Whit that much free time ( and no need to worry about survival )<br/>
We will create our own movies / shows for fun.<br/>
We will create our own music and opera,s for fun.<br/>
Most of it will be shared for free or for a small price.<br/>
Media ( movies music games ) have the power to change how people see and believe and think.<br/>
Whit automation and more free time.<br/>
The only places to create is in media and entertainment.<br/>
And because the amount of people are creating a huge pool of content for basically free there is no place for 1 big corp to have a strong foothold.<br/>
The humans will kill any competition in the media area whit free and better worked out shit ( open source )<br/>
This will also open up humanity to more philosophy witch also tends to open people up to other things.<br/>
It will unite humans more then divide it witch in turn would make it esier to rise up to those in power wen they try and stop the &quot;universal basic income handouts&quot;        </p>

<p>The general public (including economists) tend to see the government as needing to collect taxes in order to spend and see national debt as being a problem (not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB0lcX-GtOU">true</a> as admitted by Greenspan).</p>

<p>If there is ever a fake global sovereign debt crisis. Unemployed people will be targeted/hunted down.</p>

There is no way to hunt down the unemployed whitout risking losing all the power ( the majority will rise up )<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of stuff here you aren&#39;t considering I think. Why would you even need an income? If food is harvested by automations, houses are built by robot, etc. No one would need your money. Why not go completely cashless? The problem is that cash doesn&#39;t mean what it once did. There has to be something to determine who gets what. It started with gold, then cash, then checks, then debit cards... all further removing you from the actual value of your money. I guess what I&#39;m saying is this: if everyone is given money to pay for &quot;necessities&quot; and all jobs are automated, no one has any way of making any extra revenue. No one is going to pay for your &quot;music or media&quot; you produce. They don&#39;t pay for it now. Media sales are funded by advertisement sales. Who&#39;s going to spend millions of dollars on advertising when they don&#39;t make any money when you buy their product. It&#39;s total fascism. The government would have to regulate and control everything to an extreme level. Just my two cents. (Lol, see what I did there?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First let me start by saying that I&#39;m in general in support of UBI. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite as easy.</p>

<p>First it&#39;s important to understand the role of currency in a economy. Without a currency you are only able to make an exchange when both parties have something the other party would rather have. This is rather impractical. That&#39;s why we have currencies.</p>

<p>With a currency/money if somebody wants something (a loaf of bread/your labor/whatever) from you they can offer you some of their money in exchange for it. Since you know you will be able to exchange that money for something you need from someone, you can make that exchange.</p>

<p>Now how does UBI fit into the equation? When we demand UBI based on automation we basically express that everybody is entitled to a share of what is produced by automation. Seems fair? I would agree but I&#39;m not sure if whoever owns the factories would as well.</p>

<p>They produce something you want and are willing to spend money on but what are they supposed to do with that money?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if we are to automate everything like they intend to, how do corporations expect people to afford their products when barely anyone has a job? at at that point the basic income would be a redundancy and essentially useless when we can have machines do everything and everything would more or less be free for the taking, granted the people running this shit show had compassion for people. ive racked my brain for many years trying to find a realistic solution to the worlds problems and the only thing that made sense to me would be to set everyone free and abolish government and banks. everyone and their family gets a plot of fertile land to grow their own food and produce their own goods and revert back to the barter system. as it stands right now, the way we&#39;re living is destroying us and the planet at a very quick rate</p>

At the start it will ( the middle class will be reduced )<br/>
But the more that is automated the less power the wealthy will have.<br/>
The key to this is media and information &lt; something the population themselves will control.<br/>

<p>We already have/produce our own media, music, shows, games, etc.  Not much as changed. </p>

<p>Now ubi is still implemented in a capitalist system, it only covers food, housing, healthcare. Naturally I want more cool shit. So I need to buy it. So I need a job,  because ubi doesn&#39;t cover that. But wait the jobs are gone! &quot;just become a creative and sell your art!&quot; Good luck when the competition rises 1000 fold. gg no re.</p>

<p>ubi is a quick and dirty fix that&#39;ll keep us alive, but it&#39;s not a long term solution. It doesn&#39;t solve the root issues. </p>

Prices would be the same ( might change here and there )<br/>
Universal basic income is adjusted to only pay for housing / food and basic healthcare.<br/>

Wages and prices might actually drop * no more need for a minimal pay *<br/>

<p>Our current welfare system in the US <em>rewards</em> people breeding children that they are unable to feed. That will get so much worse with UBI.

    <div class="md"><p>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society...I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t give a shit what Einstein had to say, because he’s still wrong. Marxism is the ultimate oligarchy. Oligarchy is inherently a marxist trait.</p>

<p>In <em>Rules for Radicals</em>, Saul Alinsky writes on the power tactics to be used against political opponents for the purpose of breaking them down and destroying their reputation. One of these tactics characterizes nearly everything we have experienced since Barack Obama has become president, as he and his administration have successfully used it to blame Republicans for everything. The very tactic itself speaks to the wicked nature of Alinsky as a man, and a community organizer. It goes right to the heart in describing the goals of those seeking political power as it virtually eliminates any opposition while painting them as hypocrites. This is rule # 4 in Alinsky’s list of power tactics:</p>

<p>What Alinsky is essentially saying is that an opponent’s values can be reinterpreted, or redefined to make them seem undesirable; and thus, they can be used to make any opposition appear as if they are “against” whatever initiatives are being sold to the public. This is something Barack Obama and the left-wing have done masterfully as they have convinced a huge part of the population that America is the evil empire and capitalism is oppressive. Barack Obama’s reference that our Constitution is a document that hinders his progress is another good example. He said the Constitution does too much to limit what government can do, and not enough to describe what it must do on your behalf. Sadly, many Americans who have been educated by radical, communist-sympathizing hippies have fallen for this lie and have been conned into demanding “social change.”</p>

<p>It is this tactic in and of itself that describes Barack Obama for exactly what he is–a communist. Unfortunately, our left wing-controlled education system has virtually ignored the atrocious history of communism as one of aggression and mass genocide, and has successfully painted it to be one of peace and victimization at the hands of western imperialism. They have successfully done this because the above described tactic is itself communist in its origin. The Soviet Union, in its efforts to implement worldwide communism, used propaganda to convince millions that communism was about peace and that the United States was an imperialist, capitalist aggressor looking to rape the world’s nations of their natural resources. This is a strategy still being implemented today with the global warming lie.</p>

<p>In other words, the communists were using our number one value against us, and they were doing it very effectively to sway the minds of the general public in favor of communism. They were using our very “freedom” as a weapon. During what the left has successfully labeled and discredited as the McCarthy era, there was a great deal of documentation that was presented before the 82nd Congress and the Committee of Un-American Activities. For those that may be unfamiliar with “McCarthyism,” Joseph McCarthy was a Republican senator who claimed that there were 200 card-carrying communists who had infiltrated our government.  Recently, we have seen former Florida Representative Allen West make the same accusations. The left has since effectively discredited McCarthy as paranoid who believed there was “a communist behind every corner.”</p>

<p>One of these documents has come to be known as the “Communist Peace Offensive” and it was put together by the Committee of Un-American Activities. It thoroughly describes the tactics and strategies of the communist movement back to Lenin and Stalin. One of these strategies was to use America’s culture of freedom, our free press and free speech as a tool for spreading communist propaganda. Following is an excerpt from the Communist Peace Offensive:</p>

<p>The Communist leaders are fully aware that propagandists, within or without the United States, have easy access to the American public. There is one radio for every two persons in the United States, and the United States maintains radio freedom both as to broadcasting and the listener’s choice of program. The American press is also free. Thus, an American may read or listen to whatever he pleases. The Communists exploit our freedom with their psychological warfare, which finds expression in the present “peace” offensive. The current Communist “peace” offensive has certain specific immediate aims, which, if realized, can prove of inestimable value to the Soviet war machine.
This propaganda campaign to spread communism around the globe had been so carefully orchestrated that virtually every communist affiliated organization has agreed upon its tactical implementation:</p>

<p>It has received the official endorsement of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. The Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers Parties (Cominform), successor to the Communist International, has given this campaign top priority. It has been designated as the major effort of every Communist Party on the face of the globe, including the Communist Party of the United States. Also presented before Congress in 1963 was a document known as the 45 declared goals of the Communist Party USA, where it can be easily ascertained that they intend to break down America psychologically and spiritually. The following are from this document:</p>
