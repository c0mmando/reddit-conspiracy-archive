        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Intro</strong></p>

<p>Eric Braverman, former CEO of the Clinton Foundation is allegedly a missing person<sup><sup><a href="http://www.conservativedailynews.com/2016/10/where-in-the-world-is-clinton-foundation-ceo-eric-braverman-asylum-hiding-or-dead/">[1]</a><a href="http://www.snopes.com/former-clinton-foundation-ceo-missing/">[2/(((snopes)))]</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>The interest in this figure stems from the Wikileaks Podesta Emails, in which we discovered that Eric Braverman went to the press, and told them to &quot;follow the money&quot; to find out the true crimes of the Clinton Foundation.  Follow the money will lead you to the arms, that will lead you to the oil<sup><sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9VyrKB88DM">[1]</a>.</sup></sup></p>

<p>In an email conversation between Neera Tanden and John Podesta, Tanden warns John Podesta to “keep tabs on Doug Band” who she assumed was the insider who told NBC to “follow the money and find the real HRC scandal&quot;.  Podesta replied with the true identity of the mole: Eric Braverman.<sup><sup><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25357">[2]</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>A member of wikileaks and mentor of Assange&#39;s strangely dies on Oct 22 and Braverman allegedly went to the Russian embassy for asylum.  This is unconfirmed (correct me if I&#39;m wrong).  We haven&#39;t heard from him since.  Although there seems to be some small evidence an email between his account and <del>another</del> his husband, uncovered by George Webb,  that indicates he&#39;s in hiding.</p>

<p>George Webb&#39;s thesis is that Hillary, Petraus, Biden, a &quot;senators&#39; oil club&quot; and Hillary Loyalists such as John Podesta used their political influence and close tetherings to people in the intelligence community / national security council, the US military, defense contractors to run a &quot;counterterrorism&quot; proxy war in Syria (Isis) using funding stolen from a toppled and politically-controlled Libya, to build a pipeline from Saudi to Turkey, as a large Gladio-like NATO conspiracy to overthrow Assad , lean on Turkey to force a pipeline to Europe through their country to Greece, using the Clinton Fountation, political elitists and international banks to launder money and make covert deals.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, this exposition of NATO criminal empire building has been similarly explored by <em>Sibel Edmonds</em> of user-funded startup <em>NewsBud</em> in collaboration with <em>James Corbett</em> of user-funded <em>CorbettReport.com</em> in their description of so-called <em>&quot;Gladio II&quot;</em>.  Please consider supporting all three researchers so they can continue doing their important research.</p>

<li>Turkish intelligence working with this team tried to pin it on Assad in order to induce a NATO force (ie: US military) response</li>

<li>Recap: Using NYT Pullitzer Journalism to connect the dots of how &quot;Hillary Commissioned Sid Blumenthal to establish a private army with Muslim Brotherhood and then arm them by taking these stingers in Benghazi and also Sarin gas, and then conquering Gaddafi. Once you got the money from these banks and oil companies, you needed to bring the money back and put it through a funnel, and that&#39;s gonna be the IHRC.  And Eric Braverman established that...with Mckenzie...for Hillarys&#39; State Dept in 2010, right after the earthquake in Haiti.  Bill Clinton is put in charge of this board...for a year [the 9 complaining board members] are cut out of any involvement]...Hillary is putting a lot of money into Haiti from the State Department for a textile factory&quot;</li>

<li>Working theory: the <em>&quot;gold funnel&quot;</em>.  Convert assets to gold, diamonds and art aka &quot;negotiables&quot;, in order to avoid detection by wire transfer tracking agencies. This is how you get the Libyan gold to Haiti.</li>

They only have to pay a 2.5% royalty fee to the Haitian government, which is incredibly low by international standards, it&#39;s usually at least 5 to 10 percent...you have this funnel set up for 25 yrs.

<li><strong><em>People say &quot;how can this be such a large conspiracy?&quot;  George tells us his thesis is the opposite it&#39;s how few people are involved.  You only need one bag man, one tribe, a few NATO connections, a Bank Connection.  If you get people in positions of power, and everyone needs to follow orders beneath them, you only need very few people.  Hitler used to say it was me and 7 guys sitting around the kitchen table that took Germany.  The people in the inner circle are very few.</em></strong></li>
<li>7 QUID PRO QUOs among this group</li>
<li>Trump is aware of the whole funnel: his assistant Sec of Defence ran Bridgewater and Clinton&#39;s deals.  He is taking the NATO support base away from her, by cutting USAID, and cutting World Bank so she loses her diplomatic mechanism for the people she has in the State Department</li>
<li>Trump is going to stop Hillary and Kissingers Oil dealings in Asia so that they aren&#39;t stealing from SE Asia</li>
<li>Hillary has stingers which is a threat to Trump</li>
<li>Hillary has a 30B + 256B, quite a war chest</li>
<li>Morell did a gas attack in Alleppo and Ghouta and killed a lot of people</li>
<li>When Isis kills the parents, the kids get put on the human trafficking ratline</li>
<li>George claims to be 80% evidence 20% working theory, and has to be otherwise he&#39;d get distracted by hyperfocus on any one story</li>
<li>This goes back to Arkansas: Bill was always the &quot;good cop&quot;, Hillary was the &quot;bad cop&quot; running the Arkansas mafia and killing people there, now she&#39;s gone on a global scale with the Muslim Brotherhood in 32 countries now with Al Baghdadi.  The only thing that&#39;s changed is the risk to the world.  First they are shooting down Russian jets, then they shoot down European jets, then they shooting down American jets.  And they can shoot down the president&#39;s jet.  If you shoot 50 of these things at the president&#39;s plane, that plane is going down.</li>

<p><strong>Silence, Shills</strong></p>

<p>A word on shillery.  I will not respond to &quot;trump supporter&quot; accusations, divisive, false-narratives-of-partisanship type commentary in this post, and neither should you.  This is about Hillary and her cabal&#39;s crimes, and it affects each and every one of you, democrat,  republican, independent and nonparticipant.</p>

<p>If I made a mistake, correct me.  Refute Webb&#39;s claims with source, or it your words are implicitly invalid, as I&#39;ve been continually fact-checking these claims, and noted areas of his speculation.  Keep in mind that these are not my statements: I am just a messenger / note taker and I&#39;ve only done my best.  </p>

<p>If you can do better, then I encourage you to do so, below, because it helps everyone here.  If you want to help, you can treat this like an easter egg hunt to gather news stories as citations to claims and list them in the comments.  I will collate them and then repost a fully cited edition later.  </p>

<p>Thanks in advance to those who add to discussions.  You who are trying to get the truth are the best people in this country, imo.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done a lot of work on the pipeline subject and I&#39;m fairly certain that Syria was not for a pipeline from Saudis to Turkey at all. It was for the South Pars oil field in Iran. The US sanctions being removed and reimplemented on Iran match up with this theory as well as the $600 billion dollar investment that is expected by 2025. They already had control of Iraq and Syria in the next country in line before you hit the Mediterranean on to Greece. </p>

<p>Now that the plot has failed to take Syria because the Russians supported Assad, the American funded groups like ISIS FSA(read alquieda) are pulling out and the pipeline is toast. Now the pipeline however is being discussed between Russia Turkey and Iran. 
Turkey will have to leave NATO and then the pipeline will go from Iran to Turkey across Mediterranean to Greece. </p>
