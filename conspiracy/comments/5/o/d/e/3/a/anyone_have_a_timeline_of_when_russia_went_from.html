    <div class="md"><p>You can go all the way back to Reagan at the Berlin Wall.  Russia, and the communist ideology has never been irrelevant.  It is diametrically opposed to everything America stands for.  The United States so thoroughly beat and humiliated them that they never made the news.  People simply deemed them irrelevant.  What becomes obvious via Wikileaks and Assange is that Russia has been plotting revenge.  Russia has been leveraging the internet and social media skillfully.  Evil empire 2.0 hit full effect when a president elect with a communist born wife attacked the United States intelligence community, NATO, the current president, and anyone who had anything bad to say about Russia.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh not at all.  Once catalogued, it is simple math.  Wikileaks targeted NATO and the U.S. specifically.  I think anyone who has put time into analyzing this can be certain.  Everything else is conjecture.  Is Assange a Russian intel asset, yes, did he know he was, maybe yes, maybe no.  The Trump intelligence leaks?  They are true or false.  The MI6 agent is honest or not, got fooled or did not.  These are the questions, the truth will expose itself only to those who are open to it.</p>

<p>Your conjecture started at the beginning of your previous sentence. </p>

<p>WaPo, NYT, USA Today, Tribune, MSNBC, BBC, take your pick. The AP are the only ones with that story about Clapper stating they don&#39;t have evidence to say WL&#39;s source is Russia. The rest are happy to allow the public to conflate WL with the Russian influence because WL exposed those organizations&#39; conflicts of interest. Speaking of connecting dots, why do you suppose those other institutions haven&#39;t cleared the air about this <em>fact</em>? </p>

<p>43 minute mark. </p>

<p>Just for posterity, here is NPR&#39;s coverage of that discussion:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/17/502428952/clapper-resigns-as-director-of-national-intelligence">http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/17/502428952/clapper-resigns-as-director-of-national-intelligence</a></p>

<p>Oh and the most recent episode of On The Media (an NPR program) where the host (former NPR correspondent)  states that NPR is in the habit of holding back obvious and important information to support their narrative  specifically by refusing to say that Monica Lewinsky ever had a stained dress (how petty). </p>

<p>It&#39;s like people really don&#39;t understand this. It&#39;s like they look at all of those strange videos of people driving shitty fucked up cars that they have no business driving, and just think it&#39;s a thing they did for a YouTube video, without realizing it&#39;s actually that shitty there. </p>

<p>Russia is a shithole, and they&#39;re trying to turn our country into a shithole; level the playing field, so to speak- and people seem to be okay with that, which I find disturbing. </p>

<p>There are parallels to be drawn about every aspect of what Trump &#39;stands for&#39; that is right in line with Russian thinking. Anti-LGBT, anti-union, anti-&#39;establishment&#39;, discrediting anyone who disagrees with your narrative. </p>

<p>This should bother anyone with half a brain, but instead it&#39;s the same divisive politics we&#39;re used to while there are foreign interests trying to destabilize our country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the thing that seems obvious to me.  There are forces trying to destabilize and weaken our country.  I think it really started with Fox News.  Bill Clinton was the one who ignored our constitution and let a foreigner buy a media company.  That started news organizations marketing to specific demographics politically.  This has created an ever widening rift politically.  Divide and conquer.  I used to watch news on several channels but stopped because I could see how slanted they were.  The reason the CIA had govbot disabled was because a soviet agent was using it to steal American secrets.  Russian intelligence knows how shitty their country is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russian annexation of Crimea was a key moment, as you say, and the assistance provided to Assad by Russia has really damaged the Anglo-Zionist-Salafist plans to carve up Syria and further isolate Iran. </p>

<p>But there have been numerous other incidents that western countries have complained about before these events. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko">assassination of Alexander Litvinenko</a> in London in 2006, probably at the direct behest of Putin, seriously pissed off the Brits. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya">murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya</a> also in 2006 turned the western media against Putin. The crash of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Polish_Air_Force_Tu-154_crash">Polish TU-154 Presidential plane at Smolensk, Russia</a> in 2010, which resulted in the deaths of 96 people including the Polish President, Lech Kaczynski, his wife, and dozens of senior political and military figures was also blamed on Putin by some.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the main issue, right there.</p>

<p>The US was all set to attack Syria after that horribly botched false-flag Sarin gas attack on Ghouta, Syria.</p>

<p>Putin&#39;s intervention royally screwed up the plans. Shortly thereafter Putin was distracted for some time after the (US instigated) coup in Ukraine, the Crimea mess, etc.</p>

<p>Once things settled down a bit, he again focused his attention on Syria, and made Obama look like a fool (again) by actually DOING what Obama and the West <em>claimed</em> to be doing - slapping the shit out of the Paper Tiger called ISIS and largely running them out of the country.</p>

<p>Yes, this made &quot;the West&quot;, and <strong><em>especially Israel</em></strong>, VERY angry.</p>

<p>That is the primary reason that Russia went from &quot;irrelevant&quot; to &quot;evil empire 2.0&quot; as portrayed by the US media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The last one about the hacking, yeah I&#39;d say that didn&#39;t happen. The Crimea annexing had conflicting sides. The Syria thing was completely instigated by the US or at least shady elements of our deep state and Russia was just retaliating. I don&#39;t think Putin is mother Theresa, but he&#39;s closer to that than the malevolent wizard behind every event detrimental right the establishment</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me make something clear, the Syria situation had nothing to do with the US or Russia in the start. </p>

<p>During the Arab spring protesters were protesting Assad, the US had nothing do with that and really nothing was newsworthy, the protest were ok size but nothing to care about. </p>

<p>But shit hit the fan when Assad sent troops to the protest and when they got a bit out of had they just started shooting everyone, he sent more troops and it got to a point where his soldiers shot anyone going into the street.  The whole thing was crap before the US or Russia ever got involved. </p>

<p>Russia was also not retaliating, they had nothing to retaliate about,  theu simply wanted to keep a nearby pro-russian leader</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you agree with Marco Rubio that Putin is a &quot;war criminal&quot;? Everything you say could be true.  There&#39;s no doubt the innocents of Syria have been massacred. I&#39;ve seen those reports. I think very little off Assad or Putin as people. I don&#39;t put it past them.</p>

<p>But we all know leaders do terrible things all the time and depending on their client status they are either ignored, condoned, or painted as Hitler.   </p>

<p>Of course, bombing every single hospital is war criminal type action with international agreements barring such action. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Georgia attacked and invaded south ossetia and abkazhia in 2008 during the olympic games.   The hope was that Medvedev would be too busy at the Olympics to respond.  WRONG.  The Russians were watching troop movements and evacuated as many as they could from South Ossetia&#39;s border with Georgia, and alerted the Abkazhians.   Georgia&#39;s military was blown out in 8 days.  Russia took a lot of Georgian hardware and left the country.   President Sakkashvili then became VERY unpopular with the Georgian people and left the country, and came to the USA to form a CIA funded oppsition group.  Then then went to....ready for it....UKRAINE.</p>

<p>You think they left the country? You know they are still there and control 20% of the country calling it Russian territory,  right? That number keeps rising as they move this border they created</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Putin took charge.   The jewish oligarchs anointed Putin as next president after Yeltsin, but Putin had other ideas than being a puppet.
The moment he consolidated his power and authority he took all the wealthy oligarchs and gave them an ultimatum....work for Russia, don&#39;t strongarm the government or suffer the consequences.   Many didn&#39;t listen, Putin threw some in prison, many escaped to Europe and the USA.
From THAT point on, Russia became the new evil empire in the eyes of the jewish oligarchs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was somewhere along the line with connection to Syria and our proxy war against Russia there. I believe there were also leaked documents from the Clinton camp saying that they intended to attack Trump over fake Russia connections long before the primaries were even over. This was also long before they could have known Trump would be their opponent too, so I can only guess that they presumed that <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/3696795/you-all-know-that-the-clinton-campaign-deliberately-plotted-to-get-trump-nominated-right/">their plan to elevate &quot;pied piper&quot; Republican candidates</a> would be successful and that they&#39;d be able to install Trump as semi-controlled opposition. </p>
