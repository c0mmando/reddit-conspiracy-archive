       He will never release them. While they do not contain explosive information for the general public they contain enough information that investigative agencies will be bound to act. A lot of people will be embarrassed, some in office now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a small connect the dots game and some speculation that the released tax returns could easily either confirm or deny:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The FBI angle:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump laundered money in the 90s for the Jewish-Russian mobsters that were cooperating with Russian intelligence and sharing profits. They later introduced him to Russian intelligence. He went to Russia, got compromised.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the FBI New York Office let him get away with it - either because of being sloppy or for more darker reasons - and was extra motivated about pushing Trump to the presidency to avoid this coming to light.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the current FBI leadership was afraid of that dereliction of duty coming out and the ensuing scandal and thus supported Trump for the presidency with a non-event of a press event surrounding the e-mails.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Praque angle:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Michael Cohen used his Israeli passport for the meeting in August in Praque with a Russian state figure connected with Russian intelligence. Thus him tweeting his US passport out publicly as a "clever" move.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         FBI, still looking to cover their tracks, decides not to investigate even though they know that this is the same guy with a different passport.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         CIA punts because Cohen is believed to be a Israeli asset inside the Trump regime. Relationship with Israel is key for the deep state to survive the next four years as tiny nations like Israel, Estonia and to lesser extent Poland are only ones with HUMINT access to Russia.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The how rich Trump is angle
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The best guess is that Trump's real net worth hovers around 700-850 million dollars. Some put it a bit higher, some lower. We do know that in real estate projects, his main source of revenue, he is as a rule a minority stakeholder or only sells out his name as a brand for even less money. With the exception of a very few marquee projects like the golf course in Scotland that he uses for publicity.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         However during the campaign Trump could not keep his mouth shut about being actually worth 11-12 billion dollars. This can't be only his brand value 
since most of his brand projects like the university, vodka or stake are failures.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We know now that the Rosneft stake offered to Trump by the Russians via Carter Page was worth exactly around 11-12 billion dollars.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The disinformation angle:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Russians have recruited dozens of well-known conspiracy hacks from the Western world as their agents of provocation.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They recruited Bannon to give marginal conspiracy theories with a Russian anti-Nato spin a mainstream audience.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They then recruited father and son pair Flynn to give these stories a route inside formal halls of government.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The key conclusion from this train of thought is that, Trump has not been recruited by the Russians, however he is being actively blackmailed. And many members of his entourage are active agents and not only assets for the Russian government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus formal procedures to get rid of Trump are difficult to begin with. Thus the need for a deep state to function independently of the compromised and or bought Trump regime for the time being.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can figure this out as a complete outsider. Not really rocket science. So will others.

       Trump in 2011 -

        "We’ll look at that. Maybe I’m going to do the tax returns when Obama does his birth certificate. I may tie my tax returns. I’d love to give my tax returns. I may tie my tax returns into Obama’s birth certificate."
       </a>
       <br/>
       <em>
        (Obama released his birth certificate the following week - still no tax returns)
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump in 2014 -
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg-5KEt1Abg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">
        "If I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump in 2015 -
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIMDkxoS1as">
        "I don’t know. I actually have not even thought of that. But I would certainly show tax returns if necessary. Well, what have they been doing? They’ve been really doing one year other than people that never made anything. But I would certainly — I’m very proud of what I’ve done. I do pay tax, but I’m very proud of what I’ve done," Trump said. "I have no objection to showing any tax return."

       You cannot be both a patriot and a trump supporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know they think that they're the most patriotic of all, but teddy roosevelt would disagree;
      </p>
      <p>
       “Patriotism,” said Theodore Roosevelt, “means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the President or any other public official save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. … Every man,” said President Roosevelt, “who parrots the cry of ‘stand by the President’ without adding the proviso ‘so far as he serves the Republic’ takes an attitude as essentially unmanly as that of any Stuart royalist who championed the doctrine that the King could do no wrong. No self-respecting and intelligent free man could take such an attitude.”
      </p>
      <p>
       or perhaps you prefer this one where Roosevelt gives us the TL;DR version;
      </p>
      <p>
       “To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.”
      </p>
      <pre><code>― Theodore Roosevelt

       Roosevelt would be rolling in his grave at today's GOP. The man was a protector of public lands, societal safety nets, and knew that business plots were to be looked at with caution. He believed that criticism was healthy in a republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       You now have a GOP who is hell bent on selling all of your public lands, cutting all social safety nets, and will hand everything off to corporations. They also have a cabal shouting down any dissent.

       Today's republicans are RINOs. Anyway paying attention can see it.

       Trumps taxes is a fishing expedition.  No one (other then the IRS and his accountants) has any evidence of wrong doing or illegal activity.  People asking to see his returns are simply fishing for anything to make him look bad.  It's not in his interest to help his enemies.  Therefore he will not release his taxes if he can avoid doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually smart of him.  I don't want an idiot president that sets themselves up for failure by giving ammunition to their enemies.  As far as taxes go, it's between Trump and the IRS, as far as I'm concerned.  If I had to guess, he's paid as little taxes as legally allowable, but that's a fault of the IRS, not Trump.

       Then he should just release them like all other presidents do. If there's nothing to see, why hide them? End of story.

       It's not the "End of Story".  This "if you have nothing to hide" bullshit is the wrong mentality.  We are not obligated to give our enemies ammunition against us so we can be proud and say "look at me, I'm transparent."  It's moronic.  Just because YOU want transparency at all levels doesn't mean people have to oblige you.  They have rights too. Or would you have everyone in the world give up their right to privacy so you can snoop on their private lives and find fault with them?  Because that's what the people who are asking for his tax returns are looking to do:  Find fault.

       I'm sorry, he's the president. He doesn't get a pass because he's your guy. All presidents release their tax returns in good faith. 74% of the public wants them released. That's part of our transition of power, having our public officials show us what they've been up to. There is no excuse. No need to defend it.

       Why shouldn't we look for fault???  We have every damn right to look for fault in the person who will be running our country.  If he wants to hide in the shadows he can shut his fat fucking mouth and quietly run his businesses instead of trying to run the most powerful country on the planet.

       Looking for fault is an attack.  If you were aware of a specific fault and trying to gather evidence, that's one thing.  But what you are talking about is probing for weaknesses and looking for an exploit to attack.  It makes you an enemy of the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to avoid hypocrisy, then you should think about how you would feel if people were working to exploit every aspect of your life.  Looking at your taxes, looking at your chat logs, looking at every single personal detail of your life so they can tear you to shreds.  And you're going to sit there and tell me that you would help them destroy you?  Hypocrisy....right....

       I don't think there is anything illegal in the tax returns. I just think they are filled with convoluted tax dodging systems that would reveal he pays more taxes in Ireland and the Netherlands than he does in the county he is president of. I would be very hypocritical of him that he keeps ranting about how US tax dollars are funding cheap heath care &amp; education in NL (via US defense budgets and NATO) if people found out his company's are paying taxes to NL to maximize profits at the cost of lower US tax returns.

       This is such a stupid argument. You think that people don't release their tax returns because they are hiding actual crimes? You think the IRS doesn't have access to this info regardless of whether you publicly disclose it or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       The ONLY reason he doesn't release them is they will show he doesn't have as much cash as everyone unknowledgeable about business would assume he has. ZOMG TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE BILLIONS IN LIQUID CASH WHAT A PHONY

       When they aren't busy wanking it to their high school crush's Facebook page they can topple foreign governments, traffic drugs and weapons, assassinate US citizens, etc. but Trump's tax returns are Top Secret and a mystery to everyone. Their guess is as good as mine as to whether he's a tax criminal.

       Half? They've absolutely seen his tax returns and they know there's nothing illegal he's just taking advantage of legal techniques. If anything releasing his tax returns would shine a spotlight on what's legal for rich people regarding taxes and they don't want that. Us normies are too busy making mud piles for any of this to directly effect us anyway.

       I'm pretty sure he's not releasing his records to evade public knowledge of how the wealthy avoid actually paying thier fair share. They hide money, take deductions for things that aren't quite accurate, etc. How funny would it be to see Trump getting government "assistance" via tax breaks? That's the real welfare everyone should be rioting in the streets about.

       That's fine.  But you and I do what we can to pay as little tax as possible.  So why would we expect anyone else to do otherwise.  I don't cheat on my taxes but i also don't pay for more than I have to.

       But that's the thing. They've either lobbied to get corrupt practices into law, or they manipulate through tax attorneys to actually cheat. (For a small example, my ex owned what was listed as a single family home, but in truth, was hiding two apartment rental incomes, for what was not lawfully a 3 unit home. Both the tenants and tax attorney were aware and my ex was a former felon for tax issues...)  Shit passes through the IRS yes, but under public scrutiny, would be brought to light.

       Bring it to light, by all means.  But that's not what this is about.  We don't need to attack the PEOTUS to expose tax loopholes.  We can do that without him.  All this stuff about Trump's tax returns is just an attack on the man and a distraction, nothing else.  It's detractors being detractors.

       Wealthy people don't become wealthy by being completely honest, except in very few cases. I do not understand the blinders that Trump supporters wear. It's annoying in general conversation, but within this sub? Maddening! He's not anti-establishment. He's part of the narrative.

       I am in no way a Trump supporter.  I just feel that this tax return business is distraction.  No one has evidence of wrong doing and yet they claim a right to investigate.  It's like me demanding to tear up your back yard so I can look for dead bodies even though I have no evidence you killed anyone.  Releasing tax returns is likely to only give ammunition to people (and nations) who would want to hurt him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't give a shit who Trump is or isn't. As far as I'm concerned, it's not about the man himself.  It's about common sense.

       You're right.  The President should have more protections from attacks on the grounds of national security.  Like him or not, he's our leader and any attacks on him weakens our nation as a whole.  It's not a popular way of seeing it but it's unfortunately correct in every regard.
