Strangely enough when Jesse Ventura interviewed him on &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot;,It was found out that all UFO sightings in the USA are actually routed to Bob Bigelow first for study.  He also is creating his own line of spacecraft. <a href="http://www.phantomsandmonsters.com/2013/04/discussion-skinwalker-ranch.html">http://www.phantomsandmonsters.com/2013/04/discussion-skinwalker-ranch.html</a> There is a large amount of wierd things that have happened there.  Sightings of Aliens that look similar to the creature in the movie &quot;Predator&quot; have been seen climbing through a large metal type tube, and both looked somewhat transparent. This may be a Dimensional Bleedthrough.  <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/02/why-do-ufos-love-this-utah-ranch-so-much.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/02/why-do-ufos-love-this-utah-ranch-so-much.html</a> Please tell me what you know about the strange Skinwalker Ranch. <a href="http://www.oddx.com/skinwalker-ranch/">http://www.oddx.com/skinwalker-ranch/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know is, lower dimensional beings cannot exist in the third dimension because of its frequency of light would be detrimental to such negative beings.</p>

<p>Positive beings above the fourth dimension are usually energetic bodies or beings of light and love.</p>

<p>Archons, and other negative controlling service to self beings that exist in lower dimensions and frequencies can only incarnate here through royal bloodlines (the famous 13 bloodline families)</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I can contribute for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man, appreciate that. One topic I&#39;m compiling currently is on the subject of chemtrails and how it&#39;s destroying our environment, each other, and the ecosystems globally.</p>

<p>It will be my biggest post to date with a lot of sources and information tying it all together, I want to help blow the lid off geo engineering.</p>

<p>Hoping to finish that tonight or tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay here goes. This is just a drop in the bucket of sources but it&#39;s where I started.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>conversations with God by Neale Daniel Walshe. Books 1, 2, and 3. </p></li>
<li><p>Seth material channeled by Jane Roberts</p></li>
<li><p>journey of souls by Michael Newton</p></li>
<li><p>Law of one material by Ra</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The above sources aren&#39;t entirely dedicated to ET information but lays the ground work, context, and knowledge that lets you grasp the whole picture of the reality we incarnated within.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Gaia network. Like Netflix but for spiritual, alien, and conspiracy information. Great service that has many shows that touch on these topics</p></li>
<li><p>David Wilcock is an excellent example of these ideas. He has 3 shows that discuss various information pertaining to these subjects. I suggest watching cosmic disclosure, wisdom teachings, and open minds (open minds is hosted by someone else but has great info too)</p></li>
<li><p>Bashar, channeled by Daryl. His videos and channelings are all over YouTube.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is just a start, to provide context for you.</p>

<p>Hope I helped, and thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One problem with many of these narratives explaining odd creatures is the dissonance between technological ability and practice.  If these creatures were able to break or bend the laws of physics to travel space in ways humans can only theorize about, why would they be interested in mutilation, taking and removing cattle, dogs, humans, etc. especially in the vast amounts attributed to them.  </p>

<p>They should have mastered biology by now, how many cows does it take to see what makes one tick, if they need a continuous supply do these supposedly enlightened beings really lack the ability for animal husbandry.  These aren&#39;t the signs of an intelligent and wise race so much as a parasite or sociopath.</p>

<p>Concentrations in certain areas, especially remaining in the same place for decades even after drawing attention to it by the public rather than move on to one less suspect, why?  You can make a portal, between worlds or dimensions, but you can&#39;t change the location? These seem odd constraints.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All speculation and conjecture. There is zero evidence of alien life.  Do the math..... we are a speck of cosmic dust in a universe so vast it takes light billion of years to traverse...  are you actually saying another intelligent life form has found our tiny planet and not only arrived here but also... do the math again.... is the appropriate size and image for us? Ever wonder why aliens always seem to have a head, two eyes, two arms, two legs?  Because we do... do the math....  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s another math problem for you. Stretch your arms out wide. From one finger tip to the other can represent time of livable conditions on earth. Now at the teeny tip of one finger represents man&#39;s existence on this timeline. Basically, we just arrived.  Niow IF intelligent creatures visited this earth chances are, it was a lava ball or a steaming pot of goo.... not when man was at least intelligent enough to recognize them as aliens.   Aliens finding one another in space? Hahhahhahaaaaa.... you don&#39;t understand the vastness of space.  But that&#39;s why portals were invented, wasn&#39;t it? To explain just how these impossibilities could be possible.  Aliens take short cuts..... how convenient.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose you have never heard of wormholes and folding space to cover huge distances? That does not matter anyways. Aliens are from other dimensions.

    <div class="md"><p>More speculation. These are sweet theories but none are conclusive. You cannot claim wormholes can/will be used to cover large distances or that aliens are from &quot;other&quot; dimensions because it is only believed they MIGHT.  It&#39;s also possible we are a speck of dust with a biological life form created by accident and who will die off soon enough, never to exist again.  Or maybe some &quot;great creator&quot; made us out of clay and watches over us. All possible, nothing conclusive.    Significant research.... what a joke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not limited just because I refuse to believe wormholes and aliens exist just because they might. They might but as of yet, they don&#39;t.  Wormholes might be theoretically possible but there are no wormholes that we are aware of where we can travel long distances by taking the wormhole shortcut.   Thousands of  people make fantastic claims concerning aliens but as of yet, no one has proof of an alien on earth.  Sorry to bust your Star Wars/Star Trek wishes but theories and speculation are not facts.    </p>
