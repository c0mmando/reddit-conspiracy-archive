       In the past these things would come out in a press release, or press conference, the intelligence agency would almost certainly have gotten a "heads up" before the public, and have started to sculpt a response.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Trump going direct to the public he keeps them playing defense. Since it's a medium they aren't as effective at using this is probably pissing a lot of folks off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to the mix a new adversarial right wing press that isn't neocon, and citizen investigation the fight for media control is a lot more interesting.

       Yeah, and what a coincidence the Wapo starts posting more lies than usual RIGHT AFTER Obama signed the "Countering Misinformation" propaganda law. How many of these BS stories are actually written by CIA and Wapo paid to publish?

       Bezos owns amazon.
Bezos bought the WaPost for 200 million (I think that's the #)
4 months later, bezos gets a 600 million dollar contract with the CIA to build a "private cloud" for the CIA to use for its data needs

        <strong>
         Jeffrey Epstein was said to have run a sex ring, where young girls were trafficked for the pleasure of his “elite circle of friends.
        </strong>
        He served time and settled with 17 of his underaged victims.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump: "
        <strong>
         “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.
        </strong>
        No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
       </p>
       <p>
        It started last month when Senator John McCain gave the FBI a dossier outlining contacts between the Trump campaign team and Russian intelligence services. The dossier included evidence that Russia had “slam dunk” material, including video of Trump proving him to be a pedophile.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Trump is currently in a legal challenge over a rape charge involving a 13 year old (at the time), charging both Trump and Jeffrey Epstein with a “double team” sex assault
        </strong>
        . Trump’s legal team alleges that the court gag order on the case and a proposed settlement which involves a potential “non-disclosure” can be used to prohibit grand jury testimony.
       </p>
       <p>
        This may well be why it is so important for Trump to get a Supreme Court nominee passed, should this decision come before that body.
        <strong>
         However, there is no confirmation that this case is the one the Russians have video on, or that there is only one case

       And when you don't know in the intelligence agency, it means there is  truly nothing there. They have had this dossier for months. The dossier was sponsored by Jeb Bush and John McCain, and then continued to be sponsored by Democrats after the general election. It's all a bunch of partisan BS.

       So you really believe that Trump managed to track down the bedroom of Obama in Moscow, managed to sneak into the bedroom with hookers, managed to have them piss on the Obama bed, and managed to get away with it too, if it weren't for those pesky Russians. Give me a fucking break cuck. I know you can't be that retarded.

       <strong>
        illegally

       sent and received top secret classified info at the time. James Comey "let her off with no intent" which is bullshit because Comey accused her of gross negligence or "extreme carelessness" if you'll recall. Lawyerly bullcrap doublespeak. She is guilty as hell.

       The CIA-run media in this country has been trying to take down Trump since he announced his campaign run. All of it's been the CIA, Military-industrial complex, oil companies, pharmaceutical companies, etc. The CIA is at the top and John Brennan is quite literally a Saudi oil money puppet. CIA is trying to prevent Trump from destroying the New World Order and they are absolutely desperate right now. They are backed into a corner and there's no amount of bullshit they won't pull in the next 4 days.

       Right because Trump drained the swamp, didn't appoint a bunch of Neocon flunkies to his cabinet, wasn't funded by Israeli mob boss Sheldon Adelson. Trump is a boy scout! He is going to make America great again?

       Trump did not appoint a bunch of neocons you fuckwit. He appoint businessmen and businesswomen, Generals, and paleo-Cons and actual Conservatives. You're a retard for concern trolling over the Cabinet picks when Obama's cabinet was decided by Saudi bank money and oil money. Trump did not appoint people over pay to play.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump wasn't funded big money by Sheldon Adelson, you're right! Trump won with self-funding and small donations. Some big money went to the RNC itself but that was not connected to Trump, and it was nowhere near the amount of money Crooked was taking in.
      </p>
      <p>
       He does not do the same shit as other politicians. If he was the same, the CIA/MIC/Bilderberg/Rothschild/ apparatus wouldn't be so god damn desperate to stop his presidency.

       Trump got a least 25 million from mob boss Sheldon Adelson.

       Giuliani is a Neocon and a NWO puppet, he helped the 911 false flag attack. Without criminals like him, the plot would have been exposed. Interestingly, Trump knew that bombs were involved and said as much, until he retracted and said the usual mumbo jumbo about jet fuel melting steel. Was Trump an insider who knew how the false flag was carried out?

       I personally only buy into conspiracy theories that have at least a SHRED of evidence on their side. Even just a bunch of circumstantial evidence might get me to believe in it, but I need SOMETHING more than anonymous CIA officials leaking fake stories to the corporate media. Until or unless there's some actual evidence of some kind, I can't get behind that conspiracy theory.

       Handkerchief code words do appear in Podesta emails released by Wikileaks that have been confirmed to be 100% legitimate. Nothing concrete, and it doesn't prove anything at all, but at least there's a SHRED of actual evidence there. I don't necessarily buy into the wildest allegations that have been put forward based on such slim evidence, but that confirmed-legitimate evidence IS
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       . All we have in this case is baseless allegations by professional liars. I'd be more willing to believe Alex Jones telling me that Obama is a reptile space alien than I am willing to believe baseless allegations the CIA might try to feed to me through the corporate media.

       It's not even supporting trump that is a problem for me. It's the low quality and lack of critical thinking skills the posts tend to exhibit and promote. Just look at this posts body (this subreddit post, not this comment). Bit more on point this is a conspiracy subreddit, so blanket infatuation with a political candidate does tend to smell a bit odd.

       This isn't a conspiracy! A conspiracy requires some sort of plotting or conspiring - secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful. This is just a faggy headline for T_D to rub one off too.

       The CIA having a secret plan to sabotage Trump is not a conspiracy? Trump talking about restructuring the CIA and other intelligence agencies a few months ago and the CIA trying to take out Trump is not a conspiracy? You are not looking closely.

       Trump throwing around accusations at people who don't bend the knee to him isn't a conspiracy. A respectable person leveling accusations at the CIA
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       take, to use OP'S phrasing, balls. In Trump's case, it's just more of his trademark hollering. It's the CIA one minute and someone who made his taco bowl wrong the next. "Grandpa spit on his care nurse again! The balls on that guy!"

       Yeah I understand that. But this man has been attacked by half the country and the media sure as hell was never interested in presenting both sides or getting facts straight, so he's doing it.

       That is not true and all of you are unrecognized people who are trying to forum slide and fracture this community.  I know because people that are regulars, whether i agree with them or not are marked as F and you guys are all unmarked.
      </p>
      <p>
       unmarked means this whole comment section is filled with a bunch of touron losers who are trying to push a narrative, and some of you are pushing counternarrative...this is a forum slide.

       We get what you're doing. All of us know what is happening.  All of us know what you're doing.  We won't forgive it.  There will be a public revelation of everyone that has astroturfed here in the last several years, when the user database is leaked and you guys will be in a lot of trouble since you'll see what correcting-the-record IRL looks like at that time

       I disagree with 911bodysnatchers322 on almost everything, but a one year old account does not mean anything. I have been on reddit since about 2011, but I change my name about once a year, so like now, my account would only show one year also.

       So a three sentence shitpost is good material in your mind? Keep in mind one of those sentences is just "Amazing!" This post is nothing but Trump cock worship. It would not have gained
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       traction before the Trump brigade began. Just look at the vote ratio; as of this post it's at 60% and it's only that high
       <em>
        because of
       </em>
       the Trump brigade.

       Even if it is, it's still relevant. When the president is publicly warring with the CIA it is relevant to this sub no matter how much you hate Trump.

       I'm fully aware of the relevant information, and that this "event" is worthy of attention. However, OP did not share and instead decided to shitpost. This post is now on the front page due to the brigaders. These types of posts are not just annoying but also damaging to the reputation and credibility of this sub, which is pretty low to start with due to the nature of this sub.

       relevant OP just spouts unsourced claims with such a thick pro-Trump bias that you can cut it with a knife. Yes, what OP is referencing is true, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a shitpost.

       You must be joking. Most people here are simply criticizing the Trump wave. We don't even know what kind of president he will be yet. I may have voted for the son of a bitch but this sub has been flooded with

       The entire post, not just the title, is a shitpost. The only reason it made it to the front page is because of the Trump wave.

       Exactly. Fuck Trump, but fuck the CIA even harder. Trump hasn't done shit compared to what the CIA has. His scam "university", his business discriminating against Black people in the 70s, allegedly raping that 13 year old child, even the wacky stories about him being a Russian plant. Nothing he's done, nothing he's promised to do, nothing he's alleged to have done is anywhere near as bad as the evil that the CIA has brought the world.

       The Russians wanted to mutually do away with nuclear weapons but instead of coming to good terms Reagan passed on easing the hostility because he wouldn't give up ambitions for space weapons. 
Then there was that time his administration was caught using profits from weapon sales to Iran, who we had under economic and diplomatic sanctions(including an arms embargo) following their 1979 Revolution, to fund the Contras of Nicaragua.

       There is a Cabal in control and the only part of the Cabal that is a US government agency is the CIA.

       I thought about your response a bit more.  When you say "billionaires" consider this.  The real establishment is the trillionaires.  The ones you do not see on the lists of the world's richest people.
      </p>
      <p>
       $1 Trillion is 1000 times more than $1 billion.  It is like me have $1 million and you having $1000.  If I have $1 million and you have $1000, then I can easily wipe you out.  If you have $1000, then you can easily wipe someone out with $1.
      </p>
      <p>
       The billionaires that you mention are super rich to you and me, but they are only foot soldier, like pawns, to the trillionaires.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war we are waging is against the trillionaires.

       I am reading more about Hitler to see if he understand what he was up against.  I think he did not.  The people he rounded up and exterminated were not a threat to anyone.  He targeted the wrong people.  If Hitler would have targeted the banker class, then his place in history might be much different.  It is interesting to consider...

Storming the beaches of Normandy, and killing a shitload of Nazis. Want to know his life's regret? That he didn't kill more Nazis. He has a great, honorable man.

       Oh, I do not worship Hitler.  Sorry if I gave you that impression.  One of my Grandfathers fought in Europe and the other fought in the Pacific.  I think the one that fought in Europe was in the Battle of the Bulge, but I am still trying to sort it out.
      </p>

       Hitler and the Nazis got what they deserved, because they committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.  I have read about the Nuremberg trials.  I wish Hitler would have been hung along with the others.

       What I am saying is that Hitler made many mistakes, and history would view him much different if he understood the way the world really works.

       You know that American bankers funded the rise of Hitler, right?  One of the bankers was George Herbert Walker.  Does that name sound familiar?

       You're trying to convince a socialist that bankers are evil. By bringing up Hitler. I don't need to know what Hitler should have done (putting the bullet in his brain 25 years earlier is the only thing he "should" have done.) to know that bankers are evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way to fight a banker is not to elect anyone from the 1%
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I know, HRC was beholden to the very same bankers I am railing against. As a socialist,
       <strong>
        nobody
       </strong>
       ever running for office for one of the 2 parties will even come close to my economic ideals. That leaves me with social issues to make my decision. I like having insurance, I like abortion being legal, and I like the lgbt community having rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a REALLY easy decision for me on which candidate to support. Trump's actions and words since winning have done nothing to convince me that I was wrong. Quite the opposite, actually.

       I kind of lost track of this conversation because I have had several today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I was not clear on my Hitler reference.  I brought it up because I am going back and relearning that part of history based on what I have learned the past year.  History looks much different to me now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are probably aware that Helene Hanfstaengl stopped Hitler from killing himself after his failed Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I support Bernie, so I have Socialist leanings to the point that people label me as such.  Of course, Hitler was a fascist, and the 1%, as you call them are also fascists.  My hope is that the US will become more Socialist in the future, and I am pushing towards that.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Yes, I know, HRC was beholden to the very same bankers I am railing against." --  Yes, I am also against them.  My point before is that Hitler would have been smarter to kill the bankers rather than exterminate Jews.  Of course, it is risky to say anything remotely positive about Hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
       "As a socialist, nobody ever running for office for one of the 2 parties will even come close to my economic ideals." --  Bernie is closer, right?  I think he should start a Progressive party.  My hope is that both the Democrats and Republicans will be done for in the coming years.  The Democrats are hurting, and the Republicans have a President that they did not support.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I like having insurance, I like abortion being legal, and I like the lgbt community having rights."  --  I am with you.  I am straight, but I have a lot of friends and business acquaintances in the LGBT community.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It was a REALLY easy decision for me on which candidate to support. Trump's actions and words since winning have done nothing to convince me that I was wrong. Quite the opposite, actually." --  I look at it this way.  With Hillary as President, very little would have changed.  With Trump as President, he will either, by some miracle, do well, or he will bring down the system by shear incompetence.  He is already in conflict with the CIA, so that is a good sign to me.  I am betting Trump will bring down the system by shear incompetence.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you mention the 1% being elected, this is where I see things differently.  I think that the 1% do not run for office because they would have to give up power to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I mentioned before, the 1% are the trillionaires, the Rothschilds and their ilk.  They control the billionaires and the politicians and have them do the dirty work.  These billionaires being selected by Trump are merely pawns.  If they are removed from their positions, it will not change anything.  If someone like Rothschild, Rockefeller, Soros, etc. are "removed", then that will change things.  One way to remove them is to nationalize the Federal Reserve.  Another way to remove them is to take power away from the CIA.  I honestly think that we should confiscate their money because they stole it from the U.S. taxpayers, and have been doing so for over 100 years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the people in the Trump administration start implementing their racist, sexist, homophobic policies, I know that people will protest and push back.  I am counting on it.  The idiots in the Trump administration will not be able to see that they are undermining themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC was not able to see that they undermined themselves with their treatment of Bernie and his supporters.  Those idiots are blaming the Russians for their election loss!  They still have no idea.  This is the mentality of the people in the Democratic and Republican parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, let them screw themselves, then we can jump in and take over.

       Trump represents the establishment more than anyone, Republican or Democratic, than anyone could ever imagine. Might as well have elected a Rothschild or Rockefeller.

       Well, I see it differently.  To me, Hillary is more establishment than Trump.  Hillary is bought and paid for, and established Republicans turned their backs on Trump and voted for Hillary.  I recall hearing such talk when Trump started winning in the primaries, and I found it interesting.  These Republicans, who I despise, are for Hillary and against Trump.  That means I should be for Trump if those are my two choices.  Of course, I wanted Bernie...
      </p>
      <p>
       I just posted that there is a Cabal in control, which includes the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Soros, etc.  What most people do not know is that the CIA is the only part of the Cabal that is a US government agency.  Trump is already in conflict with the CIA, which is a good sign to me.  No doubt, Hillary would have gotten along fine with the CIA, which is another reason I am against her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this make sense?  We need to weaken or dismantle the CIA to break the grip of the Cabal.  We also need to nationalize the Federal Reserve.

       You're right, it simply has thedonald constantly here upvoting anything involving Trump.  And those doing so provide nothing and are only pushing their own agenda of supporting Trump and ignoring anything negative about him.  By downvoting anything negative about him since we have a lot of conspiracies to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the main problem is, yes the sub is pro-Trump.  It's fucking annoying.

       Where are the conspiracies about Trump considering god damn news stations are even talking about this shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh downvoted because thedonald sub downvoted it.  There's my fucking conspiracy.  It's pathetic you lie when the evidence is literally right in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to grow a pair and start voting on conspiracy shit more here.  You're lying basically and it's obvious.  Great Trump did something, now where's also my many threads about everything NEGATIVE Trump does and the possibilities behind his actions that have been hinted at for a year?

       I agree and I wish both sides could be heard out equally. It seems like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is where you have to go to explore anything anti-trump, which is annoying because the comment section is just an echo chamber that eliminates any chance for possible discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that I noticed is that anti-trump conspiracies are hard to find on youtube too, unless it is from the MSM. If you look on youtube for videos countering the MSM there are hundreds of accounts with their own videos analyzing and refuting claims, but if you look for videos of trumps ties to Russia or anything anti-trump there are not nearly as much content. It is almost as if youtube is becoming the new talk radio for the right wing.

       Who is calling out Trump's greatness? This thread is about him calling out a conspiracy....you know...what this sub is about. OP is clearly a Trump fanboy but at least what he is saying is relevant to the sub.

       In the comments you can disagree with the sentiment that this is something good or if you believe there is something else going on etc. You are free to do that and it is welcomed. But calling out the sub as a Trump playground based on posts that are entirely relevant is not useful.

       From a conspiracy perspective there is a valid (if small) hope that he will change things. He has many issues as a person and president and likely isn't the savior people hope he is, but it is valid to point out instances where he shows potential to take down some of the corruption and members of shadow government even if that is being brought up by a shill or fanboy and even if it could just be him bullshitting us.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is up to us to hold and share our own opinions. I've seen that the vast majority of these trump posters are open to admitting that he may not be what they were hoping for despite still posting relevant bits about how he is challenging the CIA etc. I don't see what is wrong with that. The proper course of action against that is to explain why you are skeptical or think they are wrong to believe, not try to smear the sub as a safe haven for trump supporters when it isn't.

      <p>
       Trump is a scumbag and I'm pretty sure he really did rape that 13 year old girl that he was accused of. I don't like him, but you know who I like even less. Deceptive liars like you.

       Seems you may have skipped your meds, but I'm curious how I'm a deceptive liar?
      </p>
      <p>
       And who are you to say I'm not a legitimate, regular user?  In the 5-6 years I've been on reddit I've been in this sub under 2 usernames.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consistently view the posts in this sub set to new to try and do my part to stop the flow of shit like this post.
I comment where when I have an opinion.
I have no problem calling bullshit when I see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at your other comments in this post, it's clear you aren't here for a discussion, but to put your fingers in your ears and say "I can't hear you." after telling people they're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with that.

       I think it's more just people with a sense of reality that don't post in the Donald all day, an echo chamber where you aren't allowed to have opinions. So when you're in here you're not used to people not agreeing and upvoting everything you say.

       And even so, who would dream about that shit? It was so obviously fake that even while Buzzfeed was doing as they were told and parroting the CIA's bullshit, they felt the need to point out that it was obviously bullshit. What a fucking horrible fake, it's as if they didn't even care about their lie even looking believable.

       I have no reason to believe its fake yet. I also don't believe its factual but there's certainly some evidence to back it up that I've personally witnessed on this website and twitter, as well as what trump says.

       Trump is the only person you can trust now, don't you know?

       I agree with your sentiments. My question is Joe and why so many people on this sub are gravitating to Trump. I'm all for mucking up the order of things, but is Trump really the guy we want doing it? That's discounting the idea that he is an elected official. If elections were corrupt and the rules of the game so clearly defined by the higher powers, why is Trump an exception to this "rule"?

       What is wrong with his cabinet? Trump campaigned on running the country like a business. His economic platform is central. If you were president, after making these promises, would you be appointing some econ prof who has never run a business in his life or self-made people who know how to run a successful business and make money?

       Well again, who the hell do you expect him to appoint? You should only be concerned if he's appointing proven corrupt people. He's appointing the few people who supported him i.e his friends what a surprise. That is what every president does and it's what I would do too. I'd appoint people who are both capable and trustworthy.

       First, Tillerson actually owns Exxon stock, which is why he is expected to divest. Kerry didn't, his wife did.

      <p>
       Second, Tillerson was the CEO of Exxon. Teresa Heinz never worked for the Heinz company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, your own image points out that Heinz is worth ~1 BILLION dollars. This wealth is not dependent on the current success of the Heinz company, it's hers. The value of her stake in the Heinz company (a distinction that was beyond whoever made your image)? About

       Fair enough. My main point was that the rich are always appointed what is so fascinating about Trump doing it? He himself is a billionaire and he campaigned on running this country like a business--with other business people like him. Did you expect him to appoint his loudest supporters? Alex Jones maybe?

       I understand all the optimism if you're a trump supporter but most likely in a few months you'll get to find out first-hand how all the people fooled by Obama's "hope and change" felt. I want nothing more than for you to be correct but I'm just not feeling it.

       This has been ringing through my brain. We got good old pizzagate in the weeks before the election, Comey's letter, this grand crescendo of doubt...and nobody thought to leak this thing then...because our intelligence agencies were actually looking into it, or in Comey's case sitting on it. Nobody revisited the mother jones article where the idea of an investigative dossier was first mentioned. All the attention was on Clinton, and all of it was bad. Trump and a Russian official "warning" about WW3 and Trump's apocalyptic final TV ad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bringing this thing out now, if it's a total fabrication, could be used to create doubt in Trump in the public eye, but literally achieves nothing in and of itself. He will still be inaugurated no matter what, despite his half-assed attempt to divest, swirling in controversy.

       The 'dossiere' itself has been highly-contested and part of a conspiracy around Trump either way.  Once side saying the dossier is valid, others saying it's not.  Some saying it shows TRUMP is conspiring.  Other say it shows Trump is being conspired against.

       A conspiracy is defined as "a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful". Are you unaware of the harm that the CIA plots to do in secret?

       With Donald's new tweets on Brennan and all theses new interviews on his new policy agendas especially NATo ect I believe its all over for Trump and he knows it too. According to Alex Jones who claimed to have  connections with some DC elites, Donald will be arrested soon and there will be Martial Law/ Some say this is balls of steel however I don't think it is...maybe some last min efore hell breaks loose

       Well it seems to be way more than the CIA that has evidence on this story, I'm waiting to hear more to the story before making a judgement. I strongly advise others to do the same. There seems to be at least some legitimacy to it even if the dossier isn't accurate in every way.

       Not even worth bringing up to a trump supporter anymore. You already made up your mind. Pizzagate may be the biggest, dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever seen. It's based off of 4chan, and literally made up on the spot and spun to make a narrative. Any form of evidence you have is a joke.

       There's evidence, it's just all circumstantial rather than concrete. It's more of a "this is VERY weird" and "this looks REALLY suspicious" versus "this proves that they're human traffickers."

      <p>
       Show me some actual evidence that Trump is whatever you believe he is. Even circumstantial evidence, if it comes from a trustworthy source or can be proven to be legitimate. And no, the CIA is not a legitimate source, they're professional liars.

       Yes, it is possible Trump is doing something bad but that's another conspiracy theory. My point is this thread is still related to another conspiracy that is frankly more viable. The CIA being used for political purposes by the Whitehouse is not a new event.

       No. One theory is that the source is 4chan. The left has quickly changed the narrative and given credence to the MI6 agent theory.
But in regards to that:

       Someone else posed this to me before. It would be a good theory if it didn't assume that Trump's team knew that Buzzfeed would leak it. They couldn't have known that so far in advance that they could post in on 4chan in November before Trump even won the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, you would think that if
       <em>
        Buzzfeed
       </em>
       knew all this time they would have released it before the election. The same goes for the whole leftist media. They are hardly people who hold back against Trump.

       Mother of Jones did an article in October. Looks like the British spook leaked it to the wrong source (they were too shitscared to publish the dossier ).

       The FBI, which had been sitting on the info, released a letter and confiscated Weiner's laptop to distract anyone.

       Why Hillary didn't use it? According to the Mother Jones article the Russians have blackmail material on her as well. Also, she was convinced she would win anyway.

       This doesn't make sense. Hillary was publicly attacking Russia for months and talking about 'economic and military' responses to Russia for (allegedly) hacking the DNC. If they had blackmail info on her she and Obuma wouldn't be pushing the anti-Russia rhetoric. They were throwing everything could at Trump, hiring trolls, starting violence, hiding and faking news etc. It is inexplicable that the tabloid Buzzfeed had this all this time and kept it a secret despite their bubbling clits for Trump.

       Again, Hillary was publicly attacking Russia and helped create the current narrative about them. If Russia had dirt on her then she wouldn't be doing that. So it doesn't make sense that Russia was preventing Hillary and her 'media' from releasing the dirt on Trump. You gave it a good try but it's implausible that the media would back on Trump. Heck, even when Buzzfeed did release it was because they just couldn't hold it in despite their inability to verify.

       I think the difference is that an mi5 agent who is speaking publicly about things he shouldn't is braking an oath of silence... or he's not really an ex mi 5 agent.  Either way he's a liar and not to be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       A billionaire businessman made no public oath to the public.. he owed his duty to no one.

       Being rich and knowing other rich guys some of who may have gotten their riches illicitly does not in itself deem the man a liar and beyond trust.

       The fake news stations are reporting Russia has ties to Trump, Wikileaks has been compromised by Russia, and the recent document leak with golden showers and shit.
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has had heavily upvoted threads saying that
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ncovs/no_trump_is_not_a_russian_puppet_no_russia_didnt/?sort=top">
        the former two are flat out wrong and there is no conspiracy there.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So if Obama wants a conspiracy to die he just orders CNN to report it and the CIA to go along with it and therefore the conspiracy will go away and will no longer be discussed here.

       Everything about someone like Trump reaching this office oozes of conspiracy. Add that with the notion he was compared to a "kid on an anthill with a magnifying glass" narrative to his comments today about a CIA director.

       Are you joking? op talks about the President accusing the CIA of literally conspiring against him with lies leaked to the media, and you say there's no conspiracy? A conspiracy is defined as "a secret plan to do something unlawlful or harmful". Do you believe the CIA secretly leaking fake shit to the media is isn't secretive? They weren't intending to harm Trump by leaking that bullshit? Come on. Even if the bullshit story the CIA leaked is 100% true, the CIA still had a secret plan to harm the president, making this appropriate r/conspiracy material EVEN if their wacky lies were true.

       OP's account is 3 days old. Looks like they made it 1 day after the moderators controversially removed
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5nby2o/16168713729_reports_allege_trump_has_deep_ties_to/">
        the Trump conspiracy post.

       Since then MAGA_1991, an obviously fake username,
       <a href="http://archive.is/14Toz">

       The title is clickbait and there is hardly any text in the self post. Obvious attempt to make the subreddit look pro-Trump is obvious.

       This OP is a perfect example of the lengths people will go to try and make that false narrative a reality.

       Yes there might be a large number of Trump supporters here, and yes the removal of [that Trump post 4 days ago](the Trump conspiracy post.](
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5nby2o/16168713729_reports_allege_trump_has_deep_ties_to/">

       ) was wrong, but Trump supporters haven't come close to taking over this subreddit and they are just as welcome here as any other supporter as long as they remain skeptical of every politician including Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully the MODs will remain politically neutral so we won't have more weak attempts to subvert the subreddit, like MAGA_1991, in the future.

       Here's a tip. Anytime someone says something like "this is r/the_donald2" or "I liked this sub better before Trump fans took it over", they're 100% FOR SURE trolling. They might be a paid shill, they might be a useful idiot, they might just be a fucking asshole, but if they're saying things like that, they are 100% fore sure not posting in good faith. Don't let the karma score fool you either, trolls use sockpuppets to upvote each other, especially when we're talking about the paid astroturf.

       Yep. Unfortunately there's not really any way around it besides common sense or MODs deleting all the concern troll comments. Since censorship is never productive I guess we'll just have to hope everyone else realizes this and wait for this recent phase of Trump/Conspiracy hysteria to blow over.

       Trump is a scumbag and a criminal. I've spent the past year badmouthing him in this sub and I don't think I've ever gotten negative comment karma for it. Most of the users here realize that Trump is not on their side, so I'm not sure why you folks are so intent on coordinating a to trick people into thinking everyone here is in love with Trump.

       I agree too. "The Donald2.0" angle is being pushed a lot like shill activity.  I don't care if I even see Donald stuff on here, but considering he is the president of course you would seem something related to him. Kind of seems convenient though that nothing gets accomplished and people just keep fighting every time something related to Donald Trump is posted. Lots of deragatory comments. TBH makes me almost not want to browse this sub.

       Agreed.  Fantastic work.  Well said.  Thank you.  Not to mention the whole ordeal with reddit admins trying to find evidence of the the donald leaking into other subreddits.  Maybe these are fake trump supporters attempting to get the donald banned.

       Just because I know that the CIA is filled with liars and I don't appreciate the fact that they're spreading lies that the media is parroting without scrutiny doesn't mean I want to "circlejerk the Don". He's a fucking idiot scumbag criminal who ripped off millions of dollars with a scam "university". He's been accused of raping a 13 year old girl, and I don't doubt that it happened. He's a bigoted moron who has said terrible, terrible things about Mexican and Muslim people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the CIA is still filled with liars and they're using the media to spread lies about the president. Trump is a fucking piece of shit and I don't like that he's my president. But you know what I like even less? Propaganda. Lies. The fucking CIA. Our new president is so fucking terrible that you can call him an alleged child rapist and be 100% correct. We don't need to make up lies or spread the CIA's lies in order to talk shit against him. We don't need to tell lies to make him look bad, he consistently makes himelf look bad.

       I honestly don't think that document leaked from within any US IC... I think it leaked from whatever private firm/contractor wrote it...
      </p>
      <p>
       If the copy the media had access to was from a US IC it would have been stamped into evidence, titled, classified and had redaction codes... the copy on buzzfeed had none of these things... so it was a "virgin" copy and not a piece that was ever filed by a US agency... too pristine.

       The document that was leaked was privately generated, What gives the whole thing legs is that multiple agencies and countries came to the same conclusion based on their own independent investigations.

       You don't understand what I'm saying... I know it was privately generated... but if the US IC got their hands on it they would have stamped it all up and filed it into evidence... and then distributed copies of that stamped up copy... so if the leak came from within a US IC it wouldn't be covered in just highlighter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whomever wrote it probably "leaked" it... though it wouldn't technically be a leak if they did it themselves.

       Can someone clarify something for me? The report was from a private security firm and not produced by the US. From my understanding, then, this wouldn't be a classified document because it was privately produced. In addition, it was floating around for months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it important who sent a non-classified document to BuzzFeed? Why an investigation? Isn't this legal?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is this different than if I wrote a two-page memo detailing how my wife nags and I leaked it to BuzzFeed?

       You are correct... it is no different.. to be a leak it would have had to come from within the US IC... and though they had a copy of it... this didn't leak from them... it was handed out by who wrote it.

       Even if it came from the IC, it's not a classified document. Isn't it like if I worked for the CIA, found an embarassing video of Obama slipping on a banana peel on YouTube and sent it to BuzzFeed?

       Every document is classified in the US IC... even if it is classified as unclassified... They even classify newspaper clippings and enter them into case files...

       Not to get too conspiracy meta, but this looks like a false flag attack on the subreddit.

       OP's account is 3 days old. Looks like they made it 1 day after the moderators controversially removed

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The title is clickbait and there is hardly any text in the self post. Obvious attempt to make the subreddit look pro-Trump is obvious.
      </p>

       ] and others to paint this subreddit as "taken over by The_Donald".
      </p>
      <p>
       This OP is a perfect example of the lengths people will go to try and make that false narrative a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there might be a large number of Trump supporters here, and yes the removal of
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5nby2o/16168713729_reports_allege_trump_has_deep_ties_to/">
        that Trump post 4 days ago
       </a>
       was wrong, but Trump supporters haven't come close to taking over this subreddit and they are just as welcome here as any other supporter as long as they remain skeptical of every politician including Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully the MODs will remain politically neutral so we won't have more weak attempts to subvert the subreddit, like MAGA_1991, in the future.

       I don’t believe the world’s most well equipped, trained, and financed intelligence community fell for le 4chan meme. They have all of the resources in the world to verify, disavow, or manufacture a story like this. I was able to call this hours before it broke that this was a prank. The CIA can easily outstrip me in investigative gusto. They simply chose not to.
      </p>
      <p>
       My level of incredulity is at where Milton Cooper is talking about how CNN was able to interview UBL weeks before 9/11, but the CIA couldn’t seem to track him.
      </p>
      <p>
       4chan and websites like it are known far and wide as places that mega corporations and world powers use to sway and manipulate public opinion. It was true back in November. It was true in 2011. It is true now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s something else to think about, too: Donald Trump has been implicated in very real cases involving sexual deviancy. Now this very real connection has no credibility because of this whole fiasco.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deep state is rallying around their new figurehead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new boss is going to be the same as the old boss, because he’s blackmailed, like the old boss.

       Don't really like Trump but the fact that absolutely nobody in the establishment has any idea what the fuck to do about him is somewhat refreshing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, there's no playbook for any of this, and all they can do is have the MSM continue to throw feces at him while he continues doing the Trump thing. The people that run this country and pretend to know what they're doing are finally going up against a beast they can't kill, getting hosed at their own game, and everyone's watching.

       My main impression of trump was that he ran an anti-establishment campaign and picking a bunch of wall street and intelligence insiders to run his cabinet suggests to me that promise probably won't be kept.

       Most of Reddit is cucked, I won't disagree with you there. But your characterizations of r/The_Donald and paranoia of unsubstantiated rumors about Trump himself are equally as retarded as SJWs spout on about the Russian boogeyman in

       You must be joking. Most people here are simply criticizing the Trump wave. We don't even know what kind of president he will be yet. I may have voted for the son of a bitch but this sub has been flooded with

       He did disclose part of the CIA torture report I mean give him partial credit. Mr Gorbachov bring down part of the wall! We will go part of the way to the moon! We fight them on the beaches (within reason) and will never surrender (completely)!

       You're trying to convince a socialist that bankers are evil. By bringing up Hitler. I don't need to know what Hitler should have done (putting the bullet in his brain 25 years earlier is the only thing he "should" have done.) to know that bankers are evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way to fight a banker is not to elect anyone from the 1%
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I know, HRC was beholden to the very same bankers I am railing against. As a socialist,
       <strong>
        nobody
       </strong>
       ever running for office for one of the 2 parties will even come close to my economic ideals. That leaves me with social issues to make my decision. I like having insurance, I like abortion being legal, and I like the lgbt community having rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a REALLY easy decision for me on which candidate to support. Trump's actions and words since winning have done nothing to convince me that I was wrong. Quite the opposite, actually.
