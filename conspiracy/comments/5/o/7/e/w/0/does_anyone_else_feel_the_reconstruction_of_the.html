    <div class="md"><p>This is a great observation, one I&#39;ve thought about previously. The reconstruction was done by the same company that did the WTC, Turner Construction. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bbu73/turner_construction_is_one_of_the_principal/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bbu73/turner_construction_is_one_of_the_principal/</a></p>

<p>Are our representatives REALLY that stupid, though? Are a majority of them REALLY unaware that 9/11 was an inside job? Or might they all escape beforehand through the underground passageways and use a video to make us think they&#39;re there before they all get &quot;massacred&quot;?</p>

<p>But yes, I have had that feeling. Plus we&#39;ve got the predictive programming for the Capitol being destroyed in &quot;Live Free or Die Hard&quot; (a film franchise that already teased us with the &quot;robbery of the century&quot; under the cover of downtown Manhattan terrorist attack in &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;) and &quot;Batman v. Superman,&quot; two movies loaded with CIA Hollywood pawns before and behind the camera. </p>

<p>So sure. It could happen. Hopefully somebody&#39;s telling the representatives what&#39;s up. Then again, how many of them would we miss if that happened?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this comment did lead me down the rabbit hole all the way to the Denver airport, and now I return with even more concern. I feel too many politicians fear of what trump may reveal, but I also don&#39;t fully trust our intelligence agencies to look into the Capitol, I saw something earlier how no one is allowed inside of course it makes sense to prevent others from going in, saw someone on Twitter say that a stash of guns were found still don&#39;t have a source though. It&#39;s really hard to find info about this other than what you have provided. I felt the Capitol was being built for Hillary since a woman is what they feel will usher in whatever the fuck it is they are trying to usher in, I just fear of them setting up something terrible.</p>

<p>How does Denver Airport play into this? Because CIA is moving HQ from Langley to Colorado? </p>

<p>No one is allowed to go where? In the Capitol? </p>

<p>I agree that they thought Clinton was their gal. The very fact they were unable to pull that off should give you pause about how effective the CIA actual is anymore. </p>

<p>On this one in particular there is a ton of residual evidence. More than exists for the Moonraker change even. Just Google &quot;lion and lamb&quot; and church, statue, ornament, verse, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>on an opposite opinion they are very old buildings with tremendous amount of upkeep. i work within eye distance to the capital building and while i agree the work that was done did seem to take a looooong time I&#39;m not entirely sure they would actually go through with something like that here in dc....but then again after 9/11 anythings possible </p>

When they started it, I&#39;m sure that everyone involved in the project was figuring Clinton was 100% going to be the next president anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this comment did lead me down the rabbit hole all the way to the Denver airport, and now I return with even more concern. I feel too many politicians fear of what trump may reveal, but I also don&#39;t fully trust our intelligence agencies to look into the Capitol, I saw something earlier how no one is allowed inside of course it makes sense to prevent others from going in, saw someone on Twitter say that a stash of guns were found still don&#39;t have a source though. It&#39;s really hard to find info about this other than what you have provided. I felt the Capitol was being built for Hillary since a woman is what they feel will usher in whatever the fuck it is they are trying to usher in, I just fear of them setting up something terrible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but if you are experiencing the ME then you know that things do change. Just because you have not experienced this particular change doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>On this one in particular there is a ton of residual evidence. More than exists for the Moonraker change even. Just Google &quot;lion and lamb&quot; and church, statue, ornament, verse, etc. </p>

<p>As a divinity student, this Bible change should be of great interest to you.</p>
