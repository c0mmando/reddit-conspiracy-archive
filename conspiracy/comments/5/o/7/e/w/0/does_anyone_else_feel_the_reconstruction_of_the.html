       This is a great observation, one I've thought about previously. The reconstruction was done by the same company that did the WTC, Turner Construction.

       Are our representatives REALLY that stupid, though? Are a majority of them REALLY unaware that 9/11 was an inside job? Or might they all escape beforehand through the underground passageways and use a video to make us think they're there before they all get "massacred"?
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, I have had that feeling. Plus we've got the predictive programming for the Capitol being destroyed in "Live Free or Die Hard" (a film franchise that already teased us with the "robbery of the century" under the cover of downtown Manhattan terrorist attack in "Die Hard with a Vengeance") and "Batman v. Superman," two movies loaded with CIA Hollywood pawns before and behind the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       So sure. It could happen. Hopefully somebody's telling the representatives what's up. Then again, how many of them would we miss if that happened?

       Well this comment did lead me down the rabbit hole all the way to the Denver airport, and now I return with even more concern. I feel too many politicians fear of what trump may reveal, but I also don't fully trust our intelligence agencies to look into the Capitol, I saw something earlier how no one is allowed inside of course it makes sense to prevent others from going in, saw someone on Twitter say that a stash of guns were found still don't have a source though. It's really hard to find info about this other than what you have provided. I felt the Capitol was being built for Hillary since a woman is what they feel will usher in whatever the fuck it is they are trying to usher in, I just fear of them setting up something terrible.

       I'd like to see a few links from you about what you write here.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does Denver Airport play into this? Because CIA is moving HQ from Langley to Colorado?
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is allowed to go where? In the Capitol?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that they thought Clinton was their gal. The very fact they were unable to pull that off should give you pause about how effective the CIA actual is anymore.

       As a former Divinity student, I can assure you it was never "the lion" laying down with "the lamb." Both lion and lamb are symbols of the church--the Lion representing Christ, the lamb representing believers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wolf and lamb is what Isaiah always read. And I tell you that as a guy who believes in The Mandela Effect. Didn't until the "Moonraker" chick lost her braces, but now I do.

       On this one in particular there is a ton of residual evidence. More than exists for the Moonraker change even. Just Google "lion and lamb" and church, statue, ornament, verse, etc.

       If you get to experience a flip flop, you'll know 100% that something weird is happening. I've watched the Flintstones, Tidy Cats, and Thinker all flop back and forth. It's incredible.

       Imagine waking up tomorrow and Dolly's braces are back and everyone is saying "she's always had braces" and every comment and thread about her missing braces has disappeared. And nobody believes that there was a Dolly without braces. Wild.

       Frankly, there isn't a lot we can do against a Deep State action like that. There are indirect actions, like cutting the power and sewage to all of the intelligence agencies that are spying on us... but that would be illegal. And illegal is bad.

       Maybe we should set aside one day every year where we just let all of our aggression and violence out.  We could make all crime legal for just that one day, and everyone could get all the bad energy out and society would function properly the rest of the time.  We just need a cool name for it...

       on an opposite opinion they are very old buildings with tremendous amount of upkeep. i work within eye distance to the capital building and while i agree the work that was done did seem to take a looooong time I'm not entirely sure they would actually go through with something like that here in dc....but then again after 9/11 anythings possible

       The reconstruction there has been going on for a long time now. I don't think it has anything necessarily to do with any inauguration. When they started it, I'm sure that everyone involved in the project was figuring Clinton was 100% going to be the next president anyway.

       Well this comment did lead me down the rabbit hole all the way to the Denver airport, and now I return with even more concern. I feel too many politicians fear of what trump may reveal, but I also don't fully trust our intelligence agencies to look into the Capitol, I saw something earlier how no one is allowed inside of course it makes sense to prevent others from going in, saw someone on Twitter say that a stash of guns were found still don't have a source though. It's really hard to find info about this other than what you have provided. I felt the Capitol was being built for Hillary since a woman is what they feel will usher in whatever the fuck it is they are trying to usher in, I just fear of them setting up something terrible.
