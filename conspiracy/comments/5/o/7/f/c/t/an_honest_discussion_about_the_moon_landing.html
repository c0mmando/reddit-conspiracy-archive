      <p>
       All these old newspaper articles popping up about the moon landing have got me thinking about the undercurrent of nationalism which has been seemingly forgotten over the past 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, when we think or talk of the moon landing, we tend to use terms like "man walks on moon" and "one small step for man" and hardly anyone will ever directly reference the "American" aspect of the event that was so obviously so present at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I can never be completely comfortable saying I 'believe' in the moon landing, despite the overwhelming sentiment in favor of it happening.  Everyone seems to conveniently forgot just how much of a motive the USA had when it came to getting to the moon ahead of the Soviet Union.  The Space Race has been pushed into the deepest parts of the closet as if that should make us all forget about the context of the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did we achieve such a highly improbable landing/take off when nothing like it had ever been done before?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is that after such a small number of missions, we have never once been back?
      </p>
      <p>
       Around the same time we claimed to put men on the moon the USA also claimed to put a manned submersible on the bottom of the Mariana Trench, a feat that was never repeated for over 50 years.  Both of these events are completely possible, anything is, but the fact that they both happened at such a highly advantageous time makes me question the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else have any thoughts about the moon landing that don't deal with a bunch of archaic 'evidence'?  I'm just looking for some interesting points of view.

       I've always been skeptical about the moon landing, but whatever. It's not worth arguing about. I am always interested in space stuff though and I saw recently two videos done by NASA talking about the Van Allen belts and how until we figure out how to get past them we'll never get farther than orbiting the Earth. I was like wtf did y'all forget you told us you went to the moon several times already? lol

       ,  our persona in chief here today, I guess we know for sure there are no valuable minerals there and that it isn't a vantage point  or easy launch position for  more distant targets. It's just a rock.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of rock matters but I'm sure we got a sample of every mineral available there and found it worthless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real estate value adage  that what matters in defining value for property is Location, Location, and Location holds true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alaska was once thought worthless. It was sneered at and  called Sewards Icebox I think they found oil there a bit later.
      </p>
      <p>
       The south Florida swamp land was also thought worthless and joked about endlessly on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show until Bob Graham dug holes in it, sold the rock  he dredged up for a dollar a ton profit (about a million dollars worth) and was left with south Florida, lake front, property . That laughable, worthless  place is now called Miami Lakes and is the home of millionaires. Poor guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the moon is worthless I'm calling your judgement lame to missing.

       I see where you're coming from. There are plenty of good reasons that we had to fake the moon landings, but no evidence for actually doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless theres concrete evidence to support that we actually didn't go to the moon besides whats been debunked, then we obviously have to give the US the benefit of the doubt.

       I've been seeing this a lot recently:
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is real if it can't be disproven as long as it's "official"

       Is that just successful brainwashing, or is this an actively pushed narrative recently?

       You should check out the documentary 'Room 237' which posits that Stanley Kubrick helped stage the moon landing and hid clues about it in his film, 'The Shining.'
      </p>
      <p>
       When I first heard that idea I thought it was absurd of course but Kubrick is well known for layering his films with symbolism and hidden meaning. And the filmmakers make some very compelling points!

       It's a great watch whether you take it seriously or not.

       Lots of evidence. My most recent favorite is Neil Armstrong's 25th anniversary speech in 1994 at the White House. He neatly avoids ever saying "moon landing" the entire speech. The entire speech! It's "Apollo this" and "Apollo that". The "Apollo mission", as if the goal was to prevent the USSR from gaining a military advantage on the moon and that's how he justifies his participation in his own mind.

       Every single problem that the "hoaxers" have identified can be explained by physics/math.

       Give me one specific question, ex: "how did they get through the radiation belt?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And I will give you the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The landings happened. The hoax is a disinformation campaign, potentially started by the USSR and continued now by who know what agency and a bunch of people who are not able to research critically to answer their own questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really hate doing this because invariably the people who as questions are incapable of being specific and throw around a bunch of accusations.

       How far beyond Earth's surface do you have to get before you can just "coast" the rest of the way to the moon? That is the prevailing explanation for how they made it there with so little fuel, as I understand it.

       Alright, that's clearly bullshit, but here's another. How did they control their speed upon re-entry to Earth's atmosphere after being pulled by gravity for over 200,000 miles? They certainly had very little fuel at this point in the trip.

       How can you call that bullshit? It's orbital mechanics! Literally how orbits work.
      </p>
      <p>
       They only needed to get off the moon and raise the lowest point of their resulting Earth orbit to a point where the heat shielding of the command module would allow atmospheric reentry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The command module had an eccentric center of gravity, that allowed them to "steer" the descent into the atmosphere by rolling, this also bled off velocity.

       Perhaps you can enlarge on why the space shuttle program never went much more than 400km above the earth- 1/1000 the distance to the moon! As a kid the shuttle never impressed me. After "going to the moon" the best we could do was orbit the earth a few times?

       In space, there's no atmosphere to limit your maximum falling ("terminal") velocity like there is on earth. So if you are being pulled into Earth's gravity from over 200,000 miles away, you're going to accelerate to an insane velocity before reaching Earth's atmosphere unless you do something to counteract it,
       <strong>
        something like reverse thrust.
       </strong>
       There's simply no other way around it. If you fall to the side of the earth, then per Kepler's law you'll end up right back at the height of the moon after "slingshotting" around earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the difference between jumping off the diving board at the community pool (re-entering from LEO) and jumping off the golden gate bridge (falling from the moon). The atmosphere has resistance just like a body of water does, and it'll mess you up bad if you hit it too hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that parachutes don't work without atmosphere either. So your mission is to slow yourself down before you reach it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did some searching before I asked you this and no one had bothered to try to explain how they got back without any fuel.

       The return orbit brought them back to the earth, they used the atmosphere to slow down.

       Sorry I responded to your other question re orbits, didn't see this one until just now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're basically right, in space there is no terminal velocity per se, but there is a maximum velocity that is determined by position in orbit. A spacecraft in a highly elliptical orbit will travel fastest at the lowest altitude and slowest at the highest altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apollo was no different, and the craft accelerated due to gravity until entering the Earth's atmosphere. It was then slowed down just as a bullet is slowed down by water, compare that to a bullet traveling in air and I think you will understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypersonic flight isn't easy because the drag/friction with the air causes surfaces to get extremely hot. If you watch the Orion re-entry vid, there's a shot showing the ionizing air as the spacecraft returns to Earth. Really cool to watch.

       Just on the point of never having returned. Is there much reason for people to walk on the moon? It's quite desolate and I feel like rovers can do everything we need without risking lives/health and wasting dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The space program doesn't get the proportion of funding it used to and it's just way more lucrative to explore Mars which could be colonized vs the moon which at best will be a depot.

       Planted a flag, gathered moon rock samples, vague "sciency stuff".
Colonizing isn't easy. We have no real idea what effects less-than-Earth gravity has on the human body. Getting supplies there (such as oxygen [or lithium, I think they use, to change CO2 into O2], food supplies, water, etc, etc) is a monumental task. Building a moon base is extremely difficult. Every pound of material they need to send up there requires an insane amount of fuel. 
Interestlingly, they're thinking about simply sending up robots equiped with 3D printers, and using moon rocks and dust to 3D print the building equipment on site, rather than send up literal tons of building supplies. The problem with this however is how fine the dust is; they believe that it's too fine to actually work with modern technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason we haven't been back, I believe, has to do with the van Allen radiation belts. In the 70's, health and safety wasn't the biggest concern, and the astronauts, knowing the risk, decided to go up anyway. Now, with so much government oversite, it's not really feasible. There's no clear cut way to bypass these radiation belts, unless we're launching the rockets from the poles. That however is also extremely difficult. The best place to launch rockets into space is the equater -- you get some assistance from the earth's rotation (this is why most of American rocket launches are launched from Florida; initially NASA wanted to launch from Nicaragua, but the region was deemed too politically unstable). You would get no assitance from the earth's rotation at the poles, which would require even more fuel. [Perhaps the real reason they won't launch from the poles is because there's actually a giant hole there leading to the center of the earth, perhaps full of Nazis -- currently my favorite outlandish conspiracy. Not mocking, mostly good natured joking.]
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure the exact objectives of the moon missions, but I'm sure some quick googling could tell you (at least "officially") what the objectives were.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why not have the camera on the ship, I think seeing the lander launch off of the moon is a fantastic shot, although that's my opinion. I agree, I think there should also have been a shot from the ship so that you can see the entire moon. That too would have been kick-ass. Perhaps there was, but it got "lost" with all the other tapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       That, by the way, is the most suspicious aspect of the moon landings, at least in my view. Although, people are stupid, and people lose things, so maybe it's just that.

       People that talk about "rocketing through" the Van Allen always neglect to consider the insane amount of fuel that that would take. The Saturn V rocket had about the same amount of fuel as it takes to get into low Earth orbit, or about 400 miles above the earth. The moon is 234,000 miles away at minimum, and about 200,000 of those miles are going to be spent fighting Earth's gravity. The "slingshot" theory actually makes no sense, you can't create energy out of nothing. No matter what you do to make the route more efficient, you have to expend Energy the entire way there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And speaking of Earth's gravity, how do you suppose they fought Earth's gravity to re-enter the atmosphere after effectively falling over 200,000 miles, with no atmosphere to limit them to a "terminal velocity"? They certainly had only ounces of fuel left at this point, what slowed them down? I've got a hunch that a parachute isn't gonna cut it in this case.

       Well parachutes slowed them down.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't so much "rocket through" the van Allen belt, so much as accept that the risk was there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sling-shot theory actually does make sense, I'm just not versed enough to explain it:/ Essentially, rather than go straight through, they "orbit" the earth. The same way the moon does (the moon is actually going further away from us, just not very much). So it's not creating energy, so much as they're inertia to their advantage.

       It's not that you're not well enough versed in physics to explain it, you've just been told that it makes sense and accepted it as the truth. I actually do understand physics, and I can explain to you why it doesn't work. Even if you orbit the earth the entire way and gradually expand your orbit to eventually meet up with the moon, you still have to spend energy to reach higher levels of orbit. It's a basic law of physics, you must have action for re-action. You have to generate kinetic energy by spending fuel to reach higher levels of potential energy against to earth's gravity.

       I mean I understand physics (I was briefly a physics major in school, though not astro), I'm just a bit too lazy to explain it properly and succinctly. I wasn't trying to say they spent NO energy, just that they didn't need a bunch extra. Of course they need energy to move out of orbit. I'm also unaware of the "rocket through" narrative, so I wasn't trying to make it. If that's actually the official narrative, then my reasoning is moot, or at least, they would need quite a bit extra energy. All this being said, they did have quite a bit of fuel on those rockets... I'm not sure. I've flip-flopped on this conspiracy theory for years. The motives certainly are there. Personally, I'm more of a mind that they made it, but found something that the public shouldn't know about. Really, neither of us are in any position to definitively claim anything.

       Man, I remember when I was in school watching the Bill Nye show.  He was actually explaining that it was impossible for us to get into space because of the van allen belts.  But I can no longer find this clip.  In fact, i've even seen Nye on television within the last few years trying to convince people of the opposite theory.  Very interesting.  I remember the clip like it was yesterday.  It might've like late 90s to early 00s.

       You seem to have missed the point I was trying to make. In space, there's no atmosphere to limit your maximum falling ("terminal") velocity like there is on earth. So if you are being pulled into Earth's gravity from over 200,000 miles away, you're going to reach an insane velocity before reaching Earth's atmosphere unless you do something to counteract it, something like reverse thrust. There's simply no other way around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine the difference between jumping off the diving board at the community pool (re-entering from LEO) and jumping off the golden gate bridge (falling from the moon). The atmosphere has resistance just like a body of water does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that parachutes don't work without atmosphere either. So your mission is to slow yourself down before you reach it.

       And what about that 238k number: Is this the constant distance?  Does it get closer at certain times during the cycle?  How can we possibly know how far the sun is when we can't even directly look at it?  How is that distance calculated?  Part of me wants all this to be fake, honestly.

       234k, the number that I used, is supposedly the minimum distance, 237k is the average distance. Perhaps not so coincidentally, room 237 is where the characters in Kubrick's The Shining see imaginary things.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can measure the distance of the moon by bouncing a laser off it and measuring the time difference. "Debunkers" love to cite that as proof we went there and left mirrors for that very purpose, but in reality you can bounce a laser off the bare surface of the moon, as they were doing long before Apollo 11.

       That camera was located on the Rover and was remote controlled from Earth.  However there would have been a 2 minute delay from the Earth to the Moon so they would not have been able to follow the launch of the LEM.
      </p>
      <p>
       The launch is also suspect. The top portion of the LEM separates from the bottom section with explosive bolts before the Ascent Module fires the rocket. Watch how it jerks upwards instead of generating velocity when the rocket fires. There is also no where for the rocket exhaust to vent.

       In the 1960s, white men still had balls. That's the short answer to how it was possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The longer answer is that space can be used for military purposes. If you knew the ways, it would curl your hair, or straighten it out, depending on your race. A bombardment from space by
       <em>
        rocks
       </em>
       (yes, that's right, just rocks) could utterly devastate a country in a way that nuclear warheads could not easily accomplish -- and without radiation afterwards. This could be done from a base on the moon, with an electric mass launcher, which would work really well in the vacuum of the moon. All you would need to do is jacket the rocks with metal. Or, if the rocks were mainly iron ore, you might not even need a jacket.
      </p>
      <p>
       A reference for you -- read Robert A. Heinlein's
       <em>
        The Moon is a Harsh Mistress
       </em>
       . It will open your eyes as to why the US government was in such a frenzy to get to the moon first.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it happened, the USSR fell behind in space exploration, the leaders of America decided they were not a threat, treaties were signed making space a non-military zone, and it was decided that the money going to NASA could be better spent buying cheesies and grape drink for millions of black inner city citizens disinclined to work for a living.

       Men had balls? Maybe so, but they also:
Needed to navigate through space with a computer that had the processing power of a pocket calculator
Needed to land a lunar module that was never ever successfully landed in training
Needed to wear a moon suit that had to be 100% airtight and could not leak from any joint, seam or seal
Needed to survive in a lunar module that didnt have an airlock
Needed to wear space gloves that once pressurised would make it utterly impossible to use their fingers to grip anything
Needed to take off from the moon and dock with an orbiting command module... that always gets me. How difficult would it be to know where that module is? What 60s space instruments did they use to locate and rendezvous with the module? What if they both ended up in orbit a "mere" 1000km apart? As far as I can find, you can NOT get information on how that rendezvous could ever be possible!

       Then realize almost all of the Apollo astronauts got cataracts from radiation exposure.

       It's not that you're not well enough versed in physics to explain it, you've just been told that it makes sense and accepted it as the truth. I actually do understand physics, and I can explain to you why it doesn't work. Even if you orbit the earth the entire way and gradually expand your orbit to eventually meet up with the moon, you still have to spend energy to reach higher levels of orbit. It's a basic law of physics, you must have action for re-action. You have to generate kinetic energy by spending fuel to reach higher levels of potential energy against to earth's gravity.

       You seem to have missed the point I was trying to make. In space, there's no atmosphere to limit your maximum falling ("terminal") velocity like there is on earth. So if you are being pulled into Earth's gravity from over 200,000 miles away, you're going to reach an insane velocity before reaching Earth's atmosphere unless you do something to counteract it, something like reverse thrust. There's simply no other way around it.
      </p>

       Imagine the difference between jumping off the diving board at the community pool (re-entering from LEO) and jumping off the golden gate bridge (falling from the moon). The atmosphere has resistance just like a body of water does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that parachutes don't work without atmosphere either. So your mission is to slow yourself down before you reach it.
