    <div class="md"><p>I have no love for Soros and I don&#39;t want to defend him but I think you&#39;re jumping a bit far. There&#39;s no reason to suggest he sold his own people for any other reason than to not get caught himself. I don&#39;t know if he sold out anyone but Jews, but I don&#39;t think that could be proved either way at this point. Regardless, there&#39;s no way, based on these actions, to say he&#39;s a Nazi sympathiser or anti-semetic. At most, you could accuse him of pure selfishness for the sake of survival. I don&#39;t believe for a second that most people wouldn&#39;t do the same in similar circumstances. Add to that that he was a child at the time. He totally should have fought the Nazi regime, right, but he didn&#39;t so he must be an anti-semetic Nazi sympathiser.</p>

<p>But this is not the issue. These aren&#39;t the reasons he&#39;s disliked. His actions in modern times are the concern. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was so impressed by the cited sources here, but I realize that was just a ruse to look more official. If you read the cited links, there&#39;s nothing there. </p>

<p>Yes, a group of Baptist missionaries went to Haiti to &quot;rescue&quot; some orphans. If you read the Wikipedia article, it&#39;s an almost comical attempt to execute God&#39;s will and save these kids. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s nothing tying them to Clinton. The email is a copy of a State Department document, that is a copy of a press release published on the Baptist church&#39;s website. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if OP is purposefully distorting the facts for some purpose, or just can&#39;t see the jumbled mess he&#39;s pieced together. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to sound rude, but you have to be really obtuse to think there&#39;s nothing there. We know that this human trafficking occurred (and that many of these kids still had parents), and I don&#39;t know how you could be dismissive of that saying it was just Baptists rescuing them. This is how human trafficking works. Use the veil of missionary work or some other cause, which gives you easier access and a better defense if you&#39;re caught. </p>

<p>And please don&#39;t reference Wikipedia, especially for a politically charged topic. Their manipulation of facts is well-known, so at the very least use whatever sources they are citing.</p>

<p>You accuse the OP of distorting the facts, but it feels like you&#39;re trying to do the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your message wasn&#39;t very rude, really. Just the first sentence. So if you really want to avoid that in the future, maybe try to engage with people assuming the best of them. Or at least fake it by removing personal attacks. </p>

<p>First of all, I read the Wikipedia article because that was the first document cited by OP. You can read it also by clicking on cite [1]</p>

<p>Do you agree that in this instance I wasn&#39;t being obtuse by referencing it? </p>

<p>Second, the reason I accused OP of distorting the facts is because he cites sources 2, 3, 4, and 5 claiming Clinton flew to Haiti trying to free Silsby. But I read all of them and none of them came close to doing that. #3 linked to a document saying they found the connection to Clinton, but I read that two and it didn&#39;t mention any connection at all. If I missed something, do link to it and post a quote. I spent s bit of time looking and couldn&#39;t find anything. </p>

<p>Other than the Wikipedia article, which only quotes cited sources, I found this report about Silsby, which quotes her former employee (who sued her for failure to pay wages) interesting:
<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-laura-silsby/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-laura-silsby/</a></p>

<p>I also read this entire article about Hilary Clinton&#39;s experiences in Haiti:
<a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/us/politics/hillary-clinton-haiti.html">https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/us/politics/hillary-clinton-haiti.html</a></p>

<p>This is a very detailed investigation with a vast amount of negative coverage for Clinton, spanning 40+ years of involvement in Haiti. It&#39;s really damning and portrays her as an ineffective leader. There&#39;s no reason an involvement in Silsby&#39;s case would be excluded from something like this. </p>

<p>Anyways, I just wish we had people working together here to get to the truth. There&#39;s enough evil in this world that we don&#39;t need to bend over backwards to fabricate things. And I love a good conspiracy theory as much as the next person, but as a group we should hold each other accountable and expect a higher degree of accuracy from posts. </p>

<p>I definitely don&#39;t want that either. I feel like we&#39;re in this transition period where we all have access to so much information, and the means to distribute our own information. But as content producers and consumers, our skills haven&#39;t caught up with our capabilities. Hopefully all this murky information is just temporary and we&#39;ll evolve better skills and tools to separate out the facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like that the moles think that we don&#39;t notice their presence. Its one thing to challenge an idea to refine the quality of the discussion but some of them are just here to shit on any instance of compelling dissent. When a post makes front-page and it contains well articulated reasons to support a formal investigation, they descend on it like firemen coming down a brass pole. The best is when they pretend to be crazies and post a bunch of nonsense to discredit the sub. Its like somebody taught psych 101 to a bunch of meat head jocks and they think they&#39;re fooling everyone with their master role playing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there hasn&#39;t been any compelling dissent or well articulated reasons. There has only been emails about cheese pizza, comparisons of symbols, links to social networking sites offered as credible evidence, random pictures of anonymous children and unidentifiable adults, endless speculation and hypothesizing and still not one example of a credible source substantiating any of this fantastic story. Having failed to substantiate this story, you accuse me of being mole whatever that means. Offering compelling evidence that it&#39;s true would go much further for your agenda then expressing your bizarre paranoia about internet miles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there isn&#39;t enough evidence to convict at this moment but don&#39;t you dare stand there and brush off his pedo artwork as inconsequential. People have been convicted on mounds of circumstantial evidence that when each peace is singled out by a sleazy defense attorney, can be argued to be inconsequential, but when you put it all together, juries see through the bullshit when there&#39;s too much coincidence to ignore. You argument would be sensible if you were arguing against any particular punishment, but you&#39;re arguing against a lawful investigation in light of some pretty compelling connections that may well turn out to be nonsense, but what kind of monsters would we be if there was something to it and those kids never get justice? It&#39;s worth a look, if the look is reasonable. I see no legitimate denial of that when the man&#39;s walls were plastered with pictures of children in their underwear in vulnerable positions. I respect any attempt to prevent a witch hunt. I felt the same way until I saw those paintings. This ain&#39;t no witch hunt. This fucker has it coming if he&#39;s going to put up pictures like that and post them all over twitter. Don&#39;t defend a scumbag just to be a contrarian either because then you&#39;re just enabling a monster. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I can&#39;t verify that podesta has any such art. When I search it i get only a few fringe sites that offer no proof that the pictures are podestas. I certainly find no evidence that he has any illegal art. When I search it all I find are a few of these conspiracy sites that are also pushing other very crazy conspiracies. So until we prove that podesta has illegal images of children, there can be no investigation. I can&#39;t even find proof that any of this art is his. Do you have a link to a credible source that substantiates any of this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just checked my references and the article that previously published the disturbing paintings like <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/File:Sm-minors.jpg">this</a> one and <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/images/a/ac/Biljana_Strung_Up_Boy.jpg">this</a> one, claiming that Podesta owned those pieces, is now a dead link.  </p>

<p><a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">Here</a> is a link to a 2015 article in which he names, Biljana Djurdjevic, the artist of the above disturbing paintings as one of his favorite artists. However, it&#39;s worth mentioning that the artist doesn&#39;t paint dead eyed children in their underwear exclusively. Other articles now show the <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/images/0/01/Biljana_Djurdjevic_Seemingly_Deceased_Girls_in_Swamp.jpeg">works</a> displayed in his home to be of similarly haunting paintings of young girls who appear to be deceased and partially obscured in foliage; disturbingly suggestive, but fully clothed. I&#39;m not one to censor art so in lieu of my original source being available, and because I personally support the exposure of truth, whatever it may be, I concede that it&#39;s not reasonable to investigate Podesta purely based on his unsavory taste in art when there&#39;s plausible deniability that he can say that he finds those works compelling on a more abstract level than pedophilia.  </p>

<p>However, James Alefantis aka Jimmy Comet, has posted more than enough disturbing material to his twitter account (which has since been deleted but can be viewed in archive) to warrant a basic investigation into his business and personal life. While someone can claim that his posts like <a href="https://www.trigtent.com/sites/default/files/u2/tapetable.png">this</a> and <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/images/5/5b/Girls.jpg">this</a> (worth mentioning that Comet Pizza would be closed at night) or that the band that features graphics like <a href="http://heavybreathing.net/gfx/trans.gif">this</a> on their website performs  shows at Comet Pizza&#39;s private parties, can be written off as circumstantial evidence of a dark but legal sense of humor or appreciation for sexually suggestive avant garde stylism, at some point, the circumstantial evidence may not be the same thing as a smoking gun, but again, we&#39;re talking about citing the probable cause to investigate the potential illegal endangerment of children in an organized establishment with proven ties to people of great legal influence and power. Even if the counter argument that people like you represent, is motivated by a desire for fairness and avoiding political witch hunts, the authorities do not and should not require a smoking gun just to initiate an investigation. More often than not, investigations are initiated because of community complaints and reports that, until followed up on, are purely hearsay. Sometimes that hearsay turns out to be true, sometimes it doesn&#39;t but that&#39;s why we have investigators. When someone like this, operates a family restaurant and posts garbage like that, does it mean that they are definitely a pedo and should be tried in the public and run out of business to give a moral bruise on the democratic donkey&#39;s eye? Of course not. It does however mean that the careless public advertisement of Comet Pizza&#39;s disturbing comments and taste in art and music that features clearly suggestive imagery of children holding phalluses to their mouth and babies bent over with come-hither smirks and little girls taped to a table and patrons posting drawings of penises with pizza shaped ejaculate on their twitter page means, that in the even remote chance that there&#39;s something to these child endangerment and molestation charges against them by a sizeable public outcry, paranoid and irrational or not, they should at a minimum answer to these concerns. Because if they are innocent, there is no reason not to open their doors and welcome an investigation if it is conducted according to the law. I can&#39;t think of a single reason not to open a case as long as it&#39;s managed in a fair, professional and objective way and their rights are respected. They have a brand and a business to protect and no one should damage their livelihood without cause, but as a father and humanitarian, I think it&#39;s more important to prioritize the risk to children over the risk to the parties involved having their busy schedules imposed upon with visits from the authorities. It&#39;s as simple as that. </p>

<p>George Webb also makes unsubstantiated statements like his claim that NYPD and the fbi were going to indict hillary (<a href="http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/">http://truepundit.com/breaking-bombshell-nypd-blows-whistle-on-new-hillary-emails-money-laundering-sex-crimes-with-children-child-exploitation-pay-to-play-perjury/</a>). The article was before the election and she wasn&#39;t locked up even though they said she was going to be locked up before november 8 . He is using that claim even though its untrue and is still using the claim now. Also he claims to bring up mainstream media first he brings up this claim first in his video</p>

<p>Because there&#39;s literally no basis for that whatsoever. I haven&#39;t said anything at all about Trump and I&#39;ve commented on their sub maybe 5 times total. I&#39;ve never seen evidence of t_d paying people to shill like Correct The Record either. Yeah I think it makes sense to be cautious since they swarmed the ever loving shit out of this website and demonstrated the efficacy of their social media manipulation to all their friends.</p>

<p>But who knows, maybe it&#39;s all a coincidence. All these 5 month old accounts with 500k karma all from politics/worldnews/conspiracy. The same lines being repeated over and over and over. The 2-3+ year old accounts with everything deleted up until last year.</p>

<p><em>Not a single chance</em> there are still people being paid to do damage control for these high level democrats right friend?</p>

<p>Laura Silsby, child trafficker posing as a Idahoan missionary[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She&#39;s a Idahoan missionary who was convicted of trafficking. Slight difference. As far as I&#39;m concerned, her actions are explained by religious zeal overcoming her regard for the law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laura Silsby was represented by a lawyer Jorge Puello who himself had been previously convicted of child-running in latin america in 2004.[ibid]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no evidence that Jorge represented Silsby. <em>&quot;Two days after they were arrested on Jan. 29 while attempting to take 33 children across the border from Haiti into the Dominican Republic, Mr. Puello called up an Idaho church where five of the 10 Americans attend, offering pro bono legal services. Two relatives called him back and accepted, and Mr. Puello then began acting as the group’s lawyer, even though he lacked a law degree. Since his background has emerged, some of the detainees have sought to distance themselves from the man.&quot;</em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/world/americas/16haiti.html">source</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>REDDITOR discovered the Clinton-Silsby connection. Hillary flew down to negotiate Silsby&#39;s release, as revealed in Wikileaks&#39; emails.[2][3][4][5]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a whopper. There is <strong>no evidence that Clinton flew to Haiti to negotiate Silsby&#39;s release.</strong> Your own links do not support this claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An investigative reporter, Monica Petersen, who was investigating the clinton made textile factory and human trafficking in Haiti ended up dead[6][7].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe she was actually investigating a mine owned by Hillary&#39;s brother, but otherwise that is factual.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Huma Abedin was funnelling emails about Silsby&#39;s Haitian enterprise to Hillary as far back as 2001[8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Funneling,&quot; sounds so surreptitious. There are a handful of emails about the work that Silsby&#39;s church was doing (not about Silsby herself). This is not suspicious, considering that the Clinton foundation was ostensibly doing charity work in Haiti.</p>

<p>Lying to the parents about where the kids are going, lying about what kids you have, and trying to do it without proper documentation.  Those do not paint a pretty picture as far as intent goes.</p>

<p>The troubling part about this for me, is how everyone seems to quick and willing to explain away all behavior.   We all understand that one thing being true doesn&#39;t make everything else true, but what we all want is this to be investigated honest</p>

<p>the Haitian justice system—prodded in part by President Clinton’s
diplomatic efforts on behalf of the missionaries
—determined that
none of the missionaries were guilty of illegal activities, except the leader
Laura Silsby, who faced a lesser charge of organizing illegal travel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My argument is that I could find no evidence that he FLEW to Haiti at all to broker their release.

<blockquote>
<p>Jorge Puello: In the days following the group&#39;s initial arrest, Dominican Jorge Puello took on the role of legal advisor. Puello later acknowledged that he is under investigation for sex trafficking in El Salvador and wanted in the United States for smuggling people across the Canada–US border. Puello was incarcerated for short terms in both Canada and the US. [25] [26] He was arrested in the Dominican Republic on March 18.[27] On August 18, 2010, the Dominican Supreme Court authorized Puello&#39;s extradition to the United States where he was sentenced to 37 months of prison in June 2011.[28][29]</p>

<p>Child Trafficking Major Concern After Quake</p>

<p>Thousands Of Children Left Without Parents</p>

<p>By Mike Paluska, CBS Atlanta Reporter</p>

<p>POSTED: 4:58 pm EST January 14, 2010</p>

<p>UPDATED: 5:28 pm EST January 14, 2010</p>

<p>ATLANTA -- UNICEF and international adoption agencies said getting children into safe zones is a top priority after the
devastating earthquake in Haiti.</p>

<p>The massive magnitude 7.0 earthquake that hit the island of Hispaniola has left thousands of children without parents.</p>

<p>Before the quake even hit UNICEF statistics from 2007 show there were 380,000 orphans already in Haiti.</p>

<p>&quot;There are so many children that are in desperate need of help that&#39;s what we are here to do to keep them alive and get</p>

<p>them the nutrients they need and clean water. It becomes the one place of stability for the kids where they have people
UNICEF workers they can relate to they have educational material so they can start back with school,&quot; said Alissa</p>

<pre><code>  UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05772708 Date: 08/31/2015
</code></pre>

<p>Silverman, deputy director for UNICEF in the southeast region. &quot;UNICEF is tracing family members and caring for</p>

<p>children orphaned by the disaster to protect them from harm or exploitation.&quot;</p>

<p>The number of children on the island is staggering. Forty-six percent of Haiti&#39;s population (nearly 10 million) is under the
age of 18, more than half of the population is under 21. Prior to the earthquake, four of every 10 children lived in homes</p>

<p>with mud floors or severely overcrowded conditions.</p>

<p>&quot;My first concern is who is with the kids how many of our nannies our ok and who is watching the kids and then all the
kids on the streets,&quot; said Chareyl Moyes, the program manager for Wasatch International Adoption. Moyes works with a</p>

<p>number of different agencies and orphanages in Haiti. She said early reports about how much damage they suffered are
good.</p>

<p>&quot;But, there is going to be a concern about child trafficking so both Haitian and the United States governments are going</p>

<p>to be careful about forging ahead with new adoptions. The need is going to be great,&quot; Moyes said.</p>

<p>A lot of families in the U.S. according to a number of international adoption agencies across the country said some
people were at the very end of the process to adopt a child from Haiti. &quot;Now, it will set everyone back,&quot; Moyes said.</p>

<p>Even though child trafficking is a major concern for Moyes she worries about the immediate help children need trapped</p>

<p>in the rubble from a country in ruins. &quot;How long will that child survive without somebody rescuing them,&quot; Moyes said.</p>

<p>An emergency response team from Westport&#39;s Save the Children successfully reached Haiti today and worked quickly</p>

<p>with staff already on the ground to organize the distribution of tents, medicine, and toiletries to children and families in
desperate need, the charity said.</p>

<p>&quot;Save the Children is extremely concerned about the well-being of children in Haiti at this critical moment and we are
doing everything we can to quickly get relief supplies to those who need it most,&quot; said Charles MacCormack, president</p>

<p>and CEO of Save the Children, in a news release.</p>

<p>&quot;Our staff on the ground is pulling out all the stops to overcome hurdles like blocked roads and unreliable access to the
airport.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is just the beginning of what will be a comprehensive five-year effort to build back better in Haiti. We are</p>

<p>dedicated to not only addressing the immediate needs of children and families, but to making sure they have a brighter
future ahead.&quot;</p>

<p>As someone in the anti-trafficking news of the disaster in Haiti has my mind rushing to worrying thoughts on how the
disaster will increase human trafficking in the country. Such a large scale disaster will undoubtedly leave thousands and
thousands of children, and their families, at an increased to be victimized by modern slavery.</p>

<p>Haiti&#39;s Restavek system still has a tight grip on the community, leaving some 300,000 children in the country enslaved as</p>

<p>domestic workers according to the UN. It is these children who will continue to anguish and suffer the most in the
shadows of the earthquake.</p>

<p>I bolded the parts that show you her child trafficking.</p>

<p>I assume she wanted them for herself /s</p>

<p>Huma Abedin was communicating via hundreds of emails going back to 2001 with Laura Silsby</p>

<p>what am I missing here?  I don&#39;t see a single email between Huma and Laura Silsby.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Huma Abedin was funnelling emails about Silsby&#39;s Haitian enterprise to Hillary as far back as 2001</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the wikileaks email in question is clearly referring to the haiti earthquake which happened on January 12th, 2010.  The earliest emails regarding Silsby appear to be from 2010, NOT 2001. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children&#x27;s_Refuge_case">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children&#39;s_Refuge_case</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hillary flew down to negotiate Silsby&#39;s release, as revealed in Wikileaks&#39; emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty sure it was Bill Clinton who negotiated for her, because he was already there.  But Hillary&#39;s involvement (as secretary of state) and Bill&#39;s (as a diplomat with close ties in Haiti, who was playing a large role in the disaster &quot;redevelopment&quot;) should not be controversial given the official explanation that they were attempting to save orphans from the streets.</p>

<p>I agree that it&#39;s a shady story.  Why are they just grabbing random kids off the streets?  Many of whom appeared to not be orphans...  But lets not misrepresent the facts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An investigative reporter, Monica Petersen, who was investigating the clinton made textile factory and human trafficking in Haiti ended up dead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where is the evidence that monica peterson was investing the Clinton Foundation?  I think this is almost certainly not true, officially.  Can you cite anyone close to her who makes that claim?</p>

<p>No definitive link besides her friend&#39;s speculations, but it is really odd the reddit search function is only turning up 5 or so threads considering when it happened there was at least 30 on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> alone.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true. And I don&#39;t think it would be unusual. The US often intervenes when its citizens have legal trouble abroad. But there&#39;s no evidence. Which completely contradicts the original post that claims that the Wikileaks emails prove that Hillary helped Silsby. That&#39;s a straight up lie. </p>

<p>I think the most likely explanation is that Silsby was overzealous- she probably believed that she was helping these children in some sick way. But I find it extremely unlikely that she had some plan to bring them back to the US to sell in sexual slavery to the elite. That&#39;s just another wild speculation. The only reason this theory has gotten any traction is because of the political angle. </p>

<p>I think one part of the story we havent touched was how she claimed they were all orphans, yet none of them were.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you seem like a reasonable guy. I don&#39;t mind discussing things like this when people have open minds. </p>

<p>Silsby is definitely a freak. Apparently, she took these children from their parents who gave them away willingly, hoping they would have a better life with the Americans. They were not orphans and they did not come from an orphanage. She deceived the other members of her group. The Wikipedia article and links are pretty interesting. </p>

<p>All her defenses to ignorance are undermined by her lies (that they were orphans, that she built an orphanage, they even doctored their birth records). No reasonable international adoption agency would think you could just take kids over a border the way she did. Then you look at her financial motive and it&#39;s amazing they agreed not to charge her. Evidently average Haitians were ticked off by it which let to the arrests in the first place but the Haitian people are used to taking a backseat to the interests of U.S. citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is misleading.  I&#39;m no shill, and I&#39;m very open to considering alternative theories and revisionist history, but I&#39;m familiar with this story, and the people involved did not &quot;kidnap&quot; children in the conventional sense of that term.</p>

<p>After the earthquake in Haiti, there was a ton of orphans.  There were unaccompanied minors everywhere, and international charity orgs were looking for ways to deal with the sudden several thousand percent increase in orphans.  One solution a lot of NGOs pursued was shipping the kids out of country to go to orphanages, adoption agencies, or government facilities in other countries.</p>

<p>Lots of charities were doing this, but if you think about suddenly orphaned children, they present special problems: very young ones don&#39;t even know their last name, their parents names, if their parents survived, etc.  Most children will have no documentation proving their identity, and if their house got leveled and mom&#39;s dead, you might never find this info.  So what do the charities do?  Only try to place children if you can prove their identity?  Or that their parents are dead?  Or do you just try to help everyone?</p>

<p>The arrests that happened over this issue were because NGOs were taking children out of the country without any documentation for the kids.  The NGOs were saying, &quot;hey, we&#39;re helping these kids&quot;, while the Haitian government was saying, &quot;you can&#39;t just take these kids and adopt them out when we don&#39;t even know their last names&quot;.  The NGOs kept doing it, so the government of Haiti, which had much bigger problems at the time, made arrests.</p>

<p>There were no laws about &quot;unlawfully transporting unidentified minor children out of the country for purposes of adoption&quot;, so they were charged with kidnapping.  <strong>This was not a case of charity workers snatching kids off the street for export, it was a case of NGOs trying to deal with the massive amount of newly orphaned children in Haiti, and the government trying to stop the massive outflows of people from Haiti post-earthquake.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now, you could argue that the NGOs behaved unethically, jumped the gun, were overzealous, or even acted without regard for the laws of the country in which they were operating.  However, I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s disingenuous, if not outright misleading, to characterize what these people were doing as &quot;kidnapping&quot; in the conventional sense of that word.  And to connect what these people did with wider issues of human trafficking and child sex abuse is a jump in logic that is supported by no evidence at all.</strong>  Given evidence, I&#39;d be willing to entertain the idea that these people acted recklessly, without accountability or regard for the law.  But the burden of proof for connecting these charges to &quot;international child sex rings&quot; or any kind of human trafficking has not been met, not even close, and would require a lot of evidence that just isn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>If anyone has any substantial evidence, I&#39;d love to see it, but as it stands, I think this post title is pretty misleading and inaccurate, especially since people tend to only read the headline and accept it uncritically, without investigating these claims further.  </p>

<p>r/conspiracy could be a great sub.  It has potential.  There are some smart, knowledgeable posters here.  But if you want to be taken seriously at all, you have to approach these things critically.  Your first instinct shouldn&#39;t be &quot;what evidence can I find to support the conclusion I want?&quot; but rather it should be &quot;can I disprove this claim or find evidence against it or a more plausible explanation?&quot;  Only after ruling out everything else should we start to consider the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; as an explanation, because often things are much more complicated than &quot;a bunch of rich powerful guys in a room decided to work together to influence outcomes of significant world events&quot;.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re alleging child sex trafficking, why wouldn&#39;t they take orphans then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering the havoc happening in Haiti at the time, they probably didn&#39;t know/care if they were orphans. The kids were probably wandering the streets and then convinced to follow the group, not knowing they were going to be kidnapped. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s reckless, no doubt, but where are the actual sex trafficking ties?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well what do you think most trafficked humans to 1st world countries end up doing? Certainly isn&#39;t labor. Sex is the most common among most kidnappers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you have a dead reporter and a lawyer who seemed to have similar issues, but wouldn&#39;t that make him knowledgeable on the subject at least?</p>

<p>Who are you referring to as him?</p>

<p>I understand that sex trafficking occurs there, but the articles clearly state that many groups were ushering these kids out to protect them from that. I guess you just don&#39;t buy that story? If you don&#39;t, then where are the sex trafficking connections in this case? Just charities taking kids out of disasters? Did the arrested have prior sex trafficking histories? </p>

<p>I see the lawyer being cited a lot, but it looks like that was just a guy trying to get a quick buck. Are there further ties between him and Silsby?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t take kids without asking &quot;where do you live?&quot; or &quot;where are your parents?&quot; though. And they certainly didn&#39;t illegally kidnap kids to a different country after being in communication with the SoS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it just a general observation about charities taking kids out of disasters? Did the arrested have prior sex trafficking histories? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, many charities are speculated to engage in this not just NGOs in Haiti. Disaster stricken countries where NGOs operate see a huge uptick in missing children. Taking children out of countries while being in communication with people like Huma who specified how much it would be to fly the children over is sketchy, at the very least.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not that I know of, I would argue that&#39;s a minor point of the story. Monica Peterson in combination of this story seals the deal for me. Read this article to get a hint of how Haiti is being used for trafficking in Monica&#39;s very suspicious death when investigating Hillary&#39;s brother&#39;s mining operation/The Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oneangrygamer.net/2016/12/washington-post-misinforms-readers-about-monica-petersen-pizzagate/18705/">http://www.oneangrygamer.net/2016/12/washington-post-misinforms-readers-about-monica-petersen-pizzagate/18705/</a></p>

<p>When you have a human trafficking investigator die after claiming she was about to expose the Clinton Foundation and with her mom and friends very suspicious about her suicide it&#39;s kinda serious. I combination with all of the other sketchy shit the Clintons have done in Haiti there&#39;s more than enough evidence to believe it.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t ask that, they actually knew and met the parents. They had the parents&#39; consent, in some cases.</p>

<p>How is Huma helping them sketchy? Hillary&#39;s career has focused on womens&#39; and childrens&#39; issues. What exactly is sketchy about an SoS aide communicating with a charity engaging in a relief mission involving kids. The emails don&#39;t shown very much, btw.</p>

<p>That article misconstrues quite a bit, I&#39;ll try to show how when I have time. I&#39;ll edit this post.</p>

<p>She&#39;s not an investigator, she was an intern. Let&#39;s be clear-she had little experience. How do you know she was going to expose Clinton? All it shows in that article is that she believes Clinton&#39;s brother is doing these things, but offers no evidence. You&#39;re basing that on her belief, without any corroborating evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is enough to be taken seriously. It seems like an <a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">egregious violation</a> to sweep in and try to take kids across the border for an adoption. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re right that there is no sex angle to these particular allegations. It sounds like she had a profit motive and there is no proof of a sex angle. Since she had some sort of U.S. operation one can presume she intended to adopt the kids to American families for $10,000. </p>

<p>But Silsby seems like the person who might be tempted to take $15,000 per kid without asking too many questions . . . </p>

<p>The evidence points to kidnapping right now, so who knows if it&#39;s for sex trafficking. It seems like the ringleader was hard up for cash and was going to have people pay $10,000 per kid so she probably hoped to sell/adopt them to &quot;nice&quot; homes in the U.S.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or if you wanted to know the truth, you could just, you know, Google it.  Or have the critical thinking skills to realize OP&#39;s links to &quot;FightTheNWO.biz&quot; don&#39;t qualify as legitimate, objective news, but apparently that&#39;s too much to ask from the people in this sub.  So ok, you got me, I did the work for you.  First, just to establish the basic humanitarian concern:</p>

<p>&quot;Aid workers expect that a massive spike in the number of orphans will create its own pressing humanitarian problem: <strong>should Haitian children be adopted by foreign families or stay in their home country? Jets are already arrivng at Haiti&#39;s main international airport ready to fill up with orphans for adoption overseas, raising fears of a free-for-all in which would-be parents can adopt without the usual safety checks.</strong></p>

<p>Planeloads of children have already left for the United States and the Netherlands and France, raising fears of fast-track adoptions like those following the Kashmir earthquake of 2005 and the previous year&#39;s Indian Ocean tsunami. A group of 33 Haiti children were expected to meet their adoptive French families yesterday, after being flown out of the capital, while another 55 landed in the US on Tuesday.</p>

<p>&quot;We are watching this with a great deal of discomfort,&quot; said Christopher de Bono, from the UN children&#39;s agency, Unicef. &quot;There are at least tens of thousands, potentially hundreds of thousands, of children in Port-au-Prince, in Haiti, who currently need urgent help. And they need that help in Haiti. &quot;They don&#39;t need to be plucked out of the country and taken away,&quot; he said. Aid agencies have reported a flood of phone calls from families hoping to adopt children, but cautioned against moving youngsters from the country before they can be registered to determine whether they have any surviving family members.</p>

<p>&quot;We remain focused on family unification and must be vigilant not to separate children from relatives in Haiti who are still alive but displaced, or to unknowingly assist criminals who traffic in children in such desperate times,&quot; said Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the US department of homeland security. Catholic leaders and immigrant groups in Florida are urging that thousands of children be airlifted to their state. The plan is similar one that was carried out in 1960 called &quot;Operation Pedro Pan&quot;, in which some 14,000 unaccompanied Cuban children were brought to the United States.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The possibility of a child being mistakenly labelled as an orphan during this time is incredibly high,&quot; warned a spokesman for Save the Children, an international advocacy group. &quot;Only once the family tracing effort has been exhausted and it is determined that children cannot be reunited, and after proper screening, should international adoption be considered.&quot;</strong></p>

<pre><code>    http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/americas/haiti-home-of-a-million-orphans#full     
</code></pre>

<p><strong>&quot;Parents of some of the children confirmed to the press and testified in
court that they gave up their children to the missionaries after being prom-
ised by the recruiters and the group of Baptists that “the kids would be
educated and relatives could visit them.</strong>”64 Reverend Sainvil convinced one
parent to hand over his children to the missionaries for their better care,
pointing out “that dead bodies buried under rubble in his El Citron neigh-
borhood would breed disease.”65 Reverend Sainvil told reporters that:
Everybody agreed that they knew where the children were going.
The parents were told, and we confirmed they would be allowed
to see the children and even take them back if need be.66
<strong>Adrien—the orphanage worker—stated that parents jumped at the offer,
while a mother who handed over her daughter observed that it was “only
because the bus was full that more children didn’t go.”</strong>67
The parents gave their consent to the missionaries to take their children
under the impression that Silsby and her group were providing shelter and
education; the parents’ understanding was not that they were permanently
parting with their children.68 Contrary to the parents’ expectations, Silsby’s
express intent—according to her online action plan—was to place the children for adoption  </p>

<p>Now, to the person who&#39;s comment this is a reply to, I don&#39;t care if this convinces you; realistically, these 2 articles alone constitute enough evidence that a reasonable person should realize the &quot;this is just more Clinton child trafficking&quot; explanation is not the only, or in fact, most plausible explanation here.  I only wrote this comment so visitors to r/conspiracy who aren&#39;t totally immersed in the outlandish, paranoid, credulous thinking of the sub would realize that not everyone here just jumps on every conspiracy bandwagon just because a tortured case can be wrested from the available info.  I don&#39;t know your ideology, I don&#39;t know what you already believe, and I don&#39;t care.  But if you were to prosecute this case in a court, the evidence provided in my articles and OP&#39;s together could <em>maybe</em> get you negligence.  What you couldn&#39;t get is a child trafficking conviction, because the evidence isn&#39;t there, and it&#39;s an even further leap to connect this to other supposed instances of child sex slavery by the elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. While I dont believe that Hilary Clinton is directly responsible for human trafficking in Haiti, I know there is enough evidence to suggest that its definitely happening to those people in Haiti and that theres a human trafficking ring and market in America, and looking back, I suppose youre not arguing that its not happening over there, but that people are exaggerating the Hil-dog connection.

<p>I like this sub, but this is the biggest problem here on both sides of a lot of people&#39;s arguments/theories. It&#39;s detrimental overall since a lot of people already have their mind made up and take what they read at face value, but it makes you keep your thinking cap on if you&#39;re aware of it and willing to keep searching on your own after you leave, you can almost make it beneficial to yourself. Unfortunately, people on the internet mostly like instant gratification and would rather prove that their right at the first turn than to shoot down their own idea after spending a lot of time on it.</p>

<p>This reminds me of something else that was going on in Slovenia in 1995 - the so-called &quot;D&#39;Onofrio Affair&quot;. </p>

<p>I recently researched this shit for a biopic I was adapting. Buckle up: </p>

<p>In 1995, Slovenia was a focal point for illegal arms deals that fueled multiple sides of the Yugoslav civil war. </p>

<p>One of the most colorful arms dealers was a guy named NICOLAS OMAN. Nicolas worked for a Swiss-German arms dealing company called MEREX AG. </p>

<p>Merex was founded in 1963 by SS Hauptsturmführer Gerhard Mertins. Mertins was a dear wartime friend of the notorious SS Obergruppenführer Otto Skorzeny. Both of them were kommandos on a famous mission where they hanglided off a mountain to bust Mussolini out of prison. </p>

<p>Skorzeny was one of the leaders of the so-called &quot;Underground Reich&quot; that took root in South America and maintained a covert, but powerful presence in western Europe. These ex-SS officers were largely true believers, but they sold their services to the USA to escape the gallows. From then on, they were on-and-off assets for the CIA and other Western intelligence agencies. </p>

<p>ANYWAY - Nicolas Oman became the Slovenian Ambassador to Liberia in the early 90s, where he became good friends with the infamous CHARLES TAYLOR, a CIA-backed warlord. Taylor also worked as an agent for MEREX AG, the Nazi company. Taylor was accused various times of eating the hearts of his enemies in occult voodoo rituals.</p>

<p>Nicolas Oman literally lived in a medieval castle in a town called BLED, and eventually (surprise surprise) he got in trouble for fucking pre-pubescent girls in Liberia. He fled to Australia, where he still lives AFAIK.</p>

<p>Nazis-Pedos-arms traffickers-terrorists-cannibals-satanists-CIA</p>

<p>It&#39;s all way more fucking connected than you think. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even get to the wild story of CIA Officer Roger D&#39;Onofrio, Licio Gelli (an associate of Oman&#39;s), the Vatican Bank, and the money-laundering Archbishop...
Best friend/colleague of suicided/assassinated Monica Peterson writes in January of 2016 about how when on a long term trip to study the pro-child trafficking culture and human trafficking of all forms (not just sexual) found evidence that the Hillary Clinton Foundation was involved in human trafficking although she states that she does not know to what extent. Her information also leads us to believe that out of three Hillary backed companies in Haiti two are almost sure to be involved in illegal human trafficking:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>TL;DR - Mandy Peterson a government hired cultural researcher was assigned to study the child trafficking pro-organizations and factions in Haiti. In early January of 2016 Mandys best friend and co-researcher Bella Robinson made a well informed post stating that the mining contracts, and the Clinton foundation were all partakinf in child trafficking. </p>

<p>Three days ago Mandy&#39;s family was contacted and told that Mandy&#39;s body had been found DEAD and that it is likely a suicide. Mandy&#39;s family AND friends do not believe that she killed herself and the government is now reportedly saying that they will not be able to have the body brought over from Haiti. </p>

<p>Mandy&#39;s co-researcher and best friend made a heartfelt goodbye to her fried but also posted a link to a Reddit thread where a Reddit anon details how the hillary Clinton foundation has her assasinated. A friend asks for details to which she states she will PM the used as it &quot;shouldn&#39;t be in the public&quot; and that she &quot;finally knows what happened to Monica.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Koons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen his name dropped a few times so here is what I know about Koons.</p>

<p>A year or so ago there was a AMA thread on /b/ about the luminati/NWO. Unlike every other thread like this, this thread was extremely convincing. The OP replied with brief straight-forward responses, nothing vague or mysterious. OP mentioned he was an artist by profession then basically described the member arrangements within his organization without incriminating anyone. Twards the end before OP left he mentioned getting his &quot;young blood treatment.&quot; Once he was gone anons found out from the pictures OP posted that the &quot;artist&quot; of the posted pics was Jeff Koons. </p>

<p>I wish I had more useful info and do not mean to side track the investigation but this memory has stuck with me hard, I actually believe OP was Jeff Koons. Who proclaimed in that thread that he was a lower ranking member of the NWO. The thread read like no other I&#39;ve seen sense. </p>

<p>What does /pol/ have on him?</p>

It depends. The ruling class simply wants to rule over an indifferent mass. However, many do believe that in the end times, a war of ideas will occur and they will prevail through the intervention of a &quot;messiah&quot;. Which makes it scarier because there are powerful people who legitimately believe through mass war and death, peace will come.

Belgium, this little country between France and the Netherlands, is also the home of the European Union, NATO, and, I am told, a massive computer centre where databases on all the people of the world are being compiled.</p>

<p>The name of the global pedophile ring is &quot;The Visionaries&quot;. They are hidden within art organizations in The United States and Europe, and have franchises all around the world.</p>

<p>They run &#39;outsider&#39; art galleries that are actually just advertisements for Satanic rituals, and they bid on paintings at high class galas hosted by celebrities and politicians. </p>

<p>The main administration is run by psychiatrists who control the artists through drugging and asylum. Many of them were formerly abused, and lie about it in their artist bios. The psychiatrists are mostly based out of Virginia Commonwealth University. They are a modern MKUltra operation meant to launder human trafficking money and gain power on the global elite. </p>

<p>The Visionaries run franchises through art societies based in Richmond, Virginia and Lausanne, Switzerland. The Souls Grown Deep foundation, one of the nodes, hosts eyes wide shut parties through the art auction method. </p>

I haven&#39;t seen this this Frank Winstead has died, but another guy from NC with the same name has a few articles about his death. I mean, it could be the same guy but he doesn&#39;t look 80 in this video.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what I&#39;ve gathered about Frank Winstead is that he was the community appointed Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner (ANC) for Washington DC. And the reason the reported doesn&#39;t like him is because he seems to be a bit of a cunt (the ping-pong reference I assume is related to the video where he complained about them playing on the sidewalk).

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fwinstead/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/fwinstead/videos</a></p>

<p>His connection to PizzaGate is that 9 years ago he uploaded a video outside of Commet Ping-Pong to document the unsafe playing of ping-pong on the sidewalk.
Anons have recently noticed that in this video, you can hear what appears to be a child screaming for help (although I ask why no one even the cameraman himself notices).

dont feel that way. Observing actually helps.</p>

<p>Quantum researchers working at CERN with the Large Hadron Collider found that when they observed particles..yes, merely watched them, it CAUSED the particles to behave differently. Short explanation, their EXPECTATIONS and the mere fact that they were observing had a direct effect on quantum particles.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t made a meme in my life, and I certainly cant crack an encryption. But observing..watching the rest of /pol do what it does, sends it energy and changes the outcome. </p>

<p>Read watch. Every scrap, every bit of information, every post you can, every news, every element. Sooner or later we&#39;ll all have amassed enough information collectively that it will combine the way it did for the election.</p>

There is a cypher at the bottom of the page. When translated one of the hits is &#39;Missing British Girl Madeleine Mccann Portugal Two Zero Zero Seven.&#39;

<p>IT security company from GA created by this mysterious Bill Havre, who also created Rachel Chandler&#39;s modeling agency and literally a thousand other companies.</p>

<p>At the bottom of their webpage is some sentence written in a cipher we are trying to break.</p>

<p>Yep. Nothing to see here. Pack it up fags.</p>

Faggot.
Guys, I&#39;m really kinda freaking out. Let me just give you the overview of my investigation into Rachel Chandler, former rider of the Lolita Express with Bill and Jeff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This led me to investigate her tumblr page, <a href="http://rachelchandler.tumblr.com/">http://rachelchandler.tumblr.com/</a> and <a href="http://rachelchandlerparty.tumblr.com/">http://rachelchandlerparty.tumblr.com/</a></p>

<p>Check it out for yourself, the place is filled with weird pictures of children much like the other instagram feeds we&#39;ve previously investigated.</p>

<p>So who is Walter J Pearce then?</p>

<p>Apparently a real estate agent in.........</p>

<p>WACO TEXAS.</p>

<p>Why... what... and why so little information? </p>

<p>So just to recap everyone.</p>

<p>Rachel Chandler, rider of the Lolita Express with Jeff and Bill, owns a modeling company in New York, registered to a company registered to a random guy from Wyoming. That modeling company is co-owned by a small time real estate mogul from Waco Texas, scene of the famous Waco siege during Bill&#39;s presidency.</p>

<p>What are all these strings, and someone help me tie them together!
Ok the story gets worse. <a href="http://rachelchandler.tumblr.com/image/144108869692">http://rachelchandler.tumblr.com/image/144108869692</a> this boy was a very peculiar target for the picture, considering the poses, ballerina shoes and snakeskin pants. The CSS prevented us from viewing who shared and liked, but it doesn&#39;t work in mobile so we found 63 associated accounts and began an investigation. The majority of these tumblr accounts were filled with obscene, usually borderline pictures of children, bdsm, hardcore porn and the occult. Truly some sick shit, with a special focus on eyes for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Some really really weird stuff turned up, disturbing pictures of children or drawn of children. Previous threads will show my discussion but I can&#39;t find the instagram links now, hopefully someone else saved them.</p>

<p>Eventually we found her instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ray.chandler/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/ray.chandler/?hl=en</a> which has more of the same from her tumblr, except it allowed us to find who the boy in the snakeskin pants is: a young teenage girl! Apparently he transitioned into a girl <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BIs6Ze6AHN-/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BIs6Ze6AHN-/</a></p>

<p>Moving on. Rachel Chandler and some guy named Walter Pearce apparently own a company, <a href="http://midland.agency/">http://midland.agency/</a> that does photography for what appears to be scantily clad models. </p>

<p>That company was registered by REGISTERED AGENTS INC. <a href="http://imgur.com/TJnIhhI">http://imgur.com/TJnIhhI</a></p>

<p>which was a company in turn registered by </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/FwlLGqV">http://imgur.com/FwlLGqV</a></p>

<p>Bill Havre. Who is Bill Havre and why is he incorporating a random modeling agency in Washington DC when he himself is from Wyoming?
i posted this last time, but i guess a bump is needed and maybe people find it still interesting:

<p>email as well as numerous other AMOUNTs of circumstantial evidence altogether can&#39;t even add up to reasonable suspicion warranting simple questioning!?</p>

<p>Like are you aware that in most states, a foul odor is enough to give police this same suspicion to strip search and blood test someone for drug possesion and use?</p>

Its one thing to challenge an idea to refine the quality of the discussion but some of them are just here to shit on any instance of compelling dissent. When a post makes front-page and it contains well articulated reasons to support a formal investigation, they descend on it like firemen coming down a brass pole. The best is when they pretend to be crazies and post a bunch of nonsense to discredit the sub. Its like somebody taught psych 101 to a bunch of meat head jocks and they think they&#39;re fooling everyone with their master role playing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there isn&#39;t enough evidence to convict at this moment but don&#39;t you dare stand there and brush off his pedo artwork as inconsequential. People have been convicted on mounds of circumstantial evidence that when each peace is singled out by a sleazy defense attorney, can be argued to be inconsequential, but when you put it all together, juries see through the bullshit when there&#39;s too much coincidence to ignore. You argument would be sensible if you were arguing against any particular punishment, but you&#39;re arguing against a lawful investigation in light of some pretty compelling connections that may well turn out to be nonsense, but what kind of monsters would we be if there was something to it and those kids never get justice? It&#39;s worth a look, if the look is reasonable. I see no legitimate denial of that when the man&#39;s walls were plastered with pictures of children in their underwear in vulnerable positions. I respect any attempt to prevent a witch hunt. I felt the same way until I saw those paintings. This ain&#39;t no witch hunt. This fucker has it coming if he&#39;s going to put up pictures like that and post them all over twitter. Don&#39;t defend a scumbag just to be a contrarian either because then you&#39;re just enabling a monster. </p>
