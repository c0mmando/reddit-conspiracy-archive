I finally gathered up enough balls to post Ben Swann&#39;s Pizzagate segment on FB, and as I predicted the attempts to gaslight me ensued. I have to say that honestly, I am a Pizzagate skeptic. However, I do not deny the possibility that it could be true, and I do believe that something strange is going on and that it needs to be formally investigated. One FB friend mentioned that Pizzagate was completely made up on 4Chan before it snowballed here and r/The_Donald. Is there any veracity to this claim?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this piece of evidence to me was the smoking gun at first, but I actually went back and read through the entire email thread and he is talking about a cheese basket he received from John Podesta. If we take the secret code out of it for a minute, while the use of &quot;on&quot; here is strange, it could make sense here in the context. Its like saying &quot;Do you think I could run faster on cheese or on pasta?&quot; Maybe its an inside joke and he sucks at playing dominos, perhaps the last time he played with John Podesta was over pasta and he lost. So now he&#39;s saying that maybe this round of dominos with his kids and grandkids he will play better after eating cheese. Again I end up finding a lot more evidence when we look at the actions of James Alefantis and co., after this was uncovered. The hot dog stand in Hawaii and the Hot Dog Fridays with $65K being spent on hot dogs and pizzza, those emails I can&#39;t seem to get my head around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, but I also can understand why a lot of people think this is stupid and crazy. I have actively tried to debunk this many many times over, and I just simply can&#39;t get it out my head.

<p>The following year, the Sandlers were back on Martha&#39;s Vineyard and were playing dominoes again. Herb Sandler jokes about Podesta changing the rules (Herb is over 80 years old).</p>

<li>2015-07-11 <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/37971">Herb Sandler</a>: &quot;Last day in MV. Missed you. Susan whipped Sherry and me at Dominos. Using the Podesta method, she made up the rules as we played.&quot;</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The hot dog stand in Hawaii and the Hot Dog Fridays with $65K being spent on hot dogs and pizzza, those emails I can&#39;t seem to get my head around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Running a hot dog stand was John Podesta&#39;s humorous idea of a low-stress job that he would get after being Chief of Staff. For example, in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/07/03/for-the-presidents-4th-chief-of-staff-a-measure-of-success/4f7a333b-0e12-4815-a749-fa7ff35c82f1/">this July 2000 article</a>, Tony Podesta says that John &#39;often says--in a voice that seems only half-joking--his biggest goal after the White House is to run a hot-dog stand in Hawaii. Even that might prove too stressful for a presidential chief of staff already getting the feel of beach sand in his toes. His true goal, Tony Podesta speculated, is to run &quot;a crazy T-shirt store on the Big Island.&quot;&#39;</p>

<p>FYI, not all PG offenders/suspects are Demoncrats, some are Repugnicans. Try to research a little before you call everything a 4chan hoax. 4chan certainly did not post to JimmyComet Insta acct. Those pictures + wikileaks + MSM articles + CPP youtube videos + artists associated with Pedostas are what tipped the scales for me.</p>

<p>If you want to be infallible, just keep blaming Russia for planting evidence (and everything else) - nobody can disprove that. The 4chan narrative is already busted. You may not like me, but if you have any integrity at all, at least give me credit for cleaning up your lame-ass arguments. I wish you the best in trying to find your intellect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been careful to say that they are unsubstantiated and aren&#39;t proven, I don&#39;t act like it&#39;s a sure thing, just that I think it&#39;s likely given what&#39;s been provided.</p>

<p>And again, wrong. I have a strong dislike for pizzagate because I think it is a limited hangout or distraction of some sort. You can see I believe in the whole mass pedophilia and child abuse shit, just that I don&#39;t think the pizzagate investigation is on to anything with the emails and artwork and such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing has been &quot;provided&quot; except for the testimonies of FBIAnon. everything else was found hiding in plain sight (including Jimmycomet Werkinonmanightcheese and ccwoolman Insta posts and comments). I saw these when they were public and ran through 3 TWTR accts trying to spread the word. Perhaps you will better understand my vitriol towards individuals who try to cast doubt on what is reasonably obvious.</p>

<p>The Russia talk (with precious little evidence) is a distraction from the known pedo ring (which you acknowledge to be true). PG is a stupid name, but I came too late to change it. You should go ahead and try to cover now by telling me what you think could be more important than the safety/sanctity of children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first paragraph is referring to the dossier not pizzagate, as in I think it&#39;s real based on the dossier and what some people have said about it, that&#39;s what I mean by the provided part.</p>

<p>Pizzagate doesn&#39;t need to be distracted from imo, if they wanted it to fail they could just as easily infiltrate the movement and fill it with misleading crap, which considering the amount of misleading stuff  that gets a lot of attention I do find that plausible. Trump does have business connections with Russia, and has lied about knowing Putin, so I find it reasonable to look into.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t acknowledge that this is a pedophile ring, there may be something with Silsby trafficking and Clinton connection to that, but I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with the coded emails, symbols, ping pong pizza and Pegasus museum stuff, instagram accounts, or many of the other connections that have been drawn. It could also be drugs or guns, which iirc, were ran through Mena in the past.</p>

<p>And come on, let&#39;s not use the &quot;think of the children&quot; argument, we can care about more than one thing at once and that&#39;s been used by the media to push their agenda, we&#39;ve even called it out on here iirc (after any school shooting it seems to be used).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, 4chan and reddit are where people initially started amassing all of the evidence that they found, comparing notes and finding new people/places to investigate.</p>

<p>The idea that PG is a &quot;fake story&quot; is just a straw man that MSM mouthpieces use to discredit the idea with <em>NO</em> examination of evidence, whatsoever. The lack of information within these hit pieces, in itself, should be a red flag to anybody who asks questions; but, A significant portion of the population gobbles up these articles as truth - a victory of the American Educational System, if you will.</p>

<p>Things probably aren&#39;t all as bad as they seem, though. I submit that it only looks that way because the idiots that I mentioned above are Facebook&#39;s prime demographic. Who is dumber, the idiot or the one who insists on arguing with said idiot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve tried to be very clear in my post, that I would must rather be wrong about this and have it thoroughly investigated, than have any lick of this be right and have it ignored and ridiculed. That was just met with more ridiculing and advising me to stay off the internet for a bit, lol. Its not easy to do the right thing, but I&#39;m not going to shut about this. Something is amiss, and we owe it to our children to make sure these perpetrators are exposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am encouraged by your sense of duty and responsibility. Just the same, maybe my experience is a cautionary tale.</p>

<p>I started following PG investigations in last days of October. I was much more about the initial George Webb line of investigating the CF and CGI  (arms, oil, money,). After seeing the FBIAnon threads, I started looking into it, and sure enough I started running across the same themes/information that anyone who followed the trail will find.</p>

<p>Just after the election. much like yourself, I was driven to share what I considered overwhelming evidence to help protect children and bring abusers to justice. I used my TWTR acct to get the word out as best as I knew how. My account was suspended in December. I appealed it, and just got the notification a week ago that the suspension is permanent. I started two other accounts, but they were both shadowbanned in short order (I found out from followers who were kind enough to tell me). Now, I can&#39;t start a new acct unless I give them my digits (eff TWTR!!!).  In addition to this, I also got a 48 hour ban from all of reddit for &quot;concern trolling.&quot; PG has been attacked by MSM, but the social media sites are more dangerous. They attack people who try to spread truth about this mess. It&#39;s all being done to shape the popular perception that it is a &quot;crazy fringe theory.&quot; Firstly, it would not surprise me at all if your likes and positive comments from FB friends are being suppressed or redirected - one of the initial ideas of FB was to make insecure sheep feel popular with digital &quot;friends&quot; and  &quot;likes.&quot; It has the opposite effect on people with &quot;unpopular&quot; views or ideas. Also, if you are going to talk about PG, make sure you do so on an account that you are willing to lose.</p>

<p>My advice to you is to share the information IRL, where the sheep have much less of a herd mentality - and you have the opportunity to connect with individuals personally and to walk them through the information. That is the most effective (and safest) way to spread the word, IMO. I wish you the best of luck and emotional peace as you go forward - I believe you will need it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your response. I&#39;m not active on Twitter other than to read others posts, and thankfully I don&#39;t actually have a big FB following. Unless I&#39;m posting pictures of my family or talking about fun outings or vacations, I won&#39;t get more than 1-2 likes on my posts. Perhaps it has been active suppression or redirection, or people in my FB friend group just don&#39;t give a shit about my political ramblings. I did have a coworker come and talk to me (she&#39;s the only coworker I&#39;m friends with on FB because I trust her) and she was curious about PG. I was worried enough to post anything on FB honestly, but I think I crafted it in a way to not prevent me from getting banned, because obviously I want to keep my personal account I&#39;ve had since 2005. Thanks for your advice! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first I thought the 4chan archived posts were just BS. An actual FBI source posting these kind of far-fetched crazy theories? Yeah right.</p>

<p>But what solidified it for me was that, in those forums, the FBIanon said that a document dump would be coming very soon. Lo and behold, in the time frame that he alluded to, the FBI Vault twitter account awakened after being dormant for years and posted a bunch of official FBI documents that led Reddit and 4chan &quot;investigators&quot; on a bunch of new rabbit holes through new leads related to these &quot;far-fetched&quot; theories. It&#39;s staggering where these connections from the official FBI documents, paired with the authenticated Podesta leaks (and past leaks that touch on related DynCorp/Stratfor matters), have led us since November.</p>
