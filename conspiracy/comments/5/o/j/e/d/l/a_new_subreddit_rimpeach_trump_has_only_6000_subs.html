       Trump wants to protect social services like medicare, wants to end illegal wars, he's even praised universal healthcare while talking about repealing the ACA. Trump is not a typical Republican. The Democrats don't like this. They don't want someone in power who might protect medicare or end illegal wars. They want a typical scumbag Republican like Pence who'll deliver more illegal wars, who'll privitize social security, who'll fuck over the American people for the profits of the billionaires.

       You're right. This is just Democrats trying to rile up their voters to support action that will never come to fruition. Thanks to this, the Democrats can look like they're "fighting the good fight" without actually achieving anything. Kind of like how Republicans in Congress kept "trying" to repeal Obamacare even though it obviously was never going to happen. Just bullshit political theater to placate the people and make us think they're doing something when they're really doing nothing.

       Lol they locked the post.  I think they need a few new subscribers to correct the record.  I'm no fan of Trump but I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt until he at least until he violates the Constitution in his capacity as POTUS.  That sub is a joke.

       Reading the comments, it appears many are singing a tune, they do not agree with. Many of the top comments were like, ok you impeached Trump and now have the most religious conservative president we've ever seen, with support from establishment R's. Now what?

       The question is how a post from an obscure, tiny, subreddit got onto the front page of /all in the first place. Not the obvious conclusion that people will upvote something they are exposed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any idea what percentage of new posts (from non-default subreddits with less than 10k subs) are even given that chance? Its almost like winning the lottery.

       There is circumstantial evidence that trump has ties to Russia and that he is mysogynistic. I'm not saying that it's true but it is as deserving to be looked into as much as many other conspiracies.

       There isn't. There are unfounded claims. If I claim that you're a Nigerian spy, that doesn't mean there's now circumstantial evidence that you are. There is literally no evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, to support the mainstream medias 'Russian narrative.'

       But I've never been to Nigeria or spoken in admiration of Nigerian leadership. Trump has visited Russia and spoken highly of Putin (as well as many other connections). This can be called "circumstantial evidence." Do I think that could hold up in any court ever? Absolutely not, nor would I want it to be. Do I think that people can be speculative of his motives based on this? Yes. I don't see why that would ever be down voted in a sub about conspiracies.

       MSM got Trump elected because they saw his bafoonery was getting the best ratings. At least that's my theory. Seems like it worked because it's all anyone can talk about whether they hate him or love him.

       This election was so close that you can't just pin everything on one factor.   There were 13 states where the winner had less than 50% of the vote.   I'm sure that if you picked any of those states you could select one issue and find enough people that voted along that line that it could flip the results.  If you just mix and match with flipping those states you can get anything from a complete blow-out for Trump to a complete blow-out for Clinton, and everything in between.

       That's to vote to remove from office, if it even gets that far. The House must first vote to impeach and Trump would have to piss an awful lot of his own party for that to happen (not impossible, but very unlikely).
      </p>
      <p>
       The people advocating for Trump's impeachment by the GOP Congress are the same people who tried to get recounts based on nothing, GOP electors to dump Trump, and failing that, the GOP Congress to reject those electors. And we're going to hear from these geniuses non-stop for 4 years.

       The sub is growing so quickly because the mods just placed one of their posts directly onto the front page.

       Its exactly like when spez just happened to mention r-enoughTrumpspam in post to the highly viral frontpage r/blog subreddit.

       At the time he "casually" mentioned it, nobody had even heard of that subreddit. Within 24 hours it had 10's of thousands of subscribers.

       Don't worry, plenty of people will soon enter this comment section to demean everyone. Recognizing blatant media corruption and information manipulation has now become synonymous with "supporting Trump" if you point it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       All day I hear about how Trump supports are "brigading" reddit, yet the only message I am being bombarded with is how evil Trump is and how anyone who supports him or defends him is literally an alt-right, white supremacist who farts in babies mouths and forcefully grabs random women by the pussy.

       Didn't call you a shill.  Been checking profiles lately.  Large number of proTrump accounts are new.
Don't think they are shills, nobody is paying them.

       It seems as though you were implying that. My account of 5 years got disabled for no reason a while back and unfortunately the email account I had tied to it was old an inactive so I couldn't reset password. Honestly had several since then and kept deleting bc I was getting paranoid about being labeled a Trump supporter (dissident) if shit hit the fan - crazy right?

       I live in rural community, I don't like people round here knowing I'm a bleeding heart liberal.  I can relate.  It's cool.  Just been an influx, had a guy the other day tell me he has 36 reddit accounts, a protrump guy.
I don't even know anymore.

       Granted I did not vote fore either parties but, lil Donny  did bring a number of individuals who think like that out of the woodwork. Hell, even some elected republicans didn't want to hitch a ride on that wagon. I'm sure there are some who supported him because he was the party representative and stuck with it, just like on the democratic side. But like anything else in life, a few bad apples ruined it for the rest of the class.

       I find that you can usually stop the trolls in their dust with two steps. First, you tear them apart with logic, evidence, cited sources, etc. Second, you point out that Trump is terrible and explain specific ways that he is terrible. They can't call you a "trumptard" if you jut got done explaining how Trump's unconstitutional plans to discriminate against Muslim people is really bad.

       Sure maybe but what I don't understand is why Trump supporters keep comparing her to him as if her being bad somehow negates Trump's actions. If you criticize Trump, Trump supporters come out in defense of him by criticizing Hillary.

       Usually their comment starts with trump has been accused of this, this and this why hasn't he been impeached yet.  The accused part is usually the part they don't quite get I'm guessing.  Seeing as the Clinton's have been accused for a multitude of things as well.

       You're completely missing the point and sorta proving what I'm talking about. Why is Hillary used as a defense mechanism when Trump is criticized? She's completely irrelevant at this point. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         person 1: Trump said he'd drain the swamp but appointed worse people in his administration
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         person 2: well Hillary pizza pedophile emails transcript speeches!!1!!!
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Hillary has nothing to do with what Trump is doing right now.

       How about the fact that we have verified proof of her committing multiple felonies (giving TS SCI and SAP documents to unauthorized persons is a felony).

       How about the fact that no such proof of crimes exists for Trump.

       I don't like Trump. He's a bigot and an idiot. I like some of his ideas for government like when he praised universal healthcare, but many of his ideas are unconstitutional and others are just fucking stupid. That said, I'm not interested in impeaching Trump until or unless he does something that merits it. I don't like Trump, but I dislike Pence even more.

       No, but a large portion of them are. Even more so with reddits demograph. Of course salty Hillary supporters will flock there (although their sub count isn't that high yet.) it's a no brainer that a majority of the sub would be Hillary supporters, it's called logic.

       You can go there right now and look for Hillary Clinton threads. There aren't any. Posting a pro
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       anti Hillary Clinton post to that subreddit would prove nothing because the subreddit has nothing to do with her and everything to do with impeaching Trump.

       Look what happened with spez decided to "casually" mention the (then obscure) subreddit r-enoughtrumpspam in his viral r-announcements post.
      </p>
      <p>
       The post in question:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4oedco/lets_all_have_a_town_hall_about_rall/">

       </a>
      </p>

       Have you even read the fucking post ? He mentioned T_D

       The Donald was already a viral subreddit at that point. Please, don't jump into conversations that you obviously don't understand.

       More brilliant insights. The point of this post is that the admins created this situation by placing the post on all, meaning it didn't happen organically.

       I just don't understand. What did he do to deserve being impeached already? He should not be impeached for things he is doing outside of his presidency. The guy hasn't even made inauguration yet and they already want him Impeached... You should of done a better job of promoting Hillary if you didn't like Trump. He won tho so suck it up?

       I don't really get your critique.  The president can't be charged with anything until the president is impeached, so if Trump committed a crime then the only way to prosecute him would be to impeach him (once he is inaugurated I believe).  Though I would agree any effort to impeach Trump would not doubt be politically inspired, but it's not as if Clinton's impeachment was only about justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they are incorrect that immediate impeachment is merited, let alone that it would be good for the nation, but if Trump really did commit a crime then the fact that he won the election shouldn't mean that he doesn't deserve to be impeached.  I just think that, on principle, popularity does not exempt you from the criminal process.

       She committed many crimes while Secretary of State. Even today she deserves impeachment and prosecution for those crimes she committed back then. Please do not falsely equivocate Trump's crimes with Clinton's crimes. I'm sure he'll do something impeachment worthy by the end of his term, but he doesn't deserve impeachment now. Clinton DOES deserve impeachment right now.

       Impeachment doesn't require the crime to have been committed while the person was holding the office. The crimes he's being accused of in the post and in the news would 100% lead to an impeachment.

       I think the people causing a ruckus are doing so because the narrative is currently meant to rile up the dissenters, make them feel like trump is the end of the world.  Can't blame them for being upset, but over time they'll chill.

       Do we really know Trump or are we just just pretending to be informed because the MSM has said lots of things about Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in a unique position to understand this phenomenon because everyone here at conspiracy assumes to know what I'm all about, and people all over Reddit also pretend to know what I'm all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people are convinced of ridiculous things about me.  They say I'm a Nazi, JIDF or a government agent.  Others say I'm a retard, useful idiot or schizophrenic.  But what do any of this self proclaimed enlightened people really know about me?  Have you ever had a beer with me?  Have you ever asked for my help with something that doesn't benefit me in any way?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my case, people on Reddit who were inconvenienced by my methods decided to propagandize others to join hands in unified disapproval of me.  Let's just demonize him, and then he will go away.  Let's manufacture a deeper truth about him that is full of negativity and condemnation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to hate with a herd, nobody will denounce you for your frivolous negativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we need that release don't we?  We need something to be angry with to distract ourselves from our own embarrassing internal truths.  Every time you got fired and told your friends that you quit. Every time you quit on a dream because it was hard and you didn't have the rocks to take the pain of the challenge.  Every time you disappointed your parents and fed them some bullshit reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The herd is safe from all that stuff.  You can always blame the group, you can always deny that you were the weakest link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Face it, the only person you REALLY know for sure is YOU.

       I understand your point. Propagandists can do some significant damage and misdirection. But the fact remains our head diplomat had to at one point have his cell phone taken away from him because he wouldn't quit saying stupid shit on twitter. I think honestly feel like you'd be more suitable for the position. I've seen how he does and the people he's put around himself. Those things don't misrepresent him. This isn't going to be pretty from all of what I can tell.

       Well certain people are surely going to do everything in their power to make it seem like it's not pretty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even sure anyone would comment on the good he might do.  If Trump was the best president for the people we ever had, would the people ever hear that story? Or would it be buried by some fabrication of misdeeds being set up as we speak.  They are already talking sabotage and he isn't even sworn in yet.

       From my perspective he's already dug himself into an enormous hole and we haven't even started yet. If he makes good on a fraction of his campaign promises that will be awful as I don't want him to slash funding for climate research, defund planned parenthood, screw up the education system, screw over poor people, slash corporate taxes for "small businesses", the list goes on. His pick for CIA says Snowden should be executed. The depth of things wrong here to me is staggering in a sort of way that puts me in awe that so many people want these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if by some miracle he does something good like repeal the ACA and replace it with something better like he says he will, I'll eat my own shoe. It's too bad my shoes are safe from me eating them because the result of whatever he's going to do is going to give people less insurance and make insurance companies more wealthy. Don't believe me or Fox news though, all you'll need to do is look at the numbers afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the same kind of thing that you're saying about him could be said for the folks from T_D. Do you think if Trump did something really bad it would phase them? It hasn't so far. They next war he marches us into a good one? No, none of it will matter.

       Lol do you idiots not understand how upvotes and the front page works?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is literally what the new algorithim does. New subs have a higher chance of reaching all. When they reach all, non subscribers start to vote. It's super simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are y'all even allowed to exist? Why do y'all regularly reach the front page? If reddit is cheating against you, why are you even here? And I don't mean, why do you stay. I mean, give me a reason you're allowed to stay in spite of this conspiracy you claim.

       90% of Donald Trump opposition on the internet is fake. Liberals do not have the cognitive capacity to organize - hence why they lost everything in the previous election. Only a select few on the extreme end of the bell curve - the ones who do have the knowledge to hack the internet and push propaganda online - are the ones who can obtain tangible political power and engage in vote manipulation like what we see here. Nothing to see here, folks. Donald Trump will stamp them out. Propaganda like Huffington Post, Jezebel, Buzzfeed, NPR, MSNBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, The Daily Show, The Young Turks, PBS, Salon, Mother Jones, The Washington Post, The New York Times will all be a thing of the past. Liberals were right about one thing: the stamping out of freedom of speech. But it is they who should be silenced, as we are the vanguards of truth.

       r/uncensorednews usually has about less than 100 upvotes per thread but whenever a muslim immigrant takes a shit that post gets over 5000. Is that vote manipulation too?

       whose lying? he's been there for less 100 days. It's a complete disaster. Falls for a false flag attack wants to go to war with N.Korea, gets US soldiers killed, job rate is falling.

      <p>
       The fact is, a post only needs ~1000 points to make it to the top 10 pages on r/all. For instance, for me right now the #24 post on r/all has just 1,600 points... those scumbags at r/2007scape must be vote manipulating!
      </p>

       The real conspiracy is why the mods of r/conspiracy continually allow T_D regulars to use this sub as a dumping ground for their pro-Trump rhetoric and
       <em>
        anti

       anti-Trump propaganda.

       It's time to dump Reddit and move to non biased source and give them a chance. I'm open to suggestions and checking out a few of the offerings in play. Hopefully one of them pans out and catches fire enough to take off and leave reddit in the dust like Digg.
       <br/>
       I would love to see Reddit crumble into dust for turning into the hellhole of circlejerking echo chambers that is has devolved too.

       Because people hate Trump. His approval rating is 40%. Just mentioning his name in public sends people in to hostile tirades. He can't even get anyone famous to play his inauguration. Of course an anti Trump sub is going to hit the front page.

       After the pro Trump even spilled in here it was just a matter of time until an anti Trump sub would appear.

       And now the pro Trump guys are getting upset and instead of talking in the Trump sub about it bring it up here again.

       Everytime I talk to someone who does'nt like trump they don't have anything specific they can point to. HE IS RACIST!! I HEARD HE DOES'NT LIKE MEXICANS AND MUSLIMS!! Without actually knowing for sure that he does'nt. I mean I voted for trump and I could actually argue he is racists better than that.  But yea children trying to stay up late.

       I don't know if this is "Reddit" doing this. Astroturf shills can start their own subreddit and buy enough upvotes to reach r/all without any help from Reddit or their admins. It's possible that Reddit is complicit in this case too, but what op is pointing out could be done without any help from them.

       Do they realize you can't impeach someone who is'nt even in office yet? 
Also do they really REALLY REALLY want his VP as president? Do they think if trump loses the presidency Hillary becomes president?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also yea Reddit has been very anti trump from what i can see. It is sad actually that the people censoring trump supporters actually believe that he is the fascist one.
      </p>
      <p>
       That and a coup against trump is laughable.
His hardest supporters consist of gun nuts, military personal, ETC.
Hillary's hardest supporters consist mostly of like kids with a liberal arts degree they couldn't even finish. So I mean clear winner their right?

       There isn't. There are unfounded claims. If I claim that you're a Nigerian spy, that doesn't mean there's now circumstantial evidence that you are. There is literally no evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, to support the mainstream medias 'Russian narrative.'

       Reading the comments, it appears many are singing a tune, they do not agree with. Many of the top comments were like, ok you impeached Trump and now have the most religious conservative president we've ever seen, with support from establishment R's. Now what?

       After the pro Trump even spilled in here it was just a matter of time until an anti Trump sub would appear.
       <br/>
       And now the pro Trump guys are getting upset and instead of talking in the Trump sub about it bring it up here again.

       Have you even read the fucking post ? He mentioned T_D
       <strong>
        three times
       </strong>
       , giving them a lot of exposure. Worst. Manipulation. Ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what is the chart of impeach_trump supposed to prove ? All new subreddits that suddenly start trending have a chart that looks like that. (usually when one of their posts reaches
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
