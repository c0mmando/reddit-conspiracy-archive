    <div class="md"><p>Nobody said they don&#39;t do it. Just the way this story went it seems way too easy. They deny everything all the time, so why would they suddenly admit anything to some bullshit dudes watching the border? Also, they aren&#39;t inept, unless these guys are going rogue and acting alone, they would have intel about who was watching the border and where and know where not to go. So them running into these guys is super low on things that are likely to happen to the CIA.</p>

<p>What&#39;s stopping the CIA funding their black ops budgets with black market sales of drugs? Only makes sense</p>

<p>Not to mention the head of the CIA had to come out publicly and dismiss that these people were &quot;related to the CIA&quot; which goes to show that it did in fact happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, like I previously said. im not denying that the CIA may be in on some shady drug running deals. I said this specific story sounds fake to me from the details given. </p>

<p>It makes zero sense they would just cave and give away their plans to these people and show them their ID&#39;s. Youd think CIA would have some sort of fake id&#39;s made for the people actually doing the drug running and such. Also that they woudnt just blurt out their plans the second they are caught. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What fake id&#39;s could be used to legitimize your drug running operation?</p>

<p>The fact alone that the CIA head had to publicly deny this or the ownership of that cocaine proves that they were CIA agents.</p>

<p>I see it as they didn&#39;t blurt out their plan they merely presented CIA ID&#39;s in an attempt to get the Minutemen to let them go</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I sure as hell wouldnt be using a CIA ID. Literally any fake ID made up, the CIA certainly has the capability to do so. </p>

<p>If they truly were running drugs across the border, I would fully assume they would have fake passports/state id&#39;s without their actual names made so if they were caught. They get arrested, and conveniently &quot;transferred&quot; out of jail/prison. </p>

<p>Just seems dumb to flash CIA shit when you get caught, especially when armed men stop you on a border and you have 1300 lbs of cocaine on you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so what are the alternative theories here. Again, I respect skeptics but what possible alternative theories could there be?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say these were 2 random drug runners with a fake CIA ID.</p>

<p>Why the fuck would they risk even more threat, charges, and the like by using a fake CIA ID let alone while carrying 1300 pounds of cocaine.</p>

<p>Let me tell you something.</p>

<p>1300 pounds of cocaine.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s lowball an estimate and say that one pound of cocaine sells for at lowest, $8,000.</p>

<p>1300 pounds at $8,000 is $10,400,000.00 </p>

<p>Are you telling me that two drug runners used fake ID&#39;s while carrying TEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF COCAINE?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if anything, the fellas, maybe ex CIA maybe not, maybe no training what so ever, were hired/working for the cartels to get drugs over the border. If I was caught at the border by minutemen, how seem to be unwavering in their commitment and patriotism, the logical arugement to get them to release you, would be to tell them your working for the government and on mission. So seems like to me these 2 guys got caught smuggling drugs, they started to lie to cover there ass, and to try to get released. Eventually the lies being told or the lies in the police report are what got published here, just instead of lies, the news report covered it all as real. </p>

<p>TLDR: Basically the incident happened, but the fact the 2 arrested were working for the CIA is highly unlikely and was originally mentioned as a attempt to get law enforcement to let them go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also a surprising lack of conformable details, along with a &#39;rushed&#39; narrative.</p>

<p>THIS JUST HAPPENED! last night! But, no date at all, etc.</p>

<p>For those concerned over fake vs real news, most long term Conspiracy Theories rely about at least a few pieces of substantial evidence, along with circumstantial. Fake news pieces will be entirely circumstantial, but with high quality presentation.</p>

<p>Real conspiracy theories generally rely upon a variety of people reaching the same conclusion, and generally systematically eliminate all &#39;reasonable&#39; alternatives. Fake news pieces present a &#39;what if&#39; scenario, and then create a movie, book, and fan club to support such a bizarre situation - Fake news also tends to have &#39;bizarre&#39; confirmation, such as the picture of this guys &#39;CIA badge&#39; but with it blurred out? Seems legit, but why the blur? Who in the CIA allows you to take a pic of their person, at all?</p>

<p>Likewise, occassionally, fake news will suggest &#39;immediate&#39; action or judgement. Real conspiracy theorist generally just want a trial. An open investigation in which the evidence is reasonable presented, and their explanations documented on record.</p>

<p>Anyways, for new comers, that&#39;s the general way you can distinguish enraging propaganda vs reasoned justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the sidebar has a list (or it use to?) of &#39;confirmed&#39; conspiracies. But if you just want some basic one&#39;s that I don&#39;t think any sensible person could deny, when presented a complete set of data:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>US Media primarily serves to provoke, rather than inform (Propaganda)</p></li>
<li><p>9/11 Required a significant amount of internal assistance, far beyond the operational control of a cave dweller (whom CNN did a live interview with just months before... but the CIA could never find!) - Gov. Sanctioned Terrorism</p></li>
<li><p>That the FBI played a pivotal role in murdering, or allowing the murder of a huge number of civil rights activists.</p></li>
<li><p>That the government makes no attempt to be representative of the desires of the people, that goes far beyond mere incompetence (tyrannical)</p></li>
<li><p>The murder of Robert Kennedy is completely suspect - <a href="http://www.jfk-info.com/teeter2.htm">http://www.jfk-info.com/teeter2.htm</a></p></li>
<li><p>There is practically no way Lee Oswald was the only shooter against Kennedy. That would require a level of marksmanship that would place him in like the top 1% worldwide, and I&#39;m not sure if anyone has been able to physically reproduce his claimed abilities.</p></li>
<li><p>The 3rd Kennedy, who lost to Hillary for Senator of New York by death, seems oddly &#39;coincidental&#39;.</p></li>
<li><p>The choosing of Truman over Wallace as the successor to FDR, is completely mind boggling. Truman essentially had no political history, and was never elected to office. Instead FDR won and died almost immediately, and then Truman dropped some A-bombs forthwith, and essentially declared war against Russia immediately after. It was an odd set of coincidences and behaviors.</p></li>
<li><p>Prescott Bush (father to George) was the head financier for the Nazi Party, while living in Texas. Essentially he money laundered for Hitler, and then won 2 Presidencies. Interesting...</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a few points...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is practically no way Lee Oswald was the only shooter against Kennedy. That would require a level of marksmanship that would place him in like the top 0.1% worldwide, and I&#39;m not sure if anyone has been able to physically reproduce his claimed abilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a popular myth that Oswald was a terrible shot. That said, a Texas Live Oak was in his way, and the gun he was using couldn&#39;t cycle fast enough to get off the shots. This is especially evident when you consider people were hit with fragments of bullets on the overpass in Dealey Plaza, meaning there had to have been more than one shooter. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 3rd Kennedy, who lost to Hillary for Senator of New York by death, seems oddly &#39;coincidental&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No Kennedy lost to Hillary. Moynihan was Senator from New York for decades, but he was planning to retire in 2000. JFK, Jr. had a blind poll done in 1999 to test the waters for his candidacy when Moynihan retired. Kennedy&#39;s numbers looked very good. Then he died in a plane wreck. Clinton ran and won the seat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The choosing of Truman over Wallace as the successor to FDR, is completely mind boggling. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Untold History of the United States makes clear, there wasn&#39;t any shadow conspiracy behind that. It was obvious. The Democratic leadership did not like Wallace. They put up with FDR because the people loved him, and FDR used that leverage to get Wallace on the ticket in the first place when he replaced Garner. With Roosevelt&#39;s deteriorating health, the Democratic leadership feared what would happen with an even more radical Democrat than FDR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is from a <a href="http://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/thought_and_writing/mind_control/MKULTRA/Stratton%20-%20Altered%20States%20of%20America%20(Spin%201994).pdf">1994 article in Spin magazine</a>, if you&#39;re interested.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, it all began with a mistake. In 1951, Allen Dulles, later appointed director of Central Intelligence, received a report from military sources that the Russians had bought 50 million doses of a new drug from Sandoz Pharmaceuticals in Basel, Switzerland. A follow-up memo stated that Sandoz had an additional ten kilos - about 100 million doses - of the drug, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25), available for sale on the open market</p>

<p>Dulles was alarmed. From the beginning, LSD was lauded by military and intelligence scientists working on chemical warfare compounds and mind-control experiments as the most potent mind-altering substance known to man. “Infinitesimally small amounts of LSD can completely destroy the sanity of a human being for considerable periods of time (or possibly permanently),” stated an October 1953 CIA memo. In the wrong hands, 100 million doses would be enough to sabotage a whole nation&#39;s mental equilibrium.</p>

<p>Dulles convened a high-level committee of CIA and Pentagon officials who agreed the agency should buy the entire Sandoz LSD supply lest the KGB acquire it first. Two agents were dispatched to Switzerland with a black bag containing $240,000.</p>

<p>In fact, Sandoz had produced only about 40 grams of LSD in the ten years since its psychoactive features were first discovered by Albert Hofmann. According to a 1975 CIA document, the U.S. Military attaché in Switzerland had miscalculated by a factor of one million in his CIA reports because he did not know the difference between a milligram (1 /1,000 of a gram) and a kilogram (1,000 grams).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a deal was struck. The CIA would purchase all of Sandoz&#39;s potential output of LSD. (Later, when the Eli Lilly Company of Indianapolis perfected a process to synthesize LSD, agency officials insisted on a similar agreement.) An internal CIA memo to Dulles declared the agency would have access to “tonnage quantities.” All that remained was for agency heads to figure out what to do with it.</p>

<p>Your narrative is: &quot;the CIA are heavily involved in the drug trade&quot;. Fair enough, tbh I don&#39;t doubt it. </p>

<p>Your tactics: &quot;disseminate information you know to be false&quot;. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if you are doing this to supposedly stimulate discussion.

<p>You do realise that the &quot;alternative theories and ideas&quot; are completely unfounded, right?  Like, it takes a special kind of dumbass to believe that <a href="http://worldtruth.tv/big-study-vaccinated-kids-2-5-more-diseases-than-unvaccinated/">this study</a> has any grounds for legitimacy at all.  The sample group is completely non-random, the study was funded by Google Adwords revenue, it&#39;s authored by a &quot;homeopathic practitioner&quot;, and hasn&#39;t been peer-reviewed by anyone (for good reason, it&#39;d be shot down in a heartbeat for failing to follow even a hint of scientific method - but i guess you can&#39;t expect any respect for science from a &quot;homeopathic practitioner&quot;)</p>

<p><strong>This website is an echo chamber for the paranoid.</strong></p>

<p>As for your article, it&#39;s copied (sourced) from worldnewsdailyreport.com, which is even more out-there than the one you posted.  Featured under it&#39;s &quot;Most Popular&quot; section the following articles (i&#39;m thinking &quot;stories&quot; would be a better descriptor):</p>

<p>So they were crossing the border, but not via the roadways? It was never specified, although I&#39;m assuming that. However, I&#39;ve seen parts of the border in Texas, near El Paso and I just never realized that there are areas where an SUV can travel towards the border, in a vehicle kicking up dust, undetected from miles away and up to the border. Either the article is leaving out vast amounts of information or the article is BS. I suspect the latter.</p>

<p>that movie with tom hanks, charlie wilson&#39;s wa, is all about our clandestine CIA proxy war in afghanistan, painting him as a hero for submitting fictious budget requests to fund it (i.e. lying to and defrauding the american people, and embelizing from the US govt). the cocaine running began when his ability to get a way with that waned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually somewhat regular here. I see this sub get raided a lot by right wing and alt-right sites, so we are on the same page, so I was actually mocking your generalization of us, although I see now that may not have been apparent, just now looking back at my chosen wording. A lot of us are skeptical of conspiracy theory but we are willing to at least lend our attention. </p>

<p>The OP article doesn&#39;t read as satire, so I believe this is more a case where a report or a media outlet falls into the category of fake news. Satire would have been more easily forgiven if not only because satire never seeks to mislead. This is not satire because it made no attempt at humor, or otherwise Poe&#39;s law comes into play. </p>

<p>In any case, fake news, satire or otherwise, OP admitted their mistake and made it clear that they left the post in hopes of having an opportunity to discuss the very well documented and real topic of CIA drug running in the developing world. One fake news story doesn&#39;t make it all fake. It&#39;s not even a <em>theory</em> we are discussing here, it is an <em>actual</em> historically documented issue and can be confirmed most definitively through various FOIA releases from recent years. Some believe there were related conspiracies that the U.S. CIA perpetrated against the people of the world, while being somewhat effective at taking down international drug lords, but particularly negatively affecting the poverty of the affected developing nations, Columbia, Panama, and so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct, but you have to keep in mind Reddit&#39;s ongoing struggle with maintaining the autonomy of individual subreddit communities. As it stands, subreddit moderators still don&#39;t have meaningful ways to analyze their participation and maybe this is for the best, but it frequently leads to brigading and raids that take a huge frequency uptick during news events, like elections, but leaving banning and deletion as the only methods for moderation. </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near a perfect overview, but we could get a better insight if we had some trained linguistics analysis  of the alt-right vs. neutral comments and ran some numbers considering commenters&#39; newness and their loyalty to their various subreddits in which they participate. It would be even more insightful if we could see an internal report on driveby post/comment voters and their traffic sources. It would be nice if these were statistics publicly available to any subreddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing about most conspiracy theorists, they don&#39;t actually want to think critically, they just want to think that they do. </p>

<p>Most of them have latched on to certain beliefs/theories and blindly believe them no matter what, looking for every piece of &#39;evidence&#39; they can as long as it fits their already constructed narrative, and ignoring everything that goes against it.</p>

<p>This exact sort of shit is part of why no one takes somewhat realistic conspiracies seriously. It&#39;s funny that so many conspiracy theorists believe that a shadow government employs shills on the internet to discredit them, when they already do such a flawless job of that to themselves.</p>

<p>A fuckton of people here are inclined to believe whatever they want to be true, do no research of their own, don&#39;t fact check their own side of the story let alone any contrary perspectives, and this is the result, a subreddit which is more of a joke than this article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% the CIA is running drugs from Mexico but this story does seem a little odd. I just have a hard time believing the CIA was unable to pull rank in this situation.  Regardless the intentions of the Minutemen they would have to know their lives were on the line. The CIA agents also would be able to make a few calls. Those calls would 99.9% allow the CIA Agents to walk away, no mention to press and a fat little cash bonus in the accounts of the minutemen....... that or dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my theory. </p>

<p>1: The receipt- simple one here. Its easy to make up a story about getting busted by the cops . If you hand the cops a receipt it&#39;s so unusual that the media is surely going to report on it. guaranteed. </p>

<p>why worry about the media knowing about the receipt the cartel has nothing to hide that people don&#39;t already know. As for the C.I.A involvement in all this staying quite,they could care either way. Just reading a headline on a conspiracy site on the internet sounds so far-fetched that people make up there mind before even looking into the facts. </p>

<ol>
<li>C.I.A involvement?-  They need to get funding from somewhere thats tax free and off grid for their little private wars they have going on. What better way to do that other than drugs? When they presented themselves as C.I.A agents it probably tied down any other minutemen and most defiently called in other forms of law enforcement.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>So nobody in this buisness transaction was nor is scared of being outed. They are both pretty much &quot;above the law.&quot; This was a distraction. I&#39;m betting something way more valuable made its way across the border while the people watching the border were busy giving chase. </p>

<p>Not saying it happened, or they did cover it. But, I mean, they an organization of that nature, they got the means to. And tbh if some lurker who cba to even read the articles or source it for themselves (me) can think of it as an idea, then the team to handle this sort of PR must have at least toyed with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A retraction would be you saying &quot;yes, this story is completely false, but you shouldn&#39;t let that detract from the very real history of the CIA doing shady shit with drugs, and here&#39;s why...&quot; Whereas what you actually did was say, and I&#39;ll quote you directly here,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>with the amount of attention this thread is receiving, I figured it would be beneficial to point out what many redditors have said.
The source of this story as well as other attempts at finding more information on it indicate it originates from satire websites.
While it&#39;s important to be critical of any information, I believe we need more verification of this story and it&#39;s claims.
Although I&#39;m not going to let this go to waste, as there is a long history of CIA involvement in drug running and other black market scandals. While we are here, I think it&#39;s important to collaborate, post, and share other information and dots that can be used to see a bigger picture of what the CIA has dipped it&#39;s hands into and done. I&#39;ve edited my post below with additional links provided, please feel free to contribute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so no where in your diatribe do you say explicitly &quot;this is fake and ought to be considered false.&quot;  All you do is suggest that the story might be true, we just need to find a better source.  You should not have a headline that says what your post says if you can not provide even an iota of evidence in favor of it, that is irresponsible and it actually leads people to be marginally more likely to dismiss conspiracies immediately.  </p>

<p>So many people have said this already, but if you really care about finding &quot;the truth&quot; then you need to remove this thread, it makes the whole issue of CIA involvement in the drug trade look like it has less veracity.</p>

<p>Now that is literally the bare minimum that you need to do, come out and say without any qualification that the story that you have referred to in your post has no basis in anything empirical.  At this point the case for a removal is so plain that I&#39;m worried you are letting your ego get in the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not trying to be overly critical, but that&#39;s not really an excuse.  Make a thread titled &quot;CIA drug trafficking&quot;--a real problem with loads of evidence presented in a way that diverse groups of people can understand.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but a satirical story that was discussed under the pretense of being real is a bad place for discussion and destroys credibility to those who don&#39;t give a closer look, i.e. most people.  </p>

<p>If this place is a circle jerk, it&#39;s just an internet forum that has no effect on the real world, and which contributes to the stigma against trying to find the truth behind the mainstream story.</p>
