       If you've been watching George Webb you'll have heard of how "development organizations" are used to essentially bleed countries dry. Like Haiti Libya etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Justin Trudeau has recently accepted flights and a stay at the Aga Khans private island. The Aga Khan is the fourth Aga Khan and is seen as the imam (leader) of Shia muslims, he doesn't rule over any land, he has a net worth of around a billion dollars, and he has many many private enterprises.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aga_Khan_IV">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aga_Khan_IV
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "He is the founder and chairman of the Aga Khan Development Network, one of the largest private development networks in the world. The organisation has said it works toward improvement of the environment, health, education, architecture, culture, microfinance, rural development, disaster reduction, the promotion of private-sector enterprise and the revitalisation of historic cities."
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that sound familiar to anyone? It's almost a carbon copy of the mission of the Clintons crew when they go into a country. Micro financing is a known debt trap and the Aga Khan is operating one of the biggest implementation networks of micro financing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.akdn.org/our-agencies/aga-khan-agency-microfinance">
        http://www.akdn.org/our-agencies/aga-khan-agency-microfinance
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly don't like that Trudeau didn't see this as a conflict of interest or a kick back. Not to mention I don't agree with anything the Aga Khan stands for. He can claim all these progressive intentions but the core of his belief system contradicts all of it. And he is the leader of this belief system. I wonder which he is more inclined to support?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
       <a href="http://grameen-jameel.com/first-microfinance-institution-syria-fmfi-s/">

       </a>
       Aga Khan sponsoring micro finance in Syria
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Aga Khan has been on Canada's pay roll for awhile
       <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/qlfd-dns/qd-lstngs/gftsfrmhrmjsty-lst-eng.html">

       </a>
       you'll notice Clintons on there too
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
       <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/sec.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/the-law-page/canada-revenue-agency-delists-foreign-charities/article20104693/%3Fservice%3Damp">
        https://www.google.ca/amp/s/sec.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/the-law-page/canada-revenue-agency-delists-foreign-charities/article20104693/%3Fservice%3Damp
       </a>
       all of a sudden in 2014 the CRA delisted the Aga Khan and Clintons as approved foreign charities. So any donations to them wouldn't be a taxable donation. This has to be telling of something because Canada penalizes donations to Aga Khan and Aga Khans response is to giving Trudeau paid in full vacations????
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Aga Khan has been reinstated as a donor but that certification expires on March 20th. It will probably be renewed now. The Woodrow Wilson scholar fund is registered until 2018 as well

       Nothing mentioned here has crossed my radar even alil. At one point I was a bit worried about his extreme pro Muslim stance.

       But here in Canada his recent vacation did cause alil uproar, just because of the cost.

       I voted liberal and have since been eating my hat. I knew we were in trouble when he said his "because it's 2015" comment. Such pandering nonsense. It was in reply to a question of why was his cabinet 50 percent men and 50 percent women. I don't care if it's 100% women or 100 percent men I just want the best person for the job. For him to say "because it's 2015" is implying that he made it 50/50 for diversities sake which would mean that people did not receive positions because they were the best person for the job. Tack on his back tracking on electoral reform, inaction on Bill C-51, support for TPP that is hopefully dead, pay for access, and now clearly taking gifts from a foreign influence and I'm at the least a little disenfranchised.

       Despite what people will say about his father, Pierre Trudeau garnered respect from all leaders he met. Except maybe the Queen but she isn't exactly a politician now is she haha. But the man was extremely well educated and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms of 1982 was his crowning achievement in my opinion. Was it easy pickings? Maybe but someone had to do and do it right which I think he did. He stayed out of Canadians bedrooms and legalized abortion. His old man was the man but Junior is not up to snuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as weed goes I think that's one thing he actually will come through on because he's gonna need those brownie points with the young voters again. The report released by his committee on legalization was pretty spot on and awesome in my opinion. Except for their stance on edibles. He will legalize if only to try and save his second term. And I think it'll work unfortunately.

       No hidden facts here boss. They Fidel and Margret weren't even in the same country a month prior or a month before contraception. That being said it's common sense. Like as simple as it can get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just pointing out your statement about Snopes.  Snopes has been a around long before fake news on facebook. Maybe some fella or whoever you trust doesn't like them, that's fine. But they seem to do thier job well. You don't need to like them or trust them. Thats fine. But that just shows me, that users like you are why I have a hard time on reddit. I can prove or say, or even provide sources. But if it doesn't suit your narrative then, it's all garbage and fake news. It was your claim, show me your source. Your legitimate source that Fidel is Justins dad. If not then, have a good night sir.

       And the best, that I've come across has been the simple math of Trudeau's wife, Justins mother not being anywhere near Castro, 9 months prior. 
Also at the time Trudeau and his wife were under extreme scrutiny for their age difference. The wife couldn't make it to the store with out being followed and questioned by the media.

       But whoever wants to dismiss common biology and simple math, will most definitely be the ones that believe that Fidel fathered him.

       Herberto Padillas arrest was carried out on March 20th. Key writer against Castro. Castro gave a speech in Cuba April 1st. The thread you posted has literally nothing substantial in terms of documentation. Just picture comparisons and unconfirmed allegations.

       Castro and Margaret Trudeau would have to have conceived their secret love-child between March 16th and April 22nd, 1971.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be noted that Margaret and Pierre Trudeau were secretly wed on March 4th 1971, and honeymooned until March 8th. When they returned she moved in with Prime Minister for the first time. If ever there were a time to make a baby and have it be born in late December, it would have been then, as hinted at in a Harper’s Bazaar profile of Margaret:

       I'm waiting for him, since he originally made the claim the the onus is on him. We have stated our side, proven with science. But wasn't enough. Again the onus is on him, and if he can't prove or provide me with evidence that either proves his claim or discredits mine, I'll go on about my day.

       You don't accept that Fidel and Margret weren't near each other 7 to 10 months prior to Justins birth?

       I think it's only a conspiracy when the official narrative says one thing, but facts and evidence say another...you need to brush up on a few subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       To deny facts and evidence isnt going to help you in life.

       Send me a link with your facts and evidence that Justin is Castros dad. I'm sure I'll get a decent laugh
