<p>This man cannot form coherent sentences that are expected of a person who has been college educated and in work all his life.  His abilities have deteriorated rapidly after he hit 65 years old. </p>

<p>His moods are concerning, he seems to only have the ability to be aloof or irritable and the most trivial or neurotic issues seem to bother him the most.</p>

<p>He can&#39;t remember his own stated positions, or what he&#39;s recorded as saying, or what he even types out himself on Twitter. </p>

<p>His ability to read facts or understand factual information has rapidly deteriorated with his age, too. </p>

<p>Look, having nuclear—my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart—you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world—it’s true!—but when you’re a conservative Republican they try—oh, do they do a number—that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune—you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged—but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me—it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right—who would have thought?), but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners—now it used to be three, now it’s four—but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years—but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t compare a guy who has thrived on living in the public eye for most of his life to a nerdy kid who interacts with people only when absolutely necessary. Also how is a board meeting where trump had to justify how he lost all their money and still somehow gets another $800,000,000 loan a less stressful situation than talking to a massive crowd of people that are losing their shit at every other sentence you say? The energy of thousands of people stoked to see you would be a little nicer than staring down 10 rich fucks who are waiting on you to tell them how much money you (have or haven&#39;t) made them?</p>

<p>I mean by your own reasoning Hillary passing out wasn&#39;t all too strange given her age, I bet if you ask most 70 year olds they&#39;ve felt unstable on their feet now and again. </p>

I didn&#39;t see trump need a neurologist on the standby with an injectable dose of Diazepam.  I didn&#39;t see Trump coughing for minutes at a speech on Labor Day.  There are so many more.</p>

<p>Trump, in his book <em>Think Like a Champion</em></p>

<p>“What he has done is amazing. The fact that he accomplished what he has—in one year and against great odds—is truly phenomenal.” […]”Barack Obama proved that determination combined with opportunity and intelligence can make things happen—and in an exceptional way.” […]</p>

Don&#39;t care. Putin is a bad guy but he isn&#39;t relevant, no matter how you talk him up. If he was a bad bad guy, he would have taken the bait and started WWIII over Syria.</p>

<p>Yeah, some have been saying that a long time. Her shoulders too wide, her walk to manly, the bulge in her crotch occasionally. I think there was mention that Barack was in a gang of gay guys when he was younger.</p>

<p>With all that said and this being the last week of his presidency, what&#39;s the conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we can discuss on this sub Joe Biden having possible dementia, discuss the fact he does have some possible symptoms, we can certainly discuss that being the case for Trump as well.</p>

<p>We must be non-partisan in our theorizing. If we continue to step away from unbiased theorizing, we will end up missing some real and possibly blatant conspiracies.</p>

<p>I know that Biden has some signs of dementia. And thank you to OP, I will be investigating these signs in Trump. Because that&#39;s what we do here. We investigate. </p>

<p>I mean, Trump&#39;s Dr. report was obviously faked. That does not mean he is not in good health, but it is something to look into. </p>
