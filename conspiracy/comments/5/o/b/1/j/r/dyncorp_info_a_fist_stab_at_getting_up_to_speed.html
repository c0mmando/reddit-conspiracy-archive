I’m going to tell you right now that there’s going to be a DynCorp person always involved in the pile of bodies. The other murders are just cover murders, but it’s going to be DynCorp, and I think you’ll find that’s true.” <a href="https://theinternationalreporter.org/2017/01/13/bombshell-solving-the-puzzle-its-dyncorp-behind-the-mass-shootings-you-see-in-america/">https://theinternationalreporter.org/2017/01/13/bombshell-solving-the-puzzle-its-dyncorp-behind-the-mass-shootings-you-see-in-america/</a>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s almost as if there&#39;s an internal battle in the US state apparatus. A battle between the forces of dark and light.<br/>
A minority who have a conscience and fight to defend the Constitution and human rights. Versus an occult satanic majority who revel in causing as much harm and destruction as possible.<br/>
But it&#39;s an uphill struggle. Pedophiles are placed in positions of power because they are not only part of the &#39;club&#39; but they&#39;re also forever compliant. Corruption is encouraged because it reinforces an &#39;Us vs. Them&#39; mentality. 
If the average citizen could acknowledge the inherent depravity of state power we would begin to be able to cleanse ourselves from this cancer.<br/>
The satanic elites retain power for as long as the silent majority refuse to believe that these elites are guilty of the crimes we theorists believe them to be. </p>

I was probably reading your compilation just as you were commenting here.  I&#39;d seen a little bit about what went on in Bosnia with DynCorp.  But there&#39;s so much more in the book excerpts that you put together.  It&#39;s yet another illustration of global corporatism, at its worst, run amok. Your compilation is an effective way to get the info out.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like what you have done I have been thinking about for a while about these PMC&#39;s Private Military Contractor&#39;s and why the Government uses them with quotes from articles on here <a href="https://www.thefreelibrary.com/">https://www.thefreelibrary.com/</a> </p>

<p>It boils down to lack of transparency, accountability, if a Private contractor comes back in a body bag it doesn&#39;t go on the American or British Soldiers casulty list.  Also as seen in the articles and books they can just sack those who break the law or whistle blow without any direct bad press coming back to the Government.  Less laws and quicker mobilization.  They can just say they were police officers or civilians that came under fire and had to act in self defense.</p>
