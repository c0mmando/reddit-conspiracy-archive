       I agree that it doesn't matter who we vote for, nothing is going to change from the trajectory we've been on for about the past 30 years. Personally I'll be voting for Gary Johnson, if nothing else just to get the LP to the 5% needed to get automatic ballot access next election.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that accusing anyone who disagrees of being CTR is just a way to stifle meaningful discussion. Every time I see a post about how this sub has recently transformed into r/The_Donald 2.0 (which is
       <strong>
        really
       </strong>
       has) the top comments are all accusing them of being CTR. The entire culture of this sub is now identical to r/The_Donald, where anyone who disagrees gets downvoted to oblivion, shamed to death, and accused of being a shill. The only difference is that those posts aren't censored here yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is a conspiracy sub, we should be trying to find the
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       , not assuming we already know it and that no one could possibly deviate from your own opinion without being paid to do so.

       I do hate how "But Trump!!!" shuts down so much criticism of Hillary.  Seeing anyone who has genuine enthusiasm for either one is kind of disgusting.  Despite all that, I actually think the reputability of the "conspiracy movement" is skyrocketing as Wikileaks keeps dripping.

       nah that's right a lot of you seem to be falling for the exact same scam run last time using Obama, where a guy shows up to act as a 'strong upstart against hillary clinton' and
       <em>
        says
       </em>
       all the right things and promises all these wonderful changes, and the stupid people believe it as always.
      </p>
      <p>
       in reality anyone supporting trump is just supporting a clinton donor and long-time family friend / Bill's golfing buddy Trump who has been set up to take over her "opposition".

       sure man, only those are facts and they don't change regardless of who's talking about them, you can choose to pretend it's "CTR", or you can just deal with the reality that those are facts and you're watching the american equivalent of Putin's wife being set up to "run against" a long-time Putin donor and family friend, which again, is what Trump is to the Clintons - and a bunch of dumb people believe it's actual political contest/competition, instead of a false struggle to keep people thinking they've got skin in the game of 'politics'(in the form seen on TV).

      <p>
       only stupid people and young people who haven't seen this happen over and over keep falling for the same scams over and over again. Trump is just the republican version of Obama being used to calm the stupid people down by tricking them (AGAIN) into thinking that they're being represented and "they got their guy in" and "they beat the corruption" - it's literally the exact same scam that was run on people using Obama, and one of the actors (Clinton) is the same, playing the same roll. Obama has just been replaced by Clinton donor Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       it does not matter which of them wins, it's just obscenely rich people jockeying for social position on TV. That's all. Some day people will deal with it by getting involved in politics on a local and state level instead of just sitting around whining about 1 or 2 presidential candidates every 4 years. Until then they'll keep kidding themselves into thinking that sticking a sign in their front yard and whining about 1 of two random individuals every 4-8 years is "politics".

       I didn't in any way say anything about violence, maybe that's on your mind but it's not on mine. What I meant by "people will deal with it" is they'll stop being fooled by their TV sets and the internet into thinking that a single election for a single office in DC every 4-8 years is going to change the world and realize that if they want to improve things in their country then they need to be proactive and involved in their own lives on a local and state political level and through their efforts and attention/interest/passion rejuvenate their democratic institutions and hold the people within those systems legally accountable. Some day people will deal with it by getting involved in politics on a local and state level instead of just sitting around whining about 1 or 2 presidential candidates every 4 years while thinking they're being politically involved!
      </p>
      <p>
       as for D. Trump, you think there's nothing fishy about the fact that a Clinton has been set up to "run against" her own donor and family friend/her husband's golfing buddy? Remind you of anything? Just like Bush II being set up to "run against" his own frat brother and fellow Bonesman, Al Gore? Does this not seem at all suspicious to you? Just because he says one thing doesn't mean it's actually true, same as Obama's campaign speeches and promises were just rhetorical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gee, what a mysterious surprise that a Clinton donor like Trump showed up at the exact time necessary to completely take over Clinton II's opposition - what a coincidence suddenly some ridiculous rich guy connected to the Clinton family and existing
       <em>
        firmly within
       </em>
       "the establishment" showed up to co-opt the energies of all the people who think they're "anti-establishment", by saying all the right things to do that, just like Obama did.
      </p>
      <p>
       do you actually think I'm a ctr shill?  you can feel free to look through my comments history, one of my recent posts is about Clinton eating a baby. Calling anyone who points out these facts to you a shill doesn't make it a fact, and ignoring/pretend facts aren't facts doesn't change them. It doesn't really matter which of the two get elected, just like it didn't
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       matter whether Obama or Romney got elected, or Bush II or his frat brother Gore, now it's Clinton II vs. her donor and family friend, archetypal rich guy Donald Trump. These people just use caricatures of extreme political difference, like the aforementioned people, to disguise the realities of overwhelming political indifference to most US citizens by some of the people who have gotten themselves into power in DC.
      </p>
      <p>
       the same exact strategies are used every presidential election year. the same types of men say the same types of things. Are you saying that's not true? Exactly what in my post are you calling a lie? What's not true about it?

       Far more than 90% of the posts are political, and many of them push talking points straight out of Breitbart, Zerohedge, and Wiki Leaks that have little to do with the classic "conspiracy."

       Throwing your support behind them and declaring them a savior? Exactly what historians have said when they write about the great fascists of history who get elected on their "good decision making" and "winner" projection without providing any evidence for either claim, or providing any specifics on what they want to do. Instead they just attack anyone who disagrees with then as being the enemy of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I joined the conspiracy movement this kind of fasicst detection was your introductory lesson. Nowadays people have thrown in with a candidate who is the epitome of what the movement originally stood against because you're so used to hating someone who is objectively better in every metric by which people claim the other candidates superiority. She's still shit, but everything people throw against her (dishonest, corrupt, warhawk, explosive) it is absolutely impossible to try and say that trump is better in anyway about any of those. He's a petulant child who has had success bought for him, the real life equivalent of Joffrey. Hillary may be cersei, and we still need to watch and fight her, but to say that voting for him is better is ludicrous.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's truly incredible how manipulated this movement has become.

       Noone is falling in line behind anyone, but I am sure you are discussing Trump.
He is no more or less authoritarian than Clinton.
If they are supporting him its because he has an underdog chance of stopping war.
Thats it. Just a chance. Probably wont stop war with Syria either way, but Hillary is different.
