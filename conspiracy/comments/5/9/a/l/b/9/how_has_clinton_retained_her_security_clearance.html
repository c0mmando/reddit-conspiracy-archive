Even with the clear evidence and testimony to mishandling and stated negligence with classified material she has kept or will be granted a security clearance of the highest magnitude as president. How?
Seems to me it would be an absolute given that she loses it with even what we know are facts from the congressional hearings alone.</p>

<p>No one else would keep a security clearance after what she has testified herself. She didnt know what (c) meant. She forgot everything from security briefings because of her concussion. She used multiple devices she was told she could not use. She mailed a laptop with classified material. She allowed her lawyers, who had no security clearance,  to go through her emails to pick which ones were personal. She used a personal server which lacked even basic  encryption.</p>

<p>Government security is put in place for the protection of the people it serves. She has put all of us in danger and will be granted a security clearance as president despite her carelessness and recklessness. </p>

There is no plausible answer to your question other than government collusion / corruption within the executive branch of the government at very high levels.

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton is untouchable much like the old mob bosses and gangsters.</p>

<p>She is a Bilderberg member with deep ties to Wall St. and Big Banking. One could argue she committed treason in her dealings with the Bilderberg group while SOS. </p>

<p>As far as her gross mishandling of MASSIVE amounts of classified data, she gets a pass. Due to her status in the establishment, nothing will happen to her. A Four-Star General is likely going to prison for doing far less than she did, basically confirming some information. Another Four-Star General was charged for mishandling classified information for a biography and plead guilty. Both of these men did FAR LESS than her and were dealt with harshly. (If anyone deserved a break for their crimes it was probably one of the decorated veterans not some soulless blood-sucking politician.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s this pattern of behavior that almost had me supporting Trump at the start of the campaigns. (But then Trump turned out to be a prick.) This election is a choice between bad (Trump) and evil (Hillary).</p>

<p>The saddest part is that even if we manage to find some rogue FBI element to cut through her bullshit and build a case, then we miraculously found a prosecutor who wanted to gamble with his/her career, and found a judge willing to hear it and managed to score a conviction, the President would overturn it.</p>

<p>the DoD had its PCs rootkitted ten years or so ago (source The Register), they only discovered this during a software upgrade.</p>
