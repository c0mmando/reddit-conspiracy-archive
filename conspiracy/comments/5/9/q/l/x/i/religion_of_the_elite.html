    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll throw down this occult knowledge I have that I just posted on another thread.</p>

<p>This Tesla <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f37f34694bcb57965dd81903a0b72292?convert_to_webp=true">Quote</a> sums it up nicely IMO.</p>

<p>The stars are able to predict the future because the stars are not what you think they are. Don&#39;t you think since we move 300 million KM around the sun (According to you) we would see some movement of the stars. Saturn is vibrating at a certain frequency to create the hexagon, all sounds affect us, we have bodies that are frequency based. Now this may blow your mind a little because many people are not into Shamanism or anything of the sorts. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll use as many sources as I can. First of all, if we get to a good frequency, in theory we will not get sick.
<a href="http://energyfanatics.com/2011/12/07/relationship-between-diseases-energy-frequency/">http://energyfanatics.com/2011/12/07/relationship-between-diseases-energy-frequency/</a></p>

<p>Next is realizing that the earth and our bodies according to science like being at 528hz, in the article above they are claiming a higher frequency is needed to remove all illness, which I personally believe.</p>

<p>Here is another video to show you how different shapes are created simply by creating sound. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJAgrUBF4w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJAgrUBF4w</a></p>

<p>Like I said before the earth and our bodies like 528 hz and that&#39;s where we are resting. Through the combination of the rubber shoes we wear, they block the connection our bodies have to the earth. And also here&#39;s the big one, Saturn vibrating at the frequency it does, I don&#39;t know which hopefully someone might be able to help me here. It vibrates at a lower frequency to lower our vibrational state. It creates the hexagon at the pole because of this fact. It may even affect the earth and make it vibrate at a different frequency which lowers the entire earths vibration. All in all Saturn vibrates and it affects us and our environment. The food we eat also affects our vibrational state which is why many herbal doctors recommend eating only living foods and what many refer to as an alkaline diet, or high frequency diet, which removes all of the mucus from our bodies.</p>

<p>The Jewish religion symbolized by the hexagon because they are aware of the hexagon affecting humans through Saturn. If you worship Satanism or anything of the sorts you will also know they worship Saturn. It&#39;s not that they bow down to the planet, it&#39;s that they acknowledge what it is doing. The pyramids were from past civilizations where the frequency was higher, they symbolized marijuana and other drugs because they are the keys, do you see how Shamanism and all of the sorts fit together into all of this like a jig-saw puzzle? Shamans have raised their vibration, and also many of us have. There are two standard personality types that conspiracy attracts, they are both on the anti social side of the spectrum because people of higher vibration realize the world is a shitshow pretty early on, at least I know I did. When I learned in school early on that everyone in the entire country learns roughly the same shit I realized something was really wrong. How could there be so many world problems and yet we are taught all this redundant CRAP.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/639279/SCIENTISTS-discover-invisible-alien-entities-spying-on-us-on-Earth">http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/639279/SCIENTISTS-discover-invisible-alien-entities-spying-on-us-on-Earth</a></p>

<p>They have dominion over the earth in my opinion. Now I will trust you&#39;re a good soul because I truly believe it&#39;s fate to determine which side you end up on. (The devils or Gods) As I said before, people on conspiracy are generally of the higher vibrational state. We are souls which affect ourselves, if we have a strong high vibration soul we will be able to pick up on the higher knowledge because of our natural ability of being high vibration. We are immortal beings that are currently in such a low vibration on this earth that we forget who we are, for that reason we are just playing a game so make sure you have fun and you learn and research.</p>

<p>The stars as I&#39;ve just showed you with my quick write up above are not what you think they are, and neither are planets. I am everything. Good luck doing so, if I can recommend some magic mushrooms in a large dose I would do that. I am not a religious person of any religion you have heard I simply follow the path of self improvement and stop nowhere, I just keep going higher. Much love to all if you have any questions PM me, I am happy to help you all on your journey. &lt;3 I do natural drugs and keep an open mind to what can be good for me. I do fasting and eat generally a KETO diet. </p>

<p>I hope this has helped, reply to this with questions I&#39;ll answer them. It&#39;s basically a run down of what their religion is speaking about. They are all aware that this frequency is keeping everyone low and dumb, so to combat it you must do everything to raise vibration. I suggest taking magic mushrooms because we have a lot of emotional baggage and mushrooms will remove it in large doses. I have never had a bad trip it just sort of happened for me one day TBH. I never knew what I was getting into. They say don&#39;t play with magic if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing. I did chaos magic which is where you delete your belief system. I created an entirely new one which revolves around frequency and how it affects us and our world.</p>

<p>Cheers much love.</p>

<p>Edit: Thank you for the up votes everything I post gets sent from the heart, even if it&#39;s met with hateful words I am always trying to improve the way I convey my message for all. PM me anytime with questions but try to read my post history before you do and ask from there so that I don&#39;t repeat myself much. Our world is highly complex and everything is connected.</p>

To me, right now we are seeing a point in time where the people of the world are increasingly waking up out of the religious coma and realizing that it&#39;s all bullshit. This is why TPTB are pushing for World War. They want billions to die off so they can start with a clean slate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kabbalah is not religion in the sense we mean it today. Kabbalah is purely unhuman - not in the negative sense - it just doesn&#39;t care for the man as an individual, but as a living cell of something greater which has inside itself all the elements that were used to build the universe too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s way more like an hermetic philosophy than a religion. It was the way of ancient jews (haunted) to stock and use their higher knowledge of worldly mechanics to have a shot at ruling the world through the perfect ruling of themselves.</p>

<p>To say so, it was aimed to decipher the &quot;assembly code&quot; of reality through intuition. The abstract teaching was not supposed to make you enlightened in itself, but to disclose a deeper reality into yourself where those things supposedly started working into yourself unconsciounsly and free you (after due intentionally focused time, like all things tho) from your blindness and denial.</p>

<p>It was and is probably the best shot of humanity at spiritual freedom and knowledge. What you do after that though, i guess it depends on the individual. Jesus had actually a very firm grasp of kabbalah and tried to spread a &quot;soft form&quot; to that part of the mass that was willing to learn. 
You can put christians at fault for how they treated jesus message the very same way those &quot;elites&quot; did with the kabbalah.
In kabbalah there are 3 important &quot;veils&quot;, and just the first one is the complete death of ego.</p>

<p>They have been here the whole time and are spoken about in every religious text ever written. Know thyself.</p>

<p>Also keep calling me crazy it does not bother me. I willfully choose to write this all over the internet and have people call me crazy and such because I know there are people out there who will read what I have written and it will strike a cord in them. The world is portrayed as a massive ring of information. The ring the world presents is 100km long for example. The true ring it stems from is simply 500 meters long. I am trying to break down the world for everyone so that they can see the truth instead of being stuck in the 99.5KM of half truths and lies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have studied gnostics before kabbalah and they actually got me there.
Gnostics are very entrenched with the tree of life and the christ is actually a symbol of one of the sephiroth (ancient meaning was beauty).
Gnostics also have very good keys to jesus thought and a lot of gospels that represent it better than the officials.
Ancient gnosticism is very mysterious, but the relation with judaism goes unquestioned i think although if you asked me now i don&#39;t recall exact sources. 66% or so of my studies have been on <a href="http://www.gnosticteachings.org">www.gnosticteachings.org</a> and others different gnostic sources.
To add to that (which could be little or more depending how fond of gnosis you are), The unofficial gospels (and to some degree the officials where they weren&#39;t corrupted) use very kabbalistic &quot;forms&quot;.
Like, the holy trinity Jesus talked about is a key point of the kabbalah since much before him.</p>

<p>But, as if on cue, this just popped up on VC:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t believe in religion, per se (imo) and I&#39;d say it depends on the rank of said elite individual(s). The top (imo), it&#39;s occult texts passed down by ancient mystery/majick schools (esoteric). Mysticism I presume would be a major part of this, along with alchemy and astrology. The underlings may be religious though, think of politicians and CEO&#39;s, etc etc. </p>

<p>They have been here the whole time and are spoken about in every religious text ever written. Know thyself.</p>

<p>Also keep calling me crazy it does not bother me. I willfully choose to write this all over the internet and have people call me crazy and such because I know there are people out there who will read what I have written and it will strike a cord in them. The world is portrayed as a massive ring of information. The ring the world presents is 100km long for example. The true ring it stems from is simply 500 meters long. I am trying to break down the world for everyone so that they can see the truth instead of being stuck in the 99.5KM of half truths and lies. </p>
