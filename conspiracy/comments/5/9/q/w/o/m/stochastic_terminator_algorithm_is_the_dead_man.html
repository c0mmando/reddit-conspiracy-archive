      <p>
       Let's rewind a bit and understand how Wikileaks works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange has stated that he has multiple servers in data centers across Europe publishing the information on autopilot. This sounds to me like he has many redundant servers with different hosts so if one is taken down the rest continue to operate. Submissions are done automatically with CRON jobs or something. In order to take Wikileaks down they would have to get ALL of these servers, or use a blanket attack like a DDOS (which did happen).
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings us to the Stochastic Terminator algorithm being "updated". If this should refer to the algorithm that drops leaks on autopilot, then wouldn't he have to update every damn one of those servers across Europe with the algorithm?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Stochastic Terminator" can be loosely interpreted as "Random Killer" or "Switch Dead". Dead Man Switch. If it was just their leak algorithm, then "Stochastic Publishing algorithm" would make way more sense. Why use the word "Terminator"?
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes more sense (to me) that the Stochastic Terminator algorithm is actually the Dead Man Switch, and the "update" that was Tweeted basically means,
       <em>
        Dead Man Switch has been activated
       </em>
       resulting in specific material (contingency) now coming down the pipeline instead of just leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three pre-commitments were made on Oct 16, the same day Assange supposedly met with Pam Anderson:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        pre-commitment 1: John Kerry 4bb96075acadc3d80b5ac872874c3037a386f4f595fe99e687439aabd0219809
       </li>
       <li>
        pre-commitment 2: Ecuador eae5c9b064ed649ba468f0800abf8b56ae5cfe355b93b1ce90a1b92a48a9ab72
       </li>
       <li>
        pre-commitment 3: UK FCO f33a6de5c627e3270ed3e02f62cd0c857467a780cf6123d2172d80d02a072f74
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The pre-commitments are, as most people have described, hashes that prove a file hasn't been modified since the time it was created. Usually these are followed by leaked document downloads so people can get the files and verify they are authentic (without even opening the docs, since they are still encrypted). But whatever the files are, they haven't been released. These hashes are like Assange's trump card. What I think may be happening here is that he is about to be tortured to make a confession for
       <del>
        pedophilia
       </del>
       rape (my bad), but the hashes on these files will eventually exonerate him at a later date and prove the confessions he made were under duress. If we align this theory with the fact that Fox News reported an arrest was going to be made "within hours" on Oct 18th, and Pam Anderson visited him on Oct 16th where he said she "tortured him", it all fits. Very powerful political entities have been pulling strings to silence Assange any way possible, including that CIA-like front company Todd &amp; Clare. $20 million in equipment to keep him and the Embassy under surveillance. We cannot forget how many cards are stacked against him. It's a wild theory, but I can't think of anything more obvious.

       Stochastic Terminator literally means random killer. They said they were now publishing on a schedule, rather than arbitrarily.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would wager it just means no longer "random" or at someone's whim. They are publishing to a cron on a whim (or when it's ready) and then the cron publishes it at times where it gets maximum publicity.
