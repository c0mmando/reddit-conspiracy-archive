       This is always a touchy subject.  I am not trying to be disrespectful to anyone who has been circumcised or has chosen to circumcise their child.  Full disclosure - I am a circumcised male.  My son is not.  His mother was against it and I was for it.  She said "do some research and find one reason why this surgery performed on our newborn is necessary".  So I set out to prove her wrong.  Neesless to say, outside of "cultural norms" and "religious reasons" I found absolutely ZERO reason to have my son's genitals "augmented".
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am not trying to be disrespectful to ANYONE who has been circumcised or has chosen to circumcise their child.  I am merely trying to open up an honest conversation regarding this very odd ritual.  All comments thoughts and ideas are welcome.

       Desensitizes the glands (tip) and makes orgasm less powerful. The orgasm is very powerful in the chakras. In monotheistic religions sexuality is a bad thing and only for married individuals for procreation. It's a control mechanism. Just my opinion. Thankfully my parents were rational hippies and didn't get me snipped..

       Question: Say you’re part of a fifth column in a nation, destroying it from within. But you mutilate yourselves in a way that makes it possible to out the members of your group by being forced to drop your pants. What’s the best way to hide among the natives? Force them to do it, too.

       Circumcision is a luciferian ritual of devil worship. It is trauma based mind control.
      </p>

       It is specifically designed to make men more savage and psychopathic.

       There's no reason for this stupid shit to continue. Male genital mutilation is the same horror of female genital mutilation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trauma based mind control. Messes with the natural function of the penis. Hurt people hurting people.

       There is also the conspiracy of selling the foreskin to be used in cosmetics. It's a huge industry of fraud, lies, and medical malpractice.

       It started the same way as most insane traditions: a 19th century  fundamentalist. Specifically, John Kellogg, who believed that circumcision would prevent phimosis, "uncleanliness", and sex.

       There
       <em>
        is

       evidence that suggests circumcision can prevent HIV.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Evidence supports that male circumcision prevents HIV infection in men who have sex with women.[1][2] In 2011, the WHO and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) stated that male circumcision could be an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention if carried out by well trained medical professionals and under clean conditions.[3][4][5] The United States Disease Control Center states that circumcision reduces the risk that a man will acquire HIV and other STIs from an infected female partner. [6]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also from the
       <a href="http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/">
        WHO
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is compelling evidence that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. Three randomized controlled trials have shown that male circumcision provided by well trained health professionals in properly equipped settings is safe. WHO/UNAIDS recommendations emphasize that male circumcision should be considered an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention in countries and regions with heterosexual epidemics, high HIV and low male circumcision prevalence.

       Studies done in Africa showed that circumcised African men were less likely to become infected with HIV than African men who weren't circumcised. It's convenient and relevant to do these studies on the African population because they have such high rates of HIV/AIDS, but as far as I know no one has suggested that lack of circumcision is the sole or major cause of the high rates.

       I'm not advocating circumcision, just trying to add some dimension/information to the discussion. For most men (especially in the first world) circumcision probably isn't the best choice, but that doesn't mean it can never be beneficial in any circumstance either.

       Funny how no one research the effect on HIV contraction of cutting folds of skin off the female genitalia in the same sanitary conditions in which male circumcision was studied, especially since uncircumcised females are 2-3x more likely to contract HIV from unprotected vaginal sex than uncircumcised males.

       A blanket statement from WHO, but no mention of the science that would explain WHY snipping off a sheath of self lubricating nerve endings helps combat AIDS AT ALL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know why lube is a big deal in western sex? Because circumcised penises can have too much strain on the skin below the head. It can sometimes tear or cut if forced into a partner dry. This of course depends on the 'artistry' or lack thereof of the original procedure.
And uncircumcised, unlubed  penises can hurt the partner as well. 
Foreskin not only helps lube your tip but is a more comfortable sheath for entry and initial in/out friction.
Source? My partners opinions and reactions to it vs. their experience with circumcised partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, why would WHO tell Africans that circumcision helps prevent AIDS when it can actually increase the chance of injury or blood exposure in a rape culture society? It's almost like they want to increase the spread of AIDS.

       "Once, a long time ago there was a mohel who performed more circumcisions than all other mohels. And one day he was talking to a friend of his and the friend asked, "You've performed so many circumcisions, have you made anything from the foreskins?" And the mohel said that yes, he had made a wallet from all the foreskins he had collected. The friend said, "You've circumsised so many children, you must have collected dozens of foreskins, and all you have made is a wallet?" And the mohel replied, "I know it's just a wallet. But when you rub it, it turns into a briefcase."

       I don't have the article, I read it a while ago. And many sites I see now have rushed to debunk it. It was just the first thing that came to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can tell you from experience, at the daycare I taught at, in all the cases of children having infections on their penis (there were at least 4), 100% of them were not circumcised.

      <p>
       And sure many people will say that it's the parents job to teach him to clean out his turtle neck. But good luck teaching a two year old to do anything with his wiener other than pee out of it, or fiddle with it.
