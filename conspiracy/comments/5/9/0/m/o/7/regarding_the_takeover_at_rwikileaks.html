    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       As we know,
       <a href="/r/Wikileaks">
        /r/Wikileaks
       </a>
       was taken over the other day, amidst growing fears that the actual Wikileaks has been compromised as well.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/about/moderators">
        6 of 10 mods added in the past day
       </a>
       , funny timing isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What isn't funny is that anyone who raised questions about this takeover was instantly banned, deleted, and muted by the new mods.
       </strong>
       (Including myself, twice over).
      </p>
      <p>
       Users also started getting banned for asking certain questions about Assange's safety. (You can search
       <a href="/r/Wikileaks">
        /r/Wikileaks
       </a>
       here in
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       and see a ton of posts regarding this from the past 24 hrs.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally this would warrant a stir here in
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       either way. But this time it's more serious -
       <strong>
        the newest mod here is also a big part of the takeover of
        <a href="/r/Wikileaks">
         /r/Wikileaks
        </a>
        .
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So as a community, we need to demand accountability from
       <a href="/r/AssuredlyAThrowAway">
        /r/AssuredlyAThrowAway
       </a>
       . The shamelessness with which
       <a href="/r/Wikileaks">
        /r/Wikileaks
       </a>
       is being sabotaged has no place in
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">
        /u/AssuredlyAThrowAway
       </a>
       , your claims are completely misaligned with your actions, so I only have 1 question:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Since the censorship began when you were brought on board, do you plan to remove yourself and the other 5 new moderators from the moderating team in
        <a href="/r/Wikileaks">
         /r/Wikileaks
        </a>
        ?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we need to start a petition to the other mods at
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       to have you removed from here instead.|
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit
       </strong>
       : Don't be fooled by the excuses that they thought they were banning CTR shills. It was clear to everyone who saw it that it was shameless censorship according to an agenda. And if a mod really thinks anyone who poses a question is a 'shill', what does that then say about their mental capacity to be a moderator?

       Yea. The sub seems back to normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are digging and finding good info.
      </p>
      <p>
       No more "IM WORRIED ABOUT ASSANGE" posts every 5 minutes that were clouding up the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       New leaks are still being released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concern trolling still exists on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       This OP is borderline concern trolling. May be genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceed with caution regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
       CTRs tactics are forever changing. I think this whole thing was part of the plan to keep people digging off balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at all the time you have been spending wondering wtf is going on instead of digging through releases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, what is everyone hoping for? A magic email with absolute corruption? Someone else to take care of the corruption. No heroes are coming.
      </p>

       Every branch is compromised ...

       There are no longer checks and balances within the gov.

      <p>
       The people are the last check and balance, but the people are arguing on a social media site instead of organizing.

       I was literally added to
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       to provide oversight of the other moderators; and in 24 hours on the
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       team I have removed the ban on self posts, manually overturned 100's of bans that were issued by an over zealous mod, have helped to draft a new set of rules that will be put to the community for input/critique before they are implemented, have taken steps to make the entire mod log of
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       public, and I mod over there (as here) solely to ensure the free flow of information is upheld by mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the trolling/manipulation regarding this situation started as soon as the situation in
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       was posted to
       <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">

      <p>
       So, with that said, it's very clear why you (and others) have been trying to sow discord among this community and it's moderators. However, I am proud of the oversight I provide on reddit and I will not stop fighting to advance the cause of the free flow on information.

       Welcome to 1984, folks. I just puked in my mouth a little.

      <p>
       I don't go anywhere near that 'top minds' sub, so what's clear to you? You're suggesting people are upset because of a thread in another sub, and not because dozens of users are being banned for posing questions in
       <a href="/r/Wikileaks">
        /r/Wikileaks
       </a>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because what's clear to us, the users, is that you're lying. All of this awesome stuff you keep listing that you're doing in
       <a href="/r/Wikileaks">
        /r/Wikileaks
       </a>
       is completely made up. The mods are still there. They're still banning people. You're still enabling it.

      <p>
       /u/ here4popcorn is the one whose agenda is most blatant, so why haven't you backed up your words and actually done something about it?

       Here4popcorn also mods in
       <a href="/r/dncleaks">

       , but simply got overwhelmed by the amount of non-wikileaks related material on the subreddit yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       While he certainly made a bad decision by deciding to blanket ban nearly every user who he felt was a CTR infiltrator, he very much was acting on good faith in an attempt to protect the flow of information related to wikileaks from being buried under a constant stream of drama-type posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here4popcorn realizes full well that his response to the community outrage was entirely incorrect, and moderation going forward will never again be reduced to that type of wholesale banning.

       I very much have manually reversed hundreds of bans that were issued in error yesterday, I also personally re-enabled self posts, and have also taken the lead on the project to implement public mod logs.

       The outrage is a

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The initial outrage started due to the original two new mods who were added (before the 5 mods from
       <a href="/r/dncleaks">
        /r/dncleaks
       </a>
       joined the team), as one of them was an open Clinton supporter who scrubbed his history after becoming a mod of
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       . Both of those mods tendered their resignation, although only 1 of them has left the team as of this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outrage was then compounded by the rash deletions and bans issues by here4popcorn and another mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both issues have been address internally, and I apologize we were not able to overturn your ban sooner. If I had known I would never have allowed it to stand.

       You're either the most altruistic hero on reddit or the most successfully sociopathic insider on reddit. Anybody who mods SO MUCH STUFF is suspicious. Like, are you independently wealthy or what?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always assumed you were just part of the SRS crew that seems to run everything along with the people who go out for lattes with the admins (or do I repeat myself?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at your post history it's kinda hard not to think you're actually a good guy. Well except that you post in some creepy subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been here way longer than the account I'm on now and I've always assumed you were one of the shadowy puppet admin group.

      <p>
       WTF ever happened to -moose- anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, is it more suspicious to mod like 150 reddits, or LESS suspicious because somebody who was doing it maliciously would use more alts? Fuck man, you make me uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'm still banned on
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       . The theory being floated is that the ones who got too close to "the truth" whatever that is were banned longer :P I like that theory, it strokes me off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I no longer think the twitter is compromised, I think, but
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       is a whole other thing. Replacement of basically the entire mod team in 36 hours after the Assange internet cut smells no matter what anybody does or says at this point.

       God no, I have been trying to expose the goons since they very first started migrating to reddit. In fact, what they did during the reddit bomb/project panda, wherein the "circle jerk militia" from SA created
       <a href="/r/preteengirls">
        /r/preteengirls
       </a>
       , filled it with actual CP, emailed Anderson Cooper about
       <em>
        their own subreddit
       </em>
       , and then directed him to reddit's "jailbait problem" was disgusting. Couple that with how they maliciously tried to ruin lives with the predditors tumblr, and I can say with certainly that the way the admins rewarded the goons with SRS as a thank you for solving reddit inc's little "free speech problem" was truly the most fucked up situation in reddit's history.

       I'm sorry to say he went inactive, although one of his former accounts "
       <a href="/u/yrugay">
        /u/yrugay
       </a>
       " may still be around. Also, his archieve sub was maliciously taken over by trolls from topmindsofreddit, and now is used to mock us. Truly upsetting that the admins allowed that to happen.

       Why were you banned? I will overturn that right now. My apologies for what happened yesterday in

       Also, as a side note, I appreciate your kind words and I can say only that I do everything I can to embody Aaron's vision for what reddit could have been. Although that fight has resulted in everything from death threats to years long campaigns to falsely slander my character, it is something I truly enjoy and am quite passionate about.

       Yeah I'm banned in Worldnews, or News, for posting a 4 year old article when I was unfamiliar with Reddit, it's rules, and each subs specific rules. Not everyone lives on the browser. Just got the ban hammer without a warning. Good thing that mod wasn't a cop, fuckin power hungry douche.

       Because it's one of the subreddit's I've been a member of for the longest; also, my interest in initially becoming a mod was sparked because about 3 years ago a mod of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       attempted to ban all posts which reported on censorship around reddit.

       All of the mods have agreed to step back, and take a hands-off approach to moderation at least and uintil a discussion can be had tomorrow with the user base regarding what type of rules the community would like to see adapted; if you have links to a post that was censored, or a user who was banned today, please let me know.

       Not gonna lie, the mod causing issues should be gone if you want to correct unrest. There's no reason they should still be around if they've shown abuse of power, a lack of history and biased in the first place. Again, literally ZERO reason that person(s) should remain a moderator.

       Yesterday, an overzealous mod started banning users for mundane comments which were not against the rules of the subreddit. We have been manually overturning every single ban that he issued, and will also be making our mod log public to ensure something like that does not happen again.

       I'm baffled as to why you're not referring to him as 'former' overzealous mod. That kind of behaviour should have a permanent removal penalty, not a

       Sociopaths hold all the power. More people need to understand this. The systems we are subject to are designed such that sociopaths are most easily able to climb the ranks. At work, politics, wherever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they would stab their own mothers in the back to get ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they don't care how their actions affect other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they are amazing liars and amazing at deception face to face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they are manipulators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the average, decent person would never do any of those things to get themselves ahead. There are far more sociopaths striving for power over others than decent people, and they will go to further lengths EVERY time, because they have no conscience and only care about their own position. Thus, far more sociopaths obtain power positions, in any realm you can name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow this road backwards. Sociopaths have held power and wealth for a long time. They have ensured the system is set up in such a way that they can maintain it. The system itself has been INHERENTLY PROGRAMMED to favour sociopaths, because sociopaths slowly wrote all the laws to their own benefit, often to save their own asses in the future for deeds to be committed or already committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is run by powerful sociopaths in politics, military, finance... everywhere. And it has been for a very long time. If one outs another publicly, the whole system starts to crash down and they are ALL exposed. That's why it's been this way unnoticed for so long. They are more than willing to keep silent for one another, so each can keep that power seat above the masses as long as possible. Exposing the rest from the inside serves the individual sociopath no benefit, it only detracts from their position to hurt the whole. They risk losing their power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is let into these clubs unless they abide. If someone on the inside chooses to speak up, there's countless others willing to maintain the charade and discredit him. This is just straight logic, anyone can and should arrive to the same conclusion here if they really contemplate it. There are peer-reviewed studies that support the notion that sociopaths are more likely to obtain power positions, that is precisely what's going on worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Most people are good
       </em>
       . The small percentage of truly heartless people are reigning over us absolutely. They would love to make you think that most people are out to get you. It's simply not true. These sociopaths are the real enemy, the rest of us are driven to perpetual infighting so we will continue to miss that point. In a way this is the fundamental conspiracy from which all others blossom: Sociopaths are running show, playing with our emotions and our fears to control us. Think about the ramifications of that. I know we like to point out individual candidates or bankers or CEO's as sociopaths (Hilary, trump, bush, whatever).. but the frightening reality is that
       <em>
        it is a vast network of sociopaths controlling everything
       </em>
       . They do not need to be in direct contact with one another making plans, you must think of sociopathy in power as a cancer, in a way. It's not an issue of the individuals, it's a fundamental flaw in our social design. It's not a worldwide planned conspiracy between all of these people,
       <em>
        they naturally and autonomously enable each other because it is the most beneficial option for each individual to keep quiet, not collectively, but of their own accord, for their own personal good
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There doesn't have to be a "secret worldwide cabal of a magnitude that couldn't possibly be maintained" for this state of affairs to exist, which is often the theme of discrediting such ideas: the insistence that if any of this were true, those in power
       <em>
        must all be connected behind closed doors, which is logistically impossible, so this can't be true
       </em>
       . They don't.

       I think it's something in our biology that has helped us survive, but the time has come to identify it, quantify it, account for it, and remove its influence.  Much like how writing and philopapher change politics, sociopsychological awareness is our next big leap.

       In the "PSA: cotrect the record playbook" thread, there is mention on "compromising" and "operatizing" reddit moderators. My guess is that what we saw on r/wikileaks is part of that.

       Just to clear things up, Before I was added, 2 mods who were added to
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       seemed to have a pro-Clinton bias and the community chased them off.
      </p>
      <p>
       In response, 5 new mods were added (this time from
       <a href="/r/dncleaks">
        /r/dncleaks
       </a>
       ) as a way to address community concern regarding the prior two poorly-vetted mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was added because I mod
       <a href="/r/dncleaks">
        /r/dncleaks
       </a>
       , and tasked with providing oversight of the other moderators by way of my firm commitment to the free flow of information. To that end, I have long been a supporter of wikileaks and other whistleblowers, and have always advocated for their inclusion among the ranks of other journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also a fervent supporter of the free flow of information, and spend a majority of my moderation looking into the actions of other moderators looking for areas wherein their rules/actions undermine the free exchange of ideas.

       Don't worry, not all of us get swept up in manufactured drama like this. I can tell from your posts so far in this thread that you seem like a genuinely decent person with a good head on your shoulders. Appreciate all the work you've done towards keeping these subreddits somewhat on track before they fly completely off the rails due to mismanagement combined with actual intent to sabotage/discredit them. Good judgement and open-mindedness are important qualities in a mod. Keep up the good work.

       None of them want discussion, only for people to fall inline with their circlejerk. Got something to say that doesn't fit in with what you want? That's a ban. Ask for why you were banned? That's a mute.

       That's really not going to solve anything. The moderation team here is not trustworthy. The moderation teams on any important/high profile subs are not trustworthy. Reddit is just not all that trustworthy anymore from an information standpoint. There is an elite on this site just like there is an elite in the world. Always has been, but the users shifted from harmless egomaniacs to people and groups with agendas. Sure, there's still truth posted here often. Good luck determining what the truth is in a sea of propaganda and fluff.

       Like others have said, all one can do online is sift through the bullshit and follow their gut. Banning him as a mod is not going to change anything here, as others said.

       You people act like conspiracy sites being flooded with shills and disinfo is something new.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA has admitted to hoaxing a shitload of the major UFO events in a disinformation program but I honestly believe that was just an attempt to confuse the situation with false leads.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is their game. Confuse confuse confuse and control the opposition. "We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false."

       The question is this: Are the people at the top who are focused on destroying our planet's eco system doing it out of mere greed, or something else?

       Dude you are just trying to start shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been pushing for minimal moderation and more transparency over at the WL sub. I've also been banned and unbanned after I sent a message to the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       AATA came in after all the banning and censorship happened. He also said he was going to get the mod logs open to the users of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The here4popcorn guy admitted to banning everyone, and was also very condescending in his first post. So was the Devistator guy who started all the original drama.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are now two posts on the front page here at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       about AATA. Hmm
      </p>
      <p>
       So you think they should be removed from their mod spot here because they tried to fix up the other sub after being asked to join the team and had nothing at all to do with the original drama?

       IMO there is an ongoing (for many months now) effort from a small group of offiste users to use
       <em>
        any opportunity
       </em>
       to sow discord between the user base of this subreddit and it's moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this "drama" started as soon as this post was made in topminds-
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/58y1w2/after_brigading_from_rconspiracy_and_rthe_donald/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/58y1w2/after_brigading_from_rconspiracy_and_rthe_donald/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite obvious what this little "group" have attempted to pull here, and I'm thankful most of the userbase of this subreddit has seen right through it.

       Does this "community" assume that there is some sort of democratic process to Reddit? R/conspiracy exists because Reddit admins allow it to exist. No petition to the mods will save this sub from being compromised and or shut down. It's just a matter of time. R/conspiracy will be no more before November 8th.

       , no matter what your intentions are, the timing is wrong, the situation volatile, and your connections to other events can be seen as highly suspicious. Even if you are honest, the appropriate action would be to recuse yourself and wait to help till things have settled. To continue as a mod hurts not only your own credibility, but the credibility of the sub as a whole.

       All of reddit's forums can be compromised in a split second.  This website is a liberal hell hole, and it's controlled very easily from the top down

       Could this be a coordinated effort by fear mongerers (Which i think you are) and actual infiltrator mods (like the assuredly guy you said who was a part of the takeover) to spread division on this sub so it is easier to compromise?

       As of they say "Divide and Conquer". Create panic among dissendents and cause them to fight each other, then take them over. They seem to be trying it on here and for a good reason.

       Honestly. The mod
       <a href="/u/here4popcorn">
        /u/here4popcorn
       </a>
       was added strangely in the sub
       <a href="/r/DNCLeaks">
        /r/DNCLeaks
       </a>
       .
      </p>

       There were a bunch of strange mod switches when he came in.

       Anytime anyone discussed the Moloch emails the threads would be deleted and people would be banned.

      <p>
       That always seemed strange to me.
