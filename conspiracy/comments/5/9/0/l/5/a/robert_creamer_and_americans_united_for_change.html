He&#39;s copy and pasting stories from various articles related to gun control after the event. Given what we know about him now, I&#39;m thinking there&#39;s a lot more to this. If their job is to create false events for media coverage, what are they doing discussing suspicious gun violence massacres? Here are a few examples.</p>

<p>Tell me what you think. Also, if I&#39;m behind the times I apologize. The implications of this is blowing my mind.</p>

<p>EDIT: Might be just paranoia but I seem to be getting lots of down-votes out of nowhere. Is this being suppressed or are people legitimately unappreciative? I&#39;m not one to care about Karma but if it&#39;s getting down voted to keep more people from seeing this... Obviously, if it&#39;s legit then okay, sorry to disappoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I&#39;ve been noticing of late is that reaction pieces discussing the O&#39;Keefe videos are reluctant to mention Creamer&#39;s name, or else bury it wayyy at the bottom of the story, and downplay the hell out of the connection both Foval <em>and</em> Creamer had to the party. It took Zerohedge to point out that he&#39;d visited with POTUS 45 times.</p>

<p>According to this article:
<a href="http://www.guns.com/2013/10/30/biden-ride-bench-white-house-gun-control-push-video/">http://www.guns.com/2013/10/30/biden-ride-bench-white-house-gun-control-push-video/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh last thing regarding real vs staged. We know that when an entity wants to discredit a theory, they may seed bad or tainted info and then later show that to be false. Then they use this to silent the debate claiming it was proven false because of such and such. This happened in 9-11 very obviously for anyone who paid attention. Shit with missiles and nuetrino bombs Discredited the whole movement. 
Then people thought that it was a binary either controlled demo or planes. I saw supposed truthers promoting this view yet not wondering about remote controlled aircraft (those anti-hijacking features) or dancing Israelis that is still consistent with controlled demos to bring the buildings down. </p>

<p>I have to admit operation mockingbird and the disinfo they can spread is actually impressive and very effective. Mostly because no one expects it or thinks it may be happening but even for those who are always trying to separate the disinfo from the truth, it is very time consuming and demoralizing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a very loose theory that the reason misinformation is so effective. Could it be that those claiming to believe the official narrative are so perplexed with the notions of losing faith in the reality built around them that they will grasp for - and cling to - any narrative that could possibly explain what they know in their bones to be a false flag perpetrated against the American people? I mean, the thought of the most powerful government the world has ever seen turning against its own people is horrifying. With half-assed effort, we&#39;ve killed millions in the middle east to avenge our 3,000. Their blood is on our hands and our government could wipe us off the face of the planet just as easily for acknowledging that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are spot on. This is a psychological phenomenon known as cognitive dissonance. People instinctively avoid pain, both physical and psychological. So it&#39;s emotionally devastating to come to terms with the fact that there are actual murderers in the highest seats of power.</p>

<p>For me, it took over 3 years and lots of tears to come to grips with reality. I really, really didn&#39;t want to believe all of the stuff I was learning (9/11, JFK, Iran-Contra, Clinton Mena connection, western funding of Lenin and Trotsky, etc.) So I completely understand why the masses stay in a trance. It&#39;s far less painful than facing reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to also suggest one other possibility so that a potential avenue isn&#39;t overlooked. Sometimes the event itself really happens to a certain extent and then embellished to create the final product. I think the OKC tragedy had elements of this. </p>

<p>So I have no idea about Sandy Hook but just thought if you were only focused on the entire thing being staged you may end up overlook some important details. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I attempted looking for Orlando links as well but didn&#39;t find anything. You would think that if Creamer was such an anti-gun advocate, he would be passing articles on all of these events. I suppose it&#39;s possible that there is a little bit of truth to the claimed massacres but it doesn&#39;t seem likely.</p>

<p>Orlando, for example, Mateen had no motive at all, the FBI admitted that no one was injured or killed prior to their arrival, only one news source captured video the entire time... plus lots of stuff. I can&#39;t imagine how this could have been an actual event if you could rule out Omar and obvious actors were on scene immediately.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not too familiar with San Bernandino.</p>

<p>Connecticut, everything is messed up. Video of police raiding the wrong school, no bodies, parents appearing to be acting, possible appearance of some of the kids after their death at the superbowl etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s worth a thought definitely. Just because I can&#39;t see how it could be based on real situations at all doesn&#39;t mean that they aren&#39;t. I&#39;m really hoping that people more familiar with these events (self-proclaimed experts) will see this link and begin digging through the evidence. I&#39;m definitely not qualified to dig through and recognize the important details by myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Millions in he Middle East? That&#39;s the tip of the iceberg. Just start from 1950 and go from there. We have more wars that are off the books than all the rest before 1950 added together. Wars where we created proxy armies that brutalized millions and toppled democratic governments. We set up the worst regimes in poor countries but then claim we have to save Iraq, Syria, Libya, from their evil governments, and oh here Saudia Arabia and Israel we will give you more money than the American citizens get if you use them to create chaos. </p>

<p>Have you ever wondered if operation paperclip was actually a literal coup and that&#39;s why ever since then we keep becoming more openly fascist? Look at our history after ww2, the elites ties with Nazi (esp Bush and Koch and Dulles and Hamilton ok all of them), then operation paperclip and how everything has been different since including nonstop wars. Now let&#39;s hit this LSD dude </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I believe. It would be nice to have hard evidence to point to rather than circumstantial/weak evidence. When trying to discuss a conspiracy with someone, you&#39;ve got about 10 seconds before they write you off as a nut job. If you can immediately point to irrefutable proof (like an admission in leaked emails) then you might get them to listen for another 5 seconds. </p>

<p>Ask people if they trust our government and 90% will say &quot;No.&quot; Share evidence of corruption or treason and you&#39;re an idiot for not swallowing the official story. I should start asking naysayers what one piece of evidence someone could show you that would allow them to consider the possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to add. I have no idea about Connecticut and I&#39;ve never looked into it. I looked into Orlando pretty seriously though and I can tell you people died for sure. It shares more similarities with Boston Marathon than anything, both of which definitely involved real death. Both had Muslim immigrant families linked to the CIA and prior connections with the FBI. Ron Paul raised hell at how they put Boston under Marshall law when it happened with no oversight. It&#39;s pretty far fetched to think that the whole city got put under Marshall law without the real event happening. That would be way harder than the actual event occurring and would provide no extra benefit but lots of risk as opposed to just the actual thing happening. They don&#39;t value human life enough to go through all that trouble and risk. </p>

<p>And there is a young guy being held in solitary under SAMS conditions, not allowed to talk to anyone or the press or anything. Been that way since it happened and convicted in a secret trial. Even if he is guilty it delegitimization the entire charade. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not meaning to be argumentative but why do you say that you know people died in either of those events? I really have no idea how that could even be verified. In Newtown, I believe all or nearly all of the children were cremated without a viewing. With the Boston Bombing, I really don&#39;t even know where to begin. The face of the main victim (lost legs) has been very suspect. We would have bled out in a few short minutes without immediate attention and even well placed  tourniquets, he would have bled out with his heart positioned above his wounds (as was the case while he was being wheeled away in a wheelchair). </p>

<p>I think inventing victims and introducing a few family members of that victim would be much easier than one would think. I also think hired players would also be much more likely to keep quiet if they didn&#39;t have a guilty conscious (part of a planned murder). Although, I believe death certificates would be much more difficult to come by. Don&#39;t know if any of those have ever been released.</p>
