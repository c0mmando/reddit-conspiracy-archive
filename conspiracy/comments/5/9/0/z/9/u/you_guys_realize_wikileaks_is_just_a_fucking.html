       I mean seriously, what has come from all of this "leaking" information (that we didn't already know)? Bradley Manning is the real "hero" who leaked info and look at him, silenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden is absolutely COINTELPRO and so is Assange. They wouldn't be making major motion pictures about these clowns if that wasn't so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that they keep setting up "release dates" for leaks on Hlllary makes it even more obvious. What is this, a TV show?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust nothing you see on TV, and take eveerrrrrrrrthing on the internet with a grain of salt, people please.
      </p>

       Let's talk about how we're about to witness the most disastrous election in world history, and there's nothing we can do about it except prepare. The useful idiots are buying the party lines, hook line and sinker.

       That said, I don't think ihopeitsround is a shill. Just a smart guy maybe not quite as smart as he thinks he is, and pretty cynical.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a guy who's worked in Hollywood and the TV industry some, I can tell you that both are more in the pocket of the government, CIA and military than ever before, and already were when I left over a decade ago (though I still have friends).
      </p>
      <p>
       Oliver Stone's dad was Skull &amp; Bones. Snowden is almost surely limited hangout, but possibly also a genuine do-gooder from one wing of the CIA that is a lot less dark than the other. That movie was propaganda, though, to be sure--Snowden is presented as a hero, no question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange is more of a wild card--I don't know what to make of him, and I'm suspicious of anybody who says for sure they can. The movie about him didn't bear his name in the title, it was lower budget, he wasn't really presented as any kind of hero but rather a flawed guy who meant well but also a narcissistic liar. They pretty much nail him for causing the deaths of intelligence guys on the ground. I'm not sure the movie was a "win" for him by any means.

       I thank you sir for your honest opinion, which is all I'm looking for (goddamnit).
      </p>
      <p>
       However after reading this it sure seems like you belong on "my side" I mean good lord, Stone is one of the Jewish big dog hollywooders, you said it yourself, connected to skull and bones!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Read through the thread again and tell me who's jumping to conclusions. I'm trying for honest discourse. If anyone can help me believe in Assange, by all means I'm all ears.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks anyway, I am pretty cynical. Just because I care a lot, though.

       I can't convince you to "believe in Assange," because I'm not sure I do myself. He was on the cover of TIME magazine, for goodness sake, and that rag is propaganda print 101.
      </p>
      <p>
       But man....five years locked up in the Ecuadorian Embassy is a LONG time for a deep cover double agent Deep State puppet to hang tight. And he's clearly driving the Clinton campaign--and the Obama administration more broadly--around the bend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I suppose, it's possible that there's some underground tunnel they can smuggle him in and out of, and he gets to travel some and fuck hot chicks and lead the life of Reilly (Ace of Spies!). And maybe this is all theater for the changing of the guards that the fucked-up weirdo so-called "elites" know they've got to manufacture or society is going to melt down because of all the corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who knows? I certainly don't. We're not talking JFK murder or 9/11, where the trail and evidence are pretty obvious. This is Mystery Incorporated, and I'm all outta Scoobie snacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he turns up dead next week, though, do you think that might move the needle for you a bit?

       Yes. If he winds up being dead I will seriously consider the alternative view. Although it wouldn't be proof; I mean they could fake his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, all I'm really getting at, is that we shouldn't lean on someone like Assange to tell us the truth when we have to discover it for ourselves to understand it anyway. He's no savior, either way.

       Psyop.  I don't think you really understand what that word means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are the releases real?  So far, there's been no proof of tampering, editing, or fabricating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are the releases timed for the most impact?  Absolutely.

       Is the public better informed to make a decision on who to vote for in Nov?  Hell yeah!

       There's too many possibilities for me to mention all of them as to why he would stay there.. here's a few off the top of my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       A) he's in on it, and is a dastardly satanist wizard
      </p>
      <p>
       B) he's being blackmailed and/or threatened in one way or the other I don't know...to hide what he really knows? The guy isn't exactly a saint (see Swedish abortion clinics).
      </p>
      <p>
       C) he's being played by someone else, oh, I don't know, Glenn Greenwald.. and THINKS he's doing something good while he's actually hurting us by releasing breadcrumbs when we need loaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       D) he is an alien
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all I've got so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: sheesh maybe he's just in over his head and scared of being turned into a woman. See Bradley Manning

       Assange put his life on the line, knowing it might eventually lead to his death or torture. He more recently offered his fate to US authorities in exchange for Chelsea Manning. We all know the powers that be want both of them, so instead they employed this psyops against his admirers and followers. Assange is trying to out truth, end corruption and manipulation in the highest levels of gov.

       It is wrong to mass surveil your citizens snd lie to them saying it's foreign terrorists. So Snowden became a whistleblower along these same lines. They are both heros for truth, whether your theories show that to you or not.

       Evidence? Where's your evidence for implying that Snowden got paid to do what he did, and is getting personal visits from strippers or something? What are you talking about? You're so far out there I barely want to address it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He regularly does guest lectures, and does live Q&amp;A after, so yes Snowden is likely alive. And your insinuation that he was paid to do what he did is completely assanine, but I see your troll attempt. You're trying to align him with Russian intelligence which is bollocks. He merely got asylum there because he couldn't in Hong Kong. I'm sure he stays out of "sight" from the KGB as much as he does from CIA spies.

       You claim to be a truther, but your attempts to convince are in vain, because those who are seeking the truth will just walk away from this sub if your ridiculous replies continue.

       First of all the KGB doesn't exist, officially at least, anymore. Second of all, I was making what we call a "joke".

       Certainly am not trying to offend anyone, just trying to offer some alternative viewpoints. What did Snowden tell us that wasn't in Will Smith's 1998 movie 'Enemy of the State'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, all of this "PRISM" talk and breaking of privacy laws is old news, like 1991 old. Snowden is IMHO like a treat that TPTB are giving its dog (us) to keep it calm. They're placating us.

       Yeah right, like Hillary wanted people to know that the DNC is rigged in her favour, or the Clinton foundation and Hillary are involved in pay for play. The more you present your opinion as fact, the less you seem to know what you're talking about

       If Soros and Rothschild came up to McCain and were like "hey, we're gonna MAKE you president, but we gotta let it come out that your gay and that you helped create ISIS and that you joined the Vietcong and that's why your even alive today, so we can further destabilize the American political system" he'd say "FUCKAROONIE YAAAAA!!!"

       Haha VERY TRUE!

       However, of you know anything about secret societies and satanic cults, you know the Pope and his buddies, they're reeeeeallly good at keeping secrets.

       Just saying. It's totally possible that you don't know even a fraction of what's happening behind the scenes, I mean, right now someone is plotting to overthrow a country, the CIA is targeting someone, and Obama is praying to towards Mecca! Haha
      </p>

       All I'm saying is our perspective is limited, the media controls that perspective, and Wikileaks was reported by the MEDIA! If it wasn't half of you wouldn't have even heard of Assange.

       I mean it's possible. There are two theories as to how history works. One that is that everything has clear causes and control, and the other is just that shit is completely out of the control of anybody.

       Your right, and your smart for walking that line in between causality and chaos.

       I just lean towards causality, it makes more sense and I've seen far too much evidence for it to discount its likelihood.

       I actually agree that there's a pretty big chance that Wikileaks is a big distraction too. You can't guarantee that it isn't, nor can you guarantee that it is. Yes, they're emails, but how hard would it be to fake all of those emails? The government is pretty huge, and if they're theoretically capable of terraforming, and many other far more complex operations, how hard would it be to fake some emails and "leak" them to the public to distract or persuade?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to realize is that the domain name is purchased in the U.S. And for the longest time up until recently the government ran and regulated the internet. Even now that ICANN holds the internet, they're still headquartered in California, not far to be "influenced" a bit to do something critical for the US government. If Wikileaks is truly that damaging that even the MSM (which isn't to be trusted at all) is talking about it, it'd be an infinitesimal task to take down something that poisonous to the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, another line of thought is, maybe the emails are real. Okay, but then why isn't the government doing anything with that amount of evidence? Why are they still allowing releases? And why is Assange still alive (though that might have changed recently)? Again, all pretty minor tasks to "correct".
      </p>
      <p>
       My thoughts are either 1) they're all faked to distract us and push the persuasion in a specific direction for a reason I still haven't figured out yet (elect someone, discredit election, jail Hillary if she wins, or one of another hundred possibilities) or 2) the emails are real but they're testing to see how complacent the population is. And apparently, none of it is grandiose enough to cause anyone to do anything.

       "ihopeitsround" is a double-psyop.  Flat Earth guy says Assange is fake, which poisons real &amp; credible theories that Assange is fake.

       I agree myself. Its too coincidental. Both Snoden and Assange would be dead by now IMHO.

       I think people are being setup for more centralized control after this government collapses. The best way to stop a movement is to lead it yourself.

       People should be carefull about downvoting this, its a valid point.

       I agree. I'm just not sure if Assange knows he is, unlike Snowden. Dude definitely knows he is. Once a spook, always a spook...

       Wikileaks is very different than Snowden. Assange seems somewhat genuine, I don't think Snowden is. Hence why I said I'm not sure if Assange knows he may be being used. Just my opinion, man...

       my therory is he is  a mind control slave, just like all the presidents are sometime after WWII.
