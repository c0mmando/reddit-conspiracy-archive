<p>The fact that they keep setting up &quot;release dates&quot; for leaks on Hlllary makes it even more obvious. What is this, a TV show? </p>

<p>Trust nothing you see on TV, and take eveerrrrrrrrthing on the internet with a grain of salt, people please. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about how we&#39;re about to witness the most disastrous election in world history, and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it except prepare. The useful idiots are buying the party lines, hook line and sinker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading through the thread, gotta go with....</p>

<p>maradesu &gt; ihopeitsround</p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t think ihopeitsround is a shill. Just a smart guy maybe not quite as smart as he thinks he is, and pretty cynical. </p>

<p>As a guy who&#39;s worked in Hollywood and the TV industry some, I can tell you that both are more in the pocket of the government, CIA and military than ever before, and already were when I left over a decade ago (though I still have friends). </p>

<p>Oliver Stone&#39;s dad was Skull &amp; Bones. Snowden is almost surely limited hangout, but possibly also a genuine do-gooder from one wing of the CIA that is a lot less dark than the other. That movie was propaganda, though, to be sure--Snowden is presented as a hero, no question.</p>

<p>Assange is more of a wild card--I don&#39;t know what to make of him, and I&#39;m suspicious of anybody who says for sure they can. The movie about him didn&#39;t bear his name in the title, it was lower budget, he wasn&#39;t really presented as any kind of hero but rather a flawed guy who meant well but also a narcissistic liar. They pretty much nail him for causing the deaths of intelligence guys on the ground. I&#39;m not sure the movie was a &quot;win&quot; for him by any means. </p>

<p>However after reading this it sure seems like you belong on &quot;my side&quot; I mean good lord, Stone is one of the Jewish big dog hollywooders, you said it yourself, connected to skull and bones!!! </p>

<p>Read through the thread again and tell me who&#39;s jumping to conclusions. I&#39;m trying for honest discourse. If anyone can help me believe in Assange, by all means I&#39;m all ears. </p>

<p>Thanks anyway, I am pretty cynical. Just because I care a lot, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t convince you to &quot;believe in Assange,&quot; because I&#39;m not sure I do myself. He was on the cover of TIME magazine, for goodness sake, and that rag is propaganda print 101. </p>

<p>But man....five years locked up in the Ecuadorian Embassy is a LONG time for a deep cover double agent Deep State puppet to hang tight. And he&#39;s clearly driving the Clinton campaign--and the Obama administration more broadly--around the bend. </p>

<p>Now, I suppose, it&#39;s possible that there&#39;s some underground tunnel they can smuggle him in and out of, and he gets to travel some and fuck hot chicks and lead the life of Reilly (Ace of Spies!). And maybe this is all theater for the changing of the guards that the fucked-up weirdo so-called &quot;elites&quot; know they&#39;ve got to manufacture or society is going to melt down because of all the corruption. </p>

<p>But who knows? I certainly don&#39;t. We&#39;re not talking JFK murder or 9/11, where the trail and evidence are pretty obvious. This is Mystery Incorporated, and I&#39;m all outta Scoobie snacks. </p>

<p>If he turns up dead next week, though, do you think that might move the needle for you a bit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. If he winds up being dead I will seriously consider the alternative view. Although it wouldn&#39;t be proof; I mean they could fake his death. </p>

<p>Either way, all I&#39;m really getting at, is that we shouldn&#39;t lean on someone like Assange to tell us the truth when we have to discover it for ourselves to understand it anyway. He&#39;s no savior, either way. </p>

<p>B) he&#39;s being blackmailed and/or threatened in one way or the other I don&#39;t know...to hide what he really knows? The guy isn&#39;t exactly a saint (see Swedish abortion clinics). </p>

<p>Assange put his life on the line, knowing it might eventually lead to his death or torture. He more recently offered his fate to US authorities in exchange for Chelsea Manning. We all know the powers that be want both of them, so instead they employed this psyops against his admirers and followers. Assange is trying to out truth, end corruption and manipulation in the highest levels of gov. </p>

<p>It is wrong to mass surveil your citizens snd lie to them saying it&#39;s foreign terrorists. So Snowden became a whistleblower along these same lines. They are both heros for truth, whether your theories show that to you or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evidence? Where&#39;s your evidence for implying that Snowden got paid to do what he did, and is getting personal visits from strippers or something? What are you talking about? You&#39;re so far out there I barely want to address it.</p>

<p>He regularly does guest lectures, and does live Q&amp;A after, so yes Snowden is likely alive. And your insinuation that he was paid to do what he did is completely assanine, but I see your troll attempt. You&#39;re trying to align him with Russian intelligence which is bollocks. He merely got asylum there because he couldn&#39;t in Hong Kong. I&#39;m sure he stays out of &quot;sight&quot; from the KGB as much as he does from CIA spies.</p>

<p>You claim to be a truther, but your attempts to convince are in vain, because those who are seeking the truth will just walk away from this sub if your ridiculous replies continue.</p>

<p>Certainly am not trying to offend anyone, just trying to offer some alternative viewpoints. What did Snowden tell us that wasn&#39;t in Will Smith&#39;s 1998 movie &#39;Enemy of the State&#39;? </p>

<p>Seriously, all of this &quot;PRISM&quot; talk and breaking of privacy laws is old news, like 1991 old. Snowden is IMHO like a treat that TPTB are giving its dog (us) to keep it calm. They&#39;re placating us. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeahhhh so we spy on our allies, and we have people who videotape girls while they shower and listen to their phone conversations blah blah blah so what&quot; </p>

<p>We&#39;ve already known this. </p>

<p>1984 the book was published in 1948, talks all about it. Read it, it&#39;s good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually agree that there&#39;s a pretty big chance that Wikileaks is a big distraction too. You can&#39;t guarantee that it isn&#39;t, nor can you guarantee that it is. Yes, they&#39;re emails, but how hard would it be to fake all of those emails? The government is pretty huge, and if they&#39;re theoretically capable of terraforming, and many other far more complex operations, how hard would it be to fake some emails and &quot;leak&quot; them to the public to distract or persuade?</p>

<p>Another thing to realize is that the domain name is purchased in the U.S. And for the longest time up until recently the government ran and regulated the internet. Even now that ICANN holds the internet, they&#39;re still headquartered in California, not far to be &quot;influenced&quot; a bit to do something critical for the US government. If Wikileaks is truly that damaging that even the MSM (which isn&#39;t to be trusted at all) is talking about it, it&#39;d be an infinitesimal task to take down something that poisonous to the government.</p>

<p>Or, another line of thought is, maybe the emails are real. Okay, but then why isn&#39;t the government doing anything with that amount of evidence? Why are they still allowing releases? And why is Assange still alive (though that might have changed recently)? Again, all pretty minor tasks to &quot;correct&quot;.</p>

<p>My thoughts are either 1) they&#39;re all faked to distract us and push the persuasion in a specific direction for a reason I still haven&#39;t figured out yet (elect someone, discredit election, jail Hillary if she wins, or one of another hundred possibilities) or 2) the emails are real but they&#39;re testing to see how complacent the population is. And apparently, none of it is grandiose enough to cause anyone to do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree myself. Its too coincidental. Both Snoden and Assange would be dead by now IMHO. </p>

<p>I think people are being setup for more centralized control after this government collapses. The best way to stop a movement is to lead it yourself.</p>

<p>People should be carefull about downvoting this, its a valid point.</p>
