<p>In my opinion they go through great lengths to make the global population not think they are contained.</p>

<p>If everyone realized we were all just animals in a giant cage who have been deceived our whole lives, think of the unproductive chaos.</p>

<p>One iteration of the biological beast matrix we live in was when the architects designed the idea of the bible. It explains the sun, and the animals and what the &quot;earth&quot; is. It also explains how they plan to end this iteration ( see: Revelations ).</p>

<p>I feel that the powers that be are able to flood this giant terrarium we live in drowning everything in it and starting fresh. There are so many ancient flood stories in the past.</p>

<p>Perhaps when a civilization reaches a certain consciousness, it&#39;s a mandatory reset and a new iteration of the beast matrix is implemented.</p>

<p>What really makes my pineal gland flex is thoughts of what is outside the terrarium which we call home. </p>

<p>Are there other earth like enclosers on this plane?</p>

<p>Is the earth a sphere just 100 times the size they tell us it is and we are enclosed on a small portion?</p>

<p>Do those enclosers have entirely different types of organisms living within? </p>

<p>After a reset is the earth reseeded with hand picked organisms perhaps bred for superiority and strength?</p>

<p>Is there a way to exit this encloser and visit others?</p>

<p>Anyways.. just brainstorming :)</p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts.</p>

<p>this is an excellent point, and further illustrates the need for replication <em>on the moon</em> as opposed to in a laboratory on earth. </p>

<p>nobody has replicated ANY nasa experiments <em>on the moon</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly up for debate.  I lean towards there being mass fakery in space &quot;endeavors&quot;. (in other words, propaganda)</p>

<p>Just look closely at the evidence.  Really closely ... and with a non M0 infected mind.</p>

<p>The depictions of space.  The videos, the fast frames supposedly from the ISS.  The idiocy of the ISS interviews.  The science supposedly done in LEO.  </p>

<p>And also, in recent news: The major space agencies are now &quot;planning&quot; to go to Mars when we haven&#39;t even colonized the Moon, the closest body, ridiculously close and easy to get to compared to Mars.  </p>

<p>Would you just look how easy it was to take off that tin foil can rover from the Moon?!  I&#39;d imagine we&#39;d figure out how to build a terrarium there and achieve a space base which is much further from our terribly large gravity well, and has no atmospheric friction to boot.</p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t this been done before?  Note that this is just something thats been on my mind after I&#39;ve evaluated all the space evidence, and come away with a very bad taste.</p>

<p>1) Either they are in on it<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Our &quot;reliance&quot; on them isn&#39;t enough evidence for me that unmanned satellites existing.</p>

<p>Time and time again I&#39;ve heard the claim &quot;GPS derp&quot; satellites exist.  What else do we supposedly rely on them for?  Scientific research?</p>

<p>There are many ways to skim a cat and I can think of a few other ways to set up a world wide positioning system.  Note that GPS isn&#39;t even necessarily worldwide...ever have reduced or lost signal yourself?  </p>

<hr/>

<p>First, lets get a generic, succinct explanation of one of the GPS systems supposedly deployed in space, in a so called &quot;constellation&quot;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>GPS Satellite Constellation: The baseline satellite constellation consists of 24 satellites positioned in six earth-centered orbital planes with four operation satellites and a spare satellite slot in each orbital plane. The system can support a constellation of up to thirty satellites in orbit.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can this be mimicked in ways other than having a constellation of heavy metallic satellites that should require a fair share of maintance/repair due to being blasted by supposed space radiation, atmospheric pellets/debris, meteorites etc ?   </p>

<p>What comes to my mind:  </p>

<p>1) Bouncing a signal from the ionosphere from extremely powerful ground stations.  There is a parallel between a constellation existing in space, versus ground stations existing in remote locations on earth (might even be in the open sea)  </p>

<p>And closer to an actual satellite, but not anywhere near as difficult to pull off.   </p>

<p>2) Bouncing a signal off some minimal, cheap, easily re-deployable reflective space balloons (the side facing earth having some optimized curvature for reflection.)  Some permutation of the technology in the following:<br/>
a) <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/10-meter-sub-orbital-large-balloon-reflector-lbr/">https://www.nasa.gov/content/10-meter-sub-orbital-large-balloon-reflector-lbr/</a><br/>
b) <a href="http://darkthirtynews.com/large-balloon-reflector-set-launch/">http://darkthirtynews.com/large-balloon-reflector-set-launch/</a>  </p>

<p>Both would explain why the signal is coming from above our heads.  (2) would explain the kind of fast moving reflective star looking objects that everyone wants to call satellites without personally making them out in a high powered telescope.  And yes I&#39;ve seen &quot;amateur&quot; pictures of the ISS supposedly resolved.  But I&#39;m also skeptical of them, since others have claimed they are spherical, and just the fact that they look so bright, circular and exactly like a slowly moving shooting star generates doubt in my mind.  If I ever had a telescope which could lock onto one of these and see a machine that looks like an ISS, all doubt would be removed.      </p>

<hr/>

<p>Bonus:<br/>
If Concave Earth is your thing (I&#39;m at least fascinated by it)<br/>
3) Scientists have figured out how to transmit signals to the other side, bypassing the powerful sink towards the center of our universe.  In this model, light bends, but given some deep knowledge of it, I suppose there could be a way to utilize this bending and get something to the other side.  Believe it or not (!), there is a conspiracy that WW2 might have been partially fought over this knowledge getting the public.  You can easily find more information on this if you are interested...</p>

<hr/>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m just explaining some possibilities, and certainly have some fun doing so.   I only cared to generate these hypothesis since I&#39;ve muddled myself with the possibility space is a lie, which I&#39;m not trying to say <strong>is</strong> the case.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding having signal drop out, I have satellite radio, and it definitely drops out when you go under a bridge (sometimes in a city there are terrestrial repeaters, but get outside a big city and drop out).</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t see what stake they have in claiming there are satellites if there aren&#39;t.  I don&#39;t think they faked the moon landings, but if they did, I can think of some reasons why they might have done that at the time. Also, when the first satellite was launched, it was national news in the US. I&#39;m certain they would rather have not admit the Soviets beat us.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of a good reason to lie and say things work by satellite if they aren&#39;t there. In fact, when you consider satellite radio, satellite television, broadcasts that use satellite between the source and the stations, it quickly blossoms into something that I think too many people have be &quot;in on&quot;.  There are countless civilian engineers working on items that broadcast or receive via satellite, and I think their jobs would be specific enough that they would have to know where the signal is coming from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that, but I would imagine there are specific difference between a signal bounced off the atmosphere and one that was bounced off of a satellite. I would imagine one would be stronger, and that you could calculate it based on formulas, and it would be obvious if it weren&#39;t what you would expect. I think you have some interesting ideas though.</p>

<p>Also there are lots of civilian companies putting satellites in orbit now. </p>

<p>In the end, a lot of these things come down to two things for me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why would they lie about this?</p></li>
<li><p>Could they keep this a secret?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the moon landing, like I said earlier, there&#39;s a number of reasons they could want to lie about it, and I could envision there being few enough people in on it that it might be managable.</p>

<p>For the entire space program to be fake and there to be no satellites, I don&#39;t think it passes either test. First, I don&#39;t see any advantage to lying about it. Second, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s managable. It would require thousands of people to keep this secret, across the world, including countries that would really like to embarrass us by proving it was fake.  Clinton couldn&#39;t even keep his affairs a secret.  Astronauts, the people who train with them, all of the mission control people, people who work at TV stations...I know people who&#39;ve been to space shuttle launches, so they launched something.</p>

<p>I understand why people have issues with the moon landing.  As for space shuttle missions and satellites, I think I have to conclude they are real.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t agree with is that big secrets can&#39;t remain hidden.  I think they can.  We don&#39;t know what we don&#39;t know.  For every secret exposed, there lies many other secrets like deeply buried trees.</p>

<p>Lets pretend that a Russian believed that the moon landing were faked. </p>

<p>How exactly would you expect to learn about this Russians skepticism? </p>

<p>Did you actively monitor Russian media in the 1960&#39;s?</p>

<p>Why would you assume any Russian who was a skeptic would be given media coverage in either Russia or USA? </p>

<p>How many Russians would have to express skepticism before you accepted that not all Russians believe NASA went to the moon?</p>

<p>If ONE Russian had doubts about the NASA moon landings, would that really change your opinion, or would you simply dismiss him as sore loser sour grapes?</p>

<p>whats really sad about the &quot;If the moon landing was fake, Russia would have told me!&quot; line of reasoning is that</p>

<p>1) its completely un-original. its plagiarized. someone else thought it up, and you simply stole that idea as if if was your own, and pass it off as a legitimate, reasonable argument.  </p>

<p>2) its almost always the very first thing a &quot;true believer&quot; will say, which means that its the best they can come up with. its been repeated so many times that it has become a meme.  </p>

<p>3) its perhaps the weakest argument a person can make. instead of pointing to actual evidence, they point to &quot;what someone else didn&#39;t say&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gee, my 6th grade science teacher didn&#39;t mention that Santa Claus was fake, so therefore Santa Claus must be real!&quot;</p>

<p>as for the rest of your questions: yes</p>

<p>NASA is hollywood</p>

<p>No, but they had a space program. They put a satellite in orbit before us. Put a man in orbit before us. A woman too. Do you believe this happened? They put a dog in orbit too. I&#39;m obviously not listing these in order. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting point.  If they had conclusive proof, I&#39;m sure that they would have announced it - they had quite a propaganda machine.  But since I don&#39;t know how you would prove it, I don&#39;t know what they would have to say about it.  When sputnik went up, they could detect a signal from it all over the world (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1</a>). So if we faked satellites, I would think they would have called us on it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There was a cold war though. I&#39;m talking about long before the Clinton&#39;s. I&#39;m pretty sure the cold war was a real thing.  I remember when those relations were bad. It ended when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. So a bit before Bill Clinton, long before Hillary Clinton. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;cold war&quot; gave the US government a reason to hand out billions of tax dollars to their friends in the military industrial complex. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Government never wastes a crisis. Just because someone made money selling arms to the government doesn&#39;t mean that we didn&#39;t need them for our defense. I&#39;m not saying everthing that happened is ethical or necessary, but when you&#39;re in a pissing contest with a country like the Soviet Union, it&#39;s probably time to build a few bombers. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s necessarily true.  Defending against a domestic airline flight would mean having fighters in the air pretty constantly, in what I imagine is a pretty crowded air space.  I&#39;m pretty sure that protecting the Pentagon itself is not the DoD&#39;s primary misson. </p>

<p>There are people out there who are not our friends.  We have to be prepared to defend ourselves.  Sometimes the system sucks. There&#39;s not a lot we can do about it except vote. And if you&#39;re really rich you could buy an island. And not deal with government... but then eventually you might have to defend your island, have allies, build roads, schools... you see where I&#39;m going with this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry you&#39;re not alone. It&#39;s going to be very difficult to have people examine the outer space evidence with an open mind.  Good luck.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some of my opinion lower in the thread:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59eyhy/theory_when_a_civilization_reaches_a_certain/d97yox7/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59eyhy/theory_when_a_civilization_reaches_a_certain/d97yox7/</a></p>

<p>Anyway, props on the thought provoking theory.  It&#39;s hard to make sense of the &quot;why&quot;, given that all of the footage in outer space is fake (hard to say, but as you point out, even one spoiled apple can ruin the bunch)</p>

<p>Other options include </p>

<p>1) Fraudulent raising of money.<br/>
2) Scientism as a masked religion of sorts (Think &quot;Big Bang,&quot; existentialist human purposelessness)<br/>
3) Psychopathic humans containing us through psychological warfare, fakery and propaganda  </p>

<p>Could get weirder...<br/>
4) Concave Earth<br/>
5) Extra terrestrials containing us through psychological warfare, fakery and propaganda    </p>

<p>And perhaps less weird:<br/>
6) We really went to space and all of the footage is kept secret from mass consumption<br/>
7) We went to space and some of the footage is fake and some of it is real.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult to say, brother.   <strong>What I know is that at least some of the footage they are trying to pass off as real, is fake.</strong></p>

<p>Anyway, if anyone is still reading, they should look closely at the evidence their self and decide without preconceived notions</p>

<p>I&#39;ve considered some of the other options you&#39;ve listed.</p>

<p>Perhaps the scam was so sweet financially they had to keep it up.</p>

<p>It really creeps me out as to the reasons why they fake the shape of the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to think that we may be on a Jupiter or greater sized planet. We are in an enclosed and perhaps some sort of mill.. what they are harvesting? Who knows.. our souls? Our energy? Maybe they survive off our waste which is why they have no problem with us creating so much...perhaps we are a giant blood drive for them...</p>

<p>So I would say flat.. but I think it&#39;s bigger than that... I think the whole flat earth thing is a distraction for the reality which is that there is more than what&#39;s just under the dome... Perhaps other enclosers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating.  You might be on to something, since many of the major religions include some form of &quot;be fruitful and multiply.&quot;  That sort of thing...</p>

<p>Flat earth is most definitely a psy-op which blasphemes conspiracy/truth researchers whom may very well be on to something tremendous.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you a flat earther?!??!!?&quot;  </p>

<p>This response has been retorted not only towards cosmological conspiracy/truth researchers, but really any type.</p>
