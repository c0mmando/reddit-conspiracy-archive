<p>Lastly, they show that our government isn&#39;t run by the elected, they are basically useful idiots for the shadow government.</p>

<p>Our real president is Soros. He is actually the president of many countries.</p>

<p>I feel right now every move is calculated to usher in Russia and China as the next world super powers. </p>

<p>In the future, expect Russia to save the world from big bad illegal war starting murderous USA. </p>

<p>For all we know, the people who are being exposed in these emails are also being played by Soros as his ultimate goal is destabilizing the US. What better way than to show the citizens what&#39;s really going on, sit back and watch the shit show take off.</p>

<p>Correct, but too many don&#39;t know this and, therefore, the power gets manipulated, diverted, and rerouted <em>away</em> from its source (the individual themselves) and used by other covert figures.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not all the same though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don’t need to be to still all be equals.  Does that mean that someone with an IQ of mud should be doing the same work as a genius?  Of course not.</p>

<p>That’s not what I mean or am referring to, however.</p>

<p>Both types should never be discriminated against, however, made fun of, disparaged, or prevented from pursuing everything they can.  They shouldn’t be prevented from attempting to strive toward whatever they so chose to, see fit, and are capable of.  They shouldn’t be discouraged from arriving at whatever peaks they work toward.  They shouldn’t be prevented from working in whatever area they’re capable of working at.</p>

<p>These might seem like obvious things, but these rights are not the case on this planet for everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are hungry, I&#39;m going to feed my hungry child or wife over you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you are hungry, I would feed you.  Period.  And I wouldn’t need to take food away from my wife or child to do that.  Thinking that such a scenario is necessary is a straw man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are not the same, and thinking we are is naive (and actually steals away self and dignity) at best, dangerous at worst.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is truly naive is having as narrow and limiting an interpretation of what I’m actually meaning as this.  At best, it actually prevents the true potential of every individual from being reached.  At worst, it is downright ignorant and destroying of an individual’s ultimate abilities (not the least is one’s own).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not all of us want freedom, not all of us want risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not everyone may want “risk”, per se - but freedom, if defined properly, seems a quality everyone strives for in their own way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There will always be those who do, and those who do not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this never has to prevent anyone from still existing respectfully in a world that doesn’t involve the level of despicable racism and prejudice that this one does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plato&#39;s Allegory of the cave...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems it would be to <em>everyone’s</em> benefit to not look at existence as a series of chimeras.</p>

<p>I chose to strive toward reality - that reality that shows everything as being different parts of The One Reality.  Everything working in unison doesn’t require everything being “exactly the same” - something I was never saying in the first place.</p>

<p>If one wishes to live a quiet life at home and not bother anyone or be bothered, then that’s fine.  If one choses to be a daredevil and live life “on the edge”, then they can do that too.  One is not nor should they ever be considered “better” than another for what they chose to do one way or the other, however.</p>

<p>It seems it would be to <em>everyone’s</em> benefit to not look at existence as a series of chimeras.</p>
