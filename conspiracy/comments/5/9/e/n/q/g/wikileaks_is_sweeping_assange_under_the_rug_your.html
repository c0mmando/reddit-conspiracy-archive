<p>Heheh, the 4chan generation. Someone said something once, so it must be true.</p>

<p>Assange&#39;s well being is not a CTR meme, and worrying about him does not discredit the leaks. It draws more interest to the entire cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here, we are corralled and studied rather than being openly oppressed. but the upside of that is relative freedom of speech.  They&#39;re studying what we might know and what we might do. I have no problem telling them. I might label and categorize them in the same ways they expect to label and categorize me. It then becomes a matter of which side has more merit and ability to convince.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of groups now engaged in persona management but they are having little effect compared to what they must  have expected.</p>

<p>Once the government decided that it is OK to deceive us,  no statement of theirs holds any credibility other than expressions of force. </p>

<p>People far removed from conspiracy circles know there&#39;s something majorly wrong with what&#39;s going on.  They could be readily shown.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Trump supporter (but I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;ve warmed up to him considerably as my anger at Hillary intensifies). But even so over the past couple months r/conspiracy r/wikileaks and r/the_donald have become major sources of news for me.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy never used to be a place where I went for news. I&#39;m a 9/11 truth guy and I enjoy a good theory so I&#39;d be here occasionally. But this election has dragged a lot of conspiracy theory to the surface and now the front page of this subreddit is one of the most reliable places I know.</p>

<p>Anyhow it&#39;s been really sad to see r/wikileaks get overrun. I truly hope Assange is still with us but my doubts are starting to feel more certain.</p>

<p>If anyone has any other good sources for information please pass them along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the tactics by those who are in power and have something to hide, is to discredit and derail online conversations. This was published in a well known FBI/NSA presentation a year or two ago, I believe. They have documented methods that have actual names and examples, for how to change the course of an online discussion. I have no doubt that the tactics are being executed in full effect here on Reddit.</p>

<p>One of the methods is to discredit whoever is speaking. And a tactic that has been used to accomplish this for decades now, is to claim that anyone who is worried about a conspiracy taking place is a crazy crackpot. And then, they bring out the craziest conspiracies and worst examples of thins that have no evidence with the most socially maladapted supporters and convince people to roll their eyes any time the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; comes up.</p>

<p>One of the amazing evolutions that I&#39;ve seen in this election cycle is that the conspiracy subreddit has actually gained credibility for the term conspiracy. With all the disinformation that is out there in the mainstream media, there are very few places that someone can turn to, to get some actual real news.</p>

<p>I have high hopes for this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Kerry visited the Ecuadorian embassy almost two weeks ago I think (not sure on the exact date).</p>

<p>Julian Assange then disappears. It has been approximately 10 days since anyone has been able to confirm that he is alive, much less if he is even in the embassy still.</p>

<p>Ecuador released a press statement after Kerry left, saying they have cut off internet access to Assange. But this does not explain why no one has seen him, and no one has proof that he is alive.</p>

<p>The Wikileaks subreddit has 11 moderators, 7 of which were appointed in the past three days.</p>

<p>Social media accounts for Wikileaks have been behaving extremely strangely lately, particularly Twitter and Reddit. I believe they are releasing Podesta emails on a daily basis to do their best to distract people from the fact that Assange is missing. Don&#39;t get me wrong, HRC&#39;s email server drama is a big story, and very important. But not as important as Assange possibly having been extradited to US custody.</p>

<p>Everyone is asking Wikileaks, &quot;where is Julian?!&quot; They tried to post pictures and videos that are months old, but people have proven that they were old pictures and did not prove anything. There have been written statements, but again that is not proof.</p>

<p>I asked this morning in the Wikileaks subreddit about the status of Assange, and well, this post shows what came of that.</p>

<p>You should refer to the post &quot;Where is Julian Assange&quot;? that is stickied in this subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595o8y/where_is_julian_assange/">(link)</a> for a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sponsored approach.

<p>Also. This morning, Wikileaks stickied to the top of the sub, a picture of Julian holding a kitten. I did my best to call them out for such an obvious distraction tactic (not just the post itself, but what I believe were paid commentators in the thread and the rest of the subreddit).</p>

<p>It is no longer stickied. They probably realized it was too obvious of a distraction tactic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, this is some of the greatest CTR mental gymnastics i have seen in a long time. Assange, dead or alive, is being used to distract people from the leaks, using big threads like this having everyone argue over whether or not he&#39;s alive, with no new evidence and just wild speculation, INSTEAD OF COMBING THROUGH THE NEW LEAKS AND SPREADING THEM LIKE WILDFIRE. IF JULIAN IS DEAD THE DEADMAN SWITCH WILL CONFIRM IT. We need to make sure to remain focused on the leaks. Am I worried about him? Yes. But this sort of fear mongering is meant to distract us from the leaks. <strong>THATS WHY MOST REDDITORS PUSHING THE IS JULIAN DEAD NARRATIVE HAVE SHORT ACCOUNT HISTORIES. DON&#39;T LET THESE GUYS &quot;CORRECT THE RECORD&quot;</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>That has been and continues to be my main theme here. </p>

<p>I told the people I knew  in real life I was going to label the leadership as psychopaths some 4 years ago and have  set out to do so. It turnes out no one has disagreed that I&#39;m aware of. </p>

<p>The leaders are psychopaths who are driven to seek power based on unfounded fear of others. Once in possession of power they make decisions based on greed alone with no other factor playing a part.</p>

<p>To them, if a million people have to die for the psychopath to be able to force that one more dram of dopamine or serotonin   into their consciousness, then so be it.</p>

<p>They&#39;re far too dangerous to the population and  the planet to be allowed to rule.</p>

<p>If psychopaths weren&#39;t rewarded with power, we&#39;d have a lot less of them and their numbers and influence wouldn&#39;t be expanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The top is rooted in the primitive part of the brain down close to the neck  that  thinks animalistically.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the only possible way important events have been able to play out the way they have.</p>

<p>Civilizing qualities such as empathy conscience  and remorse emanate  from the upper and outer, newer, regions of the brain. Psychopaths don&#39;t rely on those portions.</p>

<p>Unable to feel any of the qualities that allowed civilization to form, they fear that, everyone is like themselves. They crave control of others to protect themselves from that possibility and, of course, for fun and profit. They live by the principals of the Law of the Jungle, of, Dog Eat Dog and of the  Survival of the Fittest.</p>

<p>The logical conclusion of such a leadership mindset is that there should be competition  among us for survival to the fullest extent possible,  ending with a final  human dog surviving in a jungle somewhere. </p>

<p>Such a goal being predominately practiced by leadership, lets call it the  law of the surviving human  dog,  guarantees the end of civilization. </p>

<p>Are we really just animals after all, or have we surpassed that limited  self defeating outlook  and become human beings  capable of feeling and acting on  empathy, Conscience and  occasionally remorse?</p>

<p>It was a shit poll, designed only to delay and distract. Anyone with half a brain can figure out what is required for proof of life to be authentic.</p>

<p>They are probably torturing Assange now to convince him to make a video pretending he&#39;s fine, or else.</p>

<p>Or, they are scrambling their digital team to cgi rendering. If I were in charge of US intelligence, I would most definitely put forward a program where high profile persons had a believable digital model that could be used to make fake videos, along with using fake voice samples to add a fake voice.</p>

<p>And then, any videos that are released would never be direct digital copies of the render. It would be a shitty quality cellphone video with the front facing camera. It would be grainy and blurry enough to hide any problems with the render.</p>

This method was used with Hillary&#39;s emails when they were originally sent, and we have records of it. This proves that they are authentic.</p>

<p>I wish I had a better source - I do not know what the original source is. But here is a news article from Fox News (heaven help me for posting this link):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I understand. I was agreeing. I know they were verified. I was just saying that I would appreciate the Russians giving us info <em>if</em> our own goverment wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>We can verify them. The fact that the MSM can&#39;t grasp this is just more proof that they for the most part; &quot;Parents Just Don&#39;t Understand&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. You are getting CTR accusations because your rationalizations trip all over themselves.</p>

<p>I lean left. That doesnt mean I buy into the Russia &quot;threat&quot;. That doesn&#39;t mean I have to pick between the &quot;lesser&quot; of two evils. That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not liberal.</p>

<p>All it means is I don&#39;t support &quot;neoliberalism&quot;. Ie: the &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, hands off, &quot;do what thou wilt (as long as it is for personal benefit)&quot; approach to all of the people who have given her money and influenced her campaign.</p>

<p>Hillary can&#39;t even decide where she stands. She changes her stance depending on the audience she is speaking to.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/-dY77j6uBHI">https://youtu.be/-dY77j6uBHI</a> (2:11)</p>

<p>The funny yet convoluted thing is that she is a neoliberal, neoconservative, faceless marionette. Her policy is derived from money. She serves no country. She serves (TBD at auction)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with what you&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>What can you possibly think to accomplish other than cause disruption and serve as a distraction?</p>

<p>You want to have an open discussion about Assange; specifically his whereabouts? What makes you think any of the mods know? Users keep creating self-posts claiming he&#39;s dead and questioning the legitimacy of Wikileaks. All that is doing is serving as a distraction to the email leaks and confusing users.</p>

<p>Save the speculation for this sub. After all, you have no proof. You and other users are calling for proof of life, but what makes you think <a href="/r/Wikileaks">/r/Wikileaks</a> can even help you with that? Then you turn around an conclude Wikileaks is compromised because they don&#39;t meet your demands. Come on...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have it the other way around. I am claiming the emails are a convenient distraction to keep people from paying attention to the fact that Assange is missing.</p>

<p>And you are claiming that discussing Assange being missing is distracting from the Hillary&#39;s use of a private email server, and covering it up.</p>

<p>Which one is more important? Obviously, I know where I stand, and you know where you stand. But it is not up to you or me to make that decision for everybody.</p>

<p>So, I will take this opportunity to likewise say that I disagree with what YOU&#39;RE doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The emails were being released to the public before any of this speculation began.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at this chronologically:</p>

<p>1) Assange releases DNC emails before the DNC convention. </p>

<p>2) Assange does media rounds </p>

<p>3) Assange announces more emails will be released during Wikileaks anniversary.</p>

<p>4) Podesta Emails are released almost daily. 10 editions released up to the next event.</p>

<p>5) Assange&#39;s Internet is cut by Ecuador</p>

<p>6) Podesta Emails 11 are released</p>

<p>7) People begin to speculate on Assange</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand where you&#39;re getting that the emails are being used as a distraction if they&#39;ve been releasing them for months all while speculation on Assange has only been taking place for around a week.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping you can see where my confusion is coming from as I&#39;d like to understand your point of view.</p>
