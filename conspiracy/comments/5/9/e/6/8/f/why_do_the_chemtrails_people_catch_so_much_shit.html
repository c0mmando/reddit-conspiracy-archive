       I didn't use to subscribe to chem trails. Always thought it was a little too tinfoily. But now with the alien invasion lasers getting warmed up for election day I can see the use of chem trails to create the sodium layer they need for the holograms to work.

        Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.

       Because spraying who knows what into the stratosphere just seems kinda stupid. Like, who would ever do that? Also, chemtrails... well, water is a chemical... people know that harmful chemicals are what's meant, but still, saying chemicals doesn't tell us anything. What is this magical chemical in chemtrails that people are supposedly so keen on spraying, formaldehyde? What ARE the names of some bad chemicals, and what do they do?
      </p>
      <p>
       And spraying so high up, what, 5-6 miles in the air? That seems too spread out/diluted to do anything. I know there's crop dusters for spraying pesticides on farm crops, but do you know how low those little biplanes fly? They have to fly super low to hit the target/get a good concentration of chemicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just seems like it would be a pointless waste of money. Like, industry doesn't create waste for the sake of poisoning the planet, the waste is a byproduct of something else they're doing to make money. And you know how much plane tickets cost, so one must imagine it'd be really expensive to fly all those chemicals up into the air, and for what? To poison people? Sick people are less productive, so what's the point?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, imagine taking on whatever chemicals on passenger jets... you'd have to do that, there's not enough cargo planes for it. But what airline would agree to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;Dr: "It sounds expensive, ineffective, and pointless even if it did work, so I don't see a good reason for it even if one is crooked and without morals."

       Expensive? The flights are already running.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ineffectivity would need to be measured against intent. Are you presuming that there could be only one reason to release chemicals into the air? I can think of a few off the top of my head. 
1. Military has multiple uses for release of chemicals and metals from the air. 
2. Crop dusting?
3. Cloud seeding?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are old practices and aren't really that expensive so let's move to your idea that it's pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       As pointless as the high levels of fluoride in public water supplies? And before you say it's good for teeth, floride does nothing for your teeth by swallowing it. If you don't brush and drink fluoridated water your teeth still rot. Floride is toxic to humans, hinders mental capacity, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I totally buy the idea, but I can understand why others do. Totally not out of the realms of plausibility.

       As an aside, a good question is, why do planes sometimes leave contrails and sometimes don't?
      </p>
      <p>
       It costs $25 to check a bag, and how much does airmail cost? Already flying or not, I can't image airlines would give up cargo space cheap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accurate or not, floridated water is promoted as good for teeth. I don't know of anything that people are trying to sell as a "health service" that needs to be sprayed from miles up in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd assume cloud seeding wouldn't be done on a clear blue day, so you wouldn't see the trails, they'd be hidden by clouds. Chemtrails refer to the ones you can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_application">
        Crop dusting
       </a>
       is too low to the ground to leave a trail in the sky. Chemtrails refer to the ones high up. If it's low to the ground, it'd be aerial spraying, not "chemtrails".
      </p>
      <p>
       The military has used agent orange to defoliate in Vietnam, but that's also pretty low to the ground (not as low as crop dusting, though), a couple hundred feet up at most. It also doesn't look like a contrail. Chemtrails refer to those that look like contrails.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would be more useful, besides cloud seeding, to spray miles up in the sky, as opposed to a few hundred feet up or less?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure it's plausible someone's thought of something they want sprayed from that high up for one reason or another. But OP wanted to know why it sounds far-fetched to people.

       I'm pointing out that aerial spraying isn't very expensive, has been going on a long time, and I mentioned fluoride to suggest that the reason for aerial spraying may be along the same lines as the reasons for fluoridation of tap water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Microbial heavy metals that build up in the blood stream, are toxic to humans causing illness in the long run and IIRC calcification of certain areas of the brain and fertility issues in lab rats. What about this would be beneficial from the perspective of those who see our world as a Stratego game board? Control, money, population control.. take your pick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like a win win from that perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again not saying I totally buy this theory, but I can't see how it's far fetched either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: microbial sprays and gases would take up very little space as they could be compressed.

       Way to pivot. That's really great having a well and all. I've had a couple over the years. Hope you don't live in oil country, or south of/close to an unregulated waste dump, and own a lot of land. Bush had regulations passed that allow your neighbor to frack and drain the water under your land if they can reach it from their property.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point still stands. The public water supplies have intentionally had a toxic substance added to them. In the same way you having a well protects you ( if you're lucky ) from said toxins, being super rich you could have your own mountain spring, oxygen filters, etc.
      </p>

       The people in question are so far removed from the public they can't even begin to comprehend our viewpoints, plights, or lifestyles. Watch a time lapse video of Chem trails and see how they don't disperse like water vapor or ice crystals, so much as slowly spread and float to the ground. I don't claim to know what it is or why, but I really can't see how difficult it is to believe that people are partaking in unsavory practices that are detrimental to the public in order to further their own agendas.

       I think it's because so many chemtrail videos on YouTube show regular contrails and or don't understand them, thus make false statements and false conclusions (I.e. Contrails can't do A therefore B)
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT - chemtrails are a very well documented fact, at least to the extent of cloud seeding. I've been on the job section of airlinepilotforums.com for several years, and there gave always been professionals openly discussing the ins and outs of the jobs and equipment in the job posting forums. Definitely something that's hiding in 'plane' sight. Most of the guys I've seen posting about it say they flew large, old airplanes (like DC-8 and similar) many owned by government, as private contractors or subcontractors, got sent on different 'missions' most of the time, flew somewhere, dumped the goods, and returned. It's kind of a bottom feeder pilot job for unemployed pilots who got laid off from airlines and freight carriers, or used to get hours and type rating on larger jets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess that's all sort of a tangent but I've never seen it mentioned here, and it's out there. To answer the question though, I think it's because there's so much disinfo out there about them.

       I'm somebody who doesn't believe in chemtrails, so maybe I can help you understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say we have the technology, but the technology to do... What exactly? My biggest problem with the chemtrails community is the vagueness of their claims. I've heard chemtrails are used for everything from mind control to climate engineering, to weather control, to cloud seeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all very different claims, but in my experience those who believe in chemtrails think that if they can prove one, it somehow proves all  the nebulous claims surrounding chemtrails.

       Umm. Cloud seeding is real and weather control was used at the Beijing Olympics. Nobody questions the authenticity of this type of spraying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spraying in question is the type that resembles chum in military ops. It leaves a lingering trail that spreads into a cloud instead of dissolving like water vapor (contrails) does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are confusing the knowledge of something happening of which the particulars can only be speculated at without further information, with multiple theories having different claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the difference if we are secretly being sprayed with a chemical or a heavy metal? Lots depending on the intent and outcome, but very little as far as being secretly sprayed by someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a stranger walked by and sprayed the back of your neck every day you might feel better when you find out its just water in the spray bottle, but if they won't tell you what they are spraying you with I'm sure you would have a different reaction.

       I'm not confusing anything. I'm saying that in my experience chemtrail believers have often used proof of cloud seeding as evidence for other forms of chemtrails like mind control or weather control.

       Yes I know what clouds are and should have been more clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure there are time lapse videos out there that show this, but what I've seen or had pointed out would be the ones that don't spread evenly, persist in a cloudless sky, have sinking offshoots and other abnormalities that look nothing like a cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
       They resemble more what you see from skywriters but heavier because parts float and parts sink. I am not explaining this very well. Sorry for that.

       Whatever the motive for any 'spraying' scheme might be.... depopulation, dumbing down the sheeple, there are far easier and cheaper and more precise ways of achieving it. What's the use of pumping chemicals into the jetstream at 40,000 feet if they are going to be blown half way round the globe before they come back to earth? Why not just use a truck to drive around neighbourhoods - especially 'those' neighbourhoods (wink wink) and spray them at night when nobody's watching?

       Incremental is the key word here. Surgical strikes tend to create backlash.

       Dumb down the population with heavy metals a little at a time and they won't notice. Make them sick and gain more money. Kill their reproductive ability over generations and who can point at you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at political agendas and how they are incrementally introduced to the public before slapping them in the face with new legislation. Look at the Podesta emails talking about utilizing and inciting violence to further agendas and apply those tactics to everyday life, because that's reality.

       As an aside, a good question is, why do planes sometimes leave contrails and sometimes don't?
      </p>
      <p>
       It costs $25 to check a bag, and how much does airmail cost? Already flying or not, I can't image airlines would give up cargo space cheap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accurate or not, floridated water is promoted as good for teeth. I don't know of anything that people are trying to sell as a "health service" that needs to be sprayed from miles up in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd assume cloud seeding wouldn't be done on a clear blue day, so you wouldn't see the trails, they'd be hidden by clouds. Chemtrails refer to the ones you can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_application">
        Crop dusting
       </a>
       is too low to the ground to leave a trail in the sky. Chemtrails refer to the ones high up. If it's low to the ground, it'd be aerial spraying, not "chemtrails".
      </p>
      <p>
       The military has used agent orange to defoliate in Vietnam, but that's also pretty low to the ground (not as low as crop dusting, though), a couple hundred feet up at most. It also doesn't look like a contrail. Chemtrails refer to those that look like contrails.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would be more useful, besides cloud seeding, to spray miles up in the sky, as opposed to a few hundred feet up or less?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure it's plausible someone's thought of something they want sprayed from that high up for one reason or another. But OP wanted to know why it sounds far-fetched to people.
