       We hear it over and over, and it's never been more true than right now.
       <strong>
        Information is power

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need to explain to you the NSA's wealth of information. Knowing what they collect on us, can you imagine what they collect on potential threats to their operation? Think about who could potentially hurt the NSA. Insider whistleblowers, of course, foreign agents, sure. Surely they are protected against attacks from other US federal agencies. It is completely logical that the NSA has data on Comey going beyond the regular amount of data they keep on citizens.
       <strong>
        Comey is a potential threat
       </strong>
       . FBIanon told us of pedofiles into human trafficking.. Is it possible they have him dead to rights in a children trafficking ring? FBIanon seemed to imply that very high up and imortant people to the case may be involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not long ago, an NSA whistleblower told us that the leaks came from the NSA. This was kept very quiet, but now it's all coming together.
       <strong>
        The NSA does not want Hillary to be president
       </strong>
       . They must have thought the emails would be enough. Or that more would be released. Or that Assange would still be alive, willing, and able to release the smoking guns that FBIanon claimed.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       So instead of sink Comey,  they approach him with a win-win situation. They allow him to announce the re-opening. This allows Comey to save some of the soul that he sold to the Clinton Carter. I'm sure he hasn't been sleeping well. He knows what he did. The weiner case provides a perfect conduit to trace the data along in a way that doesn't include evidence obtained illegally and thus inadmissible in court. FBIanon: "
       <strong>
        The leaks will have to be made in a non-transparent fashion.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey's reputation is somewhat restored as now he's
       <em>
        finally
       </em>
       done the right thing. The NSA has gotten what they want in that Clinton is not in office. (I do wonder what her plan was for the NSA that caused the agency to dispise her so?) The whole thing is very, very clean. The NSA has  operated as a surgical knife, cutting away the cancer that is NWO. These are likely the heroes who's names we will never know.

The only way to get one is if you are specifically read on to a program, have a need to know, then you must physically go to a location and pass through several layers of security to even look at the program. A good example in non-classified terms would be the locations and operations of our intelligence operatives around the glove, or our missile silo locations.

         All I can tell you about the SAPs is that Hillary had them, and she did not have proper authority to have any of them. They were leaked to her by someone, and she did sell them to overseas donors. Possessing them alone makes her guilty of treason.

        Hillary Clinton somehow obtained information that was categorically "beyond classified" - On a possibly NSA "Need to know" only basis. She then sold that information to overseas agencies. FBIanon has been correct up until now, and applying his words to this theory is fucking chilling. Did Hillary try to go head to head with the NSA? Did this information contain information about the NSA directly?

       If you really want to start thinking, read about the ongoing political scandal right now in S. Korea with Park and the 8 Goddess. It is crazy, insane conspiracy coming true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, they caught one of the billionaire "goddess", Choi Sun Sil. Apparently, she had ties with "an ambassador" in the States (Hillary).
      </p>
      <p>
       She is gone AWOL in Germany recently. Some think that Merkel could be a goddess too, same as Hillary and Dilma Rousseff (Brazil). Basically, women trying to push a NWO like what's going in S. Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crazy rabbit hole...dig on /conspiracy, there is a few threads with 4chan links and news link.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have been following wikileaks, you probably saw an email with the mention of The Shadow Government. Well, it is getting uncovered in South Korea right now.

       This is the question I have been asking for months. All this focus on classified this and that, when really, the question should be, why do it in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO, she did it to consolidate communication between the state department, the Clinton foundation, and the world's wealthy, powerful, and well-connected in a place that would remain far away from any sort of accountability. It is the information in the emails that is most important, the connections between the players, the power structure and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer these questions, follow the money. Then see who answers to who. Uncover media influence to identify propaganda. Look beyond the local environment and identify the effects taking place on the global scale. And finally, be skeptical of everything, even this post.

       I see what you're saying. Funny you gtry to ride my ass about reading comprehension. because I said "Do you think we are more disarmed to women ..."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking for that posters opinion. I'm not having some redpill revelation mid-thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as CTR goes it's better to shoot first and ask questions later as far as I'm concerned. I misread your post as saying FBI anon had an active thread right now. You dropped a bad link then didn't reply again. It's a goal of CTR to make ppl waste time. And plus I said "till confirmed otherwise". Don't be butthurt. if it's not true just move on.

       to be clear you're talking about my "disarmed" post? so according to you I copy and pasted what 10 words from red pill? right. I am a believer in most red pill ideas and have been for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most are disarmed to the more manipulative social nature of women. You seem to think that I shouldn't let my opinion influence text posts
       <em>
        about
       </em>
       my opinion. you accuse me of being paranoid etc, but also accuse me of pushing a narrative or building a database of pol/reddit which is retarded as hell. Maybe you need a nap too.

       Haha not at all bothered, I was curious more than anything! I am the same way, I am about just as skeptical of anything I see on r/conspiracy as I am on r/news. I cant fault you at all brother.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.s. If you're keeping tabs on the story developing in my OP, it seems that it may be military rather than NSA. Maybe wrong on the players but I think I'm close on the overall theory. Trying to piece it all together but I have a lot of school stuff to do today.

       From what I just read, it is crazy, but very believable.  I assume you are aware of The Cabal in control of the US, right?  The true nature of government is not known to most people, but events make a lot more sense once you realize it.

       If it's true that sincere insiders of Intelligence agencies are cooperating to dismantle existing power structures behind the scenes. And they succeed, I can't wait to watch the documentary series about these events in the far future. :D The amounts of delicacy and strategy needed to pull this off is insane. There are so many layers to this / parties involved / complex relations, but oh so much dirt on people, with so much to lose.... absolutely fascinating.
Power has been in the hands of a small group of people for a looong time. I think for the first time in history they have been surpassed, namely by the data gathering intelligence agencies. 
Information is more powerful than money.

       I thought about this; and this is exactly why the NSA surveillance needs to be shut down.  While in this case, it's used to out bad stuff, it can also be used to manipulate the political process whether it's outing data on good candidates that could be a threat, manipulating courts through their jurors/judges or lawyers.  We don't want an agency choosing our leaders for us.  I know it seems like a good idea to have this helpful agency, but in the long run, they pick and choose who they help.

       Oh you're absolutely right. It's essentially "god's" weapon. Humans are not responsible/ evolved enough to use it. How would you suggest a government go about destroying the capability? I don't think we can ever again fully trust any device that can connect to another device.

       NSA is run by Christians while the media is run by the tribe. The tribe has pushed so hard for HRC and the destruction of the American populous while the NSA appears to have a core motto of protecting and maintaining national security (i.e., the unity of the people and what kept the nation on top for so long).

       I am well aware of how unpopular of an opinion this is, but I've been where you're currently leaning and after many, many readings and interpretations this is where I have landed. I will adjust my interpretation when I find the evidence that proves otherwise.

      <p>
       Counterterrorism, the top priority, given the ongoing Global War on Terror.
Nonproliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, with North Korea described as perhaps the most difficult target.
Warning/informing American leaders of important overseas events, with Pakistan described as an "intractable target".
Counterintelligence, with China, Russia, Iran, Cuba, and

       Here's my theory based on my observations and the research I've been doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       HRC made ALOT of very tech savvy enemies in her time as SOS and during the campaign. There is Wikileaks, KimDotcom, The Russians, The Chinese. All of these groups have their own support groups who are capable of downright ridiculous tech wizardry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange and Wikileaks have been targeted by her and the WH for some time. Lately however with this bizarre ToddandClare.com entity appearing out of thin air with very deep roots and even deeper pockets and Ecuador cutting Assange's communications, it appears that someone is ratcheting up the pressure. Which given Assange's promises to release enough damning evidence to lock HRC up, provides a plausible motive for her to want him out of the picture. Well, the problem is, ALOT of really smart people like Wikileaks. So everything is being picked over with a fine toothed comb. There is also an element of Wikileaks supporters that operates in the darker corners of the interwebs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then there's KimDotcom. Internet celebrity in certain circles and something of a tech wizard himself. She signed his extradition order, which led to him losing everything he has, and he hates her for it. He's also acquainted with Assange and has also vowed to help get her arrested for her email shenanigans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is Russia. Everyone knows, (or should), that Russia's got some pretty righteous hackers and tech wizards. Putin doesn't want a war with us. Putin wants us to butt out and leave him the fuck alone. If anything, he wants to be on good terms with us because conflict between us isn't in anyone's best interest. Clinton has been on this ridiculous anti-Russia tirade as of late.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Chinese, well they just want money and the are very much intertwined with Russia both economically and politically. What's good for one is good for the other, pretty much. China is pretty renowned for having some really ruthless operators on the interwebs. On top of that their laws make it virtually impossible to prosecute them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any one of these entities is capable of devastating things. The DNC was hacked, we know this. They had unrestricted access for over a year I believe. This person or group was good. Rumor has it Wikileaks is in possession of the missing 33000 emails and were slated to release them next week. This is of course pure speculation but we can wait and see. KimDotcom is also rumored to be the source of the leak and possibly the leaker of the 33000 emails that Wikileaks may or may not have. Who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing is for certain, something happened today and it was HUGE. Comey went back and opened a case that he really didn't have to. This was done with, all tidied up on it's way out of the collective consciousness. It could have been very easily swept away. But it wasn't, he re-opened it. On top of that, the timing for Hillary is terrible. She really doesn't need this right now this close to the election. If anything, wait a few weeks, let her get sworn in, keep everything low key and it blows over before re-election. No harm done. But he opened it back up.
      </p>
      <p>
       His conscience didn't get the better of him. He didn't do this for karma. Something or someone forced his hand. There are an abundance of theories as to what that might have been. Op gave us one theory. I think there is something out there that either really puts the nail in HRC's coffin or threatens to bring the whole house of cards down. I think this is damage control. If she still wins the election and they manage to stop whatever the information is from getting out then no harm is done they just close the case. But if not, if they have to go to plan B, then he is preparing to throw her under the bus.

       Don't forget this happened while Hillary was in the air with no internet access 30-40 minutes before a speech. That was not a coincidence. This was leaked at the exact moment Hillary and her team were unable to respond, allowing Donald Trump to shape the narrative, and turn the media against her before she even landed.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't think Trump is in on it, he just clearly took advantage. It was brilliant political theatre.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, I fully agree something major changed yesterday to force Comey's hand. The emails from Huma to Hillary are likely emails that Hillary did not turn in which were work related and possibly classified info Huma was not cleared for and would prove Huma and Hillary both lied under oath, and to the FBI. That alone is enough to prosecute. But this is all likely just a cover up for something else they found. Maybe it's the 33,000 emails or perhaps something else?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the FBI knows something else is about to leak soon, or they themselves found the smoking gun, then by reopening the case they can walk away looking like they did the right thing without much scrutiny for the original cover up. What this also means is Comey believes whatever it is, it is enough to sink Clinton's campaign, because otherwise he wouldn't risk his career over this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the NSA and KimDotCom theories... plus 4chan. It's really hard to tell what's true right now but clearly next week is going to be interesting.

       Catherine Austin Fitts said, "If Trump has the support of the military and the intelligence community, he'll win."
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone in their right mind think that either the military or the intelligence community wants Hillary in power?
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2012, we watched two factions vie for power: The traditional banking industry [which backed Barack Obama] and the hedgefunds [which backed Romney].
      </p>
      <p>
       In this election, we're seeing an altogether more monumental battle: The New World Order globalists versus the Deep State. The globalists [and their neocon minions] grafted themselves over top of the political system, like how toxoplasmosis bacteria can take over the brain of a mouse. But their weakness is that they're just grafted over the surface. Underneath the massive governmental apparatus are career lifers who care about their integrity, who care about their country, and who resent the con-men being placed in positions of power above them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're watching a rebellion taking place: The Deep State shaking off the soft-coup of the globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a battle for the future of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will it continue to exist as a sovereign nation, or will it be subordinated into a larger global grid run by bankers?
      </p>
      <p>
       To know what the conclusion will be, we'll have to wait until November 8th. But until then, only one thing is sure: Trump is being aided quietly by the Deep State, while Hillary's backers are more like the George Soros globalists.

       One of the embarrassments of this election cycle was Elizabeth Warren (demonstrating her singular talent for tone-deafness) denouncing "Wall Street corruption and the Koch Brothers" as an attack on Republicans--apparently unaware that Wall Street and the Koch brothers were supporting

       If Clinton knows this then the NSA is fighting for its sovereignty right now. If Clinton's campaign knows they were the leaks and opposed her if she gets into office she will attempt to quell this dissent. I think that in a funny way net neutrality is tied to the health of the NSA

       Here is my issue with this statement, lets travel back to September around the time of the bombings.  Within a few minute minutes while traveling, Hillary made a

       </a>
       .  Now with that being said, I am certain she knew the event unfolding.
      </p>
      <p>
       From Clinton herself in air:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I’ve breen briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey, and the attack in Minnesota. Obviously, we need to do everything we can to support our first responders, also to pray for the victims. We have to let this investigation unfold. We’ve been in touch with various officials, including the mayor’s office in New York, to learn what they are discovering as they conduct this investigation. And I’ll have more to say about it when we actually know the facts?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So I am fairly certain she knew what was going on.  I am almost positive that's why she took so long to get off the plane as well, and then didn't even talk about it during her first speech?  I don't buy it personally.

       While I'm sure someone on that plane got a text, or a phone call, they were not prepared to broadcast live and respond immediately. From what it sounds like, no one in the Clinton camp anticipated this.

       Very nice. I like it. I made a thread a week or so ago about what I think is going on with assange. (disclaimer I'm not sure) I think he's probably fine. He already knows he will sink HRC and is holding his other cards close to his chest. I got into a little bit how I wouldn't be surprised at all if he's working with a foreign government like russia who has internests in letting HRC die cold and alone and NOT in the oval office.
      </p>

       What if on that morning john kerry made his threats and that government  group that swooped in and out of the embasy didn't capture julian, but snuck in a a high ranking official from another government to work out his deal? JA trades in his Hillary card and they negotiate a deal where Julian can have some semblance of a normal life back...

       Enter Good ol' international
       <strong>
        Clinton mole Sidney Blumenthal
       </strong>
       ... yeah that guy banned by Obama from ever setting foot near the white house (but illegal private server in basement is fair game), apparently passing around obtained NSA intelligence reports to his Queen Empress:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://observer.com/2016/09/emailgate-and-the-mystery-of-the-missing-gamma/">
        http://observer.com/2016/09/emailgate-and-the-mystery-of-the-missing-gamma/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Not to mention that, in terms of verbiage and format, Blumenthal’s email read exactly like classified NSA reporting, as anybody acquainted with our SIGINT would immediately recognize. As one veteran agency official told me back in January,
        <strong>
         Blumenthal’s email was NSA information with “at least 90 percent confidence.”
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Which was no coincidence, since an NSA investigation subsequently determined that Blumenthal’s Sudan assessment was derived from their reporting—in some cases verbatim. As I reported in March,
        <strong>
         NSA concluded that Blumenthal’s Sudan report came from four different agency SIGINT reports, all classified Top Secret/SCI.
        </strong>
        Then it got worse:
       </p>
       <p>
        At least one of those reports was issued under the GAMMA compartment, which is an NSA handling caveat that is applied to extraordinarily sensitive information (for instance, decrypted conversations between top foreign leadership, as this was). GAMMA is properly viewed as a SIGINT Special Access Program, or SAP, several of which Clinton compromised in another series of her “unclassified” emails.
       </p>
       <p>
        NSA had no doubt that Blumenthal somehow got his hands on some of their “crown jewels” information. “It’s word-for-word, verbatim copying,” an agency official of them explained. “In one case, an entire paragraph was lifted from an NSA report” that was classified Top Secret/SCI.
        <strong>
         To add to the mystery, Sid emailed Hillary his “personal” assessment on Sudan only hours after some of those classified NSA reports were issued.
        </strong>

       honestly for those of us who read thousands of emails and all of the ones from Blumenthal directly from the FOIA servers (in my case, even before the press did) this comes as absolutely no surprise. Some of the wording made it impossible to come from anywhere except for intelligence briefings from spies. Stuff like "Extremely sensitive source close to the Libyan government reports that:" and etc. This is NSA work. This is GAMMA classified stuff. I was absolutely FLABBERGASTED reading that shit and then hearing her tell the public that she never transmitted or received classified info. That is literally stuff that we would kill people to stop the release of.

       Sidney was/is the intelligence guru feeding US foreign policy intelligence back to the Mob boss for Clinton Foundation purposes.

       Pretty ignorant. The NSA is part of the system man. They aren't some rogue robin hood agency doing good around the world. (In this case knee capping and NWO plan) Get real. They are part of the NWO! They are the worst agency in the government. They have more secrets than the CIA and FBI combined

       I meant point conceded, as in OK I agree with you about that sentence. But are you saying in your opinion there's nothing Hillary could have done to have pissed them off to where they leave her out to dry?

       TBH, I think these agencies had to grow very fast, they needed to contract a lot of the smartest people in the world very fast to keep up. They are definitely the most powerful institutions on the planet right now. I think at the very least a subset of people working there will not be loyal to the NWO. Maybe just a few are conspiring while maintaining an appearance of loyalty. I don't know the inner workings, can only guess.
What I am fairly certain of is that the people that work there are far more intelligent than the TPTB. And they do have the opportunity to achieve the most valuable task that has ever been undertaken in the history of human-kind. Certainly something I would risk my life for.

       I know I did a fair amount of speculating, but I hope I separated it thoroughly enough from what is fact and/or FBIanon's words.
      </p>
      <p>
       I speculate further that the information is directly related to NSA interests or operatives. I think it would take something massive to make the NSA lash out at a secretary of state. The more you lash out, the more you are compromised. I'm sure the NSA has covered it's tracks well here, or maybe not even broken the law at all. (Aside from whoever leaked the SAP, of course).

       My guess is the FBI now likely has dirt on Obama or Obama ordered this to throw Clinton under the bus to protect his legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 33,000 emails Clinton illegally deleted contained her communications with Obama. Wikileaks confirmed this. The cover up that allowed Hillary to walk the first time was mostly to protect Obama, and Hillary simply struck a deal with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emails the FBI just recovered were emails sent from Huma to Hillary that were likely deleted on Hillary's end. This proves Huma and Hillary did not turn in all work related emails which means they lied under oath and to the FBI which is a crime. If the content is classified then they not only lied, but broke even more laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting her elected was an insurance policy to protect Obamas legacy. Something changed yesterday, but it was enough to get Comey to reopen the case, and throw Hillary under the bus on Obamas behalf more likely then not. If they have enough evidence to bring the whole house of cards down, it makes more sense to blame it all on Hillary and end her campaign then allow her to get elected, and indicted / impeached and bring everyone else down with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hilary is in check right now, and she's going to have to sacrifice Huma to try and recover from this but it will be too late. She's a few moves from checkmate and is just now realizing it.

       "A Special Access Program is an intelligence program classified above top-secret. They are held on closed servers at secret locations. The only way to get one is if you are specifically read on to a program, have a need to know, then you must physically go to a location and pass through several layers of security to even look at the program. A good example in non-classified terms would be the locations and operations of our intelligence operatives around the glove, or our missile silo locations.
SAP is granted on a need to know basis, and Hillary did not have any need to know any of the programs on her server.
All I can tell you about the SAPs is that Hillary had them, and she did not have proper authority to have any of them. They were leaked to her by someone, and she did sell them to overseas donors. Possessing them alone makes her guilty of treason."
      </p>
      <p>
       This part never made sense to me and makes me question him in general. If these "SAP" programs are so secretive that you have to go to a secure location to see them, then it doesn't made sense that they could be viewed remotely from someones home. Secondly, if they did have a remote access feature, then they would have had to give Hillary access at some point, and or would be able to tell that she was accessing the program. Third, if she did have a SAP program installed on her computer it would have been relatively useless as the important information likely resides on some government server in a secret location that wouldn't be accessible remotely. In summary, if these SAP's are as important as people say they are then there wouldn't be away to access them remotely, and IF there were away it would be closely monitored and they would know anytime someone accessed the program thus it wouldn't be some secret that she had access.

       In one of his threads he confirmed that there was no remote access to the SAPs and that the only way he could think of her having access to them was if someone smuggled out a thumb drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while I don't disagree there is a potential flaw in the issue (i.e. why are they allowing people to carry and use thumbdrives when accessing this material??) I did just want to clarify that, according to FBIAnon, no remote access to SAP.

       Well also one more theory, could this reopening be a possible pinning on Huma? Obviously not pinning the server on her, but the FBI coming out and saying that HUMA emailed possible classified info and way back and never disclosed it, thus giving the Appearance to "on the fence" voters that they email scandal is truly "final" and "just" because of a sentence for the illegality done? Again just a though and theory of why the This comes about 2 WEEKS BEFORE WE ELECT THE NEXT PRESIDENT

       Apparently when your super rich or in  a position of power, it seems to be  a way to show your status or something.  I'm not saying that some or a lot aren't sickos but it almost seems like its  way to show just how far up the ladder they really are by doing things that are so heinous but feel they are out of reach of any legal action or action of any kind.

       God damn. I remember reading cannibalism theories about illuminati YEARS ago on 4chan. I was so young I didn't know wtf but if you are a believer in what you said above you might do some research on the cannibalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The picture was on 4chan of a human cut up on a dinner table in a kitchen with all places set. but not an ordinary table/dining room etc... This looked like the absolute fanciest most lavish vistorian style furniture, etc. I remember just enough of it. But mostly the people on the board were all talking about the furniture, and specifically the wallpaper. Some people were claiming the wallpaper was some style that had an astronomic cost to it if real.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was so long ago, the dead person on the table looked so real. I have seen good makeup etc. but I don't think it would have been possible to fake back then. Honestly so fucking eerie that it has stuck in my brain until now.
      </p>

       You might look into it if you want. Let me know if you find anything..

       Dennis Hastert was paying hush money to a man who he molested when he was a wrestling coach in Yorkville, IL or Sandwich, IL or wherever. He clearly had a full dance card of young men he was molesting throughout the years. If there was a pedophelia ring in DC, he was probably involved as a customer somehow.

YOu're going to find that when you awaken the giant and it realizes that continuity of government has created an intelligence coup-d'etat on 9/11 then there will be hell to pay for real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, as far as not doing anything....I thought they were braver than that.  These guys need to regrow a spine.  We know they are hoarding medical technology that will do just that, so, fekkin' use it already.

       The gov is good at keeping secrets (some are not good though like Hill, Huma, and others) so they will mitigate the fallout hardcore. Its the same shit as the UK elites the have their own crazy shit going on that would collapse the government as we know it.

       Wait a second.  Hillary is corrupt as shit but she's hardly stupid. She would have to have known that silent eyes and ears would be on everything she said and did. There's is no such thing as anyone sneaking around anywhere any more doing clandestine shit that someone else doesn't know about. OR am I missing something.

       I have not read your theory; however, I will say this (based on the title):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The NSA pipes all data to Israel.  (We know this from Snowden.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hillary Clinton is a zionist puppet:
         <a href="http://forward.com/opinion/national/324013/how-i-would-rebuild-ties-to-israel-and-benjamin-neta/">
          by HILLARY CLINTON:
          <strong>
           "How I Would Reaffirm Unbreakable Bond With Israel — and Benjamin Netanyahu"
          </strong>
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       CONCLUSION:  Unless there are conflicting allegiances (and/or traitors to Israel) within the NSA (which is certainly possible), I don't see why the NSA (clearly supportive of Israel as a fundamental operation) would work to bring-down Hillary Clinton (the most pro-Israel candidate, since LBJ).

Ok, so there are 4 field FBI investigations into CF and HRC
FBI demanded Weiner turn over his computer. His lawyer said lets make a deal. He is facing 25 years. Wiener said he had 11,239 emails from Huma, who used her Yahoo acct. Weiner showed agents 10 of those emails and I hear a deal is now in the works for Wiener to get 15 years as long as he testifies..Pay to play proof against HRC for many nations, including Israel !

       Im still worried
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       the NSA doesnt want Clinton. The NSA is another one of those three letter agencies that will do evil to get what they want. They already spy on all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is: whats their endgame? Surely hating Clinton isnt the full story. What do they gain from this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep on the lookout. Maybe they're actually doing their job, know this election is a coup detat, and are actually trying to stop it. Maybe they have ulterior, more evil, motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess time will tell. 2016 has pretty much proven the average person, whether they be in the US or South Korea, has zero control over their current government.

       This reads a lot like Jonathan Hickman's
       <em>
        Manhattan Projects
       </em>
       . Government Scientists develop ungodly powerful weaponry and use it to get rid of the current leadership, with its Illuminati and old money ties, so that they can be in charge.

       Welcome to the "Surveillance State" where nobody's privacy is safe, including those who thought that setting it up or running it would give them even greater power and control over absolutely everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's obviously a power struggle of some kind going on between the NSA and the State Dept. that doesn't bode well for Americans nor the rest of the world that's also being constantly spied upon regardless of which one of them wins it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lest we forget, just last August the NSA itself got hacked with  some of it's own custom hacking tools getting copied and turning up for sale on the Dark Web by a mysterious group that called themselves the "Shadow Brokers".

       This article suggests HRC was given legal access to SAPs, and that the content is probably related to space warfare, satellite surveillance and possibly UFO stuff:

       I would note, that as a sidebar to all this, a Canadian Politician, Jim Prentice, died in a plane crash recently. He is famous for blocking the sale of Canadian Radarsat-2 space surveillance capabilities to the USA. I suspect Prentice's death may be collateral damage.

       Guys, I honestly think the NSA is on our side. Almost free of tribal members and their influence, most are Christians and appear to care more about the well being of the country rather than a few asshole elites.

       I may be wrong and one day proved so, but until then this is where I'm currently leaning.
