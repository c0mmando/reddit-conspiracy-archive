<p>It isn&#39;t. It isn&#39;t honest to pretend trump is a brain damaged moron, nor is it honest to point it out as if the emperor had no clothing. You can look back at any of our presidents within the modern era, going back all the way to JFK, and you will find a very interesting trend: they all intentionally assume a persona. They act out a role in order to make themselves seem more down to earth, more dumber than they appear. Compare speeches and interviews made by George Bush Jr before and after he took office. It&#39;s a fucking act and dipshits like you fall for it every time. Whether you are for trump or against him, if you believe trump says stupid shit because he&#39;s a moron, then the joke is on you.</p>

<p>Well first of all you&#39;re twisting my words and second of all, you agree with me in your next two sentences, you merely claim it&#39;s an act. Plus, your tirade is undone by my second paragraph in my previous comment. I realise that candidates behave differently during their campaign, but most do it for their own benefit, not to their own detriment.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just be honest here and admit that you don&#39;t find what he says dumb or idiotic, you&#39;ve already tried to rewrite it as &quot;politically incorrect&quot;, which suggests that you see everything he says as &quot;sticking it to the man&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the onset, I think power was/is keenly well aware of how thoroughly disliked Clinton is as a candidate.   Although power can enthrone whomever they wish, it seems monumentally important to them that the enthronement be plausible/believable to the masses.  Majority belief that the outcome was organic - not manufactured - wins day 2 compliance from the population.</p>

<p>In this light, it would appear that a boorish, vulgar, race-baiting Trump is/has been a foil against which the apparent cheating mendacity and brazen criminality of HRC can seem comparitively less severe. </p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s not intended to be this way, but it sure as shit functions this way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is that Trump is a cabal endorsed went rogue.</p>

<p>Like, he started his campaign as a slave to the system and lately said fuck it, i&#39;m going to be president whether you like or not.</p>

<p>Sources: none, just vibes. It may be as south park portray it, only with a little smell of conspiracy.</p>

<p>He may be there to gauge the right wing appeal after all this fuckery, too.</p>

<p>I think this election is a very big test of where the mass consciousness is at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m sure Trump was the ideal candidate to run against in the minds of the Democratic leadership it seems to me that Trump was allowed the nomination by the Republicans because he mobilizes the idiot yahoo vote better than anyone, and let&#39;s face it; the right-wing in America is composed of two factions, the wealthy-corporate-war mongers(and their stooges) and idiot yahoos, you can guess which faction has all of the people and which one all of the power...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub really overestimates what a trump plant would do. If he&#39;s a plant why would they make it obvious? They wouldn&#39;t. Of course he&#39;s gonna call her out on shit if he didn&#39;t it&#39;d be too obvious he&#39;s a plant. To me he could have absolutely destroyed her in both debates, and he did jab at her a little, but that&#39;s exactly why I think he&#39;s s fraud. He should have ended her campaign in that last debate.  He had every opportunity to really show how fuckin terrible she is but dropped the ball imo </p>

<p>guess what dipshit? Go back far enough and we all have common ancestors. Rich/powerful families aren&#39;t burdened by white guilt or believe in &#39;overpopulation&#39;. People get rich, they go out and fuck, they make tons of kids and then leave their wealth to those kids. Those kids get rich, they go out and fuck, and their rich, connected family spread out over time and surprise surprise, all the rich and powerful families are related to each other, as they have been for the past 2,000 years. </p>
