You should simply look at my post history and in particular certain posts that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bernie4Ever/gilded/">people really liked</a>. You would see that I am a Bernie supporter, hence my name. It is over any reasonable threshold of doubt that Clinton rigged the primaries, but could only act with the help of government entities/services/people. It&#39;s a massive conspiracy that endangers the idea of democracy itself. Hillary Clinton is a member from the ruling elites, (i.e. the Rulers) who are stealing this election. My goal is to contribute to show her wrongdoings and her concealment of truth by spreading articles on social media. So, it may seem strange for you, but in fact, it&#39;s that simple.<br/>
So please never say again some real dishonest things like me being CTR-linked or other bullshit like that. You can disagree with me but not lie about me. Thank you.</p>

<p>Wars are frequently used as a distraction if not for undisclosed goals. The military is used to play the patriotism card. If you protest the war and/or military you are protesting friends and family in the military and are unpatriotic.</p>

The problem with that is it spreads not only Islam but the Muslim gene.  One of the stated goals of Islam is to take over the world.  Mullahs have even bragged about how Islam will cover the globe without the need for much bloodshed, as Western policies assist them in this.  Why would this be appealing to the mostly European elites?  Has the Zionist narrative been wrong all along and Zionists are actually Muslim?  </p>

<p>Corporations do it with down sizing, streamlining, tech etc. They also have periods of layoffs then hire, not rehire off the street. That&#39;s not just about money many executives feel it necessary to start from scratch, not necessary but they want a redo of sorts.
