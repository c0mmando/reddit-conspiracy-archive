<p>A report says that Terry McAuliffe gave over half a million dollars in campaign cash and material support to the wife of an FBI official who was involved in the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s unsecured, homebrew email server from which she conducted all her business as Secretary of State — including the sharing of classified information.</p>
