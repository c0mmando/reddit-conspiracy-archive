        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As an estonian, I am used to being forcefed stuff about russians being the devil, however today is the day I felt a dystopia coming to life in my neighbourhood as well.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t usually watch the news for obvious reasons. However I am visiting my grandparents this week and they watch it all the time so I just happened to catch some as I was chatting with them. After all the talk about FOX News, NBC, CBS etc being brainwash centrals for americans all alike, I discovered how my own tiny little country is doing the same thing with same effects.</p>

<p>The headline of today&#39;s news were something along the lines of &quot;Russian aggression is a threat to our independence&quot;. Pretty basic headline for mainstream news on the western side despite not being news whatsoever. that was followed by talk of how Russia is using propaganda on its people as my grandparents went along with the story told on the news I stood there with my mouth open wondering if that&#39;s what&#39;s really happening right now. It seemed like a scene from &quot;1984&quot; 2 minutes of hate regime...I mean it was orwellian really. </p>

<p>After the self-contradicting story about Russian propaganda they showed us some random shit about people making a 100-meter pasta today...what in the fuck? It&#39;s like they want people to have two regimes- Know the enemy and autopilot not having any thoughts of their own.</p>

<p>After these reports on completely trivial worthless shit there was a poll on whether estonians believe a war between NATO and Russia is likely (Vote here and win 100 euros)...what a convenient way of getting feedback on how effective the brainwashing is, I thought. Relay that every 3-minutes between every worthless &quot;news-story&quot; and have a word of how Russia is a nuclear threat to all the western countries. </p>

<p>In all the 75-minute news program there was a single real piece of news including a fatal car crash in Tallinn and let&#39;s be real the only reason a real piece of news information got into the program was because it was convienent for them to report on something that people would be interested in and that had already happened.</p>

<p>Well, as you all should know by know, you can&#39;t just go full commando on brainwashed people telling them &quot;the truth&quot; or challenging them to think critically right away...so the news reports were accompanied just by my swift and fairly critical remarks, but in effect were worthless.</p>

<p>I mean they were in trance. The moment you escape the box and look outside, the truth looking back to you can be so taunting, you could climb right back in...I know I did the first time.</p>

<p>I think it is based on years of psychological torture.</p>

<p>Lie to them to make them angry. Then provide a target for the anger. Then inject something unrelated (The heart rate decreases, BP goes down, maybe some dopamine...) and allow the brain to work.</p>

<p>Then just mention the target of your propaganda, and suddenly heart rate increases, BP increases, and you are &quot;agitated.&quot; Now mix in other things that have no relation, but that you also &quot;hate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Russian diplomat seen shaking hands with Syrian terrorist, after hospital bombing.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s a good example. The US can actively do the bombing. The &quot;Syrian terrorist&quot; and the diplomat can be CIA assets, or non-existent people (How many people are going to go out and find the people reported? How deep will they dig?)</p>

<p>But the idea gets across.</p>

<p>In the midst of carnage, these two &quot;enemies&quot; have smiles on their faces. I better hate some more, like the screen tells me to.</p>

<p>It really is an Orwellian nightmare.</p>

That&#39;s all it ever was. America has definitely mastered the brainwashing. Everything looked so tantalizing until you take a step back and realize this shit is running your life. Fuck TV man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had the EXACT same feeling about Sweden, just now.</p>

<p>I even wrote a post about it on my wall on FB, but nobody is commenting or liking it :(</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTSJ4MGanng">video</a> hits so close to home in Sweden.</p>

<ul>
<li>People are quitting the police force like the plague. The police no longer have any power. </li>
<li>Our army is dead. A report claims that by 2019, our army wouldn&#39;t even be able to withstand a minor attack for more than one week.</li>
<li>We have been a Christian nation for a long time, but now all our old traditions and things are being cancelled because it&#39;s unfair to our new countrymen (immigrants).</li>
<li>People who disagree with the current government and their pro-immigration policies are labeled racists, and some have even lost their jobs just because they vote for a specific party. This is getting more and more common.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can&#39;t speak of the &quot;small company&quot; aspect, but I know my father has said in the recent years that people don&#39;t want to set up new companies anymore. I don&#39;t know why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is news? It&#39;s advertisement driven messaging. Politicians use this medium to spread their lies, bending the truth about events or claims.</p>

<p>News reporting on deaths should not be considered news. Thousands of people die everyday in poor countries but that is not reported on because those people are too far away (edit: for us) to feel anxious and fear. So &quot;news&quot; outlets will disguise these types of (if it bleeds it leads) events as news. Most have been conditioned to think these events are news, but most non-independent agencies are simply fear broadcast systems.</p>
