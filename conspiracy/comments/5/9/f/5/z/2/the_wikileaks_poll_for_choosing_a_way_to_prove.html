       I left this option aside on purpose just to highlight how stupid it was to not put a PGP signed text or video in the poll... (or maybe it was intentional

       I believe it is option 5. In order to stay in the embassy Assange had to stop any public statement until the election. I also believe that the State Department pushed for that and now CTR people are demanding that he makes a public statement.

       One point to consider is that if Assange has been extraordinarily rendered to a secret US gulag, that's not something the Clinton campaign would want made public before the election. Because it lays bare a culture of lawlessness by US officials. And since Wikileaks targeted the Clinton campaign with its leaks, she would be tainted by that sense of overt lawlessness by his illegal detention (or extrajudicial execution).
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, for her to viably win the election, Clinton needs to present an appearance of lawful propriety. The Wikileaks leaks damaged that sense of legitimacy. For the US government to then kidnap and detain Assange without due process would, by extension, paint her as partially responsible and destroy any sense of plausible respectability. She'd just be another thug, like everyone else involved in the rendition and torture program.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if Assange is rendered, don't expect that truth made public until at least after the election. And perhaps it may never be officially commented on at all. He might just 'disappear'. Like one of Pinochet's political opponents, tossed off the side of a helicopter into the open ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bye bye. Next!

       And since Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib, that's what the United States has become.

       Hello Clinton operative! Welcome to this sub. I love your newly created account with karma of... 1. It is funny to see how you are trying to give some type of reasonable explanation
       <em>
        to gain some time
       </em>
       such that your accomplices don't have to act in any way that would certainly expose them and alert people even more that something very sinister has already taken place.

       Oh please... My account exists since months (edit:more than a year). I just read more than I actually post and am def. not a Clinton operative... How could I gain some time for other people by posting on reddit?!
It's stupid to judge someone because of reddit karma, sorry :D

       There's always a first time. Atm, I am only here because of WL, I just don't care about other reddits here, so sorry that I am not interested in other reddit bullshit!
You didn't you start with hundreds of posts here either, did you? 
Do you really wanna discredit everyone who didn't post much until now? Come on...

       But okay, you MUST be right. He's incapacitated, restrained,  captured or dead. There's no other possibility, absolutely impossible. Congrats you're the man!

       Even if you are a Clinton supporter or operative, I will tell you the meaning of this poll: it was to show how weird it was for Wikileaks to set up a poll on Twitter with the 4 options they proposed us to choose from. None of them can really answer the question if Julian is alive and safe. So I set up this little poll also with 4 options only to lure people like you.

       First post doesn't mean that my account was also created 8 days ago. As I said, it is older than a year and I usually read things instead of commenting on everything (like you seem to do). Usually. What do you want from me, he?

       Yes. Because people like Bernie4Ever are totally freaking out and that won't help.
For example here:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/58pu68/when_the_fuck_does_wikileaks_refer_to_julian_as/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/58pu68/when_the_fuck_does_wikileaks_refer_to_julian_as/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       People wrote that WL neeeever tweeted "MR. Assange" and this is just WRONG and paranoid. Why not correct things that?! Because people might call me a clinton troll because I just read some older tweets to verify whether their concerns are based on facts or not?
