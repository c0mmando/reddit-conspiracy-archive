<p>At every turn, anyone who brings this point up gets accused of being a CTR shill. Yes, we all know they hijacked r/Politics, but that doesn&#39;t give you the right to hijack our sub. </p>

<p>Accusing anyone who disagrees with your narrow opinion of being a shill does nothing but stifle meaningful conversation. I know all the top comments on this thread are going to be doing the same thing, so go ahead and do it, downvote it...you&#39;re doing nothing but proving my point further.</p>

<p>There may be a few shills, but being constantly accused of being one myself leads me to believe that most of these accusations are false.</p>

<p>If you agree with me, I suggest we move to r/conspiracies. It already has some decent content and a user base, so we won&#39;t be starting from scratch.</p>

<p>Thanks guys, stay strong, the election is almost over, and then after all this shit dies down, we can return.</p>

<p>Browse new, vote accordingly, and submit content you wish to see.. I&#39;m sick of these concerned posts. The majority here don&#39;t give one fuck, because we know the election is rigged and has always been. That being said, there are plenty of conspiracies and corruption being dropped right now. And Trump is blowing the fuckin&#39; lid off. Stop being ignorant, and use your own discretion. </p>

<p>This is not a safe space college free speech zone, like the rest of the hug space reddit has become. We are all adults here.

<p>That&#39;s the problem. He&#39;s not. Assange is, and Trump is using it to his advantage. No matter who was running against clinton, they would be using the same material.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my entire point. People are trying to make it one, where only one viewpoint is perpetuated, and peddling the idea that no one could possibly differ from that without being a paid shill. r/The_Donald is already a safe space for them, why do they need another one?</p>

He may not be the brightest or have the best policies, but he is doing something nobody has ever had the balls to do in any presidential race and that&#39;s call out the system and the media bias. Of course Donald is less then ideal but what he&#39;s doing is the biggest step for the cause in modern history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to make this a safe space, I&#39;m trying to go back to open discussion. You understand how the upvote/downvote system works right? On r/Libertarian we have a rule that you don&#39;t downvote things just because you disagree with it. It works great. There are all different viewpoints represented and being discussed/debated respectfully. When anyone talking shit about Trump gets downvoted to oblivion, those posts get sent to the bottom of the page, and any casual reader isn&#39;t going to see it. Furthermore, trying to discredit people by accusing them of being shills instantly makes people doubt what they are saying, and creates an echo chamber.

I understand that there are many posts to be made about HRC and wikileaks, but it&#39;s hard to see much difference between this sub and The_Donald sometimes. This sub used to be a great place for discussion with many topics, you could disagree with someone and have a great discussion with them without being called a shill or other bullshit. I liked this sub for that open ended discussion, but it&#39;s becoming more and more of an echo chamber. </p>

<p>“I don’t comprehend the conspiracy” ≠ there is no conspiracy. Sorry.</p>
