       I follow all of the liberal news just to keep a pulse on their current narrative, CNN, MSNBC, NYT, huffpo, it's usually a 24/7 trump bashing session. They also bury any Wikileaks or negative developments on Hillary. But today is like Bazaaro World.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of a sudden they are actually covering trump. Out of no where. Actually reporting on obamacare price increases. Actually reporting on Wikileaks. To me, it really feels like the MSM knows something and they are distancing themselves from the Hillary campaign. It has been all fair trump coverage on CNN today, that is unheard of. Has anyone else noticed the flip today?

       Robbie mook was on Chris wallaces show and you should have seen him try and dance off stage when he got asked that question.  Whenever someone is smiling as they blatantly lie is so unnerving.  It's like show your fangs if your gonna do it.  Own it if you are going to be like that.  I'd love to just beat the shit out of that guy.  I'm 5'6" 135 and I know I'd just dump him.  Fucking prick.

       They are all so accustomed to lying all the time, about everything, they have no clue how transparent they are. I think they tell the lies to themselves so convincingly they have actually forgotten they are liars!

       Yeah dude.  Fucking Chris Wallace is a bitch too.  I don't want to fight him, but if I could travel back thirty years I'd tell him he'd turn out to be a real loser, then kick him right in the nuts.

       Perhaps they think the damage has been done and it's time to appear neutral in order to do damage control so that they still have viewership once the election is over, otherwise they won't be able to charge anything to advertise on their network, thus losing money and we know everyone likes money a lot. Also I agree with the notion that a landslide victory for Hilary will not increase viewership leading up to election day, which is essentially the "Super Bowl" for News providers; so yes, it needs to appear close going into the final stretch. People have very short memories these days and if the MSM seems fair for two weeks, it will have always been fair in the minds of the sheeple. I doubt they'd actually turn on her personally, but they will want to seem neutral at some point to maintain any legitimacy in the public eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       The least likely scenario in my opinion, but still possible, (considering that nearly anything is possible, most possibilities are simply terribly unlikely) would be that Trump finally decided to kowtow to the establishment/globalist agenda/"Shadow Government" behind closed doors, in order to be granted the presidency. He may have finally realized that the election would be "rigged" against him if he didn't agree to certain terms and it would be far too embarrassing for him to lose; so he would become the next puppet. Hilary for many reasons would probably make a much shittier puppet, considering the degree of idiocy she has shown between all he crimes and scandals. Also I think much faith would be restored in the election process if Trump won, therefore people might feel as though they weren't constantly getting fucked over by the government and people would stop asking so many dangerous questions regarding whether or not we are really free and is society rigged.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find the idea that Donald Trump has finally given in do to the embarrassment of losing to the most pathetic candidate in US history to be terribly unlikely, but it is possible and would be beneficial to those who run the country from behind the scenes as Hilary will make a terrible puppet that many will struggle to believe was elected legitimately.

       Yes.  Walked in on my parents ... watching TV and some major liberal leaning news network was going on about Obamacare price increases of X% (20?) in 2017.

       What. The price hikes are coming from the private industry. These corporations are to blame for prices going up. They raised the prices because the new regulations are cutting into their profits. They 100% ABSOLUTELY do not want single-payer. They didn't hike their prices so that they'd be put out of business.

       The MSM needs a horse race. Once it begins to look like one candidate is ahead they'll prop up the other.  On election eve they need something like 50/50.

       Think of it like an umpire/referee that is on the "take" and penalised one team out of the game and done everything in their power to rig the result and then in the final couple of minutes when the result is now clear, they give a couple of penalties/decisions the other way to give the appearance of being fair. I have noticed a couple of pro-trump stories in the last 24hrs from news outlets in Australia that have been pro-HRC all year. The bizarre thing is that it coincides with what you are seeing in the US.

       Tipping point. I've been saying for a while that eventually they'll all turn on Hillary to
       <del>
        get in the good graces of people
       </del>
       get more click-profit. After all, their masters are advertisers and of course the shadow government. The latter of which might be writing off Hillary as the next president as I type.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many publicized charges against her that it will be very difficult for Hillary to dig her way out, no matter how many favours other corrupt politicians owe her.

       Anything is possible. But we've seen CNN bury or spin ALL the Wikileaks stuff for months, why are they giving coverage on project veritas 2 weeks before election? Just my opinion but it seems as if someone pulled the plug. It's come out that trump funded project veritas. I'm speculating that he may have just slow played the entire country and will drop the bombshell in a few days. If he had a racist video of Hillary like o'keefe claims he has, he knew he just had to secure the nomination and then play his "trump" card a week before Election Day.

       Follow the money. If Trump is looking like an actual viable candidate, then Hillary can get more $ from her donors for a "last minute push" in the polls to secure her victory. The only thing she ever does is raise money.
