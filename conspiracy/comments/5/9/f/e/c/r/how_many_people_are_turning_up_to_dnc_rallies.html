       From the website Heavy.com ... I won't even do them the justice of a link, because I'm tired of being fed stories that reek of poor journalism...
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what they say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Hillary Clinton led a rally today in Coconut Creek, Florida at Broward College. The rally started at 2:15 p.m. at the OMNI Auditorium and was geared toward encouraging early voting.
        <strong>
         So many people showed up that extra seats were brought into the auditorium, which seats 2,000 people
        </strong>
        . At least 1,000 people had been lined up for the rally since 6 a.m., according to CBS12. Click through the gallery to see more photos from the rally and learn more about what happened. (Getty)"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And that's cool, good on her for getting such a good crowd ... until you go looking for the pictures of said "crowd"...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-617977026.jpg">
        Here's a cool entry picture, nice angle, lots of the public here
       </a>
       <br/>
       <a href="http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ba02343b7b2c4ff938d63706bc5d09f82b4407aa/r=880/http/videos.gannett-cdn.com/treasurecoast/images/5049773643001/201610/3142/5049773643001_5185002501001_5184964278001-vs.jpg">
        During the rally, I see approx 80 faces behind her, so
        <strong>
         I'll guess 120 people in total
        </strong>
        , allowing for people on the floor
       </a>
       <br/>
       <a href="https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-617977074.jpg">
        I count 70 heads here, so to be fair, I'm going to double it and
        <strong>
         say 140 member of the public in front
        </strong>
        of Hillary
       </a>
       <br/>
       And in the video I saw a side box as she entered with people in it (can't find a pic, sorry) so
       <strong>
        say another 40 people
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       My math (generously) says there were
       <strong>
        maybe 300 people from the public at this rally
       </strong>
       .
       <br/>
       Including staff, media and security, maybe the attendance was possibly 600, I DO NOT see anything close to the 1000 people who were lined up, let alone the 2000 they had mentioned!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else want to look? I used yahoo image search, because google doesn't like ... well, try it and you find out!
       <br/>
       I'm open to being proved wrong - please feel free to do so.

       Good catch, I didn't see that at first! That's really telling how desperate they are to edit footage of her rallies to obscure the entire empty half plus portion of her rallies lol. I don't want to sound harsh but it looks like she hired black actors to hold their hands up in adoration in the very front row, with more in the back holding up signs jubilantly. Is this amount of people either recording on their phones or holding a sign at an event normal, it looks like literally everyone in the crowd has their hand full with a prop? She looks a lot like kim jong-un but with a pee pee bag.

       Before I read your analysis, just based on looking at the pics I thought there were at most 300 as well. So I think we're def seeing the same thing here. This doesn't look right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, if they really had to squeeze people in, they would show it. It was an old Nixon trick to pick a room that was too small in order for the optics of the event to display a seemingly enthusiastic and well attended rally.

       I see claims of a green screen from a Florida speech today. Don't know if they were the same speech, but "enthusiasm gap" is strong with that one. EDITL here is Broward County rally

       Yeah, the #1 photo I posted pretty much blows away the green screen myth. Pictures are consistent with the video, but there was something weird with people raising the red/white/blue things just behind and below Hillary in the video ... WTF?
       <br/>
       The Image was distorted, IMO, because they used a CHEAP camera, which results in a shallow depth of focus, so the crowd looked

       I'm so sick of hearing the MSM talk about "The Clinton Ground Game" as one of their big strengths; Kaine shows up to a rally in FL and gets 30 people; Trump does the same and gets 30,000.  Hillary has essentially been a no-show on the campaign trail for this entire election.  She disappears for weeks at a  time.  Her events are poorly attended, tightly controlled, and video manipulated.  Debate questions and talking points are fed to her in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Clinton Ground Game" is the biggest fucking illusion no-one's ever seen.

       I found an extra picture of the crowd at the OMNI and a picture of the auditorium OMNI to see how 2000 people can be fit in there.

      <p>
       TLDR: That OMNI auditorium is almost empty.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I can conclude is:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Hilary is on the stage WITH part of the crowd, and only a few rows have people.
       </strong>
       Maybe the rest of the crowd is actually between the stage and the first row.
      </p>
      <p>
       I checked the video on youtube of that rally and didn't see any shot of the entire crowd... supposing there is anyone sitting behind the photographer who took those 2 pictures at the OMNI rally!
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt it's true they filled that auditorium to the point of requiring chairs but seeing how the auditorium looks like and where they placed the crowd, it might give you an idea of the number. I'm not even sure we see 100 people on that picture on my url and it shows even more people than on yours.

       There is a lot of "noise" from the media about it, but I can't find anything that clearly says he is AGAINST LGBT, which suggests to me he is likely FOR it ... it's a complicated issue though, pushing all these changes through each state.

       The politico article simply says he'll be good for LGBT people because he will stop reactionary right winger's from denying that the attack in Orlando was motivated by hatred of LGBT people, in addition to anti-American sentiment. Whoop-de-do. He's going to do that while taking away all this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A Trump/Pence White House would rescind the Obama administration’s guidance protecting transgender students from discrimination.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mike Pence confirmed the ticket’s position in an interview with Dr. James Dobson that will air next Wednesday. The Christian Post, an anti-LGBT publication, reported on the interview after obtaining an audio file in advance.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to CP, Pence explains that both he and Donald Trump believe that concerns about which bathrooms transgender students should use can be “resolved” at the local level. He added that children’s “safety” and “privacy” should be priorities in these decisions — dogwhistle terms referring to the myth that trans students are somehow a threat to other students and should be kept out of restrooms that match their gender identity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and further down:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He has promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality, he’s backslid on protecting trans people from discrimination, and he has also said he would sign the First Amendment Defense Act, a federal bill that would legalize various forms of anti-LGBT discrimination.
       </p>

       This bathroom bullshit has personally made me feel unsafe in public, put trans kids at risk for bullying, and notably increased suicidality in the trans community in North Carolina. Taking away federal protections for marriage equality and putting us at the mercy of state legislatures for protections on housing, work-place discrimination,
       <strong>
        while making it lawful to discriminate against us
       </strong>
       because of one's religious beliefs....this is the LGBT equivalent of "separate but equal." We'll be back in the gay ghettos, and forced to leave our homes for liberal states just so we don't have to worry about losing our jobs and getting evicted. It's like walking the clock back fifteen years.

       I have issues with reading stories from ThinkProgress site, IMO they seem a little slanted.
       <br/>
       I do think any move to "roll back" marriage equality would be a huge step backwards - but they are raising so many issues at once here it's hard to follow the "he-said/she-said" of it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why this site is: reporting Christian publication, who have an advance audio file, of an interview "next Wednesday" ... then resorting to using "dogwhistle" terminology? This results in a messy article.

       Thank you for posting this.  I have been wondering the same thing.  I heard that Trump is pulling in thousands to his rallies.  Any truth to this?  I am looking to make a comparison because I think the polls are bullshit.

       In the interest of full disclosure (also on the campaign trail) ... Chelsea, Bill and Joe Biden all combined to pull a crowd of 1000 or 1500 to be generous ... between all 3 of them!
