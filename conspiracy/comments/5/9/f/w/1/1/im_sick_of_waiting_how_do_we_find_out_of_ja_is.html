       I'm not someone with any special know-how, but there has to be a way for the Reddit hive-mind to figure out if he's alive. Let's get some ideas going, people. Even bad ones. How do we learn, for sure, the status of JA?

If trumps pops first, hes compromised.

       Someone buy the man a 3g router and throw it through the balcony window if need be, seems odd to me that they can shut down his internet yet he can still be in contact with Wikileaks team, any and every phone has internet now, unless they contact Home through the embassy land line he must have a phone

       No. Astral projection is when your astral body goes out of normal body and you can imagine some place and be there in moment. And you can see whats hapenning there. Btw its not easy to learn astral projection, it may take few weeks. Remoote viewing eaven is harder to perform. Check out r/astralprojection and chexk out wikihow article about astralprojection.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is one problem. If you see assange at astral projection, you cant prove what you saw to anybody else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know few people who can perform astral projection. Its not fake thing. Personally I have never had ap, its not easy.

       I'm concerned for JAs well-being as well :/
I don't mean to hijack the thread but I'm trying to save our country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please READ &amp; SHARE WITH EVERYONE. We need to make this information known and take back our country before it gets completely taken from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly believe that this might happen.
It would be the last step in this government corporation takeover.
They're going to take guns and everything &amp; we have no rights whatsoever AND WE ARE LOCKED UP.
      </p>
      <p>
       If martial law is declared and they come for us IF we can we need  to explain this to law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       ✳✳✴✳✳✳✳
What is going on is illegal. The citizens our government and our country are being overtaken by an imposter government. We are being had &amp; lied to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in 1871 the Constitution was changed, in legalese the wording matters &amp; it gave foreign agents the same ones that we beat in the revolution a foothold in this country and way to infiltrate our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless they have no jurisdiction outside of 68 miles of Washington DC which gives any law enforcement the same Authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...No Authority or jurisdiction outside of 68 miles of Washington DC .
      </p>
      <p>
       Each state is a business &amp; they have turned our country &amp; into a business The United States of America Incorporated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since businesses can only do business with other businesses they have turned us into corporations to be able to do business with us. We are not corporations no matter what they say ....We are people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This country is about to be taken over by an imposter foreign business..
Its a fake government of "businessmen" by corporations for corporations In this United States of America corporation ...
Posing as a real government consisting of "Citizens" who are for the citizens by citizens in these continental United states
      </p>
      <p>
       They are committing fraud in other crimes, taking money from the American people in the guise of being our employees and governing the people in our best interest but only working for its own &amp; other Corporations best interest.
Mission accomplished they have grown their businesses they don't need us anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to impeach the president and government ....no we don't, real or fake we can overthrow them they are an imposter government, foreign agents committing fraud against the Citizens of these continental united States to which they have no authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       THEREFORE 
As a representative of the citizens of these continental United States, We the citizens hereby take back control of our government and of our country .
We're are invoking our Declaration of Independence, under the Constitution, the Bill of Rights &amp; our unalienable rights by natural law. Only these &amp; common law are recognized. Common law, law of the land in civilian courts presided over by common law judges.
We are here by abolishing All Foreign agents, barristers and governments, military court under admiralty law presided over by foreign agents and members of the Barr within this government business known as United States of America Corporation, returning it from:
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States of America Incorporated. We the business by the business for the business.
      </p>
      <p>
       TO
      </p>
      <p>
       We the people by the people for the people
for these continental United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is important information. .  this is public notice for all law enforcement military whatsoever if we are confronted with martial law

       They are not going to tell you this on the "CORPORATE" Media news because 
OUR GOVT IS A 
"CORPORATION"  the United States Corporation in the business of businesses.

      <p>
       The Constitution
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare the words used in the Declaration of Independence and those words used in the Constitution...
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, the Declaration of Independence says: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness...
      </p>
      <p>
       The Constitution for the united states of America has the Bill of Rights...As a Natural man I have unalienable rights granted by God...Article 1 Sec. 10 says: No State shall make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts...
      </p>
      <p>
       Amendment VII of the Bill of Rights says: In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.
      </p>
      <p>
       The states are corporations and corporations can only contract with likewise corporations and not people because there can be no meeting of the minds and without meeting of the minds there can be no contract because there must be knowing consent and states are artificial persons...creatures of the mind only and artificial persons are foreclosed from creating parity with the tangible and the tangible are living creatures....
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Constitution is for artificial persons which is the Public and the Declaration of Independence is for the tangible or living souls...
      </p>
      <p>
       Mankind has Unalienable Rights meaning he is a Creature without restrictions and answers to Natural Law which come from God which is the Private Side..There is a big difference between Common Law granted by Government and what the government giveth it can also taketh away and Natural Law which comes from God are unalienable...UNA'LIENABLE, adjective Not alienable; that cannot be alienated; that may not be transferred; as unalienable rights.

       Again, not putting the man or his organization on a pedestal but they've done more to expose how lazy and complacent many Americans have become.

       I see the work they have done on a Global scale, to help so many worldwide! The world is now watching us to see what we do to repair our broken systems!

       It's critical, IMHO, that we try to stay positive, supportive and responsible for the awakening that Assange has risked his life to give to the World.
