    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve got it wrong.</p>

<p>When she and Bernie were going after the nomination, the wording on what the FBI was doing with her emails was being manipulated by MSM and Clinton. They referred to it not as an &quot;investigation&quot; but as a &quot;security inquiry&quot;. Dems were dumb enough to believe it or they were brain dead sheep standing with her. </p>

<p>After it was all but over the FBI decided it was time to call it an investigation. What followed was negative press for Hillary where Bernie supporters protested and called for her to step down before the DNC convention. The FBI later came out and cleared her.</p>

<p>This is the FBI flat out saying they found new evidence and have to reopen the investigation before people are set to vote. This is an &quot;investigation&quot; hanging over the head of a candidate. There&#39;s no clever wording or double speak going on. Flat out investigation.</p>

<p>Ironically, While making you also weren&#39;t a shill I saw your other post. Why would shifting magnetic poles cause earthquakes? I have attributed them to fracking. It would make more sense if the field oscillated after the shift instead of a dramatic realignment orthogonal to the current geometry. The big issue with this is also the devastation from interstellar radiation, more so than Earthquakes. </p>
