       You've got it wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       When she and Bernie were going after the nomination, the wording on what the FBI was doing with her emails was being manipulated by MSM and Clinton. They referred to it not as an "investigation" but as a "security inquiry". Dems were dumb enough to believe it or they were brain dead sheep standing with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       After it was all but over the FBI decided it was time to call it an investigation. What followed was negative press for Hillary where Bernie supporters protested and called for her to step down before the DNC convention. The FBI later came out and cleared her.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the FBI flat out saying they found new evidence and have to reopen the investigation before people are set to vote. This is an "investigation" hanging over the head of a candidate. There's no clever wording or double speak going on. Flat out investigation.

       Regain faith in what? The FBI? Republicans and Democrats are already split on their opinion of Comey. Democrats think they did a good job and Reublicans are unhappy and think they are compromised.

      <p>
       How would opening it up again and having them drawing the same conclusion that she did nothing wrong possibly salvage their reputation with Republicans?

       They already did this once... so I don't see what your point is. But this is their effort to prevent a revolt and maintain their power/any secrecy that still exists. With out a monumental change, it is going to be this same shit over and over again.

       to prove she is innocent, since the public doubts it, reopen investigation, find her innocent, then she can be president, they investigated twice right? found nothing? all is well. /s

       If you have never heard of the internet or watched anything other than MSNBC/CNN you don't think that. The propaganda is real, and at this point I would wager 75% of the population is completely bullshit right now, but MSM cuts it down to negligible figures. It is so bad, the US launched a cyber attack on itself.

       So do you feel she will be cleared before the election? If not then I don't understand why they would do this. This has to drastically reduce her chances of winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if she wins and they don't clear her yet? That could almost guarantee some sort of revolt. You think November 8th they'll clear her and say she is innocent the exact same day as the election?

       This attacks Trump's "the government is corrupt". They just need it to be close enough for electoral college to be in play.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government does not do anything in our interests. Stop clinging on to the fake ass bullshit hope that this will somehow fix itself. I, for one, do not want to deal with this shit again in 4-8 years.

       I don't get your statement "Don't fall for it" It's a wait and see deal. No one buys in to anything anymore given the climate of propaganda that is so pervasive in this election.

       Ironically, While making you also weren't a shill I saw your other post. Why would shifting magnetic poles cause earthquakes? I have attributed them to fracking. It would make more sense if the field oscillated after the shift instead of a dramatic realignment orthogonal to the current geometry. The big issue with this is also the devastation from interstellar radiation, more so than Earthquakes.

       I guess I'm happy you aren't fucked up enough to think on their level.

       First: the media/other citizens
      </p>
      <p>
       Second: Have you heard of a pardon? Could they leave it in limbo?
      </p>

       You have a lot of assumptions about how it
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       work. How have you
       <em>
        seen
       </em>
       how it does work? Yes. Now look for the corollaries.
