<p>Could this be Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe&#39;s ongoing FBI investigation for campaign violations?</p>

<p><strong>Just look at how incredibly suspicious this timeline is and how it ties into the Clinton Campaign...</strong></p>

<p>On March 2, 2015, the NY Times reports Clinton could have violated federal regulations by using a private email server, increasing the likelihood of an eventual FBI investigation... <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/hillary-clintons-use-of-private-email-at-state-department-raises-flags.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/hillary-clintons-use-of-private-email-at-state-department-raises-flags.html</a></p>

<p>...on March 4, 2015, there is a Congressional subpoena for all Benghazi related emails... <a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/09/06/oversight-committee-clinton-obstruction-n2214383">http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/09/06/oversight-committee-clinton-obstruction-n2214383</a></p>

<p>...Virginia Gov. McAuliffe, Clinton&#39;s 2008 campaign chair, admits having a meeting with Jill McCabe, someone with no previous political experience or influence, on March 7, 2015, to &quot;urge her to run&quot;... <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3867176/Clinton-ultra-loyalist-gave-500-000-campaign-wife-FBI-deputy-director-oversaw-probe-Hillary-s-emails.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3867176/Clinton-ultra-loyalist-gave-500-000-campaign-wife-FBI-deputy-director-oversaw-probe-Hillary-s-emails.html</a></p>

<p>...on June 26, 2015, Hillary headlined a fundraising event for McAuliffe&#39;s PAC and the Democratic Party of Virginia... <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3876506/Hillary-Clinton-headlined-fundraiser-campaign-group-gave-500-000-wife-FBI-boss-investigated-emails-s-closely-linked-bid-power.html#ixzz4OIXM76xL">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3876506/Hillary-Clinton-headlined-fundraiser-campaign-group-gave-500-000-wife-FBI-boss-investigated-emails-s-closely-linked-bid-power.html#ixzz4OIXM76xL</a></p>

<p>...by the end of July, McCabe&#39;s husband Andrew McCabe is promoted to the #3 FBI position, associate deputy director... <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-announces-executive-appointments-1">https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-announces-executive-appointments-1</a></p>

<p>...only weeks later, on August 11, 2015, FBI takes custody of Clinton&#39;s server and thumb drives, which begins the FBI investigation process... <a href="https://sharylattkisson.com/hillary-clintons-email-the-definitive-timeline/">https://sharylattkisson.com/hillary-clintons-email-the-definitive-timeline/</a></p>

<p>...Over the next three months, donations totaling nearly $700,000 by McAuliffe&#39;s PAC and the Virginia Democratic party to the campaign of Jill McCabe... <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-ally-funneled-money-to-wife-of-fbi-agent-who-oversaw-emails/article/2605371">http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-ally-funneled-money-to-wife-of-fbi-agent-who-oversaw-emails/article/2605371</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you may be right in thinking this obvious panic move by the FBI may NOT actually be related to the Weiner case - they&#39;ve had the guys&#39; phone for months, after all. </p>

<p>Your alternative McCauliffe explanation may the correct one, but there are other possibilities - the 33k emails for instance? </p>

<p>However, the timing of all this makes me think that it actually relates to WikiLeaks, and in particular to Assange&#39;s unexplained disappearance off the radar. The US authorities may be trying to prevent, or mitigate against, a release of game-changing information, which may be coming down the pipeline imminently (due to the non/activation of a dead man&#39;s switch). </p>

<p>Conversely, it is also possible that Assange is alive, and is negotiating (his freedom in exchange for redacting material) with the US, and one of the conditions is that Hillary Clinton has to be properly investigated/impeached. The US establishment, which has supported Clinton to the hilt hitherto, may have to throw her under the bus in order to protect &quot;the greater good&quot;. </p>
