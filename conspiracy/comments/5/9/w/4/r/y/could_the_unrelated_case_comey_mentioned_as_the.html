       I think you may be right in thinking this obvious panic move by the FBI may NOT actually be related to the Weiner case - they've had the guys' phone for months, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your alternative McCauliffe explanation may the correct one, but there are other possibilities - the 33k emails for instance?
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the timing of all this makes me think that it actually relates to WikiLeaks, and in particular to Assange's unexplained disappearance off the radar. The US authorities may be trying to prevent, or mitigate against, a release of game-changing information, which may be coming down the pipeline imminently (due to the non/activation of a dead man's switch).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, it is also possible that Assange is alive, and is negotiating (his freedom in exchange for redacting material) with the US, and one of the conditions is that Hillary Clinton has to be properly investigated/impeached. The US establishment, which has supported Clinton to the hilt hitherto, may have to throw her under the bus in order to protect "the greater good".
