       You say they wouldn't kill Trump. But they may have already tried 3 times at least. There was that guy that rushed an grabbed his leg. That might have just been a warning/threat though. There was that "supporter" caught with a gun trying to enter one of the rallies he did. And there was a guy with a gun caught trespassing at Trump Tower who was "dead" on records, and his gun had no serial number. And there was the young kid who tried to grab an officers gun. That guy actually is getting charged I believe.

       I'm not a Trump supporter but looking at the way the elite on both sides of the aisle hate Trump, for a while now, I've been saying he's a JFK/Nixon-candidate. Maybe he gets in. But they don't let him stay.

       Using a nuke is insanity. The only way that level of false flag attack would come from the inside is if the military/industrial complex has decided it needs something horrific enough to fully shut down democracy. We're not there. (I hope!) Plus, isn't it fairly easy to trace the origin of a radioactive isotope? I'm sure they'd use some from Russia or "the Iranian nuclear program."

       There were some micro nukes used in the last couple of years (Syria? Ukraine airport? The videos are on youtube).  There is still the theory that the China explosions were also mini nukes.

       Russian for sure. The fuel used in reactors comes from old soviet warheads that we purchase under the Megatons to Megawatts program. So we've got plenty of weapons grade Russian pop juice kicking around.

       What you are saying is not true.  There is no uniform voice over how to identify yourselves, and that's part of the problem.  I have talked to a room of transpeople and yes calling them 'transpeople' is ok.  They had no problem with the word transgendered, or at least not to my face.  Maybe they went onto their insular transwebsites and complained about me like they did when I asked a simple question in a trans sub 3 yrs ago and was merciliously attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the thing is if you don't have a uniform way of talking about the subject, you will choose any perceived mistake (in which case, ANY thing I say) as a reason to attack people, like you have done.
      </p>
      <p>
       This continues and it feels like you're stomping on my free speech, while it turns out I'm someone who actually does support you and your cause, if you can let me just speak and not be offended by everything I say, simply because i'm not trans...
      </p>

       I said nothing about the term "transpeople"  but since you brought it up, you might want to know it's sort of like writing gaypeople or shortpeople or methodistpeople. No one really does that. When writing, the best thing to do is write
       <strong>
        trans people.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's peculiar that you should complain about a minority having websites they use to social network. Why does that upset you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would guess they didn't say anything about your use of transgender
       <strong>
        ed
       </strong>
       because they were saving their energy for more important things. Pick your battles. You know? If you are sincere and well-meaning potential ally, that's not something you would call someone out on in public. If you had continued to work with this group, someone would probably have clued you in while you two are in private.
       <strong>
        Transgendered is universally frowned upon.
       </strong>
       Now you don't have to go on about 'inconsistencies' the next time someone tells you that's not right. There are actually style guides for reporters and websites for allies that are quite up to date on the acceptable terminology and how to use the correct words. But I doubt you'll check that out because you sound like you don't give two shits about how to be respectful to transgender people. Please prove me wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you care enough to get involved but not enough to learn how to use the proper, respectful language, maybe you should dedicate your energies to something easier. I wasn't offended, just mildly irked. However, someone else could be hurt by lazy terminology, if it implied the wrong thing. I really feel like this whole conversation is too reminiscent of that time I explained to Grandma why people don't say Negro anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, we don't have a cause; we're not a political interest group. We're just people trying to get society out of the way, so we can live with dignity. Most of us aren't even activists.

       I'm just surprised there haven't been more Trump tapes. They've gotta have more material of him saying questionable, immoral, or stupid things. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a false flag terror attack, but they definitely have more Trump stuff if they wanna try to distract from Clinton's criminality. But maybe I just hope that's the direction they go with. Maybe they were unable to get anyone else to betray his trust by exposing him like he was in that "grab them by the pussies" video? Bleh.

       There's a lot of it, especially in the Stern tapes. No one cares, it's like Clinton's pay-for-play stuff. People know about it, but have decided to foolishly choose one side or the other and to hell with any evidence showing their guy or gal is bad news.

       out of 22 of the people involved were confidential informants. Fifteen!! One of the reasons they were acquitted because when the government agents outnumber those on trial, how do you prove who did what? Who does the jury trust?

       I think the Clinton investigation IS the distraction. The WikiLeaks keep getting worse, and all the FBI is saying is they're going to take another look at it. What they already had was enough to indict and probably convict in the first place. If they didn't do it then, they probably aren't going to do it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, they sure can get a lot of flame wars going and keep people NOT talking about WikiLeaks, audio of Clinton talking about rigging election in Palestine, Clinton foundation quid pro quo, all the payments and "gifts" to "Bill" Clinton, etc until they come out a day or two before the election and say "ok we looked some more, definitely nothing to see here folks."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we shouldn't talk so much about this renewed investigation and just keep talking about the other things until the FBI does or doesn't do something. There's no reason at this point to think they will handle it any differently than they did so far.

       You say they wouldn't kill Trump. But they may have already tried 3 times at least. There was that guy that rushed an grabbed his leg. That might have just been a warning/threat though. There was that "supporter" caught with a gun trying to enter one of the rallies he did. And there was a guy with a gun caught trespassing at Trump Tower who was "dead" on records, and his gun had no serial number. And there was the young kid who tried to grab an officers gun. That guy actually is getting charged I believe.
