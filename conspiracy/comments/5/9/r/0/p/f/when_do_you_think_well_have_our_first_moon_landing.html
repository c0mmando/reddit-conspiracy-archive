<p>The moon landings was just not possible. And that becomes very apparent when you look into the evidence.</p>

<p>But what is interesting is that NASA/CIA so actively and desperately tries to keep the lid on this lie. That is the reason you always see flat earth, no gravity, Secret Space Program stuff come up each and every time the Moon Hoax is discussed. They want you to look into that crap and dismiss it together with the Moon Landing Hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah well the Greek had it pinned that earth is round and if you&#39;ve been at sea or in a plane it&#39;s pretty apparent. And if we are to accept Galileos findings in the 16th century earth and the other planets revolves around the sun and something keeps them there and that would be gravity. But this is a whole different ballpark than the fact that Kubrick and the guys faked the moon landings and that this is becoming more and more apparent today.</p>

<p>This is a different type of &quot;conspiracy&quot; to whether or not humans have landed on the moon, and I think it best not to conflate the two.</p>

<p>If it became known that the moon landings were faked, this  massive conspiracy would shock people to the core, but it wouldn&#39;t fundamentally change our existence. But if the Earth is not a globe then &quot;science&quot;, and our entire concept of reality goes out of the window. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of a globed spinning earth is a relatively new one, and the debate between the flat motionless earth vs globed spinning earth has been going on since its beginning. In fact, the flat earth was winning the debate until nasa &quot;proved&quot; the earth was a globe by 
going to space/moon&quot; and TPTB used modern media technology to spread the lie of a globe earth more efficiently.<br/>
Unfortunately, the average person has no access to the supposed technology that &quot;proves&quot; the globe earth, and we are told by the mainstream priests of &quot;science&quot; and other powers that be that our own observations that the earth is flat, motionless and the heavens are spinning above us is insane becasue THEY have &quot;proved&quot; otherwise.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The globe Earth was established by logical deduction and celestial observation two thousand years before NASA was created&quot;    </p>

<p>By its very nature, the globe earth theory can not be proved using the scientific method without nasa&#39;s supposed trip to space/moon. Before that fakery, all they had were theories...theories that constantly contradict observable, repeatable science.    </p>

<p>&quot;I enjoy the flat earth theory, because it has all he elements of a good conspiracy theory, but the the most obvious achilles heel of flat earthers is explaining how daylight hours change throughout the year. How is it possible for 24 hour daylight, and 24 darkness on both poles?&quot;</p>

<p>and i really smh at people who claim to know something about flat earth &quot;theory&quot; because they obviously have spent little to no time looking into it. You want some material to look at? This is a good place to start.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, but I am acquainted with the different the flat earth models. None of them have any credible explanation for the difference in hours of daylight throughout the calendar year, which  the tilting globe earth &quot;theory&quot; explains exactly. </p>

<p>Lots of people get sucked into flat earth - it&#39;s a legitimate topic of discussion, but none of its models can explain what we as humans actually see looking at the sky (and not just the sun, the moon too). Looking at the pattern of day/night across the hemispheres is how you will realise that the flat earth theory is flawed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its really not. And if you watched the video you could see that. As far as the day/night cycle question, it is basically dependent on ones perspective/relevant position to the sun.    </p>

<p>I think most people have issues with the sun cycle because when they think about it, they still picture themselves on a ball with the sun at the center of the solar system and the &quot;south pole&quot; being 1 fixed point on the globe. It does take time, but if you are honestly examining the evidence, it can become clear.     </p>

<p>I would suggest examining the evidence from the ground up....so to speak. Meaning, ignore the flat earth ideas of the heavens until you can grasp the flat earth ideas of the earth.</p>

<p>This is what you&#39;re doing, and it&#39;s why you can&#39;t work out why flat earth models don&#39;t work. Do yourself a favour and try to draw a model where Antarctica experiences 24hrs of daylight on the southern summer solstice.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_sun">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_sun</a>    </p>

<p>There are no permanent, economically autonomous human settlements south of the Antarctic Circle, only research stations, so the countries and territories whose populations experience the midnight sun are limited to those crossed by the Arctic Circle: Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut), Greenland, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States (Alaska).    </p>

<p>Pretty convenient that only government funded research stations are able to witness this supposed antarctic midnight sun eh? </p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t want answers then don&#39;t ask the question...but don&#39;t sit there and act like you have really thought about the earth being flat or a globe...because if you have decided that after 30 secs of flat earth explanation that you can fairly deny flat earth, then you are obviously just indoctrinated to believe something else.

    <div class="md"><p>Well unfortunately not everyone has the time to crawl through hours and hours of YouTube videos and dozens of websites, on every individual theory posted on this subreddit. I was hoping you&#39;d be able to point me in the right direction and I never said anywhere that I disagree with you. I was actually trying to see this topic from your point of view. It&#39;s a shame you feel the need to get so defensive about what you believe in, instead of trying to help others.</p>

<p>Somebody in a conspiracy sub would have run across this information by now most likely and if you say you don&#39;t have time to look at what I present to you, then why ask?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll play along.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a special that aired on Fox when X-files started and became popular in the 90&#39;s.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a starting point, but it&#39;s where a lot of people first got exposed to this stuff.</p>

<p>There&#39;s better information out there, and tons of good videos on YouTube that you say you don&#39;t have the time for and won&#39;t bother watching.</p>

<p>Could this have enough structural integrity to endure  the blast off, the Van Allen Belt, the lunar landing and  the blast off from the moon? What about the engineering and assembly of those panels? Does that look legit?</p>

<p>edit, From the top link in this comment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NASA’s focus now is on sending humans beyond low-Earth orbit to Mars… We are trying to develop the technologies to get there, it is actually a huge technological challenge. There are a couple of really big issues. For one thing – Radiation. Once you get outside the Earth’s magnetic field we are going to be exposing the astronauts to not just radiation coming from the Sun, but also to cosmic radiation. That&#39;s a higher dose than we think humans right now should really get.”

<p>Being inside the fairing of the rocket helps. Like, a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Van Allen Belt, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll get into this below, but it would have no real structural effect on the frame, and humans weren&#39;t in it mostly anyway. They were in the Radiation hardened command module.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the lunar landing </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was pretty smooth considering there was no atmosphere. All you have to deal with is engine gimbaling and the RCS system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the blast off from the moon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much like the landing, no atmosphere means no friction, which means very little structural stress. The astronauts joked that they had to careful in the lander because if they stomped too hard they&#39;d go through the floor. I suppose what I&#39;m really asking is this. If they knew they were faking it, and knew they were going to be photographing it close up, don&#39;t you think they&#39;d have made a more perfect model? Shouldn&#39;t <em>someone</em> in the last 40 years have come out and said it wouldn&#39;t actually work? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>NASA’s focus now is on sending humans beyond low-Earth orbit to Mars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I had a dollar every time I&#39;ve seen this used as evidence we never went to the moon, I&#39;d be able to fund the SLS myself. I can literally go sift through my old comments and find the data points of the trajectories the Apollo flights used if you want, but I&#39;ll explain it here and see if you just deflect it like people always do.</p>

<p>The Apollo program used a very high angle to reach the moon, missing the <em>vast</em> majority of the belt. They could do this because the moon is orbiting the earth, and is close enough that we&#39;d be guaranteed to enter it&#39;s SOI no matter what angle we approached at. </p>

<p>However, this does not ring true for interplanetary missions, the type being discussed hre. While you can go on odd angles, this takes much much more planning, time, engineerign and effort, all of which cost money. NASA no longer has a lot of this, so it&#39;s often not done. You can send things on a <em>generally</em> equatorial angle if they&#39;re robotic, as the tech is EMP and radiation hardened, but people are much more squishy. To avoid people spending years doing gravity assists just to reach mars, the goal is to send people directly through the belt, as opposed to the weird angles around it used decades ago. <em>that</em>s the technology being designed now, like the Orion capsule. Add to that the difference in exposure over a, ~ 8 day flight to the moon, or a ~4 month flight to mars, and you see why they&#39;re concerned.</p>

<p>And the paneling you&#39;re seeing isn&#39;t the hull, the pressure vessel is within that. I honestly have no Idea why It&#39;s joined like that, but I have to assume it&#39;s due to that only being some form of either dust, micrometeorite, radiation or heat shielding and not actually being important to the structure. It <em>is</em> odd, I just believe it&#39;s more likely it has an explanation I&#39;m not aware of than it&#39;s entirely faked.</p>

<p>I thought you didn&#39;t know about this topic, now you&#39;re acting as if you&#39;re an expert.  Meanwhile, all you&#39;re doing is spreading fallacies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s foil and a few randomly placed screws, with random irregular gaps, not the best technology money can buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean Iconel sheets painted with Pyromark, with reflective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapton">Kapton</a> layers in between?  Perhaps you should read about the construction itself, so as not to appear both ignorant and lazy:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A few months before flight, shock tunnel tests using a new thruster duty cycle revealed that the Pyromark painted Inconel lay-ups on the upper sides of the Descent Stage quads would not be sufficient protection against the hot plumes. A crash program to design a fix resulted in &quot;coal chute&quot; plume deflectors mounted below the down-firing jets. These were installed on LM 5 while it was on the pad, just before launch.</p>

<p>Another last minute thermal fix added 39 pounds of Kapton and Pyromark painted Inconel to the landing gear, pads and probe. One of the reasons for this added weight was a crew request(!) that they be allowed to keep the engine on past probe contact to pad touchdown. This would result in greater heating from the engine plume as it reflected off the lunar surface past the gear.</p>

<p>By the end of 1965, Scrape and SWIP had pruned away 1,100 kilograms, providing a comfortable margin below the control weight limit. One of the more striking changes to come from this drive for a lighter spacecraft was the substitution of aluminum-mylar foil thermal blankets for rigid heatshields. The gold wrapping characteristic of the lander&#39;s exterior saved 50 kilograms. Many of these weight-reducing changes made the lander so difficult to fabricate, so fragile and vulnerable to damage, that it demanded great care and skill by assembly and checkout technicians. Structural components took on strange and complex shapes, requiring careful machining to remove any excess metal.</p>

<p>What calculations have you done that countered those done by NASA which demonstrated that with sufficient shielding it would be safe to travel through the belts?  How did you acquire your measurements?</p>

<p>Experts in the field have continuously verified that the dosage was low enough to not present a danger to the astronauts, so it&#39;s fascinating that somebody who has admitted to &quot;not doing research on the subject&quot; would somehow have managed to obtain radiation measurements different than those of a leading scientific agency.  I look forward to your calculations as it would be one of the most impressive feats I&#39;ve ever heard of for somebody who hasn&#39;t even studied a subject to obtain smoking-gun proof that the radiation claims made by NASA were fraudulent.</p>

<p>lol, you act as if context doesn&#39;t matter.  </p>

<p>You ignore the overall message to suit your own agenda.  He&#39;s talking about new technology contained within the craft and how it might be affected by radiation.  Do you remember when cell phones weren&#39;t allowed to be used in hospitals?  Or when not even the first GameBoy could be used during a flight?  Do you understand how new precautions are taken when new technology is being used?  Do you currently fear using an mp3 player on an airplane?  If not, what technological aspects of both aircraft technology or mp3 player have changed in order to have them be allowed during flight?  Could it possibly be that <em>testing was required when new technologies were introduced to already known situations???</em>  </p>

<p>How are you so incapable of understanding nuance?</p>

<p>Again, what information do you have that counters the MRAD dosages tested by NASA?  How did you get your measurements?  Where do the measurement errors from numerous space agencies stem from, and how were you able to avoid these same mistakes from your home?  </p>

Please explain how the numerous experts in the field were all wrong, yet somebody who &quot;hasn&#39;t really researched the topic&quot; has somehow demonstrated their calculations to be incorrect.</p>

<p>Did you also find the dosomiter readings to be incorrect?  If so, how did you determine that to be the case?  How did you manage to measure the discrepancy, did you combine the trajectory plans with the estimated range of the VA belts, evaluated the strength of shielding on the Apollo missions and determined that the dosomiters contained fraudulent results?  What were your results?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are completely irrelevant to the facts and so am I.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have no facts.  You have conjecture, Youtube videos and FOX propaganda.  You say that you haven&#39;t even researched the topics, but are now spouting nonsense about &quot;facts&quot; when all you are doing is spreading misinformation.  Nice try.</p>

<p>Ok, so you have no proof, again just conjecture.</p>

<p>What is the need to venture beyond LEO at the moment?  Just to prove conjecture-theorists like yourself wrong?  NASA has better things to do than waste their limited funding on demonstrating their accomplishments to people who haven&#39;t bothered to research the topics at hand.</p>

<p>Untrue, many independent geologists would&#39;ve stood to make themselves remarkably famous if they could demonstrate that the lunar rocks were somehow falsified.  The Indian and Japanese space programs also would be the first to expose NASA through their orbiter imagery.  Exposing the hoax with <em>evidence</em> would be an enormous accomplishment for any scientist or agency.</p>

<p><em>690731 - Letter to Kulasekhara, Digvijaya and Tirthapada written from Los Angeles *
*</em>July 31, 1969** </p>

<blockquote>
<p>My Dear Kulasekhara das (Colin Jury), Digvijaya das (Dick Withey), and Tirthapada das (Tim Austin), 
Please accept my blessings. I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letters, sent along with your beads, and I have noted the contents carefully. This initiation ceremony is a Vedic principle to lead a conditioned soul to the higher level of transcendental life. In the Caitanya Caritamrta you will find the instruction as we have given it in our book, Teachings of Lord Caitanya, that after many, many births through approximately 8,400,000 species of life, a living entity gets this human form of life, which is a chance to get freedom from the material condition. When a child is born it is the responsibility of the state, of the father, of the mother, of the relatives, and of the teachers just to raise the child to the standard of Krishna Consciousness so that the child may not have any more to repeat the process of birth and death, but being fully situated in Krishna Consciousness he may be transferred to the spiritual world and situated in one of the Vaikuntha planets. The most important of the Vaikuntha planets is called Krishna Loka, or Goloka Vrindaban. In these days the propagation for landing on the moon planet is very encouraging to the common man, but so far as a Krishna Conscious person is concerned, he is not at all interested in any of the material planets. His target is to be transferred to the topmost spiritual planet, namely Krishna Loka. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the reason could be. I suppose concave earth reality casts doubt on a number of things, it throws shade on concepts like evolution and the idea of aliens.</p>

<p>Concave earth reality also reinforces the aether and the true nature of electricity/magnetism, all things which are damaging to the elite, who keep us in the dark about the true nature of our energy resources.</p>

<p><em>Lecture on BG 2.24 -- Hyderabad, November 28, 1972:</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This body is given by the father and mother at a certain date. Then it stays, say, for some time. It grows. Then it gives some by-products. From this body, there will be so many children. Or from the trees, there will be so many fruits and seeds. Then dwindling. Then becomes older. And vanish. This is the nature. 
So here we are getting information that acchedyo &#39;yam adāhyo &#39;yam akledyo &#39;śoṣya eva ca, nityaḥ sarva-gataḥ. This is another qualification of the living entities: sarva-gataḥ, &quot;everywhere.&quot; The rascal scientist says there is no living entity in the moon planet or sun planet. This is rascaldom. There is. Otherwise how Kṛṣṇa says sarva-gataḥ? Any, everywhere there is living entities. This is a false theory. We can see practically. We see there are living entities in the water. There are living entities in the air. There is living entities within the earth. There is living entities in so many ways. Why not in other planets? Where is the difference between this planet and that planet? This is also made of five elements. And that is also meant of, made of five elements. Here, the earthly element is very prominent. And the sun globe, the fire element is very prominent. So this material world is made of these five elements. Bhūmir āpo &#39;nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca (BG 7.4). So Kṛṣṇa says, sarva-gataḥ. The living entities are everywhere. Kṛṣṇa is also within everyone. Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham (Bs. 5.35). Kṛṣṇa is within this universe. Kṛṣṇa is within your heart. Not only your heart, but in everyone&#39;s heart. Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati (BG 18.61). Now, if you are a great scientist, take one insect. There are so many insects, we have seen, especially in the books, less than the full stop. Now, if you are a great scientist, find out where is the heart of this insect. And where is Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa says, sarva-gataḥ, everywhere there is Kṛṣṇa. Unless there is Kṛṣṇa, there is living entity, how that small, full-stop-like insect is moving? There is everything. The physiological condition is there. There is heart also. You cannot make that. You have imitated a big bird, aeroplane, flying, but just imitate the small insect which is also flying.
So there are so many questions that if we actually, philosophically study, then we can see vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ (BG 7.19), how Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa is acting. Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham (Bs. 5.35). So here the living entity is described as sanātana. And the process by which we can understand our sanātana nature, that is called sanātana-dharma, not that having a big tilaka and considering this rascal lump of matter as &quot;I am brāhmaṇa. This body is brāhmaṇa, and sanātana-dharma.&quot; This is all nonsense</p>

<p><em>yawn</em></p>

<p>Here&#39;s what they debunked since you failed to grasp how simple that video was.</p>

<p>They accounted for every single source of light from the &quot;supposedly fake&quot; moon landing images. Now, it happens fast, so you need to pay close attention, but they actually list off verbally every source of light and guess what&#39;s missing? Stage lights.</p>

<p>So, without those lights to contribute, they used only what was naturally available and were still off. So then they went deeper, discovered that the suits themselves were a source of light. Plugged those numbers in and it all clicked into place perfectly. Math doesn&#39;t lie and that&#39;s what this used to debunk it. </p>
