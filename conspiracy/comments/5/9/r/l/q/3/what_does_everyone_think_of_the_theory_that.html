       You can if you reneg on a deal or you mislead about the extent of the material. Depends on the promise. Promise to hold back some for hillary when making Trump think you are releasing everything.

        One internal White House email in early 2000 among staff notes that Trump “has his eye on the big JOB.” Another from November 1999 forwards an Associated Press article detailing then-potential candidate Trump’s proposal for a one-time 14.25 percent tax on the net worth of wealthy Americans.

       Why would a clinton plant parade Bill's mistresses, some he admitted to under oath in a court of law to having, before the second debate? why would a plant want to audit the federal reserve and impose congressional term limits? Why are the Rothschilds HSBC, Soros, Goldman Sachs all spending so much money on stopping a plant?

       Because trump is playing the opposition. He has to attack her with everything he can, esp by bringing out bills affairs which further creates diversions on both sides. On HRC this move offends women and further creates blind support for her. Besides if he wasn't attacking like this people would suspect he was a plant.

       The phone call was right after HRC announced running and right before Donald trump announced running.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are not working together now, why did this phone call occur?  If you can't connect the dots as you yourself know trump 'bribed' her.
Trump donated to her multiple times.
He got Clinton into golf clubs he was not normally allowed in. The numerous pictures of them at weddings and parties. Trumps daughter and Chelsea Clinton being best friends. They share an address for a corporate building in  Delaware. And the emails released through foia saying the Clinton administration wanted trump to run third party in 1999 . If you can't connect these dots. Personally I find your theory of them not colluding together harder to believe

Where First Lady clinton and trump stand or where bill and trump play golf. Apparently they still golf a lot, which is what that phone call bill made to trump last year was only about.

      <p>
       So let me ask you, since bill called trump last year and encouraged him to run, but they also talked about golf. Are they still friends? Are they still close?
