       <br/>
       By the way, the phone intervention of Julian Assange at CSIL2016
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59m8ps/julian_assanges_intervention_to_the_cisl2016_was/">
        is only a diversion to distract people of asking those controlling the Twitter Wikileaks account for a real PGP-signed proof of life.
       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       And if you want to be even more rigorous, it's more like Day 23.  You can look at the
       <a href="http://assange.net/">
        'Julian proof of life clock'
       </a>
       . As of now, there is no valid proof of life since an Oct 4 live video feed in Berlin.

       Just to make sure I have this correct....The story we are being told is that PAMELA ANDERSON is the last American to see Julian Assange in person?

       No, I am saying that Julian is being held hostage currently and that consequently, it's Truth that is held hostage through him.

       Well, I don't know your level of knowledge about how a scientific conference is organized. But I can tell you with a 150% certainty that there is
       <strong>
        0% probability
       </strong>
       that a very famous speaker would popup in a relatively unknown conference (no offense here, Argentina, but it's true!), when he wasn't even on the program a few days before, and especially when he is wanted by the greatest intelligence force in the world because he is a threat to election of the candidate of the ruling party of that country. He could have done whatever videotaped interview with whatever journalist of a major news outlet, but no journalist was able to see him. So one would want us to believe that while his internet connection has been 'shut down', he starts to find an unknown conference in which he can speak... That is completely ridiculous!
       <br/>
       &amp;nbsp;
       <br/>
       A phone interview can be faked so easily that it has not value. And even if it was Julian Assange's voice, it was certainly not live and not from the embassy. That whole improvised conference story is so ridiculous that I am surprised that so many people can consider it to be true, even only remotely.
       <br/>

       And also, I like your account that was inactive for 1 year, and that has a post karma of 1 and a comment karma of -1. Hello Clinton operative, welcome to this sub.

       Is there a problem here? We got a report of a suspicious account and a possible Code 8 under the
