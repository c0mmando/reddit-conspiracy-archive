By the way, the phone intervention of Julian Assange at CSIL2016 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59m8ps/julian_assanges_intervention_to_the_cisl2016_was/">is only a diversion to distract people of asking those controlling the Twitter Wikileaks account for a real PGP-signed proof of life.</a>.<br/>
And if you want to be even more rigorous, it&#39;s more like Day 23.  You can look at the <a href="http://assange.net/">&#39;Julian proof of life clock&#39;</a>. As of now, there is no valid proof of life since an Oct 4 live video feed in Berlin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t know your level of knowledge about how a scientific conference is organized. But I can tell you with a 150% certainty that there is <strong>0% probability</strong> that a very famous speaker would popup in a relatively unknown conference (no offense here, Argentina, but it&#39;s true!), when he wasn&#39;t even on the program a few days before, and especially when he is wanted by the greatest intelligence force in the world because he is a threat to election of the candidate of the ruling party of that country. He could have done whatever videotaped interview with whatever journalist of a major news outlet, but no journalist was able to see him. So one would want us to believe that while his internet connection has been &#39;shut down&#39;, he starts to find an unknown conference in which he can speak... That is completely ridiculous!<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
A phone interview can be faked so easily that it has not value. And even if it was Julian Assange&#39;s voice, it was certainly not live and not from the embassy. That whole improvised conference story is so ridiculous that I am surprised that so many people can consider it to be true, even only remotely.<br/>

And also, I like your account that was inactive for 1 year, and that has a post karma of 1 and a comment karma of -1. Hello Clinton operative, welcome to this sub. </p>
