    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I don&#39;t want war (I&#39;m of draft - fighting age). I don&#39;t want to fight Russia. I have family there, and their people are chill for the most part. I also know Spetsnaz, they are crazy fuckers, whom I do not wish to fight (or even drink with). They make our SEALS look like children... Trust me. Trump is 50/50, and does not want war. We know what Clinton will bring, that&#39;s enough for me... We live in dark times, and people need to think about this, especially if you are fit and under the age of 45 and older than 18. We can all be drafted, sigh....</p>

<p>You just posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t support Trump</p>

<p>then about 15 seconds later you edit to this:</p>

<p>I dont support Trump, and what bullshit did you call out?.... I see you also like to edit your posts, lol...</p>

<p>Not that i care. Im not one of those anal people who is against people editing posts. I bet you also publicly complain about reposts too dont you?

See, the problem is, this guy seems to know for fact that Trump is NOT a plant. Id love to think his reasoning is based on factual evidence but it is just as much speculation as with my view.  He keeps telling me to read more and learn more yet still doesnt present any sort of evidence to back up his claim that Trump is legit.

    <div class="md"><p>Which are all valid points, no? I mean what do you offer as proof that he is a plant? Nothing, even less evidence. A phone call or a picture from 2000 of them together at a dinner doesn&#39;t mean anything. Politicians, public figures and famous people always hang out, meet at parties, keep in touch. That doesn&#39;t mean they share their dirty secrets.
What we know is that Trump is speaking truth. Truth about the corruption of the country, hell in the first debate he went easy on her, he even said he&#39;s trying to keep it civil because their daughters are friends, but after what she did to him with fake sexual assaults, attacking his supporters, slander and lies, he had enough, attacked her and her puppet masters. Something I haven&#39;t heard a politician do since JFK. Without a doubt Hillary will start WW3, she laid out her plan, it&#39;s horrible, it consists of toppling more governments, something Russia won&#39;t stand for. Thank about it this way, Trump in 40 years in the public eye, NEVER had any assault accusations, he had many black friends, never was called racist, he employed women in positions in which no woman before was appointed to, he believes in America and in second chances, which is a great character trait. This is who he was last year, a respected playboy billionaire, he gave that up to be called a racist, a bigot, a womanizer, a rapist, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re a man, but being accused of rape or assault is one of the worst things that can happen to a man, especially someone like him. He joined this race to leave a legacy, not to have it dragged through the mud. I have great respect for the man: am I absolutely sure he&#39;s not a plant, or won&#39;t flip flop on what he&#39;s saying? No I do not. But I am sure that Clinton will drag is to a war with another nuclear power, I am sure she is a liar, corrupt, and unethical. She is weak, old, and most likely sick. She&#39;s violent, has a temper, and is an alcoholic. Trump doesn&#39;t drink, smoke or do  drugs. I do all of those things, but I still respect his resolve, and he&#39;s the kind of public figure I&#39;d want my kids to look up to as a role model, a successful good hearted family man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait wait even less evidence? Wtf evidence does he even have? One speech at a &quot;roast&quot; where they laughed and drank champagne together after? Wtf else? </p>

<p>Have you not seen the video of<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q76rxpKm3m4">Trump praising the Clintons in 2008?</a> </p>

<p>Maybe you can tell me why Trump didnt mention the content of the emails in ANY of the debates? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth be told. If someone is viewed as a legit candidate by voters when they are actually a plant...That makes them a successful plant. It&#39;s like Jim Jefferies says about &quot;dumb cunts&quot;. This isnt directed at anyone just an example...Dumb cunts dont know they are dumb cunts...Because they are dumb cunts. </p>

<p>From my perspective...Trump not mentioning the content of the emails makes him a suspect. Trump having been a Clinton Foundation donor makes him strong suspect. Trump having praised the Clintons in the past makes him a strong suspect. Trump being a professional salesman makes him suspect. Trump being a REALY TV ACTOR makes him suspect.</p>

<p>I asked you first what i need educating on. And your epic response showing your superior knowledge was &quot;Everything&quot;</p>

<p>Basically you are saying &quot;If you dont know im not telling you&quot;</p>

<p>I dont actually think you are CTR i was just teasing. But wow you got defensive quick. Most Trump supporters like you get really offended when called out for your bullshit.</p>
