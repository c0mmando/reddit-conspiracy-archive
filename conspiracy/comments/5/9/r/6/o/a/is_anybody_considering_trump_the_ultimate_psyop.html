<p>&quot;<em>Trump (and others?) have called for registering Muslims. He has called &gt; for a federal domestic police force that will be focussed on arresting and &gt; deporting 11 million people. Other candidates are talking about separating &gt; immigrants by religion.</em> &gt; &gt; <em>All of this is about building up and feeding the BIG BROTHER beast.</em> &gt; &gt; <em>The Tea Party was born bc of the perception of government encroachment in &gt; peoples lives — and it really has always been the Rand Paul mantra: &gt; government wants to control your health care decisions. Government wants &gt; register all your guns, which will ultimately lead to gun confiscation. &gt; Government wants the ability to murder its own citizens with drones &gt; (remember the Rand Paul filibuster on that one?). The Snowden stuff &gt; confirmed what many felt. . .the government was collecting vast troves &gt; of information on everyone.</em> &gt; &gt; *At a certain point, I think HRC might bring together all the different &gt; strands (mostly Trumps) of expanding federal Big Brother government — and &gt; talk about how its possible to be safe without creating some kind of large &gt; and cumbersome and intrusive police state. * &gt; &gt; *This will sew divisions and acrimony o the other side. But it may be too &gt; early to raise this. Or maybe she SHOULD pick a fight with Trump on this &gt; to help cement his front runner status. Luke</p>
