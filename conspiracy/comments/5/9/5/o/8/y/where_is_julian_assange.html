        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>What are the options?</strong></p>

<p>Is Assange &quot;still&quot; alive (as WikiLeaks, perhaps tellingly, asserts), and if so, where is he? There are several possible permutations. Either:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Assange is alive and well in the Ecuadorian Embassy in Hans Crescent, London, and simply keeping his head down (possibly in an attempt to create a news story and give more publicity to WikiLeaks).</p></li>
<li><p>Assange is alive and has miraculously managed to escape from the Embassy without being picked up the UK police or CIA who were monitoring the building, and has reached or is making his way to, a safe haven (eg Russia). </p></li>
<li><p>Assange is still alive, but now in captivity. This could be inside the Embassy, but far more likely, he has been removed and handed to the US authorities who have him in custody on &quot;US controlled territory&quot; (and where it is quite likely he is being tortured, like the thousands of nameless other &quot;enemy combatants&quot; before him).</p></li>
<li><p>Assange has been murdered (possibly by poisoning). Either his body is being stored in a freezer at the Embassy building until the  &quot;appropriate&quot; time to announce his death, or it may have already been removed. </p></li>
<li><p>It is also possible that Assange was removed (or left) the Embassy alive, but has since been killed (ie a combination of 3 and 4).</p></li>
<li><p>An option I did not initially consider is that Assange could have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T_h7pSVIFo">realised his arrest was imminent</a> and taken an extreme, but logical step to ensure that he wasn&#39;t captured. When faced with the prospect of torture, suicide would be the rational choice. Of course suicide may yet be presented as the official cause of death, and ironically, many people will not believe it.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit: It has long been argued that Assange (like Snowden) is a government agent, or limited hangout, working for US/UK interests, or even Russia. Alternatively, Assange could be in the process of becoming a limited hangout, perhaps agreeing to redact/restrict the most damaging of the documents in his possession in return for his freedom. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What does the evidence point to?</strong></p>

<p>The best &quot;evidence&quot; we have at the moment is several testimonials which purport that Assange is alive and well, inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, or news stories which are designed to make people infer that this is the case. <strong>However, these stories are either inconclusive, suspect or have been proven to be false, in other words they may just be distractions and misdirection.</strong> There have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58n6w4/is_assange_alive_has_wikileaks_been_compromised_a/">other posts covering this subject</a>, but these distraction stories include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Pamela Anderson vegan sandwich visit on 15 October (somewhat compromised by her cryptic &quot;torture&quot; reference). <a href="https://twitter.com/pamfoundation/status/790914144748892160?lang=it">Update: Pamela Anderson has tweeted this &quot;gift&quot; of two mice for Assange&#39;s cat on 25 October</a></li>
<li>the statement by Ecuador that they were cutting off Assange&#39;s internet on October 16 (a cover story to obscure the fact Assange was already incapable of communicating?)</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1995230/bizarre-internet-theory-that-julian-assange-was-poisoned-by-pamela-anderson-with-vegan-sandwich-from-pret-as-his-internet-is-mysteriously-cut/">Wikileaks employee visit/tweet</a> on 17 October <a href="https://twitter.com/kellykolisnik/status/787932228994990080">(since disavowed)</a></li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58j0y7/craig_murray_the_former_british_ambassador_to/">Craig Murray whisky visit</a> on October 18.</li>
<li>the numerous old Assange videos being re-posted as &quot;news&quot;</li>
<li>the idiotic red herring story involving images of Assange&#39;s &quot;escape&quot; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58ub39/has_cryptomeorg_twitter_account_been_compromised/">(which were actually Google StreetView images from two years ago)</a></li>
<li>the 4-month old <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/593prn/latest_sign_wikileaks_is_compromised_they/">Michael Moore video</a> being touted as current by WikiLeaks.</li>
<li>the Wikileaks promises to provide hard evidence of Assange&#39;s situation which have been reneged on.</li>
<li>Weird tweets from WikiLeaks generally, including a ridiculous accusation that a major US ddos was the work of WikiLeaks supporters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Conversely, whilst there is an &quot;absence of positive evidence&quot; that Assange has been harmed or abducted from the Ecuadorian Embassy, there are numerous reasons to suggest this might the case.</p>

<ul>
<li>Final tweet from account known to be controlled by Julian Assange (Embassy Cat) on 15 October.</li>
<li>the release of Wikileaks codes on 16 October</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/14/date-set-questioning-julian-assange-rape-allegation">cancellation of the October 17 interview by Swedish prosecutors at the Ecuadorian Embassy.</a></li>
<li>Bystander reports of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/57vu5l/red_alert_wikileaks_on_twitter_julian_assanges/d8vfhtg/">police/swat activity outside the Ecuadorian Embassy on 17 October</a> and a forcible abduction.</li>
<li>A cryptic tweet from WikiLeaks <a href="http://www.trunews.com/article/wikileaks-armed-police-appear-at-ecuador-embassy-in-london">confirming armed police outside the Ecuadorian Embassy</a>, corroborating the forcible abduction story</li>
<li>there have been at least 9 days of non-communication by Assange,</li>
<li>no proof of life provided, and no PGP signed document, despite repeated requests</li>
<li>no rational explanation for this silence</li>
<li>the sudden death of Gavin MacFadyen, the third (known) senior member of Wikileaks to die suddenly this year</li>
<li>this redditor who visited Hans Crescent on 22 October, to find there was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5941hn/my_visit_to_the_ecuadorian_embassy_221016/">no police presence guarding the Embassy.</a> Assange was under siege for over four years, with a permanent police detail outside the Embassy, with orders to arrest him if he tried to leave. Why were they removed?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MJAvCqVIXw">Mark Halperin of Politico attempted to meet with Assange on Friday 21, but was refused by a goon: &quot;Assange too busy&quot;- video.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Bearing in mind the above, and the highly suspicious nature of the so-called &quot;evidence&quot; asserting that he is in good health, I think it is reasonable at this point to suspect that Assange has either been killed and/or is no longer inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, so either options 3 or 4, or probably both (option 5) bearing in mind that the US elite will not want to give Assange a trial where he could reveal any more information.</p>

<p>Finally, if Assange has been subjected to extraordinary rendition and/or killed, we must assume that the UK, the US and the Ecuadorian governments are all complicit. It would mean that Ecuador&#39;s President Rafael Correa was somehow turned by the US authorities (be it via money or threats, or both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595o8y/where_is_julian_assange/d9641pq/">concerning Ecuador&#39;s gold reserves being held in the US</a>) into secretly revoking Assange&#39;s asylum. It would also mean that the UK authorities have illegally handed over Assange to the Americans without due legal process, knowing that Assange would be tortured and probably killed.</p>

<p>But...let&#39;s hope this has all been a bad dream. </p>

<p>At this point, however, I think the best we can hope for is that Assange is fine and still in the Ecuadorian Embassy, because I think the escape option is by far the least likely of all these scenarios.</p>

<p>TLDR: There has been no proof of life of Julian Assange for at least 9 days. Instead we have seen a raft of distraction stories (even from WikiLeaks itself) which are clearly designed to give <strong>the impression</strong> that Assange is alive and well. Some of these stories have been shown to be old footage or otherwise bogus. So it appears that WikiLeaks is compromised and that probably means Assange is no longer in the safety of the Ecuadorian Embassy. I supect the US authorities probably have the most information about Assange, and his current whereabouts, and we should probably fear the worst.</p>

<p>EDIT: As mentioned briefly above, Julian Assange was due to be interviewed by Swedish prosecutors last week - on 17th October, at a meeting inside the Embassy. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59agk0/the_guardian_reported_on_12_oct_link_that_julian/">However, this meeting was called off just five days beforehand, on Wednesday 12 October,</a>  ostensibly because the lawyers &quot;couldn&#39;t make it&quot;. This made me wonder whether it was perhaps Assange who was not available - in other words, could Assange have been out of commission earlier than we realised? Unlikely, perhaps.</p>

<p>Not knowing when the Assange disappearance timeline truly begins is making it harder to discover what has happened to him.That said, the publication of WikiLeaks codes on twitter shortly after the Pamela Anderson &quot;vegan torture&quot; visit on 15 October is the most obvious starting point in the chronology.</p>

<p>NOTE (26 October): I am updating this page as new information comes in. If you think there is something I have missed out, please notify me in the comments.</p>

<p>EDIT: 26 October 22.15 GMT. &quot;Julian Assange&quot; is apparently participating over telephone link to the CISL Conference.  Opinions?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndUYXZMNlBU&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndUYXZMNlBU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>EDIT: The &quot;Assange phone-in&quot; has finished, but can stil be accessed in the above link. Assange is introduced starting around 3h.15 - you don&#39;t see him, only hear him. Please listen to Assange&#39;s comments (via phone link) and decide for yourself.</p>

<p>EDIT: Transcript of &quot;Assange&#39;s&quot; answers during the conference call by <a href="/u/qrestlove">/u/qrestlove</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59jyze/julian_assangesupposedly_on_a_spanish_tv_show/">here</a> </p>

<p>EDIT: In my view, that sounded like Julian Assange talking. However, I am by no means certain, and I note plenty of you think it definetely was NOT Assange, so I am keeping an open mind. The Caller referenced his internet being cut off at the Embassy, and the telephone call (to a public CISL event) <strong>appeared</strong> to be live. At this point we can&#39;t be certain, so this event doesn&#39;t qualify as a proof of life. The whole episode was decidedly odd, seeing as there was zero advance publicity from him or the event organisers about him being a contributor to the conference.</p>

<p>It certainly leaves many questions unanswered about his physical and legal status, his current location and ultimately whether Julian Assange is himself entirely legit, or perhaps some sort of limited hangout. </p>

<p>EDIT: Or perhaps he has been legit up until now, but, as <a href="/u/founthead">/u/founthead</a> posits, is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595o8y/where_is_julian_assange/d99pj0t/">in the process of becoming a limited hangout, to secure his freedom</a>?</p>

<p>EDIT: John Pilger has published an article, based on a lecture he gave yesterday (27 October) at the Sheffield Festival of Words in which he states: </p>

<p><strong>&quot;That is why silencing and threatening Julian Assange is so important. As the editor of WikiLeaks, Assange knows the truth. And let me assure those who are concerned, he is well, and WikiLeaks is operating on all cylinders.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The article is here: <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/10/28/inside-the-invisible-government-war-propaganda-clinton-trump/">http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/10/28/inside-the-invisible-government-war-propaganda-clinton-trump/</a></p>

<p>John Pilger&#39;s website is <a href="http://johnpilger.com/">here</a>. Pilger is a journalistic legend and a friend of Julian Assange, and although it goes without saying, this is not a formal proof of life, Pilger&#39;s &quot;truth&quot; credentials are pretty much unrivalled. It should be stressed that Pilger and Wikileaks have stressed Assange is &quot;alive&quot; but not his whereabouts.</p>

<p>EDIT: This post is being unstickied as it has become unwieldy. Sadly, we are no nearer establishing exactly where Julian Assange is, but (what I believe to be credible) information has materialised which suggests he is &quot;still alive&quot;. However, there is no sign that Assange is &quot;still in the Ecuadorian Embassy&quot;, and he apparently hasn&#39;t been there since about the 17 October. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading this question ever since the day he went missing, and I have to ask:  Just how short of a period of time do people expect it to have been set for?</p>

<p>Consider that there are two good reasons to use a DMS with a longer delay:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you&#39;re temporarily unable to access it, you don&#39;t want it to trigger.  If it accidentally triggers, there goes your protection, and so you can expect to be dead tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have to access it every fucking day, then that&#39;s just all the more chances for someone to detect your access to it and find it, and if they find it, you can expect to be dead tomorrow.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I imagine that this thing is set for at least a month if not a year.  A longer time delay doesn&#39;t make it any less damaging for his enemies.</p>

<p>As for those who might say that he would set it for a shorter time so that he has to resist less torture to hide it, consider that he could easily have as many dead man switches as he wants.  So if they&#39;re still torturing him after he&#39;s given up all but the last one, why would they stop when he gives up the last one?  They can&#39;t know how many he has.  So he&#39;d have no reason to believe they would stop, and thus no motivation to cooperate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m floating on the idea that Assange is currently captive. Not necessarily in a covert ops extraction type ordeal, more of a leveraged &quot;we&#39;ll walk you out the front door safely&quot; ordeal. All they have to do is change his appearance, do it during a low traffic time, and then they walk him out to an average looking car to go <em>somewhere</em>.</p>

<p>Now, the interesting part is still the chemical attack at that nearby airport.</p>

<p>All they have to do is stage mass hysteria, evacuate everyone, and walk him calmly in as one of the agents doing the inspection. They found <em>nothing</em> by the way.</p>

<p>Then they hop on a plane, still in disguise, and fly him anywhere he needs to go.</p>

<p>All of this banks that they have leverage of some kind. Maybe MacFadyen&#39;s death was a message. <em>We have your people on scope, they can die in an apparently natural way, you will cooperate now.</em> Fucking ricin and shit.</p>

<p>As for the deadman&#39;s switch, it could be a multilevel switch. After 24 hours, backup is created, reencryption occurs, WL staff start getting phone calls/texts to go to a red alert.</p>

<p>The next level could be a week. False information starts spilling just to keep the pages moving and clicks coming in. Confuse the people with Assange in captivity.</p>

<p>2 weeks to a month later, if Assange hasn&#39;t proven his safety, the final switch activates, dropping the message that he has been compromised, WL is under attack, etc. Then the whole system starts dropping the leaks like missiles. I doubt the leaks would come from one site or person. They would be popping up like mushrooms all over the internet.</p>

<p>Hell, even that DDOS the other day could&#39;ve been part of Assange&#39;s deadman&#39;s switch. It wouldn&#39;t be hard to create concern for the system by simply stopping it in it&#39;s tracks. Sort of a &quot;by the way, we can do <em>this</em> now.&quot; sentiment.</p>

<p>On that note, the recent tweet declaring that his followers committed the DDOS could be a message cryptically declaring that <em>they</em> did it, in case the PTB have any doubts.</p>

<p>Add to this the fact that multiple groups have come forward with admissions of guilt. Even <em>government</em> institutions (those AFB programmers, for example). It would be all about keeping the people confused while the government cleans up the mess.</p>

<p>Anyways, I personally think Assange is somewhere in Europe, with an IV drip of strong antipsychotics, benzos, scopalamine, whatever other current psychoactives they can pump him full of to get him to talk. He isn&#39;t going to, maybe he doesn&#39;t even know 100% what the deadman&#39;s switch is. They might have leverage over him, threats of harming others to get him to talk. But all the while, I think he&#39;s still got the upper hand.</p>

<p>Hell, maybe even MacFadyen&#39;s death was a suicide. He would be the one who knows the workings of the DMS. In that case, Assange has won and is riding out his suffering knowing full well he&#39;s won. He&#39;s sitting, strapped to a chair, drugs muddling his brain, while all he can think is &quot;5 more days. 4 more days. 3 more days.&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Or the DDOS was used by the killers to cover up the deadman switch. They targeted major sites so there&#39;s no suspicion of one single site being  attacked. They can DDOS any site they want at that point and no one will suspect it&#39;s a targeted attack. They could have had intel on the deadman switch(es) and had the DDOS as backup to buy time if needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If you have to access it every fucking day, then that&#39;s just all the more chances for someone to detect your access to it and find it, and if they find it, you can expect to be dead tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d expect it to be some sort of multi-level setup, with some part of it set to fire based on external cues. Something like (each of these would be physically separate servers to avoid detection):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Daily - server(s) check for activity on WikiLeaks Twitter account. If no activity for, say, three consecutive days, keys (to some information/insurance files) and/or an alert to check on Assange et al. are quietly distributed to trusted people. This can run fairly frequently - risk of detection is fairly low (many bots are probably frequently watching the WikiLeaks account), and the costs of false activation are minimal (assuming the trusted people set is well chosen).</p></li>
<li><p>Monthly - server(s) on a random date grab the WikiLeaks.org front page via TOR. If some subtle, pre-determined change has been made to the page (say &quot;&lt;body class=&quot;home&quot;&gt;&quot; is changed to &quot;&lt;body class=&quot;home-main&quot;&gt;&quot;), then the majority of the insurance keys are publicly posted to pre-determined locations (this isn&#39;t a dead man&#39;s switch, but a reliable way to force the release may be useful). If the page fails to load, or pre-determined fixed elements are changed, for three consecutive months (with additional retries in the final month), then the release also occurs (implication is that WikiLeaks.org has been taken over by an unknown group; three month delay reduces the risk of accidental releases if WikiLeaks.org is down for other reasons)</p></li>
<li><p>Yearly - the &quot;real&quot; dead man&#39;s switch. Each time Assange contacts this server, a timer is reset. If that timer ever reaches 1 year, then all of the insurance keys, plus anything else relevant, are immediately pushed to as many publicly accessible places as possible. Coming up with a secure way of contacting the server is non-trivial, especially if torture is a possibility. I&#39;d expect it to be something like only connectable over TOR (reducing the risk that the server is found), and that access is done by something like trying to load https://&lt;yearlyserveraddress&gt;.onion/&lt;pre-determined word that changed each year&gt;/&lt;random fixed string&gt;.html. Use of the wrong word causes the switch to fire, regardless of the timer (the random string is essentially a safety - if anyone manages to find the server, randomly poking at it shouldn&#39;t cause the release of information). Someone with a better working knowledge of TOR than me will almost certainly be able to give a safer scheme.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d also expect that there would be other layers involved, such as monitoring the existence of the yearly server (ping &lt;yearlyserveraddress&gt;.onion to see if it still exists - this could be disguised as a malicious TOR node that has been sniffing hidden service descriptors and testing for existence). These would be set up by people other than Assange, so even if he breaks completely and tells whomever everything he knows, the switch could still activate. </p>

<p>Regardless of the actual implementation details (I got a little carried away thinking about how I would do it :p), the upshot is that I wouldn&#39;t expect any automated releases to occur for some time (at least publicly; trusted individuals could be contacted sooner). Assuming that the dead man&#39;s switch was set up without any particular deadline in mind (e.g. the US election), I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the release happened months after Assange was captured, killed, or otherwise removed from the running of WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible, of course, that the insurance files are random data intended as a bluff and to waste resources trying to crack them, and that the dead man&#39;s switch never existed in the first place. Personally I think this is unlikely, but it can&#39;t (currently) be ruled out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not expecting him to last a year; the idea is to make so even if tortured the torturers can&#39;t reset the trigger safely. Say Assange gives them the key word - they have no way of knowing if using it was trigger the switch or delay the release. This more or less forces them to take the server offline, as which point the watcher nodes will see something is up and trigger the release regardless. The last point is critical - those watchers are set up by other people, and Assange wouldn&#39;t know <em>anything</em> about their locations etc., so even if he handed him self over of his own volition there isn&#39;t much he could do to stop.</p>

<p>NSA et al. could possibly do traffic analysis and discover them, but the existence of such a set up changes the conversation - instead of &quot;take Assange out and the problem is solved&quot;, it becomes &quot;take Assange out, hope he cooperates/breaks, and take the risk that NSA can uncover every single element of the dead man&#39;s switch before it triggers&quot;. You can never get a cast iron guarantee of safety, but making it risky to try taking him out makes it much less likely.</p>

<p>I&#39;d just correct this though. The NSA has had honeypots by way of hosting Tor nodes, and they are compromised. I dont know all the technicalities, like &quot;MITM using Tor&quot;, but it&#39;s been proven to work, and is being exploited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tor on its own is far from bullet-proof, but it can be a useful addition. Firstly, there is a chance that the traffic travels via an uncompromised path (rather than the guarantee that NSA et al. are listening to Assange&#39;s normal traffic).</p>

<p>Secondly, and more importantly, using Tor helps to hide the server&#39;s location. If NSA et al. get a real IP address, discovering the location of server is fairly straight-forward. Correlation attacks would enable them to narrow the location, but these typically require a decent amount of traffic (not just a single ping) to work reliably. You could also &quot;check-in&quot; via a jump server, which receives the check-in but waits a random amount of time (~days) before forwarding it to the real DMS server. If that jump server is noisy to begin with (say running a Tor relay), then spotting the extra request made to the real server is a tall order.</p>

<p>Like I said, Tor isn&#39;t a golden bullet for anonymity, but using here as an additional layer rather than sending direct requests is useful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal theory, that I hadn&#39;t shared yet (however it is likely someone else has had the same theory and shared it) is that the United States threatened Ecuador badly enough that they had to fork over Assange for the sake of their government, military, and citizens lives. The UK being a long standing ally of the United States helped move Assange at least to the airport/(ocean)port or a USA controlled plot of land in the UK. The USA is planning to hold Assange until after the election at a minimum and they are making demands of known WikiLeaks staff to minimize the damage of any further leaks at least until the election; these staff would have been told that Assange is alive and to report that and only that or else, else being they die or worse. (Yes, there is always a worse possible outcome) The USA may have even demanded temporary control of WikiLeaks any resistance would be met with death. Assange will be held at least until after the election with no proof of life, at somepoint he is released at which point enough damage has been averted and the DMS will not go off as Assange won&#39;t want to die simply to fuck over a lot of the world&#39;s elite yet. Surely Assange has further aspirations for his life so until he completes everything he  wants, the worst of the files won&#39;t  be released. Notice he went missing with less than a month to go before the election, that was probably deliberate assuming the USA has him as one month would be reasonable minimum guess for when the DMS would fire off.</p>

<p>That is my personal theory at this point, I have the same information you have and therefore cannot prove anything. The USA would do this as a safe enough gamble (Yet also risky enough) that the DMS is set for a long period of time, Assange being highly intelligent would be prepared for a situation like the one in my hypothesis. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s to hoping Assange is okay physically, mentally and emotionally, I hope we see him soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose if you are correct, which I think is highly possible, then the Deadman Switch will fire at somepoint in the relatively near future be it 1 month, 6 months, or 1 year from now at which point a lot of people in positions of power are fucked. Unless the government was waiting to grab him until they found a way to disable the switch prior to incarcerating him. That would explain the death of his lawyer/s? and mentor who may have had extra copies of the &quot;key&quot; needed to decrypt the torrents he released. If this is the case we are all fucked, unless someone can get a really good hacker/programmer to crack the torrent and release it globally. My question is whether the CIA/Special Forces are actually good enough to have shut down the Deadman Switch, that might seem like a dumb question, but I doubt Assange fuck around. Point being I find it likelier that Assange gets the last laugh be it from a cell, a coffin, or from the shadows.</p>

<p>My nightmare: Assange works for the government, they fed him files to leak for years, he&#39;s done what they asked him to and now they&#39;ve let him retire. No Deadman Switch, No Torrent Files, the American people get raped again by our own government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, we&#39;ve been at war for quite some time. With Assange missing and Snowden and Guccifer 2.0 silent, the people&#39;s major advocates are dwindling. I mean depending on how you see James O&#39;keefe, Alex Jones, and (my personal favorite) Dr. Michael Savage; they&#39;re really all we have left. (James O&#39;keefe and Alex Jones) are largely discredited in the public eye. If you do not already listen to Dr. Michael Savage (he is on 400 radio stations + internet streaming from 3PM to 6PM EST Monday-Friday), I would highly recommend it, he is and has been awake for a very long time. He&#39;s also in the radio hall of fame despite being outspoken against government corruption for many years. He has written many books regarding our countries leadership and corruption, however he does offer solutions to our countries problems that can be carried out by the citizens of the country as opposed to reliance upon ethical politicians to save us.</p>

<p>I did read one theory that Assange, Snowden and Guccifer 2.0 all are government misinformants meant to make us think we have saviors thus quelling any thoughts among those who have awoken that we need to prepare for some sort of revolution. (I pray that theory is BS) Dr. Savage has been predicting a civil war for quite some time, whether it is a race war or political ideology war, not to mention 300+ pages of cited sources, I fear he is correct, I&#39;d look into him in the absence of &quot;saviors&quot; as he may have some insight regarding their sudden disappearance and it&#39;s timing. </p>

<p>Again, I know nothing more than anyone on this subreddit, nor do I have access to any special/classified/secret information that the public doesn&#39;t have access to. I&#39;ll be paying close attention to Dr. Savage&#39;s radio show, any public statements made by Putin, and articles from Zerohedge (my favorite of the conspiracy theory news sites) Hopefully we learn something helpful soon, but I&#39;m not terribly hopeful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing. We have no proof - so far this is just a theory. No matter how probable.</p>

<p>The conspiracy subreddit isn&#39;t about crackpot ideas that people think are whacko. It&#39;s about exposing that which the powers that be wish to remain hidden. And if we do manage to put all the pieces together and definitively prove something, that still doesn&#39;t mean that it wasn&#39;t a conspiracy at some point, and warrants discussion here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although true, I think if someone was loyal to Assange and wanted to help, this has to be the best motive - saying for everyone to get him to come out or open the doors to him to check that he&#39;s safe could mean allowing access to people who&#39;d want to stop him etc... Turning on his internet seems to be the wisest political motive to have. As people have assumed, some servers of wikileaks maybe compromised (such as Julian&#39;s - there&#39;s messages saying &quot;- ja&quot; on wikileaks Twitter despite we know his internet is shut down... So this leads me (and hopefully many others) to assume the people behind the working servers are putting out a message. I just thought now, what if they&#39;ve threatened Julian or Intimidate the Wikileakers still working with Julian&#39;s safety?</p>

<p>An sos seems sane.</p>

<p>I may have to start another Reddit on this collecting my thoughts and all the information first... Since the message hasn&#39;t been finished yet this may mean isn&#39;t as urgent as it could be so I&#39;ll put all the possibities down leading to it being a good SoS then hope people can help make this big news.</p>

<p>His right to Internet access is so basic, this should be a concern alone - it just happens to be more so because of his type of job.</p>

<p>If this comments made you think people should atleast know about for preparation, then please do stick below as like</p>

As you pointed out, there&#39;s no way to verify that you tie all loose ends with the information obtained from him though torture... A more effective way of dealing with the situation would be to make it very clear that if anything gets released, his children will die very painful deaths.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Assange doesn&#39;t give a fuck whether he gets tortured and probably setup a system with some redundancy... But it&#39;s a bit harder to stick to your conviction if psychos tell you they&#39;ll torture your young kids for a few days until they die if you don&#39;t disable any dead man&#39;s switch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like this theory, but a few questions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to stop the switch, you capture the man and blackmail the Wikileaks team with his release after the election / at a later date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if the dead man switch <em>can&#39;t</em> be stopped? Isn&#39;t that a hallmark of a good dead man&#39;s switch? That it can&#39;t be interfered or tampered with?</p>

<p>It could work like this: Assange has to ping a service with his credentials every day at a certain time. His credentials would be known only by himself, and his passphrase would be sufficiently random that remembering it (and subsequently giving it up during torture) would be impossible. Even if Assange&#39;s team was blackmailed with his release, there&#39;d be literally nothing they could do about it.</p>

<p>The only way to interfere with the dead man switch in that place would be to force or coerce (&quot;those are some lovely kids you have there...&quot;) Assange to log in every day to prevent the switch from triggering - but if he couldn&#39;t remember the passphrase offhand, how could he do that?</p>

<p>And would his passphrase be stored in such a manner that it couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t be found by any party lifting him from the embassy? IE, say it&#39;s written on a post it note, and Assange knows the doors of the embassy have been breached - he could just hold a lighter up to the note and destroy it, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if there&#39;s no PoPo at the Embassy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I saw another comment in this thread stating that there hasn&#39;t been a police presence there in quite a while, due to the notion that it was expensive to maintain and not useful (if Assange walked out of the Embassy, a police presence wouldn&#39;t matter as there&#39;s a number of other parties present who&#39;d pick him up).</p>

<p>Still kinda on the fence how I feel about all this, but my gut is leaning 80/20 that Assange is no longer at the embassy. Whether that means he&#39;s dead or alive, <em>that</em> I&#39;m firmly (50/50) on the fence about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. No follow up on the heavily armed police there late last week either.  Will have another search and see what I can find.</p>

<p>Edit: There aren&#39;t a lot of articles on it.  That was the 21st, Friday. Net was cut on the 17th, Monday.  </p>

<p>My gut says they did the raid and took him down; with the original plan stating it was due to the &#39;bahamas&#39; allegations that reddit undid.  Due to their undoing, they perhaps felt committed and went ahead anyway?</p>

<p>Either way, they can&#39;t admit they took him or he&#39;s dead: that confirms everything.<br/>
Their best bet is to keep a lid on it. Putting up the videos of people coming by to interview him is a smoke cover. We need to keep digging.</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t any of his colleagues coming forward?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, when you have enemies like the United States of America, you setup insurance policies that are comprehensive. There isn&#39;t one deadman switch. There&#39;s many.</p>

<p>Assange isn&#39;t and can&#39;t be the sole operator of the switch. There are redundancy systems in place. Assange operates one. Some other group of individuals controls the others. Whether or not their switches are on the same key, who can say? The man isn&#39;t stupid. If he doesn&#39;t make contact within a certain window of time, the other holders won&#39;t renew their timers. Those timers, however, are likely substantially longer than the one Assange himself controlled, due to the risk of severed contact. Although it&#39;s reasonably possible those would be &#39;arming&#39; switches that he would want an override system for.</p>

<p>If I were Assange I would have put switches (plural) I controlled into sets. Anything on a 1-2 days you control electronically. Anything on a 30 day you control through a third party, like a lawyer. Anything beyond that and the holder of the key doesn&#39;t know they have it, like a remailing service with instructions on where to find the key that are valid if Assange doesn&#39;t give a signal to relocate it.</p>

<p>The man has a tremendous amount of time to contemplate paranoia and revenge. I am relatively certain that he anticipated the risk of being captured and tortured. The obvious way to get them to stop is to give up a switch.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s the real question: If Assange is dead, were the people who killed him stupid enough to believe he&#39;d really let them get away with it?</p>

<p>They were for everyone that&#39;s downloaded his dead man switch file to check that code, somehow, against the current versions of the file circulating. If they don&#39;t match, it&#39;s not the same file he released years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A dead man&#39;s switch is usually triggered after they have not logged in to deactivate it within a month, but these intervals can be customized, like pre-commitment messages, weekly, or monthly, or even quarterly.</p>

<p>In other words, if the wide reaching Internet black out was not used to execute some high end NSA hacking technique after they detected the services or applications he was using as a deadman&#39;s switch, then we could expect a full disclosure of all encryption keys to automatically be emailed to SOME people, or send out forum thread like on 4chan etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult to predict where and how, given Assange&#39;s prowess for programming and hacking, but rest assured his dead man&#39;s switch will likely be triggered IF the NSA and MI6 did not disable it somehow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is any &#39;mechanism&#39; set up to do something if you are unable to constantly deactivate it.</p>

<p>A bank robber might have one that is a bomb strapped to his chest with an activator in his hand that goes off if he stops squeezing it together.m there the payload is, it would take out any cops or hostages in addition to the thief.</p>

<p>In Terminator 2, Dyson held a brick above a switch, so when he died, it fell on the switch and blew up the building.</p>

<p>Relevant to Assange, it would be any set of mechanisms that are constantly armed and disarmed before an electronic payload would go off.  At its greatest over simplification, he has an app on his computer that if he doesn&#39;t daily hit the &#39;not dead&#39; button, it emails out the codes to several people after a certain time.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to expect he has several sets of switches, each setup by different people, each disarmed differently, each with different activation times.  There might even be a few people with envelopes too.
No one can know.<br/>
I do think his friend and mentor dying of cancer was probably a suicide to make sure his switches would go unknown.</p>

<p>The guy has a bunch of children somewhere in Australia. Their identity is unknown to the general public, but that&#39;s obviously not something that would still be a mystery to American intelligence.</p>

<p>If they decided to take Assange, it&#39;s entirely likely that they did so because they had the means of ensuring there wouldn&#39;t be any sort of dead man&#39;s switch releasing a data dump. I don&#39;t think they could get that assurance by torturing Assange... but it&#39;s an entirely different story if they make it clear to him that if any sort of data dump gets released they&#39;ll pull his kids&#39; fingernails one by one...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is the most likely scenario:</p>

<p>Those in power (HRC and supporters) finally got sick of Assange, due to their recent publications, and decided something had to be done immediately.</p>

<p>John Kerry, as a representative of those in power in the US, threatened Ecuador and promised consequences if they did not hand over Assange immediately. Ecuador capitulated, because they realized HRC would win the election (which is completely rigged, btw).</p>

<p>The primary goal of HRC&#39;s power base is to silence Assange. At a minimum, they want him and Wikileaks out of the way until the election, or forever. However, it would be very suspicious if Assange and Wikileaks just disappeared forever. So, their best case scenario would be to capture Assange alive, and torture him until he becomes compliant, and then use him as a mouthpiece to put out videos that they approve. They would also want to take full control of Wikileaks and keep them publishing, but their new approved stories would slowly drift away from actual theories and more into crackpot and unreliability.</p>

<p>At this point, either Assange has been killed, or he has been extradited to a US government facility.</p>

<p>Wikileaks, at this point, is likely compromised. They have been working at this for years, killing two lawyers and a director. The suicide was probably a murder, as they threw him off a building. And the other two were apparently cancer, but how hard can it be to mess with their treatment plans and medication, to cause it to become ineffective? Plus, using that method instead of direct murder makes their deaths seem much more plausible. After all, you can&#39;t have everyone at Wikileaks suddenly committing suicide, that is not believable at all. Murdering people for government ends is not about instant results, it is about long term planning for believability.</p>

<p>They do not have a uranium enrichment program, and if they <em>did</em> have any nukes they haven&#39;t tested any since the whole world and your average community college scientist would be able to detect it.</p>

<p>So Hillary says she&#39;s against the TPP now. But we don&#39;t believe her.
Trump used to love open trade now. But he doesn&#39;t anymore. Why would you believe him and not her? The reality is they both fucking love open trade because it makes them both a fuckload of money.</p>

<p>The marriages are relevant because of the perception that he is a sexist, versus a feminist. It was a set up that he would never be able to combat and the media played him like a fiddle.</p>

<p>No he isn&#39;t. Sorry. The only people who think the polls are biased are people who don&#39;t understand the polls, and people who aren&#39;t cognizant enough to realize they picked someone who won&#39;t win.</p>

Assange is in custody. They won&#39;t announce this until A. After the election. Or B. Unless someone storms the embassy.</p>

<p>There is just way way too much inconsistencies between these events:
Wikileaks even said: Assange is alive. Yet provided no conclusive proof. As if the 30-100 people visiting the ecuadorian embassy daily couldn&#39;t snap a photo. Sheesh.</p>

<p>Assange is likely arrested. Sorry if I am wrong. I simply like to break the news early. (you know me).</p>

<p>Ironically this is about the same feeling of opposition we all got from stating that Fukushima was full meltdown. Even reddit is blacklisting Julian articles... CTR (When every that replaced shill lmao). </p>

<p>You want to know what the tweet means do you...
We have updated the Stochastic Terminator algorithm...
Marco - Polo
It is a message to assange. From Wikileaks HQ.
The tweet he sent from the embassy was the Raid wagon arriving.
Stochastic=Random Terminator =End algorithm=Program Launguage.
Wikileaks To Assange do you Copy?
Assange&gt;!&gt;&quot;&quot;

If you do not dis-activate. The random End will execute itself. Good luck Godspeed. The end is near.

WikiLeaks on Twitter: &quot;We have updated the Stochastic Terminator algorithim.&quot;</p>

<p>What does that mean. A TG. Exclusive look into the last week of wikileaks…</p>

<p>It started five days ago.</p>

<p>We all felt it.</p>

<p>The last podesto batch began to spark off now naming and stepping into wallstreet executives. You don&#39;t endanger the market. That is a no no in the world of politics. Hence Hillary&#39;s comment:but I suppose you can judge for yourself on WikiLeaks in the next few days.
(Article) [link to <a href="http://www.vox.com">http://www.vox.com</a></p>

<p>This was the start of it 5 days ago….</p>

<p>After the last release it was likely decided Julian was now to be detained. (For distributing Classified documents). As they will later tell you…</p>

<p>HRC likely sent out a plea to the Obama admin to Shut Him Down. (Likely dirt on them both).</p>

<p>He knew it would be soon so 5 days ago Wikileaks Formed a &quot;contingency plan&quot;.)From article). [link to <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com">http://www.zerohedge.com</a></p>

<p>This is the same 5 days ago that wikileaks announced that they would be using the Random End Algorithm. To distribute the Future batches of information…</p>

<p>Then yesterday morning:
Ecuador finally conceded. Hence, The Internet Cut.
(likely the code / forgotten letters). INTER RIP HELP</p>

<p>This was 5 days ago, that this all started.</p>

<p>Assange attempted to gain another connection. Satellite was an option… It wouldn&#39;t matter though, because dismorning the raid van landed. (Likely equipped with a jammer).
[link to twitter.com (secure)]
PHOTO: Heavily armed &#39;police&#39; appear outside Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Julian Assange has political asylum (photo, Tuesday morning)</p>

<p>What happened next was a major Major DDOS Attack.</p>

<p>Likely a response by anonymous. (They don&#39;t strike for shits and giggles). They knew before we did. Believe it!…
Why else make the move?</p>

<p>So Now we see that there was a contingency plan.
We can see ecuador Evicting him.
London moving in…</p>

<p>Then Silence?!?</p>

<p>So what did the recent tweet from wikileaks mean?</p>

<p>We have updated the Stochastic Terminator algorithm…</p>

<p>This is nothing more that a high stakes Marco – Polo game…

<p>The tweet he sent from the embassy was the Raid wagon arriving. (only way to get that pic was to be there as a witness. (so wikileaks couldn&#39;t post it from their position. How did it get uploaded… (Assange).
Keep reading:</p>

<p>Stochastic=Random
Terminator =End
algorithm=Program Launguage.</p>

<p>So message sent was: Wikileaks To Assange do you Copy? Assange&gt;!&gt;&quot;??????????????????? Hello???
After no response:
(Assange may be compromised, No internet connect).</p>

<p>(We have updated the Deadman Code). I repeat marco…?</p>

<p>Remember that Marco:
If you do not call back: &quot;POLO&quot; I.e. dis-activate.</p>

<p>&quot;The random End&quot; will execute itself.</p>

<p>Good luck Godspeed.</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>So in short:
There was a raid van outside a notorious hackers home earlier dis-morning. Leading to one of the largest cyber attacks in US history. Notably, the circumstances were all reported by MSM. Attack and Van outside the embassy… Hmmm</p>

<p>Now We know that:
The contingency planning involved the Algorithm.
We know that there was The Raid Van outside the Hospice.</p>

<p>Now
The we know about the updates to said algorithm.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to scare people it is simply the most practical outcome.</p>

<p>Who else would wikileaks be tipping this &quot;coding&quot; update too?
Not like they meant to say, Oh ya, All you cops and intelligence operators. We just wanted to inform you that the code is being modified. For your ease…</p>

<p>No no I am quite certain there is only one person that tweet was meant for!!!</p>

<p>The same person that is MIA, since earlier today; Leading up to now What Appears is Both scary and obvious.
Essentially. What mr Assange does is scary.
All I&#39;ve done is place myself into his shoes and ask myself:</p>

<p>Why would wikileaks tell the whole world about an attack code update?</p>

<p>Then I realized that fractional truth…</p>

<p>Wikileaks could tell every person on the planet this information. No one would know what it meant…</p>

<p>Accept assange of course…</p>

<p>So If only one person in the world knows indeed what that code is.
Who did they write it too… Well that one person…</p>

<p>Assange of course.</p>

<p>Thus why did they write it???</p>

<p>Pretty simple:
Because they want to know he is ok….
And if he is not ok.</p>

<p>You see. I am not scaring you.</p>

<p>Its what we all know wikileaks is capable of that scares you.</p>

<p>Because we all know now exactly who that message was for now…</p>

<p>and what it means in its simplest form describable…</p>

<p>Marco… I can&#39;t find you.
MARCO???</p>

<p>Ive been wrong before, But I am pretty certain that is what is going down.</p>

<p>Just hoping I am 100% wrong.</p>

<p>You heard it here from me first kids…
Sorry
I really may be reading into this too much.</p>

<p>With the limited information at hand, This is a situation I felt was worth reporting on based on the current facts on hand.</p>

<p>Hope I am just wrong and he is a shy person.</p>

<p>Something didn&#39;t feel write, and this was the bulk of my synopsis for the night. Take it with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>However I really could be on to something.</p>

<p>I think maybe Julian has officially been detained.</p>

<p>Which would ultimately be a sad day for truth, liberty, and justice. Let alone humanity itself.</p>

<p>That is a working theory again.
Based on the limited information that came to light today.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure thy nabbed him though. Fits the narrative all too well. My biggest concern is that on Monday someone tried to storm the embassy, and was caught by security (2 am), then on tuesday all shit hit the fan. (I wonder if he is alive?)

<p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, please. JA&#39;s internet was cut on Sunday (16th). The purported GTMO Express incident occurred around noon GMT on Monday (17th). RageAgenda&#39;s report of a raid at the Embassy (17th) was later, at 7:20 pm GMT. The Fox news predictions that he was going to be arrested were on Tuesday (18th). The London airport closure was Friday (21st).</p>

<p>The raid was conducted after the supposed Guantanamo flight? If he was renditioned to the US on Monday, of what relevance would the Tuesday Fox predictions be? And why the Friday airport closure if he was already out of the country?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve been following all of this happening in real time and to be honest, I&#39;m starting to lose track of the sequence of events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>great post. thank you. </p>

<p>let&#39;s try to work backwards:</p>

<p>Who has the most to gain from a dns blackout? So far, I have heard about it originating from:</p>

<p>• A U.S. AFB (working with State Dept.)</p>

<p>• Devices hooked up to the &#39;internet of things&#39;</p>

<p>• The group Anonymous</p>

<p>As for what do they have to gain, each one has many reasons.</p>

<p>All I DO know, is that most stage performers rely on the use of DRAMATIC smokescreens and a few sparks, to AWE (and distract) the audience as they set-up a new trick, or make a flashy exit!</p>

<p>Who has the most to gain from a dns blackout?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Top of my list of potential perpetrators is the DHS. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been following the story but over the last year or so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeh_Johnson">Jeh Johnson</a> has been increasing efforts to get cyber security to come under a DHS purview. They&#39;ve been promoting themselves quite strongly in this arena.</p>

<p>Since the DNC hack and the shenanigans with reds under the bed 2.0 they&#39;ve played off the narrative in what seems like quite a successful attempt to gain access to more networks and systems. Resulting in these findings from them</p>

<p><a href="http://fortune.com/2016/10/01/hackers-targeted-election-systems/">http://fortune.com/2016/10/01/hackers-targeted-election-systems/</a></p>

<p>Since then in particular they&#39;ve been ramping up things by offering their services on a State by State basis to secure networks with voter registration databases and voting machines.</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/technology/293522-two-swing-states-decline-dhs-security-for-voting-machines">http://thehill.com/policy/technology/293522-two-swing-states-decline-dhs-security-for-voting-machines</a></p>

<p>As the attack was happening they were tasked with the investigation but since then it looks like the FBI has attempted to muscle in with a parallel investigation.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage/">https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/21/many-sites-including-twitter-and-spotify-suffering-outage/</a></p>

<p>So for motive I&#39;d go with their primary objective is that of voter fraud with the benefits of increased budget, purview, and powers under a friendly Clinton regime. The attack itself may not have been for a utilitarian purpose moreover used as escalating event to  facilitate an internal power grab for cyber security. </p>

<p>The interesting thing for me will be after the election in examining cases possible voting irregularities. You could then cross reference those states that accepted DHS protection and monitoring and have a good shot at proving electoral fraud.  </p>

<p>This is one line of enquiry. I tend to be as thorough as I can be with things. I&#39;m sorry haven&#39;t touched on Mirai yet but there are some good reasons to believe that given the scale of this attack that vector might not be viable. I&#39;ll try and follow up later on but I really do need to get to sleep. Laters.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/unfilter/">Unfilter</a> has been following this story of DHS&#39;s expansion in this area for quite a while now there&#39;s a lot of video clips and other links. With a bit of googlefu you&#39;ll be able to find the relevant shows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read something on here the other night, that I never considered, being that he&#39;s fine and just trying to draw attention to WL for something major. It reminded me of this random YouTuber that everyone went crazy for a few days thinking she was in danger, kidnapped, or that even ISIS had her. People were dissecting her videos, tweets, etc much like people thought the WL tweets were trying to spell out messages I seen posted on here. Her channel skyrockets then it&#39;s found out she&#39;s fine. I hope this is the same thing happening but I really think he&#39;s already been nabbed or dead by now unfortunately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. Heard the same theory, and it seems plausible. </p>

<p>I dont really follow MSM nowadays, so no idea how much is being reported on, but if wikileaks manages to get the media to cover it, and make a livestream of Assange finally saying &quot;something something is now viewable on wikileaks&quot;. Maybe it wasnt planned since the beginning, but maybe wikileaks decided to go with it after they cut off assanges internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen that theory and I don&#39;t see how it makes any sense at all. </p>

<p>There is already a ton of attention on wikileaks. This is an incredibly distracting discussion (though unlike many others, I do find it to be necessary and relevant), especially considering the questions it raises.</p>

<p>All of that for &#39;attention&#39; that they already have? I don&#39;t buy it. </p>

40 Minutes ago the mods @ R/Wikileaks. (Here4popcorn) Said. </p>

<p>Hey guys we patched the mod problem. Restored permissions. Everything is hunky dorey...
Welp:
I posted the full synopsis of Julian Assanges Arrest there. 
That lead to the thread immediately being deleted.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to know what is going on it is simple.
I am going to say that Julian Assange is in captive arrest, for special judicial prosecution. (Tampering with an election).
While these mods, CTR agents, and All of reddits PR team call me a conspiracy theorist.
Even though I have all this data: Assange is in Jail in America via Special Circumstance: Assange has been extradited to the USA via guantanamo-express <a href="http://yournewswire.com/julian-assange-extradited-guantanamo-express/">http://yournewswire.com/julian-assange-extradited-guantanamo-express/</a> Read my last posts for timeline. Essentially Fox News did break this story Watch how they are scrambling to remove footage as seen below: <a href="http://magafeed.com/breaking-fox-news-just-reported-that-julian-assange-will-be-arrested-in-a-matter-of-hours/">http://magafeed.com/breaking-fox-news-just-reported-that-julian-assange-will-be-arrested-in-a-matter-of-hours/</a> Video Is still up here. FOX SAYS ARRESTED IN HOURS: <a href="http://ibankcoin.com/flyblog/2016/10/18/fox-assange-to-be-arrested-within-the-next-few-hours/">http://ibankcoin.com/flyblog/2016/10/18/fox-assange-to-be-arrested-within-the-next-few-hours/</a> All Periscope Live feeds were removed in the area: A user apparently witnessed the Raid: <a href="http://archive.is/NlrlT">http://archive.is/NlrlT</a> Airport shut down (within a few moments after said raid: <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/london-airport-declared-safe-chemical-incident-161021181211522.html">http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/london-airport-declared-safe-chemical-incident-161021181211522.html</a> tl/Dr Assange is in custody. They won&#39;t announce this until A. After the election. Or B. Unless someone storms the embassy. There is just way way too much inconsistencies between these events: Wikileaks even said: Assange is alive. Yet provided no conclusive proof. As if the 30-100 people visiting the ecuadorian embassy daily couldn&#39;t snap a photo. Sheesh. Assange is likely arrested. Sorry if I am wrong. I simply like to break the news early. (you know me). Ironically this is about the same feeling of opposition we all got from stating that Fukushima was full meltdown. Even reddit is blacklisting Julian articles... CTR (When every that replaced shill lmao). You want to know what the tweet means do you... We have updated the Stochastic Terminator algorithm... Marco - Polo It is a message to assange. From Wikileaks HQ. The tweet he sent from the embassy was the Raid wagon arriving. Stochastic=Random Terminator =End algorithm=Program Launguage. Wikileaks To Assange do you Copy? Assange&gt;!&gt;&quot;&quot; (Assange may be compromised, No internet connect). (We have updated the Deadman Code). If you do not dis-activate. The random End will execute itself. Good luck Godspeed. The end is near. Wikileaks Over; OCTOBER 22, 2016 AT 2:10 AM LOG IN TO REPLY WikiLeaks on Twitter: &quot;We have updated the Stochastic Terminator algorithim.&quot; What does that mean. A TG. Exclusive look into the last week of wikileaks… It started five days ago. We all felt it. The last podesto batch began to spark off now naming and stepping into wallstreet executives. You don&#39;t endanger the market. That is a no no in the world of politics. Hence Hillary&#39;s comment:but I suppose you can judge for yourself on WikiLeaks in the next few days. (Article) [link to <a href="http://www.vox.com">http://www.vox.com</a> This was the start of it 5 days ago…. After the last release it was likely decided Julian was now to be detained. (For distributing Classified documents). As they will later tell you… HRC likely sent out a plea to the Obama admin to Shut Him Down. (Likely dirt on them both). He knew it would be soon so 5 days ago Wikileaks Formed a &quot;contingency plan&quot;.)From article). [link to <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com">http://www.zerohedge.com</a> This is the same 5 days ago that wikileaks announced that they would be using the Random End Algorithm. To distribute the Future batches of information… Then yesterday morning: Ecuador finally conceded. Hence, The Internet Cut. (likely the code / forgotten letters). INTER RIP HELP This was 5 days ago, that this all started. Assange attempted to gain another connection. Satellite was an option… It wouldn&#39;t matter though, because dismorning the raid van landed. (Likely equipped with a jammer). [link to twitter.com (secure)] PHOTO: Heavily armed &#39;police&#39; appear outside Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Julian Assange has political asylum (photo, Tuesday morning) What happened next was a major Major DDOS Attack. Likely a response by anonymous. (They don&#39;t strike for shits and giggles). They knew before we did. Believe it!… Why else make the move? So Now we see that there was a contingency plan. We can see ecuador Evicting him. London moving in… Then Silence?!? So what did the recent tweet from wikileaks mean? We have updated the Stochastic Terminator algorithm… This is nothing more that a high stakes Marco – Polo game… Keep reading I will prove it! It is a message to assange. From Wikileaks HQ. The tweet he sent from the embassy was the Raid wagon arriving. (only way to get that pic was to be there as a witness. (so wikileaks couldn&#39;t post it from their position. How did it get uploaded… (Assange). Keep reading: Stochastic=Random Terminator =End algorithm=Program Launguage. So message sent was: Wikileaks To Assange do you Copy? Assange&gt;!&gt;&quot;??????????????????? Hello??? After no response: (Assange may be compromised, No internet connect). (We have updated the Deadman Code). I repeat marco…? Remember that Marco: If you do not call back: &quot;POLO&quot; I.e. dis-activate. &quot;The random End&quot; will execute itself. Good luck Godspeed. &quot;Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.&quot; So in short: There was a raid van outside a notorious hackers home earlier dis-morning. Leading to one of the largest cyber attacks in US history. Notably, the circumstances were all reported by MSM. Attack and Van outside the embassy… Hmmm Now We know that: The contingency planning involved the Algorithm. We know that there was The Raid Van outside the Hospice. Now The we know about the updates to said algorithm. This isn&#39;t to scare people it is simply the most practical outcome. Who else would wikileaks be tipping this &quot;coding&quot; update too? Not like they meant to say, Oh ya, All you cops and intelligence operators. We just wanted to inform you that the code is being modified. For your ease… No no I am quite certain there is only one person that tweet was meant for!!! The same person that is MIA, since earlier today; Leading up to now What Appears is Both scary and obvious. Essentially. What mr Assange does is scary. All I&#39;ve done is place myself into his shoes and ask myself: Why would wikileaks tell the whole world about an attack code update? Then I realized that fractional truth… Wikileaks could tell every person on the planet this information. No one would know what it meant… Accept assange of course… So If only one person in the world knows indeed what that code is. Who did they write it too… Well that one person… Assange of course. Thus why did they write it??? Pretty simple: Because they want to know he is ok…. And if he is not ok. You see. I am not scaring you. Its what we all know wikileaks is capable of that scares you. Because we all know now exactly who that message was for now… and what it means in its simplest form describable… Marco… I can&#39;t find you. MARCO??? Ive been wrong before, But I am pretty certain that is what is going down. Just hoping I am 100% wrong. You heard it here from me first kids… Sorry I really may be reading into this too much. With the limited information at hand, This is a situation I felt was worth reporting on based on the current facts on hand. Hope I am just wrong and he is a shy person. Something didn&#39;t feel write, and this was the bulk of my synopsis for the night. Take it with a grain of salt. However I really could be on to something. I think maybe Julian has officially been detained. Which would ultimately be a sad day for truth, liberty, and justice. Let alone humanity itself. That is a working theory again. Based on the limited information that came to light today.
SO LETS TALK FACTS REDDIT&gt;
THERE ARE OVER 150 Cellphones within the Ecuadorian at any given time. There are no calling restrictions being reported.
So: Why can&#39;t wikileaks take the 15 (SECONDS). It would take to simply text assange. Have him send a picture and upload it...
Why didn&#39;t Julian respond since FRIDAY which would take 3 seconds.
Why hasn&#39;t Julians Cat updated its profile.
Do you really think that it is a coincidence that half the wikileaks staff are dead. Assange is missing, and cant say anything until the election is over...
No. Tomorrow my guess is Kim.Com Unleashes the mega dump, that he mentioned Will be coming. However as for assange.
This is the same thing they did in Benghazi. Same crew, same tactics.
MSM IS SHIT&gt; ALL THE SHILLS / MODS OBVIOUSLY PROVED HE IS FUCKING GONE&gt; HENCE THEIR PRESENCE&gt; AND IF YOU HAVENT FIGURED IT OUT YET. REREAD THIS UNTIL YOU HAVE.
ASSANGE IS AWOL. GONE. DEAD OR IN JAIL.
THAT IS THE ONLY rational truth.
NOW DNC is trying to vilify Russian interests, without a shred of proof to derail the very validly of all THE DNC&#39;s CRIMES.</p>

<p>Links for proof. </p>

<p>The mods are likely feds, monitoring the users and leaks. 
This is a fucking coverup, and the mods were shifted there last week. </p>

<p>This thread was supposed to unsure they are &quot;Back&quot; but honestly bright red truck. You are Controlled Opposition, doing crowd control. It is now painfully obvious. </p>

<p>We should just keep blasting this message on every assange and wikileaks post, and Make everyone see that they are hiding it. </p>

<p>No joke Check my posting history. All comments deleted. Thread deleted lmao. </p>

<p>Wow. Assange is compromised. End of story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wikileaks itself could be fine and still releasing leaks on a timer.  But if many people have been killed and Assange himself captured or killed then its possible that the US Government and the others linked to them have found the secret to the Dead Drop Key, gained control of the wikileaks Twitter and decided now to make a move with so much on the line this election.</p>

<p>If wikileaks twitter continues to assert Assange is alive and well, despite evidence pointing to the opposite, then taking over the Twitter is a chance for them to smear the leaks themselves by having the wikileaks Twitter play into media narrative now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks hasn&#39;t been credible in years. There was a huge break-in into the entire Anonymous/Wikileaks &quot;community&quot; in 2011 and all the information the hackers there possessed was seized by the government thanks to a con man. Basically the govt now had (and still has) knowledge of all the Wikileaks data, passwords, crypts, servers, etc., so anything that comes from these mainstream sources can be as corrupt as it can be authentic. </p>

<p>Another thing everyone should keep in mind is that a skilled hacker doesn&#39;t get caught. If they claim to be a man of the people with their face exposed and media covering them, then chances are they&#39;re either so absolutely accomplished of a sneak that they&#39;re absolutely sure of their safety, OR (most likely) converted into a puppet in exchange for their life. Or they&#39;ve been stool pigeons to begin with. </p>

<p>My take is that if Assange was uncorrupted, they&#39;ve either captured him or he&#39;s escaped and laying low, and if he&#39;s a pawn, then this is just a scam to bring attention to the following WL articles (which are probably going to have lots of misinformation and the masses are gonna buy it because of all the drama).</p>

<p>As for your question, I think it&#39;s quite the opposite - it gives Wikileaks more credibility, since people go, &quot;Oh wow, he&#39;s so dangerous to the system that he has to go into hiding/is captured/is dead?&quot; and they pay more attention to what Wikileaks posts. And it worked, since Clinton lost miserably (woohoo). </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t throw pebbles at his window. You could be charged with vandalism of the Ecuadorean embassy and get yourself in some serious shit. Not to mention you might scare the poop out of Assange. The man has the United States government after him after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America as a democracy is finished. What we are seeing, what is being revealed through the very act and mechanism of deception, is the consolidation of a security and defense establishmentarian militarist/fascist state. It might be strategically essential for the empire known as the U.S. to destroy the Syrian and Iranian states, then effectively declare war on Russia and later China, by attempting to collapse their leadership and impose U.S. vassals in their stead, but, as such ventures are potentially existentially risky and predicated on the preservation and extension of something not acknowledged to exist–American empire–they are almost impossibly difficult to implement in a genuine democratic manner. Hence, the duopoly unites against its own nation’s democracy and the democratic truth ostensibly owed to its populace, and prefigures an election that never was, or only was in show, so that it may then efficiently and at full speed proceed to deliver the coup de grace to the remaining nationalist secular regimes in the Middle East (relics of a non-neoliberal era) and then forthwith to the juridical and extra-juridical assault on the Russian leadership class. Upon completing this, the tremor of such a hypothetical success would in itself cause the Chinese regime to quake, if not outright tumble, in any case, it would be an isolated regime, its position orders of magnitude more precarious than before, indeed, likely mortally stricken by the Russian example. This, while Europe waits, in anticipation of its follower’s fate (for its bureau-class cannot seriously be termed leaders).</p>

<p>I never made this comment, but I had it saved, and given your EDIT I think it&#39;s relevant.</p>

<p>You are on the same path I&#39;m on. A big turn of events is the Pam Anderson visit, but check this out. I&#39;ve been putting together a Wikileaks/Assange timeline since 2006, it seems like Assange may have been compromised as soon as October 2nd:</p>

<hr/>

<p>Curious, what was Assange&#39;s most recent &quot;proof of life&quot;? Was it this live stream around October 4th:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/wikileaks-october-surprise-julian-assange-229083">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/wikileaks-october-surprise-julian-assange-229083</a></p>

<p>The first red flag I think was when Wikileaks canceled an October 2nd announcement due to &quot;security concerns&quot; where Assange was going to make a statement from the balcony regarding Hillary Clinton. He did not make that statement. Did the warning from John Kerry arrive at this time? Was he cut off at this time and not weeks later like we were made to believe?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/04/wikileaks-to-publish-presidential-election-docs-every-week-for-next-10-weeks.html">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/04/wikileaks-to-publish-presidential-election-docs-every-week-for-next-10-weeks.html</a></p>

<p>Might be worthwhile to back-fill your timeline to October 2nd or a little before that. This one from October 7th seems important:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/10/12/the-mother-of-all-october-surprises-whoever-released-donald-trumps-2005-video-is-this-elections-real-star/">http://www.salon.com/2016/10/12/the-mother-of-all-october-surprises-whoever-released-donald-trumps-2005-video-is-this-elections-real-star/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Less than an hour earlier, the Obama administration preempted Assange’s limelight by undercutting his website’s credibility. Around 3:45 p.m., the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a joint statement formally declaring that the Russian government was responsible for the email thefts from political organizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like they branded Assange a traitor, officially. Does that give the Obama administration authority to detain him even from the Embassy at this point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, yes it does seem the last proof of life is a lot further back than people realise. Of course he could have been plodding along happily for quite a while after this, but I thought it would be interesting to know a definitive date.</p>

<p>Since my update, however, I was surprised to see that the ageing fashion designer, Vivienne Westwood (who has know Assange for a long time) has claimed she visited Assange on Friday 14 October. Pamela Anderson was meant to come with her, but our favourite Baywatch star &quot;got the day wrong&quot; and she visited Assange alone the next day.</p>

This looks more and more fucked up. If you try to follow the thread, you just make circles. It is quite plausible that assange is a shill like a fellow redditor posted on the other thread. The fact is that lately the emails were causing real damage to Clinton.  </p>

<p>If they decided it is enough, it still doesn&#39;t make sense as wikileaks is still going on with PODESTA mails. Although they ARE acting weird. They can be stalling until the election is over to not give further fuel to trump with an assange assasination confirmed.... </p>

<p>If Trump isn&#39;t a plant himself...</p>

<p>Another thing that I don&#39;t understand  - does he have a mobile ? If so than surely he can access internet with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how that worked out either (read my comments). </p>

<p>I think this is b.s. to stop the hype. </p>

<p>So far we have micheal moore (who was there weeks ago). Pam anderson?!? (Internet hackers are in love with her. I.e. First major nudes for iirc). </p>

<p>Want to know a really screwed up connection to this:
<a href="https://twitter.com/EmbassyCat/status/732273970381197312">https://twitter.com/EmbassyCat/status/732273970381197312</a></p>

<p>In the GCHQ papers that were obviously left here on purpose. 
The papers state. (Bait him out). </p>

<p>Was pamela anderson a distraction tool and bait to locate his presence within the embassy?</p>

<p>The raid followed within 48hours of her visit. Purportedly from a fed ex truck. (according to <a href="/u/rageagenda">/u/rageagenda</a>). (Who is likely a journalist) Being he A. Travels internationally alot, and B. Mentioned a D-notice which I&#39;d never heard of, but essentially is a non disclosure agreement. (seems weird a citizen would state that). </p>

<p>Regardless in the papers it also mentions that they should do a knock on the door, asking for a signature, then cuff him. </p>

<p>It also shows them eagerly trying to blame him on a rubber, that didn&#39;t even have a dna sample. (meaning the case was cold). </p>

<p>I think he put those papers online to leave a clue. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The phone call is a fake. Julian Assange wasn&#39;t even on the planning 2 days ago and there were no posters of him participating to the conference before Oct 25. Who pops up on a poster of a conference and gets tweets about is participation just 1 day before the event and only when he is supposed to provide a proof of life?</p>

<p>Just have a look at this archived copy of the Google cache of the event schedule as published on an event marketing site (not the direct website of the organizers). It&#39;s dated Oct. 21 and Julian Assange was not on the program at this time. He&#39;s still not on this program in the non-cached version. Why? because this site is an event marketing site. They are not the direct organizers. They usually get the program a few weeks in advance and market the event. They didn&#39;t change the event schedule when it was abruptly changed on Oct. 25 (1 day before Julian&#39;s phone call) because the organizers forgot to communicate them the changes.</p>

<p>But the website of the event&#39;s organizers was changed on Oct. 25 and was re-saved in google cache at that time. Just when the tweets about Julian&#39;s participation at the event started to appear online. There are no such tweets on Julian participating at that conference with before Oct. 25. Julian Assange is also not on the official speaker&#39;s list (archived version here) of the conference.</p>

<p>That&#39;s no coincidence, people. That&#39;s a basic cover-up operation.</p>

<p>Thus, I believe that this phone intervention was a diversion, like the poll on the Wikileaks Twitter account was a diversion. If you add to that an unprecedented amount of tweets drowning Twitter with an embedded 4-year old video of Julian making a speech from the embassy&#39;s balcony to prove he&#39;s fine, or a a flood of tweets with a video of Michael Moore saying he &#39;just got out of the embassy where he spent a few hours with Julian&#39; but which is from June 2016 and which was originally tweeted by the Wikileaks Twitter account, and if one also adds to that the weird tweets from Wikileaks on their account, and also the fact that the people in control of the twitter account didn&#39;t provide any PGP-signed short text to prove they are Wikileaks (which takes 30 seconds to do), one can only come to the conclusion that all this together is proof that Julian Assange has been either captured or killed.
They are only trying to gain some time until the election is over.</p>

<p>I keep getting the same feedback which means an official PR company is giving a &quot;narrative&quot;. </p>

<p>The tweets are really telling, as I recalled when fukushima daichii went into full meltdown the twitter was full of &quot;radiation Banana&quot; propaganda. (They use theses services to brain wash people). </p>

<p>The real telling part is the fact On OCT 18th. Fox news Announced Assanges imminent arrest. (In my comments). 
While /U/Rageagenda said he witnessed the raid live. </p>

<p>(Ironically I checked into him, and being his taste for international travel, I assume that he is a journalist). Especially because he Mentions the D-Notice, Which Is far to intimate a statement to make from a &quot;Citizen&#39;s Perspective&quot;. </p>

<p>Another interesting fact is that John kerry went to the ecuadorian embassy on the 16th, and London on right after...
(Obvious is as obvious does). </p>

<p>Note an airport was shut down. *Which they did when moving snowden. Only bird in the air was the gitmo express. Flight 379, Prison transit. </p>

<p>So We have a witness to an arrest. Confirmation by msm, and No absolute contact. Followed By two Unscheduled batch releases, and WIKILEAKS itself playing the &quot;buying time game&quot;. </p>

<p>Quite unsetteling and we should all assume that assange will be MIA until the election is over. </p>

<p>Note also that embassy cat&#39;s letters, show GCHQ&#39;s 2012 comments, on how they should bait assange out. (Interesting pamela anderson visited, (Every 50yr old hackers dream girl), and She happens to be 1.7million in debt. (So she is purchasable). 
Note there was never a mention of an existing relationship of friends between them. (So is she the bait)? Cause they shut off his lights the next day... *Maybe she was sent in to scope the rooms, and assess the security and obstacles in the perimeter...?</p>

<p>Furthermore in those same papers, (On embassycats profile). The GCHQ goes on to say &quot;We should knock on the door and have him sign a package&quot;, Then slap on the cuffs when he answers. 
To which the next comments in the tree say. We shouldn&#39;t use the embassy vehicles.</p>

<p>Ironically to follow that /U/rageagenda actually said they used fed ex trucks. As well as having shut down the whole grid. It would be interesting to see if anyone can find the power grid and check for an outage on the 18th. That would be all the proof we need. So if that is in your skillset. Get on it. </p>

<p>Also note, embassy cat hasn&#39;t updated since the 15th.</p>

Posting a photo of Assange with voice is easy and proves nothing.  Grasping at straws is not evidence.

<p>What would be easy would be proving some part of Assange&#39;s speech yesterday had been heard before. So far nobody has bothered to do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you propose they faked his speech?</p>

<p>(TL;DR: &quot;HE&#39;S OK, FOLKS!&quot;) </p>

<p>To me, his late appearance on the programme is exactly consistent with his sudden need to provide relevant evidence of his safety. </p>

<p>Given his options are currently limited, I believe Julian would have sought this kind of event to give credibility to his proof of life claim. </p>

<p>I would suggest he leveraged this opportunity off his grievances with Ecuador regarding his internet (more on that next), and based on his profile - hence the technological nature of the opportune conference.</p>

<p>Remembering his internet access has been withdrawn, Skype or any other available video telecommunication is, unfortunately, impossible for the moment. </p>

<p>A phone link at an official conference is a pretty good effort in the circumstances, wouldn&#39;t you grant him? </p>

<p>Not to mention his clear and (IMO) deliberate signaling of proof of life, with chronologically current references throughout - including reference to, and elucidation of, the &quot;Stochastic Terminator&quot; tweet. </p>

<p>Perhaps, perhaps, his speech was limited in some way with regard to content. However, he did not seem to be withheld in any way of making explicit mention of the supposed architect of his sanctions, HRC. To me this is conjecture. </p>

<p>In light of all this, and still remembering that Assange without internet may as yet be unaware of all this concern, this amounts to very solid evidence of Assange&#39;s current health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re over hyping this deliberately, in line with an undisclosed interest, or if you&#39;re just concerned. </p>

<p>I want to allay your fears and assure you that, although Julian has been &quot;contained&quot;, temporarily, to a degree - he has not been murdered. </p>

<p>And the conference certainly is amateurish and poorly executed for having such a star guest speaker having been scheduled so far in advance.</p>

<p>Not sure how to explain it, but the body language of the hosts makes them seem oddly unimpressed and unconvincing.

    <div class="md"><p>I took (spastic) notes from what JA said at the teleconference (I know there is software for faking it, but let&#39;s go with it&#39;s him for this reading):</p>

<p>We created the stochastic terminator algorithm that adjusts how much and when to release.
It selects which emails to be published, based on what it reads in the news.
We began using it 7th oct.
This whipped up a crazed hornet’s nest atmosphere in HRC camp and in her backing estbshments.</p>

<p>She has pulled around her the intel agcys, neocons, weapons mfrs, banks, investment co’s (like GS) most of the middle class, most of the media, so now we have all these estblments trying to defend HRC from being exposed as having many corrupt relationships.</p>

<p>They started attacking WL servers with DDOS attacks etc, also filed fake docs in UN and british courts to acuse JA of being a Russian spy and pedo/molester</p>

<p>You can look up that story how the hoax was made at UN&amp;UK courts by front co in US in Texas &quot;Todd and Clare&quot;.</p>

<p>But that wasn’t enough so pressure increased, they started to press Ecuador, (some of Ec oppo parties sympathetic,) and statements made to eEcuador at political and intel level that I be stopped or else consequences for Ec.</p>

<p>But WL is a global publisher w/1M docs/yr, we pub from france, germ, norway, holl, other european countries, most of lawyers and staff in US , don’t publish from ecuador, servers cheaper in europe than ecuador.</p>

<p>So the US govt in form of Kerry, &amp; HRC campaign, kept putting forth propaganda that the corruptions and scandals revealed was “interference” in US electoral process
<strong>but this not interference in political process, this is the definition of political process</strong>. It is the media’s job to publish truth and opinion about what is occurring. <strong>There cannot be free and informed election unless people are free to inform.</strong></p>

<p>So you basically have the obama admin taking control of parts of govt and using it to try to shut down critical true info published by WL, being read by american population.</p>

<p>From ecuadorean POV, while I disagree that they didn’t give any notice about what was occurring--I did not lie how it was done-- I am very sympathetic as to the ecuadorean concerns.</p>

<p>Ec like most states that are not empires has a policy of non-intervention in the interior processes, including elections, of other states.
Now it makes perfect strategic sense why small states should have such a policy, to do otherwise would mean larger states would use it as excuse to intervene in their elections.</p>

<p>So here we have a dilemma: on the one hand WL is a publisher, but not publishing from Ec, with the duty to publish everything that is true about a very important election that is occurring right now in the US. OTOH, the big tv networks--except fox--are controlled by clinton supporters and US intel estbmt which is also aligned to HRC, stating that publishing is interference—which is false—but a claim being made very loudly in the US. And this claim, though false, could be used to legitimize interfering in Ecuador’s election next year. Of course we actually publish from germ, fr, holland, etc., US has not tried to apply pressure to those countries. I am a symbol and that symbol is being protected by state of Ec—they think they can go after the symbol and try to bully the state bc it is a small state in SA.</p>

<p><strong>So we end up with a strategic position by Ec that the internet to emb will be shut off until after election so that ec cannot be misinterpreted as interfering in US elections.</strong> I don’t agree with it but i understand it</p>

<p>Ec has been strong in many other ways, giving asylum in the first place, and continuing to resist quite strong pressure from uk us and sweden to cast me out to the streets.</p>

<p>I just compare what the govt position is: about half the oppo party going into Ec elections is that they protect my asylum, other half have made campaign commitment to hand me over despite former UN finding that I am being illegally detained by UK.
But WL is a —you can ask what kind of dog is a company or org and WL is one of the fighting dogs that has a lot of energy and runs around fighting all the time. When my internet was cut off we had long ago made contingency plans for precisely this situation—we enjoy this kind of situation, there was not even a one day pause even though i was cut off from my team. ok so we’re up to date on the story, any Qs?</p>

<p>(Q inaudible)
A: as i said, it has long been our analysis that HRC will win as she has all establishments on her side. if Trump managed to get up to 48% -50%level on polling, then immediately the big media networks and funders get together and smash him back down, no chance he’ll win, [that would prob be bad inside US good outside.&lt;--ETA:I missed a bunch of this bit]  we will keep publishing. Most media very strong alignment with HRC--first reason:Most media owned by banks (they like her), also class reason: most journos  are middle class, and trump represents white trash to them. Supporting him looks like supporting trash, means to rivals in their class that they too are white trash. Lowers social status, lot of conformity and fear about criticising HRC, reduces impact of even very significant material released.</p>

<p>Latin America impact: first time in US history that we can see power structure going into election. Will shift understanding that everytone has to deal with and excesses easier to contain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the transcript. Let me offer some advocacy, from the devil!</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually, the Wikileaks Twitter asked their &quot;own supporters&quot; to stop the DDOS. They did not ask HRC&#39;s team to stop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We created the stochastic terminator algorithm that adjusts how much and when to release.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay maybe that&#39;s true, or maybe this is a coverup for the dead man&#39;s switch being triggered and the &quot;stochastic terminator&quot; is another way of saying &quot;dead man switch&quot;.</p>

<p>Which could suggest the entire teleconference by Assange was recorded before the actual conference, during an FBI/CIA interview and then played back at the conference to tell a fixed story and cover up any potential release of a dead man switch or encryption key.</p>

<p>If the conference wasn&#39;t ever announced by him or his supporters (which it wasn&#39;t) then who could possibly obtain knowledge of it? FBI/CIA interrogating him, that&#39;s who. Had he been absent from the conference, it might have raised red flags for the hosts of the conference. So it would seem in their best interest to find out what his schedule is and preempt any chance of exposing his missing status. In this case I actually think this teleconference by Assange was supposed to fly under our radar, merely to satisfy the hosts of the conference who would be none the wiser that Assange had been coopted by intelligence, but someone dug it up.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/59pa2b/was_4chans_ophotpockets_which_aimed_to_bring/">Was 4Chan&#39;s #OpHotPockets, which aimed to bring Julian Assange hotspot wifi access, unsuccessful?</a></p>

<p>If Hillary/Kerry can shut down Assange for interfering with elections, wouldn&#39;t you say they are just as guilty? I think they should have their internets cut off :)</p>

<p>If Assange was cut off due to meddling with elections, why did they let him hold a conference call and talk about election rigging, Hillary hacking Wikileaks, etc etc?</p>

Ecuador really didn&#39;t want him to influence US elections, they must have allowed that phone call on the basis that it&#39;s a free software conference in Argentina.</p>

<p>The latest news off the website, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/-News-.html">https://wikileaks.org/-News-.html</a>, is a post from yesterday offering a reward for some Jeremy Corbyn info.  Is this consistent with typical wikileaks releases?  A quick search of that page shows only 2 examples of rewards being offered going back to 2011.  I would say that it&#39;s an unusual kind of post.</p>

<p>The twitter seems to be sketchy, but has the political narrative changed?  This seems unclear.  </p>

<p>If he&#39;s been silenced one might expect a narrative change in terms of the content produced.  There&#39;s certainly been a lot more spelling errors. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not being touted as current by WikiLeaks. It&#39;s odd that they posted it now but they often retweet/tweet content like this. They didn&#39;t try to claim it was current/new.</p>

<p>They removed 24/7 police protection last year (12th Oct 2015). <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/12/julian-assange-police-removed-from-outside-ecuadorian-embassy">Source1</a>, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/met-withdraws-247-police-watch-for-julian-assange-at-ecuadorian-embassy-a6690866.html">Source2</a>, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/police-stop-24-7-monitoring-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-ecuadorian-embassy-1523634">Source3</a>.</p>

<p>It could had been made for the purpose of having us focus on a puppet without seeing the big picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If JA was taken from the embassy, would it be possible to silence this news?  What would that take?  It is even plausible?</p>

<p>To do this, imo, they&#39;d have to have total control of the embassy&#39;s information flow.  Operations at the embassy would be unusual as the employees would be controlled.  Communications with family members who were outside of the embassy would be different.  News would leak, I would think.   It <em>wouldn&#39;t leak</em> if control of information flow was sufficient to control the routing of particular types of info - ie. scrub all assange-y, or ecuador-y data of concern from the lines.  </p>

And you&#39;d have to evacuate everyone from the nearest airport so that your emergency vehicles would go unnoticed (it was)(fake chemical leak - someone sprayed some form of gas). My hunch is they shut off the internet to the embassy at the time of surprise entry/capture when JA was likely unawares (toilet/shower) and they would have known this because Pamela Anderson likely secreted a surveillance device into JA&#39;s quarters when she visited him. Pamela Anderson: government agent. Wonder how much she got paid. [Everything I just said is my hunch. Not based on personal knowledge.]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard an audio recording that was posted on the same day that news broke about his internet being cut.  The woman who answered the phone sounded terrified when she stated that she couldn&#39;t talk about Julian, whether he was in the Embassy, or alive.  You can&#39;t hide that sound, and only a great actress could create that intentionally.  She was terrified.  Later, a second recording was added to the website, and a jovial man&#39;s voice stated in a cheerful, (very strangely cheerful, TOO cheerful) manner that &quot;Hey no big deal, nothing wrong, all is well, not to worry&quot;.  I was struck by the drastic difference in tone and content of those two recordings.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;d hope we have video confirmation of him being alive and well within the next 24 hours. I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re dragging their feet on the matter. In my opinion, it detracts from the leaks themselves when we&#39;re all worried/wondering if Assange is even alive. </p>

<p>I note he spoke to a different faculty? at same uni on I think the same topic in June, so could this today just be a recording, though the poster on the link above suggests he was there by invitation so one would think live...but my Spanish isn&#39;t so good...</p>

<p>EDIT: The video is no longer live, just a recording I think he starts around 1:47:00 and nope sounds like he was live</p>

<p>EDIT2: Nope seems like the real deal - Julian is fine. Ends around 3:08.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched the whole thing, this would be very hard to fake, its definitley his voice and the way he speaks with his &quot;umms&quot; and everything. I&#39;m going to bet 99% that its him.</p>

<p>he says in the audio that its the first time he speaks to anyone outside of the embassy since his communications were cut, he says he understands why the embassy did it even though he really doesn&#39;t like the way they did it.</p>

<p>He also does a question &amp; answers bit which is clearly live. so he&#39;s difinitley ok... well... unless he called from the CIA facility in the US with a gun to his head, but I doubt it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps all the conversation was designed to lead people to this conclusion, but the tone and content of the interview leads me to believe that option 1 is the most likely. Here is a guy who&#39;s extraordinary situation became even more extraordinary now that his Internet has been cut off. Ecuador under pressure throws a bone to the US/UK without compromising the terms of asylum -- is Internet a basic human right? The method of communication is therefore logical, and the content seems to support that it is genuinely him speaking: championing the site and its design, highlighting the success of his searchable email database more so than the content of any particular email. Consider the extremely poor job other channels have done in the attempt to imitate: plenty of examples in the comments.</p>

<p>If you are convinced of the authenticity of the speaker, the location is perhaps more doubtful. I think there is a high probability that the phone call came from the Ecuador embassy. Other possibilities would be that he is making the call on the run (extremely doubtful the call would come from a new safe location), or the call came from wherever he is being held under duress. </p>

<p>They do do that these days ya know. </p>

<p>Its very suspicious that he can&#39;t text a picture to wikileaks for a 1-second verification (its only been a week). Since the net  and power cut. (along with witnesses seeing a raid), and you know millions of people began looking for him. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t necessarily worth crying over. Yet this is in no way factual evidence that he is in fact speaking today live. </p>

<p>I doubt that they would run a live telephone call. </p>

<p>It was far more likely prerecorded...</p>

<p>It just appears live, when they repeat their monologue...</p>

<p>IMO He very well could be alive. </p>

<p>Yet this is a conspiracy forum. So a dodgy video made in Argentina with shit audio and reception, are far from actual proof of any living condition on his behalf. It would be different if it wasn&#39;t assange. 
 (or the circumstances weren&#39;t so heavily suspicious).</p>

<p>He can call Argentina but not wikileaks? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Youtube video is supposedly live. A live phone call therefore makes sense. He has no internet, perhaps only a land line, therefore no pictures. I wonder what the phone plan looks like in an ecuadorian embassy in the UK...I suspect the international calling plan is somewhat limited.</p>

<p>He tweeted that contingency plans were activated, and he is under no obligation to provide anything just because conspiracy theorists wish he would. Obviously none of this is proof, I am simply expressing my belief based on the limited facts at hand. </p>

<p>I suspect his contingency plans are simple and effective. I suspect his dead man switch takes longer to activate than the end of the election when he supposedly gets back his internet. I suspect his dead man switch is why he is allowed to have the internet in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is waiting on events. I agree the fact that he has yet to acknowledge, let alone allay people&#39;s concerns about his wellbeing is very odd.</p>

<p>To me, the caller at the CISL conference sounded like Assange, but I&#39;m by no means certain. He was speaking in a strangely stilted way, but this could be because he was addressing a Spanish speaking audience. Most people&#39;s voices change when addressing people who are not native speakers.</p>

<p>I think from what we can observe (or not observe) is that he is no longer at the Ecuadorian Embassy. There are a number of possibilities as to where he might be, some very bad, but it&#39;s not hopeless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that this episode raises more questions than it answers. The Craig Murray and John Pilger attestations that Assange is well also add another level of complexity, because I believe both of these men to be reliable. </p>

<p>Another user put forward a very cogent scenario which could explain what is actually happening. Now referenced in my self-post comments above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have to assess that the algorithm is running to dump files out ahead of schedule at this time. These batches were initially supposed to be on a &quot;weekly Schedule&quot;. This isn&#39;t hypothetical it is a direct quote from Julian Assange Pre 10/16
(Wikileaks stated that they will release batches &quot;weekly&quot;)</p>

<p>Yet since the 18th. We have seen batches 18 - 22. 4 releases in 1 week. 
Something is up, and there is still not one shred of tangible evidence to directly provide a &quot;VERIFIED&quot; source of Julian Assanges freedom at this time.  </p>

<p>Not to mention all content mentioning the arrest, and potential for his disappearance SUCH AS THIS VERY THREAD, are being downplayed and attacked by users with irrelevant data, and negative / collusion. </p>

<p>I wonder if he is simply under arrest, or if he was actually injured in the raid. (Note his best friend and attorney passed in the same week as all these releases). 
It would be practical to suggest that JA, was attacked on the Evening of Oct 17th, and his body could have been extracted on the 18th. </p>

<p>There is more evidence to something going on at this time so users should keep digging, now and even harder!. </p>

<p>IMO ASSANGE IS STILL MIA, And NOW IS FEARED DEAD AT THIS TIME. 
Don&#39;t like to read that. Prove me wrong-</p>

<p>I am not saying this is the relevant reality. I am merely stating this is the most relevant reality. (Hence this very topic descending in rank). With likely over half a million views now, and no tangible evidence other than easily fabricated, and poor sourced non verified information. The reality is unveiling itself, which is to say. 
JA, is still MIA at this time. MAKE NO MISTAKE IN THAT...</p>

<p>Pam Anderson visits him and casually mentions <strong>torture</strong>.</p>

<p>From a vegan sandwich? Come on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Bill Clinton authorized extraordinary rendition to nations known to practice torture, called torture by proxy. The administration of President George W. Bush renditioned hundreds of so-called illegal combatants for torture by proxy, and to US controlled sites for an extensive torture and interrogation program under the euphemism enhanced interrogation. Extraordinary rendition continued with reduced frequency in the Obama administration: instead of subjecting them to torture, most of those abducted have been conventionally interrogated and subsequently taken to the US for trial.</p>

<p>In July 2014 the European Court of Human Rights condemned the government of Poland for participating in CIA extraordinary rendition, ordering Poland to pay restitution to men who had been abducted, taken to a CIA black site in Poland, and tortured.</p>

<p>Following the 11 September 2001 attacks the United States, in particular the CIA, has been accused of rendering hundreds of people suspected by the government of being terrorists—or of aiding and abetting terrorist organizations—to third-party states such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Uzbekistan. Such &quot;ghost detainees&quot; are kept outside judicial oversight, often without ever entering US territory, and may or may not ultimately be transferred to the custody of the United States. According to the former CIA case officer Bob Baer, &quot;If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria. If you want someone to disappear—never to see them again—you send them to Egypt.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s dead because they don&#39;t want to deal with the backlash nor do they want to make him a martyr. Killing him or kidnapping him right now at such a critical time would add validity to the claims they&#39;re trying so desperately to ignore. It would cause people to take a long hard look into the leaks and the circumstances. The last thing they want to do is draw unnecessary attention to themselves.</p>

<p>Nobody knows, but I&#39;d be very surprised if Assange isn&#39;t extraordinarily rendered and holed up in some gulag, or dead. So the question going forward is, who runs Wikileaks now? It seems someone other than Wikileaks runs the Twitter account. But perhaps not the web site. Is there a core group of insiders who do? Or is it compromised as well? And if it&#39;s not compromised, who will run Wikileaks now? </p>

<p>I am confused, is Assange still alive or well, in play, is Wikileaks compromised with the leaks running on autopilot for now, but why have the leaks came out delayed?</p>

<p>Have the US gov. got Assange and broken Wikileaks and now use their scapegoat, Russia?</p>

<p>For me, Assange does appear to have left the game, and yes WikiLeaks is most likely compromised. However, that doesn&#39;t mean everything WikiLeaks posts is fake - that&#39;s why poisoning the well is so effective - it is very hard to know what to believe. </p>

<p>Russia is not the enemy, and only the truly clueless will believe the establishment&#39;s lies that Putin either wants, or will try to rig the election. The establishment is going to do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP (<a href="/u/Sabremesh">/u/Sabremesh</a>) There is one more option that I have mentioned elsewhere, but no one wants to talk about (possibly because it may be unflattering to JA/WL).</p>

<p>It is possible that a four-way deal was reached  between JA/Kerry/Ecuador/UK-FCO. 
Before I speculate on what the deal might be, let me assert that my sympathies are altogether with JA - in his position, I would do the same.</p>

<p>The Deal (speculative):
1. JA voluntarily gave himself up into the custody of US/UK authorities.
2. JA/WL agreed to redact the most explosive of the Podesta emails from the remaining batches. In fact, the batch-by-batch release was designed to force the Clinton side to the table- after all both sides knew what was in the remaining releases. The rest of the emails will continue to be released (after redaction) so as not to arouse any suspicion.
(3) Post 11/8, all charges against JA will be dropped, and he will be free man
(4) Possibly include the freedom of Chelsea Manning in this deal.</p>

<p>Support for this theory:
(1) Release of the File Hashes - the files themselves containing legal docs enforcing the deal.
(2) Strange behaviour of the current WL Twitter account operator
(3) Reluctance of WL team and associates to provide proof-of-life evidence, which is very easy to do if JA was still at the embassy.
(4) The strange reference to the Stochastic Terminator algorithm - first in the Tweet, and then today in the Argentine conference. The explanation of the algo as providing a &quot;release schedule&quot; of the Podesta emails from &quot;human inputs&quot; and &quot;news headline scanning&quot; is a HUGE red-herring. Why such a convoluted strategy to determine when to release what emails? What does it gain?
---my own theory is that the &quot;stochastic algo&quot; is nothing but choosing batches such that there is increasingly damning info in each batch- at some time forcing the Clinton camp onto the negotiating table. The &quot;modification&quot; of the &quot;algo&quot; just implies that the emails from then on will go thru a redaction process.
-alternative the &quot;stochastic terminator&quot; may refer to changes in the JA&#39;s Dead-Man-Switch, so that it is no longer operated by him, and has been handed over to some else - necessitated by the Deal. 
(5) The &quot;phone&quot; appearance today at the Argentine Conf.
(6) [Edit] JA&#39;s own assertion that he will like to &quot;surrender&quot; to US auths in exchange for Chelsea Manning&#39;s freedom</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, that&#39;s good! </p>

<p>Well, I am already convinced Assange is no longer in the Ecuadorian Embassy. The CISL conference demonstrated he is both alive and not in custody (in the normal sense at least). Your theory certainly provides an explanation as to how these three things might be possible.</p>

<p>Also agree that the deal would need to involve Ecuador, UK, US (and possibly even Sweden?)</p>

<p>Also, I agree that Assange is entitled to his freedom, and buying it by &quot;trading in&quot; his nuke-level docs is a logical path for him to take (albeit disappointing).</p>

<p>How do you think they persuaded Assange to give up the dead man&#39;s switch, and how do you think they can be sure he&#39;s really passed on responsibility for it to somebody else?</p>

<p>Too obvious when he wasn&#39;t even a guest panel member. 
Could it be a rare booking: Yes. </p>

<p>Still leaves far more an impression that there is a gag order. 
(Even in light of this dropping down cue). </p>

<p>Imo Assange is CIA property now. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this should be unstickied with the election now just eight days away, and with the WITCH HRC, trying anything in her power outside of Murder to hide her corruption. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even feel comfortable associating the reality that I see in public forum - It is easy to unravel when you take it all into context-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read numerous topics and subreddit comments on here about this subject and while I am no expert in such matters and do not want to cause confusion to what is already a troubling series of developments regarding a man I highly respect; I would like to share a perceptive that may or may not have been previous considered here. </p>

<p>While tossed out as &quot;conspiracy&quot; tales because the actual &quot;shooter&quot; remains (in large part) unknown, the historical evidence concerning the development of financial powers behind the US Government can be traced to the years leading up to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Factually, it is now well known that had President Kennedy lived he was likely to be re-elected given that is popularity rate at the time he died was over 60% and his opponent would have been Barry Goldwater. As such, upon being reelected he closets advisers and trusted Military individuals knew that beginning in spring of 1964 second term Kennedy was going to move forward with withdrawing all American forces from Vietnam and two, because he had earned the deep respect of Soviet Leader Khrushchev, both men had already reached a deal (then secret) to reduce nuclear arms and eventually cease all development in a yet determined time. These two dramatic shifts in American policy meant a financial loss to numerous of international conglomerate in an amounts that today would be in the Trillions, not billions. So, something had to be done and done it was. Following 1965, these same financial interests have continued to play ever deepening and growing vast array roles within the US government. </p>

<p>Jumping forward quite sometime to the years just post-9/11, a rift began to develop between military branches and intelligence agencies within the United States government. The developing schism began to take significant shape after 2008 when President Obama turned from advisers such as General Paetrus to more &quot;dovish&quot; advisers in the military. In doing and in prep to 2012 election Obama began US troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan against the advise of most, if not all, of his Joint Chiefs. Troop withdrawal was good for elections in US but cause a whole shit storm in the Iraq and Afghanistan which in turn led to the Intelligence agencies to between asserting significant more control over military operations in both the region and on the Islamic Terrorist front.  This in turn forced various military branches (primarily USAFSOC) but also USAF, US Marines, US Navy and US Army to take mission and targeting orders from NSA and CIA among other intelligence divisions within. </p>

<p>Concurrently with the above-developments, the US began a slow steady withdrawal from unconditional support for Israeli. While never openly walking away from Israel, US policy began to move toward seeking resolution to the Isreali / Arab conflict through a possible two state solution. US mid-east policy become more complicated with the outbreak of conflict in Syria whose rebels - in the earliest stages - were being funded by Saudi Arabia with the US playing a more backseat role with armaments and assistance making every effort to not put American forces on the ground in the conflict. Another significant development was Iran&#39;s increase nuclear capabilities and its efforts to enrich uranium which was moving along a fast clip that US intelligence understood, but this speed was never overlooked by the Israeli mossad. The final piece to the puzzle comes as the Russian bear began asserting its influence in Syria which along with Assad means nothing to Russia financially or strategically (it does maintain a naval base though which is the excuse it gave to intervene for the Mossad government). With that said, Syria does provide Russia with the opportunity to show its former Baltic states that the Bear is taking on the Eagle toe-to-toe - i.e. Russia is back to being a super power. </p>

<p>Russia needs these Baltic states to be impressed with its new military and world stage authority since Russia has been quietly working for almost a decade to create a &quot;Baltic Union&quot; along the lines of the EU with Russia being the go to big daddy for protection. In exchage, Russia will reap Trillions in gas sales to Europe which already obtains 70% of all gas consumed from Russia and former Baltic states. A significant portion of the gas flows through of all obvious places - the Ukraine.</p>

<p>Last piece here is what arose in 2008-09 when the thieving whore Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State regarding Iran/Israel and US. In summer 2008, Isreal advised POTUS that it was planning a military strike against Iran to take out its nuclear enrichment program and as a treaty partner is damn well expected POTUS to get in on the fun. POTUS said no. Isreal said - ok we will nuke then in January 2009. POTUS said - give me a minute. That is when HRC &amp; Gang came up with the Iran Nuclear deal - first as pre-negotiations and later as full negotiations. Of course Isreal was not at the table, but they were guaranteed that the final plan would ensure that Iran would not restart Uranium enrichment.  Yea, well that did not happen and Israel was pissed and remains very pissed at Obama but ---- especially HRC --- who is sees as a future threat. </p>

<p>The rift in the US government from military withdraw combined with the perceived (likely real) threat HRC &amp; Gang pose to several military branches, industrial institutions and Israel appears to have now become an all out war being played before out eyes in the media. </p>

<p>Note - I am not saying and would never say that Assange or Wikileaks was tool or had any connection whatsoever to any US government happenings, internal conflicts etc. He is truly a freedom loving brilliant man with incredible high standards and unshakable ethics. But I fear he may be caught in a very precarious situation - at least until such time as post-election. </p>

<p>With regard to his safety and health, my gut tells me that he is too valuable and too dangerous to eliminate. My gut is also inclined to believe that he has not been removed from the embassy which has too much risk of exposure. So, my gut tells me that he is under protection (not torture), disconnecting the internet was for his safety following the Ecuadorian government lead that some type of operation may be underway. Also, my gut tells me that Assange is not alone in the embassy but has some type of protection. </p>

<p>That is just my two cents and like every persons with asshole I have an opinion as well. All fucking speculation, but based upon some factual and historical context.</p>

<p>Rip it, shit it, love it, squeeze it or fuck it - Thats it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he is dead.</p>

<p>I think he was originally controlled opposition, and was permitted to remain alive for as long as he served that role, but that with the threatened release of information about John Kerry in particular, he became intolerable to them.  I think he actually started taking what was initially supposed to be a disinformation role seriously; in other words, he tried to move away from the proverbial Dark Side.</p>

<p>I think Snowden is a Goldstein as well.  Such individuals are either actively protected or tolerated for as long as they are willing to do as they are told, but if they switch sides they will be killed.  Assange really angered and scared them too, I think; so I don&#39;t like to think about what has probably been done to him.  He probably wouldn&#39;t be permitted to die for a while.</p>

<p><a href="http://umet.edu.ar/evento/conferencia-internacional-de-software-libre/">http://umet.edu.ar/evento/conferencia-internacional-de-software-libre/</a></p>

<p>Assange did discuss Ecuador cutting him off from the net, he discussed the stochastic terminator thingy, he didn&#39;t &#39;sound&#39; under duress, though I can&#39;t say I&#39;d know, but it all sounded legit to me.</p>

<p>Only odd things to me were:</p>

<ul>
<li>they seemed to lose connection with him at the beginning after his intro</li>
<li>I didn&#39;t really get how he jumped from the topic he was on to the stochastic terminator algorithm thing</li>
<li>He pushed twice that he believes and has always believed that Hilary will win despite the leaks</li>
<li>The white trash analogy with Trump, although I get it seemed a bit tactless</li>
<li>I can no longer access the video because it&#39;s not available in my region anymore</li>
</ul>

<p>That all said I think these things didn&#39;t cause enough doubt in my mind, I think now that he is ok in the Embassy but without Internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a real way. This could all be pre recorded. (even addressing the circumstances). (as the terminator was announced on the 16th). </p>

<p>Also he was allegedly taken the 18th. 
This could have been a telephone pre interview. (again I haven&#39;t watched it). 
Do they question him live, or is it a speech. (Meaning no one in the room actually makes full verbal contact with him). </p>

<p>If they didn&#39;t speak with him directly. Then I can&#39;t technically consider it evidence, admissible yes. Conclusive, far from it. </p>

<p>Just saying the stakes are quite high, so If there is no direct communication then I would agree it is a red flag. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to say... I truly think the matter is too important too say it is proof. (There are both voice impersonators and potential for pre recorded audio). There is no mention he was on the panel. 
Strange for a celebrity guest speaker, and I did go as far as researching that. </p>

<p>IMO Life and death, I wouldn&#39;t bet my life this is actual evidence. 
Truly it makes me even more suspicious that he can call / text. Yet completely fails to text wikileaks a pic of himself. (With millions of fans). You would think it is a little important.</p>

<p>(8 hours apart). It would be extremely easy to take &quot;audio&quot; and layer it imo. (being I do it myself to make my own youtube videos) </p>

<p>Next would be to double check to make sure it isn&#39;t recycled audio, or &quot;premade&quot; I.e. For the conference. </p>

<p>Questionable source is &quot;not&quot; confirmation he is alive and well. 
Imo 
Questionable source only - Leads to further questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clair voyance on the subject shows me a vision of a group eating well and drinking fine wines. There is a facade being played in the vision it is clear they are in a nice society type establishment where money is not an object. Assange is part of the society as a high ranking member. </p>

<p>Continuing the vision, Assange raises a glass and cheers the meeting which is made primarily of military looking personal well built with short hair cuts. It is in a high society like room they are meeting. The deal is of europeans of which it appears are french and british exclusively. The rooms walls, doors, window frames and ceiling are white with a burgundy carpet and dark rich wooden furnitures. There is a back garden or court yard in the premises.</p>

<p>Later in the vision he was upstairs looking over a road enjoying a joint with a shorter fat asian looking gentleman. They are discussing yachts and planes and he has to move inside because the general is concerned of someone seeing.</p>

<p>Forward to the end of the vision, a lot of walking around and moving boxes which are labelled using a barcode handheld device. The rooms have a thick carpet which makes the doors move slowly, assange is with good company and laughing as the asian reels of twitter stories. They are using a notary service in this vision and the notary is stamping official documents. </p>

<p>There is no pain or torture in the vision, this is what i read from first meditation. Make of it what you will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Update.
While I&#39;m still very concerned about Assange, I got a promising update I want to share. A friend of mine is a very important politician in my country, and he was in touch with Assange since 2009. He told me he couldn&#39;t reach Julian by phone, but he could talk with another Wikileaks editor he knows. The man assured him Assange is &quot;having an hard time&quot; but he&#39;s alive and well.
This is what he could know. Hope it&#39;s true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Kerry is not a legitimate carrier of the Forbes name. His mothers maiden name was Forbes, His and his fathers name is Kerry. The Forbes name originated over a thousand years ago. An Irish man named Occonicher was sent to Scotland to police the picts, a primitive scattered group of unorganized tribes that occupied Scotland at the time. The entire northeast quarter of Scotland was uninhabitable because of a vicious bear that occupied the land there. The legend goes, Occonicher was in love with a woman named Bess who lived in a castle across the way and she had been frightened by this bear, to prove his love for Bess, Occonicher set out to hunt and kill this bear. After his success the land became habitable for settlement and it was said that Occonicher slew the bear &quot;for Bess&quot;. Hence the name for-bes and is still pronounced in some villages in Scotland near Aberdeenshire &quot;For-bes&quot; .the Forbes family crest commemorates this ancient legend with a bear in the shield and some versions with three bears in the shield. For a period in ancient times this 1/4 of Scotland was named Forbesland. This is found in maps from the 6th and 7th century. We Forbes&#39; do not lend our name to john Kerry who uses it to build his prestige. the Forbes wing on naushon island &quot;Forbes island&quot; are considered buy the rest of us to be the thievs of clan Forbes. They are not welcome at the clan chiefs castle seat near the village of Insch in Scotland</p>

<p>I upvoted you, but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> wants <strong>Proof</strong> right now, not Probabilities, even though &#39;Proof&#39; has always been something rare around here (by Definition). Furthermore, casting Doubt on or debunking the Theory will only get you downvoted. Finally, better not attempt to establish any known Facts that support your Theory either, (<a href="http://imgur.com/a/sQ76C">especially with actual Links</a>), for Example, like the October 18th (Day his InterNet was nicked) FaceBook Post advertising the October 26th &quot;<em>Video</em>Conference&quot; with Assange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one seems straight up obvious to me. Not long ago, Assange offered to serve time in the USA prison system, if Manning was granted a pardon/clemency. I&#39;m not of the opinion that Assange is altruistic, and think he would try to give a final raspberry to the US government, in that, I believe he&#39;s terminally ill, and serving time in the USA wouldn&#39;t last. I suspect the current absence is that he is either incapacitated due to a terminal illness, or is deceased, for the same reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, that&#39;s good! </p>

<p>Well, I am already convinced Assange is no longer in the Ecuadorian Embassy. The CISL conference demonstrated he is both alive and not in custody (in the normal sense at least). Your theory certainly provides an explanation as to how these three things might be possible.</p>

<p>Also agree that the deal would need to involve Ecuador, UK, US (and possibly even Sweden?)</p>

<p>Also, I agree that Assange is entitled to his freedom, and buying it by &quot;trading in&quot; his nuke-level docs is a logical path for him to take (albeit disappointing).</p>

<p>How do you think they persuaded Assange to give up the dead man&#39;s switch, and how do you think they can be sure he&#39;s really passed on responsibility for it to somebody else?</p>
