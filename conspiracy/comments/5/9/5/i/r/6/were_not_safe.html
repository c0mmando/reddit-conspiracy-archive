<p>Many major subs exist just so when something happens, their &#39;top content&#39; will be pulled to the front in the illusion that it&#39;s really meant to do there and all those &#39;unfavorable&#39; stories, or stories they&#39;re being paid/compelled to suppress get deleted, hidden, or straight up smothered with artificial downvotes.</p>

<p>Reddit isn&#39;t a safe way to communicate, nor are encrypted means, since now it autoflags you as a terrorist pos. the &#39;NWO&#39;, &#39;Illuminati&#39; &#39;Shadow gov&#39; &#39;Fuck faces, whatever you call them, they&#39;re winning, and if we don&#39;t figure something out soon, it Will be Too Late. </p>

<p>No trust me. They are losing.  You can&#39;t measure their win/lose by reddit as the yardstick. You have to get the word on the street.  The word on the street is they&#39;ve lost all creditbility and they are supefucked they just don&#39;t even know it.  THey have no idea. NO IDEA how FUCKED THEY ARE...how super DUPER fucked they are.  No idea.  NO IDEA!!!!!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right. I have seen a bit of a sea change on Facebook, with even a few very liberal women saying it&#39;s getting tough to support her. It&#39;s more along the lines of regretting that they didn&#39;t vote for Sanders, but I&#39;m seeing now that even if she wins, she&#39;s lost a vast majority of the country. </p>

<p>But they&#39;re going to steal it for her, no doubt. What comes after that, though....who knows? Maybe the Civil War II that they want so bad isn&#39;t going to be white vs. black but left vs. right. Or maybe not. Like I said: no idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry Ian, about my little freak out.  I&#39;m in full tilt mania mode.  I&#39;m literally charlie sheen on charlie sheen right now.  I&#39;m worried about assange, but i&#39;m combing through these podesta emails and there&#39;s enough here to declare this thing 10x bigger than watergate.  </p>

<p>They are in SO much trouble.  These people here aren&#39;t even real (I mean you are because I know you).  I&#39;ve spent a year marking people as [F] and none of these guys &#39;light up&#39; my board so that&#39;s how I know we&#39;ve been brigaded here.  1/2 the people are &#39;real&#39; but seeking refuge from MSM, the other 1/2 are hillbots, which, we can&#39;t even say &#39;hillbot&#39; any more.  We have to call them &#39;security state bots&#39; because it&#39;s clear Obama is in on this too, ole&#39; barry soetoro <a href="mailto:boback@ameritech.com">boback@ameritech.com</a> or whatever secret muslim holographic illusional demon he happens to be today...he&#39;s in this also, OMG he&#39;s so F&#39;d</p>

<p>They are going to try to spin this like &quot;russia was running wikileaks all along&quot;.  &quot;Russia created all these podesta emails&quot;.  &quot;Russia has been running a successful information campaign all along&quot;, &quot;russia is so much better than we are at everything and that&#39;s why they were able to create these deep and believable illusions while we did nothing for 8 yrs but masturbate while high fiving&quot;</p>

<p>Regarding civil war: they have every opportunity to arrest the bastards right now, have a moratorium on the election; have an interim government with the next highest as a temp president; or just give congress the temporary command of the executive (both legis and exec)...this is basically a parliamentary system as a temp measure until we can redo elections.  Or just give it to Trump by default.  Or a Trump, Stein, Sanders runoff a month later in dec 8 or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound exhilarated. But Congress, I&#39;m sure, is implicated in much of this. Who is going to make the arrests? Is it going to be some kind of &quot;shock &amp; awe&quot; overnight raid? Is there some affiliated team of &quot;White Hats&quot; that&#39;s going to pull this off? Are they some kind of subset of the Freemasons, or some other secret society? </p>

<p>The corruption seems so profound, so deep, so intricately intertwined, I don&#39;t see WHO manages to pull off any kind of countermaneuver. The only way I really see this happening is if there&#39;s some kind of mass awakening and people shut down the economy, refuse to work, just go stand in the street in front of each state capitol or something. And that doesn&#39;t seem so unlikely to me, as the population stops going to the shitty movies they shove down our throats and halts watching their fixed NFL that blasphemes Sunday and ignores the lockstep lying news that intellectually insults us daily.</p>

<p>But if there&#39;s some kind of A-Team of All-Star patriots that are going to pull the rug on all this, what are they waiting for? Though I guess if they&#39;re getting ducks in a row, no rush before election day. Or maybe they&#39;ve got something planned for election day. Or Clinton&#39;s birthday is Wednesday, that&#39;d be pretty delicious. </p>

<p>But give it to Trump? That doesn&#39;t sound so good to me either. I&#39;d vote for him over Clinton if you put a gun to my head, but fortunately we&#39;re not there yet. </p>

<p>Def. not that group. They are all onboard with what&#39;s happening.  It would have to be some kind of &quot;zippie type movement&quot;, the cryptoanarchists, &quot;true hactivists&quot; are going to have to do it.  I&#39;m not even talking about &#39;anonymous&#39; but something like the white dragons--if they even exist--an asian group, a buddhist or essene ethic hacking group.  Hopefully they read our stuff here and see that we&#39;re in a lot of trouble and could use their help.  Surely there have to be some people out there by now, with all that I&#39;ve personally wrote about them,that htey know these people are seriously bad news.  I&#39;m thinking there even have to be some paleocatholics that see the jesuits for what they are, and have reached out to others in an ecumenical way to stop this foolishness.  </p>

<p>I think the only ones who can stop them is us.  And ideologically.  if enough people see them for who they are, they are done and there&#39;s nothing they can do that won&#39;t just infuriate people more until they literally get to a point where they sit on their hands and say &#39;f you creeps&#39; and then within days the economy comes to a screeching halt, they panic and it spirals out of control until an international org comes in to stop them from goosestepping up to us in the streets to get us to work.</p>

I&#39;m not saying there is anything Julian could do, but it seems even with the knowledge that &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; were mostly right if not completely, seems to have only pushed other people&#39;s heads deeper into the sand so they could ignore the reality around them and keep working for the new PS4/Xbox that is coming out soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess what?  They don&#39;t scare me. And they shouldn&#39;t scare you. Fear is false evidence appearing real.  If we&#39;ve learned anything, it&#39;s that these forumspies are nothing but illusional demons that haunt this place like a ghost.  A  bunch of ill-equipped, unclever goons who can&#39;t even handle simple arguments without using adhoms.</p>

<p>You have to &#39;fight&#39; for your &quot;right&quot; to speech.  You have to claim your rights.  If you don&#39;t, you lose.  If you get &#39;bullied into silence&#39; then you&#39;re giving tacit complicity in the security state&#39;s ability to quash your speech.  So stop being a craven redditor and stand up for yourself.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten death threats here on this sub, as some of you know very well.  I&#39;ve been honeypotted by a mason from <a href="/r/digitalcartel">/r/digitalcartel</a> who attempted to entrap me and 20 others into a crime against northop grumman.  I&#39;ve had my username with about 12 others put on a video with scary music.  I&#39;ve been harassed so much by topmind and pre-ellen-pao-leaving stormfag types that I was &#39;scared&#39; into closing 2 accounts before this one, then I grew up.  Now I&#39;m standing ground.  They can kill me at any time, I suspect they&#39;ve tried once (see my post about the poisoned nestle milk powder).  I post a lot of anti government subversive stuff is why.  That plus I was working on a crowd-lobbying app and a month after I requested funding for it, bad shit happened to me for 3 months, almost putting me into an asylum.  Then I realized what was happening and why and I&#39;ve been on their ass, giving away all my secrets, telling them who I am, not being afraid.  </p>

<p>And you know what?  It stopped. I showed them that they get less injury to their credibility if they leave me alone, because whenever they attack me, I double, sometimes triple down the anti-narratives.</p>

<p>I have powerful friends, although I don&#39;t know who they are.  It&#39;s obvious I do. Because their nonsense has stopped--now the worst they do is continue to troll-with-friends, which I can handle.  But they think they&#39;ve won; I think they think they&#39;ve got totalcontrol over reddit and this sub and control opinion, but they dont&#39;.  In fact, in their hubris, they&#39;ve made critical mistakes.   The enantiodromia of draconianism.  They can&#39;t control this thing anymore. They are fucked and on the run.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not time to be a pussy.  That is my point. </p>

<p>If that&#39;s what you got from what I said, then you didn&#39;t get what I&#39;m saying.  I&#39;m not worse than the NSA, I&#39;m talking about the government, not about people.
