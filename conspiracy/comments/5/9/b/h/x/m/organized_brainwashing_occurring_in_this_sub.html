    <div class="md"><p>Respect bro. Susceptibility is something that should diminish overtime for those of us truly committed to transparency &amp; progress on the fronts we each pursue.</p>

<p>That being said -  those who are easily manipulated will either 1. Learn through experience to not be easily manipulated or 2. Fallout of the community overtime.</p>

<p>By nature, others &#39;like us&#39;, question the validity of everything presented to us. This isnt a skill that is easily mastered so, I think that, we don&#39;t take it for granted. However, those &#39;easily manipulated&#39; would take it for granted &amp; thus be fooled and fall out in the long-run.</p>

<p>New comers/fledgling theorists will quickly realize that there is no instant gratification in what&#39;s going on here - we&#39;ve all committed to the long game; others will keep up or be left behind.</p>

<p>Podesta emails moved the needle pretty significantly on UFO Disclosure.</p>

<p>The surveillance/police state is becoming more public everyday and it&#39;s not being welcomed with open arms.</p>

<p>A major candidate for president (Stein) is calling for reopening the 9/11 investigations.</p>

<p>US foreign policy tactics are being exposed for what they really are in real time (think about how long it took for the truth about the Gulf of Tonkin incident to enter the public domain)</p>

<p>The two party political power structure in the US is cracking at its foundation.</p>

<p>Media manipulation of the masses is being discussed in hallways, parks, on the radio, in offices etc., not just in back rooms &amp; basements.</p>

<p>Our community has never had this level of exposure before &amp; the momentum is in our favor. The tide is turning friend, strap in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, when backing up arguments with research, one must realize that there is an enormous amount of junk research out there so one must use critical appraisal to analyze it.</p>

<p>So this study used 43 subjects (small number) of college students aged 18 to 22 (very specific subset of the population) and asked them to name as many curse words as possible.  That&#39;s how they evaluated swearing.  Knowing a lot of curse words doesn&#39;t mean they swear more, it just means they have a larger lexicon (vocabulary).  So basically the larger the vocabulary the smarter the person.  Makes sense.  That&#39;s the only valid conclusion from this study.  They did not assess morality, and the notion of honesty was not measured at all.  The writer merely assumed that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>tl;dr you&#39;re wrong and I still think you&#39;re a shillocratic.</p>

<p>I believe Trump is the only one who has a legitimate chance (based on real interest in him, not on trust of the legitimacy of the race) to beat Hillary.  </p>

<p>If it were another nominee on the democratic ticket, I probably wouldn&#39;t be on the Trump bandwagon, but like I&#39;ve said elsewhere, his most redeeming quality is his laziness.  He won&#39;t make unilateral decisions and he&#39;s far less likely to be the candidate to start ww3.  My continued existence is something I happen to value a little.  </p>

<p>And I find it quite unrealistic that anyone who actually uses this sub would be concerned with Trump &quot;shills&quot; (in reality, just supporters, because, you know, he actual has real world support) when it&#39;s a known FACT that Clinton is doing everything she can to control the discourse.  ALL of the discourse, EVERYWHERE.  She controls the msm, she has invaded all kinds of blogs and news outlets, she has facebook and twitter and google/youtube and instagram, and she has destroyed r/politics, /pol/, r/wikileaks, and every other conceivable area of reddit---except for most of this sub and a couple other minor subs. </p>

<p>If you actually looked at my post history in any detail, you would see that I haven&#39;t got more than a couple posts on r/the_donald and I stay away from r/wikileaks.  Frankly both sides bother me.  Thankfully people here are way too suspicious and aware of CTR bullshit to fall into the many traps you set.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>And they’re worthless sacks of shit, militarily.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are literally stupid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GET. FUCKING. WRECKED.</p>

<p>Remember that China hasn’t won a war against a foreign power in over 400 years. They massively outnumbered the enemy–sometimes 1,000 to 1–in every conflict and they still lost. Even when they had technological parity with the enemy (rather than spear-wielding medieval fucksticks vs. Europeans with guns), they still lost. You have to go back to the 1600s and find them slaughtering Russian migrants in Manchuria to find a war where they beat a foreign power, and it’s debatable whether you can call “sending soldiers to massacre unarmed peasants who have no military support” a war. Not that their centuries of humiliating failure have prevented them from declaring victory, like when they attacked unarmed fishing boats and declared it a victory over the Philippines. Or when they invaded Vietnam, achieved none of their stated objectives, took disproportionate casualties, were driven out, and then declared victory anyway. They’re in the habit of lying to save face and try to look less incompetent.</p>

<p>Basically, every war with China goes the same way: China rushes the enemy with millions of screaming soldiers. Millions of screaming soldiers get slaughtered while inflicting less than dire casualties on the enemy. China retreats in defeat, then announces that they really won after all and only pulled out because they were tired of playing. China quivers in impotent rage as it relives the Opium Wars over and over. Let’s follow one of these examples in particular.</p>

<p>The Boxers had no government support. They had almost no firearms and spent almost no time preparing for war. They honestly thought magical kung-fu powers will grant them victory over white men with machine guns. They killed more of their own people for shits and giggles than anyone else. Seriously, they just went around slaughtering Chinese peasants they considered ‘tainted’ by Western influence. When it finally came to battle, they got their shit pushed in by a handful of European soldiers and the Japs. China thereafter remained the West’s bitch until Japan decided it wants a turn ass-raping them. China then got horribly raped twice in a row by a country with less than a tenth of its population. They were only saved by America’s (unjust, unlawful, and unnecessary) Pacific Campaign. The commies then took the opportunity to steal territory in Manchuria, again, and China just had to smile and put up with it. Almost a century later, some angry Chinaman is posting on the Internet about how dare whitey make fun of a shitty Asian country that hasn’t been culturally, technologically, or militarily relevant since the early Middle Ages and has managed to lose every war it has been in for over four centuries.</p>

<p>The Korean War! Communists invaded South Korea and China alone sent in 1.5x as many troops as every country supporting South Korea. China took overwhelming losses and pulled out of the war. At the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, China had an American unit surrounded and outnumbered 40 to 1. The American unit broke out and destroyed 40% of the entirety of Chinese military strength in North Korea, thoroughly humiliating China in the process. The invasion of South Korea was defeated and both sides agreed to a ceasefire that continues to this day. Result: American victory, humiliating loss for China </p>

<p>The Vietnam War! American gets dragged into France’s conflict because of commies, again. The American forces consistently rape the North Vietnamese army and VC guerrillas, but wasn’t allowed to end the war because politicians didn’t want them invading North Vietnam or Cambodia. America eventually pulled out of the war because of communist sympathizers at home swaying politicians, not because of any military losses. North Vietnam was utterly incapable of beating South Vietnam while America was in the war. China then decided to invade Vietnam. The entire war lasted less than a month. China, which massively outnumbers Vietnam, invaded a country that was already exhausted from decades of constant war. China invaded with 6 to 1 numerical superiority and suffered more casualties than Vietnam, lost 420 tanks (vs. 185 Vietnamese tanks). China retreated, leaving Vietnam in control of Cambodia, the Spratly Islands, and basically every other piece of territory China wanted to claim. China remains butthurt to this day and still claims they won the war and are the rightful owners of the Spratly Islands.</p>

<p><strong>Is a picture starting to be formed here?</strong> China has been destroyed by multiple ethnic and political groups in what is now modern China for centuries. Then China was destroyed by the Mongols. Repeatedly. Then the Japanese. Then the French. Then the British. Then the Germans. Then the Japanese again. Then the Russians, several times. Then the Americans. Then the Japanese again. Then the Americans and South Koreans. Then the Vietnamese. Even fucking India, a country that gives incompetence a new meaning, has given China as much shit as China has given it.</p>

<p>So whose turn is it to make China their bitch this time? Their tactics are shit and consist entirely of human wave frontal assaults, which suck when going up against fortifications, machine guns, artillery, armor, air support, and basically anything that isn’t a bunch of savages like the millions of Chinese rushing at you in a screaming horde.</p>

<p>Even with access to modern equipment, the Chinese military doesn’t get it. They only received modern underwear this year. 2016. Before, they had crude cotton canvas shorts held up with a rope cinched around their waist. China is the world’s largest exporter of body armor, but the overwhelming majority of the Chinese military has never been issued so much as a flak vest, much less a modern plate carrier. Chinese generals think giving things like body armor to soldiers is “too indulgent” and will spoil them. Seriously, look it up. They also get some of the worst rations on any military on the planet. They’re so awful that the Chinese soldiers refuse to eat them and instead pack lunches from home while on field exercises. These are people who eat rats, cats, dogs, gutter oil, bird nests, century eggs, and other disgusting shit, and they think their rations suck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only one candidate is beholden to the banks.  Trump will get enveloped if he wins, but the probability of him actively starting ww3 is minimal compared to Clinton.  It&#39;s not unreasonable to say that it will still happen, but team Clinton will force it to happen.  Team Trump may have to reluctantly accept that it&#39;s &quot;mandatory&quot;.  At least with him there&#39;s hope...</p>

<p>Also check the emails.  People on Clinton&#39;s side have called him &quot;real change&quot; and said the elite are &quot;terrified&quot; of him.  I think you might be playing into fear too much (or smart shilling, creating doubt and hopelessness in the minds of Trump supporters).  </p>

<p>Maybe he wins and maybe it happens anyways.. but there&#39;s no maybe with HRC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol playing into fear?  Thats you, buddy. </p>

<p>Nothing will change if trump wins, i promise you. If there is war, there will be war, regardless who is the spokesman.</p>

<p>Trump uses fear propaganda, you are so scared that if clinton wins, ww3 will automatically begin... smh.  </p>

<p>Let me explain sommething that most people dont know</p>

<p>This country is run by the NSC. And they decide when we go to war</p>

    <div class="md"><p>one of the two is going to win.  If it&#39;s Hillary, ww3 is next.  She has the worst rhetoric of anyone and her decisions from the past have created the nightmare in the middle east.  Removing Gaddafi created Germany and Syria.  If she gets in and sets up her no fly zone and goes after Iran, it&#39;s literally the end-game.  How anyone can vote for that, or not vote at all, is beyond me. </p>
