       I've been coming here for years, and it used to be a platform for some pretty good ideas, both left and right wing.  Now a proven scam artist like James O' Keefe, who did time for spying on US Senator Mary Landry, is taken seriously again?  His whole career was debunked years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emails?  GW erased millions.  Cheney gave up a deep cover CIA agent and made his Chief of Staff take the rap.  Podesta's most provocative stuff is on UFOs, not rigging.  Everyone knows Bernie got hosed, and that's where the pressure should have been applied.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's a disaster, and his biggest problem is his toxic personality and ethics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still not a Clinton fan, so save it.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  If you want a real conspiracy, how about how Trump's actions have cause globalist neocons and neolibs to merge.  They may be merging to fight Stupid, at this time, but they will stay together after this affair for awhile.  One Party.  Sound familiar, especially to Trump fans?  Know why it does?

       Because that's what China does.  China.  Welcome to your worst nightmare.

       It's the content of the videos that people are vetting not the messenger.

       Individuals in the videos either resigned or were removed. What does that say about the validity of the claims?

       It's true.  The propensity for people who already dislike someone severely to lower their standard of evidence, has been exploited mightily on social media.  Entire hit squads are organized in this fashion.

       In what world did these people not say what they said.  In what world did Bob Creamer not visit the white house 350 times?  In what way do you think it's believable that the Clinton camp isn't directly involved in the operations of their super pacs?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a situation where it's O'Keefe's videos against the world.  Wikileaks data proves illegal contact between Team Clinton and her Super Pacs.  These videos merely show certain instances.  The words being said cannot be refuted (nor have they been).

       Wikileaks data is not verifiable, no matter what anyone says, the chain of custody of the data cannot hold up in a court.   Now you could issue a subpoena the second they came out for the servers that were hacked, then you might find something that can be verified.  If you waited a day, everything was gone.  It's a very interesting read but it cannot withstand scrutiny in a court of law.  Maybe some info the emails lead to could.  But the content of a bunch of stolen emails could easily be altered.  There is no way to verify their integrity.  Someone could easily leak a real email archive with a few fake emails and alterations to lend credibility to whatever narrative they want.  This does not mean that the info isn't true.  Just that there is no way to know for sure without some actual smoking gun and it can't be a stolen email.  It could be something an email leads to.
      </p>
      <p>
       O'Keefe's tactics are just not honest.  They are basically the right wing version of Michael Moore.  Neither individual can be trusted to deliver a full story.

       I'm not a tech expert but there are plenty of articles and blogs saying these emails can in fact be verified beyond a doubt.  The info is out there if you haven't looked at it.  If you have and you feel it is a fallacy, that's your prerogative.  I do not have the tech background or insight to agree with you or to doubt them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever O'Keefe's history is, the words being said on his videos are undeniable.  You simply cannot argue that there's some greater, hidden context that invalidates the very clear messages coming from the people in the videos.  One of those people is Creamer and you cannot argue that he has been a very frequent visitor to the white house.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone who seeks to invalidate O'Keefe's videos appear to be blatant CTR.  I honestly don't see any every day unawares (the people who have no direct insight on their own) who are prepared to back Clinton on this, especially after they have watched the videos.  The wording and the message in the videos is highly explicit and very clear.

       It's O'Keefe's history that makes me question if we are getting the whole story on the video.  In fact, you know we aren't because it's his video.  Same with anything Moore produces.  It's the source that I question regarding the video.  Secondly, anyone telling you they know how to verify the emails without having the server in question is blowing smoke up your ass and even then it's email which has the worst verification system ever so you'd have to verify ips used.  There is NOTHING that would prevent anyone from altering an email archive and there would be no way to verify it's integrity because it would have to have all kinds of verification mechanisms built into the archive for that to be possible and it does not.

       But so what if the Clinton camp was nurturing puppies and taking care of the elderly all day (re: what wasn't shown)... it doesn't change the words and phrasing of the videos.  That much is irrefutable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, sue me, but I think HRCs idea of taking care of the elderly would involve convincing them that the CF can make better use of their pensions than they can...and then killing them (but not on the books...gotta keep that cash flow coming). FYI I really don't like her.

       Yeah our political culture is definitely corrupt.  I'm just saying that it's really important that people use real solid evidence against people like her.   If you don't you just kind of contribute to the noise and the narrative that people are out to get her.  In that kind of environment, any real leads are lost as huge numbers of people appear to jump on events that will never gain any traction.  I'd rather see an analysis by people that can keep their hate out of the equation I guess.  There could be something out there but the noise is deafening.

       Robert Creamer visited the White House.  He did so approx 350 times.  He is on video stating that he has direct contact with Clinton.  Robert Creamer is an ex-con (Bank Fraud) and has resigned from his position, under light of these revelations.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not ambiguous.  There's no "oh this doesn't prove anything" narrative that can hold water.  It is a direct link between an active Super Pac and Hillary Clinton herself.  That, like her possessing SAP data on her server, is a crime.  She should be charged with multiple violations of election law and for treason.
      </p>
      <p>
       These videos are simply a small piece of the puzzle.  If you don't see how she is guilty (by now) then I can't help you.  If you do, then O'Keefe's history means nothing.  By promoting it, you are promoting the same rhetoric that they will use to get her off.

       I wish it were rhetoric.  I'm not promoting anything other than careful analysis.  Your proof will not stand up to scrutiny and I would in fact hesitate to believe that you have the full story from any video edited by O'Keefe.  You cannot convict someone on circumstantial evidence.  While I'll give you that the video seems bad, there is always something O'Keefe has done to undermine his integrity completely, we just don't know what it is yet.  This is not likely to be the smoking gun you are looking for is all I'm saying.  I'd love for it to be that, believe me I want to see the evidence.  I just don't see anything that you can haul someone in over yet, it's all heresy, circumstantial, or plausibly deniable.  Maybe you can get a jury to convict but a prosecutor wouldn't bring a case he doesn't have air-tight facts on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So by promoting this you are really just leading people in a direction that won't find anything.  You aren't convincing anyone except for people that already hate the Clintons.  The best thing to do would be to look at emails and connections and then see if that leads anywhere.  It has to be a remote connection something that wouldn't be obvious to them to hide.  That's what people should be looking for.

       I know this isn't the smoking gun.  Her having SAP data on her server is.  This is confirmed by the fact that Congress is being blocked from seeing the data because it's too classified.  The only thing too classified for Congress, to my knowledge, is above top secret data.  (Correct me if I'm wrong.) Having SAP data on her server is treason. /end discussion.

       So we should ignore Hillary's crimes, ignore O'Keefe and focus on how terrible of a person Trump is even though he doesn't have a political history to judge.

       That's not a political history that's a donation history. Please enlighten us as to when Trump held a public office that we should be judging.

       In my experience, business associating with politics

        is

       a political history.  Follow the money.

       Well, we haven't seen his complete tax returns or donation history, so we can't be totally sure, but at the very least, he is a Hillary shill.  He may still be.  He may be the insurance that got her elected.  How does that make you feel?  Like your pussy just got grabbed?

       So you imply Hillary is evil and can't be trusted but yet you want us to ignore some of her crimes to focus our attention on Trump for..donating to Hillary? Do you have any idea how fucking fully retarded you just went?

       The reason people focus on Trump and Hillary is that is what the corporate media wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason Trump can resonate with his insanity is that the conventional "sanity" of wimps like Bernie who cave in tells us that we can't win straight up.    So,  at least Trump is crazy enough to stick out the election cycle.    Its a big fuck you that just might stick.   What other fuck you is  available to people?
