       Hi all!
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm getting more intrigued by Podesta and his obsession with aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a quick video with footage of Podesta talking about it:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Had a fascinating meeting with Bob Boyce today, who worked at Montauk and Groom Lake. He won't speak publicly either, but he would like to reconnect with Edgar Mitchell. I will connect you with the lady he is staying with - Lorie Peters Lauthier, who is quite familiar with the work you're doing...
Best,Sean
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Groom Lake, is basically Area 51.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was curious about this Lorie person, and look at this:

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The 2008 Collector’s View hosts included: Heather &amp; Tony Podesta, Shigeko &amp; Tim Bork, Jan &amp; Peter Hapstak, and Christine Varney &amp; Tom Graham. This year’s series’ hosts included: Barbara &amp; Aaron Levine, Farinaz &amp; Dadi Akhavan, Lorie Peters Lauthier, and Paul Yandura &amp; Donald Hitchcock.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So Podesta's brother does have a connection somehow to Lorie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also recently a email about Edgar Mitchell's passing has come to light:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31715">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31715
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta specifically says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We should tweet something like
Sad to learn of the passing of Edgar Mitchell, an American hero.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ck his Wikipedia page to make sure that won't seem too goofy. He's A
big UFO guy. Former astronaut.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This isn't saying that he THINKS he's goofy, just that he seems goofy because he's a UFO guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Curiously, this email, dated 2 months after the topmost one here, is written in a way that could suggest that Podesta needs to be convinced to engage with Edgar.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/27026">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/27026
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is also imperative that after your talk with Edgar, he then speak directly with President Obama via Skype for historical purposes, about the same issue, while the President is still in office.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not quite sure how to read this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can dive deeper, but this post is already getting a bit long.  Do you guys also have any thoughts about Podesta and the UFO link?  I'm not huge on politics, this particular angle of the links is rather interesting though and I  hope some big secret is slipped!  Very few actual words from Podesta on the manner though, but his wanting to tweet about Mitchell indicates to me that they were at least somewhat friends.

       It should come to no surprise that aliens or other beings exist on evidence based on:
1. Statistical probability
2. Ancient culture and mythology
3. UFO abduction phenomenon. The credence is in the sheer number reported, rather than whether or not they indeed happened.
4. Technology leap throughout history
5.  Astronaut testimonies
      </p>
      <p>
       Now whether or not the impending alien disclosure is genuine or not is another matter. Look into project blue beam. I dismissed this at first but it does connect some holes like the ghost cities in the sky at china.

       It also mentions Montauk or the Montauk Project. Which is named Camp Hero in Montauk, NY this was an extention of the Philadelphia project that claimed they can cloak a navy destroyer. It was also said that alien, time travel, and advanced weapons were developed here.

       God this is maybe my favorite thing ever. I spent a good two months digging and developing all the information that I could find on this project online. It's fascinating and so far reaching. More interesting than any other conspiracy to date. It has everything. And the people who worked there that were brainwashed are beginning to remember things. It would seem techniques in the past were not as effective.

       It's been a good 6 or 7 years. It actually inspired me to write a screenplay. Basically if you do some googling you can get to the sites that have information, pictures, interviews and the audio tapes of interviews with key players. Jon Von Neumann was involved heavily and the two brothers(Preston and Duncan I think) that jumped from the ship during the Philadelphia experiment are central to the montauk project and the montauk chair - just one of the few technologies that were "given to the program by extra terrestrials with no apparent instruction on how or why to use them" the underpinning technology was the tesla coil. Try starting here.

       Interestingly enough the part of the research at the facility that was less classified was the use of radio waves to control the moods of people. They tested this on New Yorkers, allegedly. There are other unclassified documents from the DoD that corroborate this kind of research into mind control or mood alteration. "Imagine you could make your enemy sad or angry or scared at the push of a button" by using the radio waves that are emitted from the back of a satellite dish.

       Sattelite dish? How do you think Wifi or Bluetoothworks? Radioactive waves... And they can see where you are using them too... Not a far stretch to imagine using multiple routers to triangulate your position. I swear there are time when I will start hearing conversations in my head... And I have plenty of my own, but this is like hearing a radio station or listening to a phone call. Maybe we will someday be biological able to tune into different frequencies at will? I doubt it is a far-fetched idea, though I see it would probably far out, 1000 years?, from being a truly viable reality. Evolution, life processes, and genetic heritage is far more complicated than anyone is capable of supposing, so who knows.

       My grandfather was in the military in the 40s so he had a lot of military friends.  I've heard everything from the ship totally disappeared to people that were on the ship at the time suffered everything from death to them flipping in and out of our reality (or just turning invisible) but whatever it was drove them crazy...literally.  One of his friends said he was at a bar with one of the guys on the ship and he disappeared while he was sitting at the bar.

       No sitting president is going to have a meeting on camera with a ufo guy talking about that subject. Sure every ufo guy would absolutely love to get a president on camera so that's what they demand. Ain't gonna happen.

       The key thing I take from the video of Podesta is that I think he KNOWS and wants to tell the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mitchell has largely been decried as a crackpot, but then he's actually a friend of Podesta who probably KNOWS about this stuff?  That's an interesting connection that at least gives a bit more credibility to Edgar.

       So the claim came out a while ago that UFOs were hyped to promote the concept that US has unbeatable technological superiority.  With a new cold war starting up, what is the chance that all this coming out in wikileaks is just that?  Wikileaks could be a honeypot, or receiving doctored information as well.  I do find the "historical context" messages very interesting.  But there are a lot of blanks to fill in.

       Edit:  Any semblance of trying to get at factual info - downvote.  Yeah the sub is dead.

       Why do you think Wikileaks is doctored?  I don't think they have an agenda in this, personally.  The emails are 101% real and have been proven to be so already via many different means now.

       If someone steals a file from a server there is nothing protecting the integrity of the archive.  Basically you could never prove in a court of law that the chain of custody didn't compromise the integrity of the archive.  What is possible, is that someone could insert messages or slightly alter files so that in the middle of a sea of real emails, you "find" little gems that are actually planted information.

       You are right.  At some point you have to take something for granted don't you?  I am just pointing out that hacked emails are really not very reliable.  It's almost absurd to me that officials even quit when emails get leaked.  This stuff is very easily deniable.  Imagine if you had a report that was just a piece of paper that said some evidence was true.  You could easily have created that piece of paper.  You need to verify where it came from.  You can't do that very easily or really at all with some hacked emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could just add some more emails to a legit archive and you wouldn't know any better.  There is no way to know.  It's like relying on a document that could be faked rather than a murder weapon with prints.  One is a lot more solid as far as evidence goes than the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       So likelihood of being manipulated would be a big consideration here.  An individual conducting a targeted political act seems unlikely to be the source of unbiased information.

       Yet, there have been Clinton staffers referring to the emails and not once mentioning they aren't true, and also I think its a big "These emails are true" when both people were either fired or stepped down.

       It depends.  If the fight would draw more attention to an unfavorable narrative, I'd make people commit political suicide and then reward them later.  See Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.

       I agree they have acted skittish and guilty.  Unfortunately you can't convict them on that.

       Donna Brazille has claimed the emails were doctored.  Fox news thinks they have a way to verify the emails:

       This report is overlooking some serious issues.  If the server in question was hacked, then the keys could very easily have been compromised.  There is also the question of how DKIM was configured and if it was used to verify the message body.  What is kinda cool is that in writing this response I finally have some hard facts to investigate, i.e. the DKIM signing stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  Update it appears legit.  The DKIM signature in this email prevents you from altering the contents of the email without the private key.  I don't believe there is anything going back in the other direction however, so you can't really verify that donna brazile sent the original message.  This still leaves a hole where having the private key from hillaryclinton.com would allow the doctoring to take place.  It also means someone may have been sending emails using these people's identities, which is disturbing also.

       I wonder how long they had access to the server. I wonder if someone would compare writing styles as well? I know that's a thing.

       I also heard Podesta's email hack was more of a phishing scam and they got his password and got in that way. Not sure if that's 100% though.
