      <p>
       This is quatrain:  Century V-75 from the book "Conversations with Nostradamus".
      </p>
      <p>
       He will rise high over his wealth, more to the right
He will remain seated on the square stone;
Towards the south, placed at the window,
A crooked staff in his hand, his mouth sealed
      </p>
      <p>
       B:  He  says  that  this  refers  to  a  man  in  the  United  States.  A  man  who  is very  wealthy.  Wealthy  to  the  point  that  anything  he  wants  done  can get  done  instantaneously,  for  he  has  the  money  to  get  it  accomplished. He  says  this  man  will  be  well  known  and  famous  because  of  his wealth,  but his  true  mission  in  life  will  be  secret,  for  this  man  will  be a  fanatic  of  sorts.  He  will  be  involved  with  such  organizations  as  the American  Nazi  Party  and  the  Ku  Klux  Klan.  That's  why  he  put  in  the phrase,  "the  crooked  staff,"  to  represent  the  burning  crosses  of  the  Ku Klux  Klan  and  the  swastika  of  the  Nazi  party.  This  man's  sole ambition  in  life  is  towards  the  overthrow  of  the  American  government as  it  is  presently  constituted  in  the  20oth  century.  He  says  this  man naturally  enough  will  also  be  involved  in  politics.  But  even  though  his main  ambition  is  to  change  the  form  of  the  American  government,  he has  to  stay  low-key  in  politics  so  that  he  may  continue  spinning  his webs  of  power  and  continue  making  new  contacts  and  expanding  his range  of  influence.  The  groundwork  that  he  has  laid  will  come  to fruition  at  the  time  of  the  troubles  caused  by  the  Anti-Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       D:  At  this  present time  does  anybody  know  who  he  is? 
B:  Those  who  follow  him  know  who  he  is.
      </p>
      <p>
       D:  But  the  other people  don't  know  the  danger he  poses? 
B:  No,  for  he  has  been  very  sly,  very  careful.
      </p>
      <p>
       D:  Would  that  explain  the  phrase,  "he  will  remain  seated on  the  square stone"? 
B:  Yes.  He  will  be  in  the  center  of  the  entire  organization,  but  he  won't be  the  figure  of  power  that  people  see.  He  will  have  a  puppet,  someone  who  will  appear  to  be  the  one  in  power,  but  he  will  be  pulling  the strings.  He  will  have  a  figurehead,  but  he  will  remain  seated  behind, on  the  square  stone  that  is,  in  the  center  of  this  organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       D:  "His  mouth  sealed" would  mean  that he  is  secret. 
B:  Yes,  he  is  secret.  The  phrase,  "toward  the  south  at  the  window," means  that  due  to  his  political  beliefs,  what  open  activities  he  does indulge  in  and  the  mayhem  he  likes  to  cause  is  more  often  to  appear
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't think of anyone else who this could be.  Famous billionaire.  Wants to overthrow government - Obama was literally just saying the media is like the Wild West - he wouldn't have said anything unless it was a major problem.  Turner owns CNN.  Recently gave a billion dollars to the UN who is really the only present organization who can undermine the US government.  Square stone = television - prehistoric man carved rocks for communication.  South, Turner's hometown Atlanta, Georgia.  Nickname of "Captain Outrageous" would it really surprise anyone if he ended up having ties to the Klan/Nazis?  Crooked staff - herding - Turner owned largest herd of Buffalo in the world. Very sly, clever - uses good old boy "Aww shucks" attitude as cover.

       I feel you,
But while I feel like I'm very pro-Trump, I also like to look at things from every angle possible. His message to the public is that he wants to change the current government system. 
He managed to rise above his image of "just being wealthy" and became the primary republican candidate for the United States presidency. 
Clinton is the one that looks like she's in control. Like she's the one behind all the string pulling. 
What if Clinton is Trump's puppet and he's just pulling the strings with her?
I don't know. Shit just makes me paranoid.

       I feel the same. I understood that picture when I first saw it a long time ago. I've thought about revolution, about revolting. I don't know where I'd start. I'm just a normal dude in Kansas that has no experience with hacking, so I can't provide to anonymous. All I do is preach to the sheeple to try and open a few eyes. You tell me how I can assist such a movement and I will be the first person to sign your list.

       Good.  Keep at it.  Make sure and preach non-racism and

       that way as well, however.  Together we stand, divided we fall.  We must be able to support one another first before we collectively have enough courage and strength to all stand up and move against tptb.

       God your words are inspiring dude. Reading through that comment was like pulling thoughts out if my mind. I do believe divided amongst people with open eyes, and most people won't take in my words, but dammit I try. I send links to friends and kind of jokingly say "Here's your tinfoil ruffle of the day" hoping that gets them to read it. Keep up the good work amongst this community, and any others if possible. You could seriously be looked at as the Voice of Freedom and begin a little pot stirring if you felt like it.

       Most people don’t take in my words either…but yes.  I keep trying too.  And every now and then, I run across someone…like you.  And that lets me know that not everything I say is completely lost on everyone.  And it makes it worth it to me to keep trying and keep speaking the truth as I understand it.  So I won’t stop.  And neither should you.

       The pot needs stirring, the voice of freedom needs to be blasted through a megaphone into all the ears of the american people. There are people everywhere that feel this way, we just need to group together, we need to spur a movement and revolt against this corrupt government that is slowly gaining more control of our lives.
I'm afraid of what the future holds if people continue to sit back and watch as our police turn into military and as our government tightens it's coils.

       We need to coalesce like-minded individuals together and encourage a movement of disciplined revolters - and by revolters I don't mean trigger happy rioters ready to shoot and break anything that moves.  That's horrible and counterproductive.  What I mean is a group of individuals (ideally a

       People all feel like there needs to be a change, the common man would be willing to join a movement. I was suggesting to another user that I have reached out to that we need to make a subreddit where people can come together as a group and all put their word in.

       It will most definitely not be easy, however.  Heck, just today my brother in law got
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       aggressively upset when he asked me if I was going to vote, we got on the subject of the candidates involved, and I told him just how insanely corrupt Clinton is.  He literally freaked out and started yelling about how "Hillary's the best choice available!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that he likely represents a good portion of America is, again, rather disheartening where it regards the shroud of ignorance that still covers the minds of most people in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's otherwise quite a sane, intelligent, professional individual who I get along with well enough, but got demonstrably irate over the thought of Trump getting in office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.  Trump sucks balls, of course.  They both do.  Big time.  Clinton should not be in office, however.

       Who the president is doesn't exactly determine who decides what goes on, there's still the big faces that aren't ever seen behind the scenes and in congress that really decide what goes on, the same people who narrowed the options down to 2 people who are not suitable for office and then tell people that their vote counts, either way they decide where your vote goes.

       People don't exactly know what is going on even if they have intelligent political views, an example I like to use: An artist puts up a new abstract painting in his gallery, visitors and art buyers gather around and give their compliments on how great it is or how terrible it is and what they think defines the painting, when in reality the artist simply threw paint all over a canvas without any intent to create anything but money from the ignorant people gathered around making ridiculous bids on a piece they could very well have done themselves.

       Which brings to mind a different ignorance peopel have now, how recently people care so much aboyt others being offended over whichever matter. People have always been getting offended the problem now is thqt other people feel like they need to fix their offenses, I am aware there are other factors contributing but this was more of an issue for me, you could say it offended me ;)

       of things in life.  That's pretty much how I acted w/my brother in law as he was screaming and yelling how "Everything's going to be ruined if Hillary doesn't get in!!" lol.  I was like "Okay.  If you say so.  She's definitely part of the problem too, bro."

       I actually had the same kind of encounter on social media with an older cousin of mine. My Facebook feed isn't necessarily pro-Trump, but it is absolutely anti-Hillary. They wouldn't even accept my evidence towards my point, as if it was an absolute lie. I don't mind having set beliefs, but at least okay with the thought before calling me delusional.

       God your words are inspiring dude. Reading through that comment was like pulling thoughts out if my mind. I do believe divided amongst people with open eyes, and most people won't take in my words, but dammit I try. I send links to friends and kind of jokingly say "Here's your tinfoil ruffle of the day" hoping that gets them to read it. Keep up the good work amongst this community, and any others if possible. You could seriously be looked at as the Voice of Freedom and begin a little pot stirring if you felt like it.
