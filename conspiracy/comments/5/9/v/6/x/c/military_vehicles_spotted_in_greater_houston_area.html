        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Maybe this is normal, but while driving on a major tollway in a surrounding suburb of Houston I spotted 4 military vehicles a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>A co-worker mentioned this morning that her son (who is a reservist) was called in last night. </p>

<p>Forgive my ignorance, but is something going on or is this just a coincidence?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I spoke with my co-worker. Her son was not given prior orders and was rushing to get all of his gear together. She said she isn&#39;t sure where was he was going but that she would try to find out for me. I learned in the conversation that she has no idea what is going on in the world or why this could potentially mean something very serious. I tried to school her, but those who don&#39;t care to know will not learn...</p>

<p>UPDATE 2: Well, it seems most think that it is nothing out of the ordinary, just a convoy of vehicles going from point A to B and that the Guard is possibly just running drills or something. I appreciate everyone&#39;s conversation today! I learned quite a bit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I was just visiting the Pacific Northwest and driving out of the state my wife and I saw a huge convoy pass us. Probably close to 8-10 vehicles. I&#39;ve seen it plenty of times in my hometown too. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like, those vehicles do have to get from point A to point B occasionally. It only makes sense that you&#39;d see them doing that from time to time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. I may need a shift in perspective. I feel like all this knowledge is filling up my brain &amp; I can&#39;t share it with the general population because they dont understand. They aren&#39;t educated in world events, and don&#39;t keep themselves informed. So I walk in talking about election rigging and Russia and voter fraud and Podesta emails and WikiLeaks and the elites and so on and so on... only to be looked at like I&#39;m crazy. I just want to share my knowledge if it means ONE person will snap to it and be interested enough to research it for themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>can you find out from your co-worker friend if her son being &quot;called in&quot; last night meant a normal weekend drill? Do remember that reservists serve one weekend  a month on average, and sometimes it involves mustering on Thursday nights if the training requires 3 days in a row. It&#39;s also worth noting that a great many mothers of reservists don&#39;t quite completely understand the drill process, so especially if this was his first 3 day long drill, she may be overblowing the significance of having to report for duty on a Thursday night and assuming it means he&#39;s getting activated/recalled to active duty.</p>

<p>Anyway, just ask please, if it isn&#39;t already clear from your conversations with her. it would be quite concerning if large numbers of reservists are getting called up right now, especially <em>before</em> any specific events have happened, its always been in response to an attack or war in the past...</p>

<p>Edit: but just to say, the four military vehicles aren&#39;t overly concerning. every military unit in america sometimes has to drive from one base to another in their humvees and 5-tons. if its in a military town the spectacle wears off very quickly, but if you&#39;re not, it can be quite surprising to see. keep in mind that just about every city in the US has an army reserve base or national guard armory, but many of them train on other bases. so every once in a while, especially on those longer 3 day training rotations i mentioned above, reservists will drive their humvees 50-100 miles on freeways to where they&#39;ll be training for the weekend. when this happens, it consists of dozens of humvees. i&#39;d guess that it only seemed significant to you because you haven&#39;t happened to see it many times in the past, but 4 vehicles driving around doesn&#39;t raise any suspicions for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so me an my brother saw something really weird on the outskirts of Houston the other day. We have video and pic evidence but havn&#39;t got anything uploaded yet. If anyone is interested or has more info I will happily upload. Anyway, here&#39;s what happend:</p>

<p>We were driving around the east/North east area through Dayton, came to a stop sign and were halted by a bunch of flashing lights. It was probably mid afternoon on a weekday I think (can check from video if need be) and there was this convoy of about 6 buses, like greyhound style coaches not school buses, being escorted by 3/4 Alabama state troopers. </p>

<p>They were HAULING ASS through stop signs and red lights, stopping traffic so these coaches could keep up with each other and what not. Now, I have a pretty fast car, and thought fuck it, I like a good conspiracy, lets follow this convoy and see whats up. </p>

<p>The bus company was called Chamelot charters (based out of birmingham alabama I believe, I checked them out but i&#39;ll talk about that later...) </p>

<p>Anyway, so 6 buses with pretty will tinted windows, all going REALLY fast. We got on to a long straight piece of road and i was going about 80 mph and this convoy was staying pretty far ahead of me. The weirdest thing is that I swear I saw a bunch of young (between 9 and 15) black kids on one of the buses. Like there were pillows up against some of the windows, which I would expect for kids on a bus trip from alabama...</p>

<p>So many questions...We just can&#39;t come up with ANY logical explanation for this scenario. So anyway, we followed the convoy and I actually managed to get my car in between the coaches at a red light as it was in a more built up area with lots of traffic, and got some good pics of the back of the buses and Alabama state troopers. I went real slow and the convoy started to split up a bit. The whole time, these out of state state troopers were going to the front of the convoy and stopping traffic, then peeling round to the back to catch up the buses at the back. </p>

<p>So they got split up and then the cops directed them down a smaller road so they could all get back together, and then they made an extra epic maneuver to Uturn ALL 6 buses that were now back in convoy back to the main road. </p>

<p>We lost the convoy at this point due to traffc and lights and stop signs that we couldn&#39;t just burn through like they were. But I&#39;m still kicking myself for not trying harder and following them...</p>

<p>Questions... - Why were alabama state troopers escorting 6 buses though Texas</p>

<p>Why were buses with (what I think was) children in them burning through stop signs and red lights going up to 80 mph in the middle of the day? </p>

<p>What was so important? who was so important? It&#39;s really strange...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What in the literal fuck. I wonder if they were being transported to an out of state juvenile or mental health facility or something?</p>

<p>Do out of state state troopers have the authority (or the right) to that extent in another state? I mean, could any state trooper show up &amp; blow through traffic like that? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about authority, I&#39;m not originally from here, but have always heard that that shit doesn&#39;t really fly unless it&#39;s something serious. I don&#39;t know about the whole juve or mental health idea, because they were REALLY nice buses. </p>

<p>So I called up the bus company, and asked them if they have anything available to transport 2 &quot;high profile&quot; people. And they said they had limos available. So I asked if they offered armed escorts, and they said it could be arranged. This was me attempting to figure stuff out but kind of hit a dead end. The company has a few reviews talking about kids school trips and stuff, but they also offer &quot;high end&quot; transportation. I don&#39;t see any of this as super strange...but kinda...lol </p>

<p>I did a small bit of research into the company, and they seem to check out...But I dunno...Something weird </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is something that happens often. It&#39;s just training. Soldiers have to be able to be ready at a moment&#39;s notice, what better way than to call them up out of the blue and send them to do training. </p>

<p>A few things to note: </p>

<p>It&#39;s October which is the beginning of the new fiscal year for the Army so you can expect to see more training going on.</p>

<p>There are a number of large bases within a relatively short distance and these Soldiers may have been called up last minute to assist in some type of training.</p>

<p>Soldiers don&#39;t get mobilized within the US without people knowing about it. If for some reason they were to be doing something nefarious they wouldn&#39;t be obvious about it and you wouldn&#39;t see them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Posse Comitatus Act is a United States federal law (18 U.S.C. § 1385, original at 20 Stat. 152) signed on June 18, 1878 by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The purpose of the act – in concert with the Insurrection Act of 1807 – is to limit the powers of the federal government in using federal military personnel to enforce domestic policies within the United States. It was passed as an amendment to an army appropriation bill following the end of Reconstruction, and was subsequently updated in 1956 and 1981.
The Act only specifically applies to the United States Army and, as amended in 1956, the United States Air Force. While the Act does not explicitly mention the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, due to their being naval services, the Department of the Navy has prescribed regulations that are generally construed to give the Act force with respect to those services as well. The Act does not apply to the Army and Air National Guard under state authority from acting in a law enforcement capacity within its home state or in an adjacent state if invited by that state&#39;s governor. The United States Coast Guard, which operates under the Department of Homeland Security, is not covered by the Posse Comitatus Act either, primarily because although the Coast Guard is an armed service, it also has both a maritime law enforcement mission and a federal regulatory agency mission.</p>

<p>Having read that you realize the implication of the Executive orders that have been signed recently...</p>
