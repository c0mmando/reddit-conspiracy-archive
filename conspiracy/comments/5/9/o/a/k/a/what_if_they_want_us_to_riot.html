       Maybe this is the whole plan. I've been seeing posts about how they want to incite violence soon to establish martial law. That would explain all this MSM focus on police killings and race on race violence over the past year and a half. The thought occurred to me that the best thing to do, if I was in their position, would be to piss people off to the point that they want to riot, and then imprison or kill the rioters.
The only people who would cause a problem in the future would be the ones who are out in force at the start. The others who are semi devoted would be scared off by this initial show of force by the establishment, and the problem causers would be taken care of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't know though, this is just a thought that occurred to me and I wanted to share it.

       Whether by happenstance or prescience, you have struck a chord. They DO want civil unrest for sure. That is why when the SHTF, we cannot be the violent ones. We MUST simply get 20-30 million Americans to march on Washington and unseat our government. If Egypt can do it unarmed we surely can.

       If even 5% of Americans over 18 are aware of what's going on and are willing to march, then there's your 20 million. And my low ball estimate would be about 15% of adults are awake now, my high ball estimate would be probably around 30 to 40%. That's a lot of angry people

       With technology. People don't even have to be in the same place to be heard if the drive to make a statement is there. Get 50,000,000 americans to join an online protest group and then have a predetermined list of actions that everyone will take at the same time. Like crashing government websites, mass refusal of foriegn and government services, or what have you.

       I don't see how she declares herself permanent president. They need the facade of Democracy. She is DESPISED. No way she could pull that off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, maybe the military wants her to try it so they can pull a coup and be the "heroes." The military has a much better rep with the American people than the politicians, media, etc.

       The chinese did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Sun Yat Sen (Illuminati decoy revolutionary?) removed the Qing government and established democratic republic of china, He gave the president seat to
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Shikai#Democratic_elections">
        a Qing dynasty traitor
       </a>
       and the guy literally gave himself infinite presidency and allowed his own cohorts to become president once he dies, then he quickly declares himself emperor after one of the greater congressmen was assassinated in a train station.
      </p>
      <p>
       After then Sun Yat Sen made another Revolution and after this China was split by foreign funded (Illuminati puppets like Japan, England, Germany etc.) warlords.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't think that this won't be the same thing as before.

       Look, it could happen and I'm sure they'd like to try. No doubt. Just not sure they could pull it off. Yet. They need a figurehead that 75% of the country doesn't abhor.

       I been saying this the whole time. But one thing you need to realize is that they won't even wait for the public to riot. The public will form up for mass non violent protests at which point the establishment will employ agent provocateur's to stir the pot. Basically the riots will start through people who are hired to start riots.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me the best option right now is 100% boycott of the system. Stop voting stop paying taxes stop protesting stop buying from big money corporations like Walmart etc. Protesting just gives them the fuel they need to incite violence .

       Complete shut down of DC? clog the streets with people? that's a pretty hard message for MSM to ignore and one that would immediately go viral world wide. And with it going viral world wide, if any violence was brought against us, the rest of the world would be aware of it

       Nothing is ever out of the realm of possibility. It only is if you approach it with that attitude. If enough people are united under the same belief, there isn't anything they can do.

      <p>
       Do you really think they would kill and imprison the vast majority of their labor force? What fun is it ruling the world when there's nobody to rule? The biggest problem is that people don't see the true power in numbers. It's a handful of people controlling larger handfuls of people, who are giving orders to law enforcement, military, and other bullshit stoolies. And I don't think those law enforcement officers will arrest millions of people, they'll start questioning what's going on. The military will not kill American citizens, they swore an oath to protect us, and they won't stand for those orders. Those officers and soldiers are American citizens, just like us. What happens when the lines of defense for TPTB turn on them? Then it's millions of people against a handful.

       I think the bill of rights was a subliminal message.  These 10 rights will be taken first. This is the time you need to remove your head from the sand and do something.

       They are obviously coming for the guns. SJWs and the PC police are going for the 1st amendment. The things you brought up in your post, I believe, are the establishment going for the right to assemble (I know thats not in the BOR, but I hope you get my gist).

       The "God given rights" are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unless God is going to grace us with his presence on Earth and say, "uhhh yea you guys don't get those anymore", then no government agency or document will ever take that away from any of us. And if it comes to violence, then it comes to violence. We all die one way or another, might as well die for something worth holding your head up for.

       Any sort of quick action to remove any of the rights of American citizens after this election needs to be acted on very quickly. No matter who gets elected, we need to watch the policies being moved through very carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       We barely have the right to assemble as is. We have the right on paper, but as everyone else has clearly stated, they have no problem hiring agents to incite violence to destroy any organized movement. Black Lives Matter is the best recent example, and has obviously been infiltrated to incite violence at any protests. It doesn't take much to create a riot. Just one or two people get violent and it's a cascading effect from there with group mentality

       Now, maybe the military wants her to try it so they can pull a coup and be the "heroes." The military has a much better rep with the American people than the politicians, media, etc.
