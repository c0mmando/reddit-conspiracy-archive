    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the Moscow Theatre hostage crisis was classic false flag, TBO, I don&#39;t really have the energy to look up links for you it was many years ago I was reading about this. There&#39;s documentary evidence of it, they shipped in the terrorists into the heart of Moscow undetected, the only people on the surveillance cameras to leave the premises were known FSB agents. They gassed the people and then killed them all when they didn&#39;t have to. It was just after 9/11 so Putin was cashing in on 9/11 to crack down on Chechnya. This is all stuff I read about over 10 years ago, so CBF sources, do your own research. The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-War-Truth-Disinformation-Terrorism/dp/1566565960">&quot;The War on Truth: 9/11, Disinformation and the Anatomy of Terrorism&quot;</a> by Nafeez Ahmed is a good start. </p>

<p>The Russians were controlling the supposed terrorists in Chechnya in the 90s, so they could come in and destroy the place. The book  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Jihad-American-Mujahids-Counterterrorism/dp/1585745650">&quot;My Jihad: The True Story of an American Mujahid&#39;s Amazing Journey from Usama Bin Laden&#39;s Training Camps to Counterterrorism with the FBI and CIA&quot;</a> by Aukai Collins is a great read, this guy was there in Grozny and had a first hand account of Russian duplicity.  As for the oligarchy and censorship, stuff that&#39;s not difficult to search yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone here disputes that particular point. Putin maintains 9/11 to be the work of terrorism. Back in 2001, he had a brilliant opportunity to discredit American press and intelligence (supposedly the chessmaster). Instead, he agrees with the narrative and uses it to conduct his own consolidation and eventually to fuel proxy wars in the ME. Notice that RT never questions the official 9/11 narrative. There are some lies that all levels of hierarchy must uphold. The fact that they are the same lies puts them in the same organization (whether they know it or not). Perhaps Putin doesn&#39;t know the role he plays for the global owners, maybe he does. Just the same, he is compromised to a similar degree to American politicians. Let me know if that makes sense to you...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 1999 there was a series of apartment bombings that were blamed on the Chechens, and were used as justification to start the second Chechen war. However, a mound of evidence points to the FSB actually being behind the attacks. Thus, Russia had their own &quot;9/11&quot; just before the United States, and I&#39;m convinced this is why Putin won&#39;t call us out on 911. If he outs us, then we do the same to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like that... kind of an intel Mutually Assured Destruction arrangement (specifically about governmental credibility). It is possible that the illusion if geo-politics is maintained long enough to get a big, population thinning war going between major powers.</p>

<p>In my mind, the Russian government could withstand this exposure much better than the Merkins. Reasons for this might include (but should not be limited to) traditional local Russian imperialism over neighboring states like Chechnya, the relative lack of cultural diversity (especially compared to the US), Putin&#39;s strong political support from Russian urbanites, as well as the renewal of Russian nationalist sentiments which seem to have risen during his reign.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good thread here. In hindsight, I saw the false flag Russian apartment bombings as a sign Putin must&#39;ve known 9/11 was coming and he decided to take advantage and do it himself to get ahead of the Chechen problems. US couldn&#39;t call him on it because it might be a problem for them later.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t see Putin as any kind of good guy, but I&#39;m not convinced he wants to take over the world either. Russians have got less than 20 military bases scattered around the world. The US has got 400+. We made up reasons to invade the Middle East. It might just be bad guys and worse guys, but the USA--no matter where they fall on that spectrum--are definitely more aggressive in our continuing imperialist push.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like an analogy to our current election, where America is Clinton and Russia is Trump. America seems to be the greater evil right now, but I&#39;m sure Russia would not be any better if they had all of the power that America has right now. Just look at how Moscow treated the rest of the Soviet states and the Eastern bloc during the Cold War, and you&#39;ll see that they&#39;re not preferable in the long run. The whole world needs to be cleaned up for the benefit of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia could definitely weather it better. Their situation is relatively isolated, but the lies behind 911 are global in scale. Nonetheless, the Kremlin doesn&#39;t want to commit political suicide and allow unrest to sweep the country. They would have a hard time recovering if the truth got out, despite the reasons you listed (which are true and good points). I think the bigger issue, however, is that if the truth came out on these topics, then it would be like opening the floodgates.

<p>I even agree that civil war in Ukraine is kind of a Russian proxy gig (because it&#39;s in their backyard). Don&#39;t forget the people who helped to get it started (Victoria Nuland and US intel).</p>

<p>I do think that Russia is afraid of the US... maybe not of US military capability, but certainly of the threat that US interests pose to their energy empire. That is a big part of what draws us closer to war... the fact that the Russians know the US military is over-extended, NATO is starting to fracture, and if the US backed forces can displace/kill enough Syrians, then US and Saudi interests can build a pipeline through Syria without harming a hair on Assad&#39;s head. The clock is ticking... the only question in my mind is which event sets it off...</p>
