       The Clinton Narrative Network really doesn't like when their wanna-be-reality doesn't stick to, well, the true reality.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Not so long ago in July, when The FBI Director announced that he wouldn't recommend criminal charges against Clinton,
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/05/opinions/fbi-clinton-decision-gergen/">
        CNN lauded Comey for all his great work
       </a>
       and stated the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So far as we can now tell, the country in this instance has been well served by a leader and an FBI that has been diligent, hard-working and fair. Embittered partisans will disagree, but for my book, the FBI seems to have gotten this one right.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <br/>
       But today, it seems that
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/opinions/fbi-director-comey-should-resign-opinion-callan/index.html">
        CNN changed quite its mind on Comey's qualifications and just asked for his resignation
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Perhaps it's time for the embattled FBI director who seems to have forgotten how to conduct a proper investigation to resign.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <br/>
       I love "unbiased" news networks like CNN. I am sure they contribute so much to the "great trust" people have in the MSM...

       Nixon won in a landslide in '72, even though anyone who was paying attention to the press knew he'd been involved in the Watergate break in. Clinton is in the same situation. She may win this election, but she faces an immediate impeachment battle. And this time a Clinton would be removed from office for verifiable high crimes, not just some back office blowjob with an intern.

       No they didn't. They knew about the break-in, but evidence implicating the involvement of Nixon and other high officials didn't become widely known until after the election.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the DNC headquarters at the Watergate complex on Saturday, June 17, 1972. The FBI investigated and discovered a connection between cash found on the burglars and a slush fund used by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP), the official organization of Nixon's campaign.[4][5]
        <strong>
         In July 1973, evidence mounted against the President's staff
        </strong>
        , including testimony provided by former staff members in an investigation conducted by the Senate Watergate Committee. The investigation revealed that President Nixon had a tape-recording system in his offices and that he had recorded many conversations.

       So they pay Comey to cover up her crimes, now she's getting her news network to shame him? Yeah sure, from an international political criminal perspective, this tactic makes perfect sense. She's used him as a pawn in her giant chess game.

       We are seeing but the tip of the iceberg here. Comey is not some rogue actor in a lone wolf campaign to change the election. Comey is a tool. He is part of a massive bureaucratic machine that is our federal government. Something has changed now, some group of people has decided that Hillary needs to go and they are dropping the hammer. Mark my words there is more to come.

       Obviously, the plan is to go after the foundation, and has been all along.  Missing or undisclosed emails might put a big chip in their image, but bringing down the foundation would be the massive victory they need to regain the publics trust

       CNN is such a pathetic joke of a news network. They've been spinning this election in her favor since it was announced she was even running. For all the shit that Fox News catches, CNN is just as bad if not worse in their own way.

       Visit their websites using adblock and press F5 and hold it for 5 minutes. There are also scripts to do that for you, so when you are at work have the script do it for hours, use up their servers and don't give them ad revenue.
