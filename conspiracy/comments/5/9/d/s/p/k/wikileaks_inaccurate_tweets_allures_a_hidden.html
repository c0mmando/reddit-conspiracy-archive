     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       Full credit is reserved to everyone who has contributed to this subject - I was also inspired by another former post that suggests and further attempts to decipher a message when other writing errors arose in the tweets that later had been discovered from when this whole topic had arisen.
      </p>
      <p>
       After much study on the tweets, I continued to separate the different patterns of errors that arose in the tweets, as people have readily highlighted - Wikileaks is known for not making errors in their tweets.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've identified that there are 3 different rules and I'll date the errors in order that match those rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first rule; rather basic, is to de-crypt the words with a missing letter - by highlighting the missing letter in the word as a conclusive whole answer.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        ma(r)ked (4:45a, 18th)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       = r
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        pri(n)cipally (6:39a, 18th)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       = n
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        w(h)opper (11:36a, 20th)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       = h
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        su(r)prise (3:07p, 20th)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       = r
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        presum(p)tive (6:19a, 21st)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       = p
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        intel(l)igence (3:24p, 21st)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       = l
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        immediat(e)  (24th)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       = e
      </p>
      <p>
       The second rule; a bit more tricky and is a continuation from the first crack attempt at this, is to make a full word or suffix from the additional letter used and then use those new letters. (The first guy had the right idea)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        paedophil(l)ia (9:16a, 18th)
= -ia (a suffix) or = i, a
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Suffix  Edit
-ia
      </p>
      <p>
       Used in forming names of countries, diseases, flowers, and rarely collections of things (such as militaria, deletia).
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        support(t)ing (6:41a, 21st)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       = ting (this is a word) = t, i, n, g
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        recip(i)e (3:15p, 21st)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       = -ie or rather = i, e
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        algorith(i)m (6:32p, 21st)
= him or rather = h, i, m
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The third rule - well, this requires some explanation that's easier to state in one piece:
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks made a tweet on the 22/09 regarding the death of Gavin Macfadyen... coming to the end of the tweet you will read "sock it to him".
      </p>
      <p>
       I became convinced that this sentence is wrongly applied since
       <em>
        sock it to 'someone'
       </em>
       in British means to:
      </p>
      <p>
       "attack or make a forceful impression on someone." - Google definition
      </p>
      <p>
       "to say or do something to someone in a very strong and direct way" -
       <a href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/sock-it-to-someone">
        http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/sock-it-to-someone
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So the correction must be "sock it to
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       " rather than
       <em>
        him
       </em>
       ... ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule assumed here (by deduction, this must be different to the other rules)... We are to remove and replace the letter(s) that are erroneous and note only the existing new letters:
      </p>
      <p>
       ie; h(i)m - remove and replace the "i" and retain the new letters (t)h(e)m... The answer is = t, e
      </p>
      <p>
       When you use all these letters you can find a clear statement minus 2 letters (at-least to the date of creating this post)
      </p>
      <p>
       All the letter's acquired in alphabet order are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Vowels;
      </p>
      <p>
       a, e, e, e, i, i, i,
      </p>
      <p>
       Consonants;
      </p>
      <p>
       g, h, h, l, m, n, n, p, r, r, t, t,
      </p>
      <p>
       Note:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        (round brackets) will indicate letters that haven't been shown or possibly found yet...
       </li>
       <li>
        &lt;angle brackets&gt; is just to indicate an easier read since the word will probably not be found.
       </li>
       <li>
        Someone already unravelled "help him", they're not wrong about their assumption when used here...
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Answer appears to be:
      </p>
      <p>
       Help him regai(n) &lt;his&gt; Int(e)rnet
      </p>
      <p>
       So/Or even,...
      </p>
      <h1>
       Help him regain Internet access
      </h1>
      <p>
       A message to everyone reading this to get politically active and help Julian Assange have his internet access in the Embassy of Ecuador restored? We can assume safely that he's alive and well and the people at wikileaks maybe suggesting he's possibly got something for us we should try to get to know asap?
      </p>
      <p>
       comments are appreciated and I hope people see this getting other people to take a look and try to find anything they can to go with this... I kinda wonder if Wikileak's tweets will get sabotaged for this seemly/slightly early declaration but if this is the message... My judgement is to get this on Reddit asap to gain time before the upcoming US election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last but not least and for my own safety not knowing the full possibilities of providing this - I leave "The Gematria Secret" and as well as "Moon In Capricorn" as something to fall back if ever needed.

       Makes people think he's still alive, still in control of Twitter, sending out an SoS for "the fans" to decipher. Keeps 'em busy on the wild goose chase, speculating over nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever posting these cryptic Tweets could just say
       <em>
        Assange needs help
       </em>
       instead of blatantly hiding an "encrypted" message across a bunch of Tweets. Do you like alternate reality games (ARG)? Because that's what you're playing by trying to find secret messages in those Tweets.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...they're fucking with us. Assange wouldn't approve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could also be wrong and the Tweets could be part of his dead man switch.

       This will need attention and be exploited like the first post so everyone knows...
      </p>
      <p>
       Idea's that come to mind:
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone starting a petition on change.org
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone else petition parliament
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone from London to try and organize a rally outside...
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is we don't know who's exactly cut him - atleast I don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contact Foxnews and Russiatoday when this gets enough viewers about a secret code...
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever outlets in the uk that might take it on (Guardian? Telegraph?) probs need contacting for a story too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trouble is, the guy can't seem to contact on the outside, atleast something is happening... If Wikileaks is compromised then other servers must still be running fine with the continued leaks... But the unusual posts suggest that the people still going on with the project might be facing problems with communicating to the viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps as other posts may even suggest, this could be something rounded up to give wikileaks needed attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, getting this known sounds like a start for the best or worst. It's either a white lie or pretty damn serious - the armed pols suggests it's worth the push.

       I'm not going to try to verify this. But it feels like a distraction from the fact that be might have been extradited.
