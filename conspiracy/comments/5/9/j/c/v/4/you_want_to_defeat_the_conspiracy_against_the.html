       Your vote does not matter. Why do people keep thinking it does?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a serious question. Look at the rampant corruption in every sense of every elected position. By thinking your vote matters, and thinking that if enough people follow suit with you and vote whatever party outside of the common norm to such a majority that it actually WINS the popular vote, that A) the media will reflect that truthfully, and B) the shadow government would let it occur......it seems severely far-fetched.
      </p>
      <p>
       At what point do you realize that it's fruitless to put your hope in a politician of any sort? We, as a society, are beyond the hope of trying to mend the system.

       No, it's not. That's your opinion and it's not supported by anything realistic. Again, just because someone doesn't participate in a rigged election doesn't mean they're supporting whomever wins. That's absurd logic.

       I understand your attempt at pigeon-holing the conversation but you're just wrong in your thinking that we have some kind of duty to participate in rigged systems and if we don't then we're all doomed to our choices. It doesn't work that way. Especially not in a rigged system.

       If you wanted to be active you could start participating in project #StopSoros, but instead you're asking people to ignore the rigged machines and vote 3rd party anyway. From my point of view I'm doing far more than you are, I just said fuck your plane and bailed.

       "Pigeon-holing" how utterly convenient for you,you dont see my logic, i attempt to explain that logic with a very simple scenario and you dodge answering it and accuse me of some ridiculous tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public is already ignoring the rigged machines even with solid proof as it is or i wouldnt even be discussing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public is not involved directly in the evidence that proves its a rigged system so it far too easy for them to remain disconnected and "unaware"
      </p>
      <p>
       By making it THEIR vote that was dismissed they are now directly vested in the outcome of the rigged system.

      <p>
       Exactly. It's an oversimplified scenario and thought experiment that has no real world value in regards to the elections. I didn't dodge it. I asked a question in return that you've dodged yourself. You've also handily dodged my point that you could be more active instead of calling for 3rd party votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say the public is ignoring the rigged machines even with solid proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then you say they should vote 3rd party and watch the outcome in order to get...proof? Which for some reason they won't ignore? This implies those who vote 3rd party will be expecting a certain outcome if they vote and if they don't get that outcome they'll see the corruption?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not see the holes in your logic?

       It is a perfectly simplified sceneario.

      <p>
       You either stand up for a new pilot or you shrug your shoulders CONSENTING to the pilot that wants to crash.

       AGAIN- The public ignores the proof because they have no connection to it.. To them its a bunch of internet "hackers" doing stuff.

       Having it be their vote that is overridden makes them vested in the outcome of the corruption.

       Pffft what are you talking about now?? Overridden votes? How the fuck would they know their vote was overridden at all? You've yet to address these massive holes in your logic except to keep throwing your silly airplane scenario at me again and again.

       No, just no. I'll vote for whom I want or no one at all. Gary Johnson is a fucking retard and most users on here could easily defeat him in a reasonable debate. Jill is sitting at around 1-3% which definitely isn't appealing at this time.

       You're telling people to vote 3rd party like they have some kind of duty to do so, and that by voting 3rd party they'll somehow be awakened to the corruption. I'm saying that's absurd and the system is already rigged, regardless of who people vote for. If they haven't figured it out in past elections why would they this time?

       And I've already countered this - which you've ignored and belittled me instead - and I asked you how do you not see the flaws in your logic? Why would these disconnected people that have voted before in these manipulated elections suddenly care or see the corruption? Is this the first election you've ever been aware of that has been/will be manipulated or something?

       <p>
        You say the public is ignoring the rigged machines even with solid proof. But then you say they should vote 3rd party and watch the outcome in order to get...proof? Which for some reason they won't ignore? This implies those who vote 3rd party will be expecting a certain outcome if they vote and if they don't get that outcome they'll see the corruption?

       The original post said that Jill's percentage of the vote isn't enticing enough to vote for her. So I don't believe it is a silly remark to say that the only way her percentage of the vote will increase is to vote for her. Unless I'm interpreting the original post wrong?
