    <div class="md"><p>Your vote does not matter. Why do people keep thinking it does? </p>

<p>This is a serious question. Look at the rampant corruption in every sense of every elected position. By thinking your vote matters, and thinking that if enough people follow suit with you and vote whatever party outside of the common norm to such a majority that it actually WINS the popular vote, that A) the media will reflect that truthfully, and B) the shadow government would let it occur......it seems severely far-fetched. </p>

<p>At what point do you realize that it&#39;s fruitless to put your hope in a politician of any sort? We, as a society, are beyond the hope of trying to mend the system.</p>

<p>I understand your attempt at pigeon-holing the conversation but you&#39;re just wrong in your thinking that we have some kind of duty to participate in rigged systems and if we don&#39;t then we&#39;re all doomed to our choices. It doesn&#39;t work that way. Especially not in a rigged system. </p>

<p>If you wanted to be active you could start participating in project #StopSoros, but instead you&#39;re asking people to ignore the rigged machines and vote 3rd party anyway. From my point of view I&#39;m doing far more than you are, I just said fuck your plane and bailed. </p>

<p>&quot;Pigeon-holing&quot; how utterly convenient for you,you dont see my logic, i attempt to explain that logic with a very simple scenario and you dodge answering it and accuse me of some ridiculous tactic.</p>

<p>The public is already ignoring the rigged machines even with solid proof as it is or i wouldnt even be discussing this.</p>

<p>The public is not involved directly in the evidence that proves its a rigged system so it far too easy for them to remain disconnected and &quot;unaware&quot;</p>

<p>By making it THEIR vote that was dismissed they are now directly vested in the outcome of the rigged system.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. It&#39;s an oversimplified scenario and thought experiment that has no real world value in regards to the elections. I didn&#39;t dodge it. I asked a question in return that you&#39;ve dodged yourself. You&#39;ve also handily dodged my point that you could be more active instead of calling for 3rd party votes.</p>

<p>You say the public is ignoring the rigged machines even with solid proof.</p>

<p>But then you say they should vote 3rd party and watch the outcome in order to get...proof? Which for some reason they won&#39;t ignore? This implies those who vote 3rd party will be expecting a certain outcome if they vote and if they don&#39;t get that outcome they&#39;ll see the corruption?</p>

<p>Do you not see the holes in your logic?</p>
