They also know that many people will reluctantly support Trump (in spite of the aspects of him they find objectionable) just to vote against Clinton.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this question: Do I believe any 3rd party candidate has a chance in hell of beating Trump?  100% of answers should be no, because they don&#39;t.  And don&#39;t fall for the &quot;they need support to ensure funding&quot; argument either, because of all years, this year they will most definitely get enough votes to guarantee funding.</p>

<p>The CTR goal has shifted to minimizing Clinton deserter support for Trump.  Every vote that goes 3rd party that would have gone to Trump will help anoint Clinton.  Do not help crown the demon queen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think that the majority of democrats and republicans (or leaning independents) are ever going to vote 3rd in enough numbers to actually win, then you are living in a cloistered fantasy world.  70% of votes will always go to the main two parties (at least until there is a real voice given to the 3rd party, one that will exist for more than the 10 months leading up to the election).  That 30% that remains will get split between the two parties and whatever independents are running.  </p>

<p>Regardless of what you think, there will be no 3rd party win this year.  If you want to doubt that and vote with your conscience, then that&#39;s your prerogative, but ask yourself whether the damage of a Hillary Clinton Presidency is something you feel comfortable risking on a 100-to-1 shot... and really think about what kind of damage she will do.  It&#39;s quite real and quite terrifying.</p>

<p>And obama was a guy i was watching since 2000 and was hoping he would win in 2008. So after that, i dont trust any candidate on a major party ticket, unless heavy reforms take place in said party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I know, but that&#39;s the point.  Think of it like this. If Clinton is actually ahead (which I find hard to believe, but whatever) then every vote she loses is bad for her chances, obviously, but every vote she loses that her direct competition gains is a net loss of two votes.</p>

<p>Example: Clinton has 44% of the vote. Trump has 41%. 3rd combined has the other 15%.  If Clinton loses 1% of her voters to the 3rd party, it&#39;s still 43:41 against Trump.  If she loses that 1% to Trump instead, then it&#39;s 43:42.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>And don&#39;t fall for the &quot;they need support to ensure funding&quot; argument either, because of all years, this year they will most definitely get enough votes to guarantee funding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this is actually a valid argument, conditionally.  If you live in a stronghold state, and like a third party candidate or party, there really isn&#39;t a compelling reason not to vote for them.  It doesn&#39;t matter if the winner of the state wins by one vote or a million, with very few exceptions (Maine comes to mind) it is winner takes all, electoral-wise.  So, why not vote for a 3rd party to see if they can get the 5% popular vote needed for federal funding?  Your vote isn&#39;t going to impact the electoral math.</p>

<p>The formula changes in swing states however.  There &#39;lesser evilism&#39;  actually makes sense as a voting strategy, in which case voting 3rd party could result in the worst-case scenario, depending on who you think the worst candidate is. So, if you live in a state like Ohio or Florida, voting 3rd party could have some seriously unintended consequences if people do that in any serious numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every vote that goes 3rd party that would have gone to Trump will help anoint Clinton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this just isn&#39;t accurate.  It only applies to potential swing states.  <a href="http://www.270towin.com/maps/2016-election-battleground-states">See this map</a> to see which states are considered too close to call currently.  Obviously polls can be off, so it is better to look at polling in your state, demographics, and historical trends and decide your own comfort level as to whether or not it could become a swing state.</p>

<p>Full disclosure:  I intend to vote Green and am in a stronghold state which will most certainly vote for Clinton (Maryland). I&#39;m not even really that much into Stein and have some reservations about the party but do believe that having viable third parties is a good thing.  That will never happen if they don&#39;t receive votes.</p>
