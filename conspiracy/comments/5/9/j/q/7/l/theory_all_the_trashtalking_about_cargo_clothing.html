        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The fashion industry has deemed cargo clothing to be both too long-lasting, and unprofitable - hence all the recent downtalking about the style in the last few years.  They want everyone to think its not cool so that people will switch off of cargo shorts &amp; pants into something shorter-lived and more expensive.</p>

<p>I for one will never part with my be-pocketed clothes.  They are comfortable, I like the style, they are reasonably affordable - they last for YEARS longer than any other clothing, their brand name doesn&#39;t mean shit - and if they ever stopped making them 100%, I would learn to make them myself.  Cargo shorts and pants for life!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok good point. But whos mocking? People in real life are mocking you for wearing cargo shorts. ....REALLY? Or is it talking heads on television or in the media who claim to represent &quot;fashion&quot;? These are not real people or real opinions, its manufactured bullshit not worth giving a second thought to. It should have no relevance on your life, what you wear, or purchase, or how you feel about your self. If it does, they are succeeding in brainwashing you with fear  based propaganda all so they can make money off you by feeding into a negative feedback loop. ...And we&#39;ve come full circle. Guess it was a good topic after all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cargo clothing is a style that came about as a result of people legitimately using and needing &quot;a shit ton of pockets&quot;.  It isn&#39;t like streetwear, where the style only exists because a celebrity wears it, or because it has brand recognition plastered all over it.</p>

<p>What about pockets do you think is childish?  Do adults tend to not need pockets, but kids do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that pockets are childish, it&#39;s the amount of them. No person realistically needs that many moronic looking pockets. Plus, if you were to wear cargo shorts/pants into any formal or business setting, it would look inappropriate.</p>
