       The fashion industry has deemed cargo clothing to be both too long-lasting, and unprofitable - hence all the recent downtalking about the style in the last few years.  They want everyone to think its not cool so that people will switch off of cargo shorts &amp; pants into something shorter-lived and more expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one will never part with my be-pocketed clothes.  They are comfortable, I like the style, they are reasonably affordable - they last for YEARS longer than any other clothing, their brand name doesn't mean shit - and if they ever stopped making them 100%, I would learn to make them myself.  Cargo shorts and pants for life!

       It's got some significance, and psychological evaluations of people who were mocked for wearing said clothing might reveal they wore it less or got rid of them entirely after the mocking.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would they buy to replace them? How can we make money off of such a situation?

       ok good point. But whos mocking? People in real life are mocking you for wearing cargo shorts. ....REALLY? Or is it talking heads on television or in the media who claim to represent "fashion"? These are not real people or real opinions, its manufactured bullshit not worth giving a second thought to. It should have no relevance on your life, what you wear, or purchase, or how you feel about your self. If it does, they are succeeding in brainwashing you with fear  based propaganda all so they can make money off you by feeding into a negative feedback loop. ...And we've come full circle. Guess it was a good topic after all.

       As someone who wears cargo pants/shorts, and thus notices when they are being mocked - I mostly see it on the internet.  Anonymous people seem to love talking bad about the look.

       I think that's more of what the conspiracy consists of, talking heads making it seem as if people are mocking to drive up sales of alternate clothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they really aren't making fun of them except for the few people that unquestionably believe the talking heads.

       Idk, I personally don't like a shit ton of pockets on my pants. I only really carry a phone and wallet with me. My issue with cargo pants/shorts is that they look childish and unnecessary. Would be interesting if they pushed the trend away to cut costs on materials though.

       Cargo clothing is a style that came about as a result of people legitimately using and needing "a shit ton of pockets".  It isn't like streetwear, where the style only exists because a celebrity wears it, or because it has brand recognition plastered all over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about pockets do you think is childish?  Do adults tend to not need pockets, but kids do?

       It's not that pockets are childish, it's the amount of them. No person realistically needs that many moronic looking pockets. Plus, if you were to wear cargo shorts/pants into any formal or business setting, it would look inappropriate.

       I don't think cargo clothing is at risk for fear of taking over the market of formal clothing.  I don't think anyone is arguing that here do you?

       What makes one pocket more moronic looking than another?  Why do you think the pocket looks moronic?

       he doesn't need the pockets so that's fine, don't buy these kinds of pants, no need to insult them tho. But one thing that's not true is them lasting a long time. Jeans last longer.

       Sometimes jeans last longer.  I would argue that jeans themselves are such an iconic clothing option that the fashion industry would love to take them down - but knows they can't so they don't try.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skinny jeans last notoriously not-long-at-all though.

       good point yeah it depends on the type of jeans

       I think we all would.  I don't know anything about Che, although I do know that his face gets used by Western, pseudo-Communist edgelords to try and make themselves look cool.  That is the only context I've ever seen him in.

       I think this is true about fleece outerwear too.  A genuine polartec sweater/jacket will last 15 years and can be washed in a machine and tumble-dried but they want you to buy new worthless crap every year.  Even polartec is quitting fleece and producing flavor-of-the-month idiotic knit fabrics.

       I'm on the fence about fleece.  All my fleece stuff has "pilled" significantly after maybe only a year or so of consistent wear.
