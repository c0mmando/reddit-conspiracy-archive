       On Tuesday I noticed CNN dropped the 24/7 Trump bashing. Actually started covering wikileaks and giving trump fair coverage. NYT has been burying and spinning wikileaks for months, and they started covering it properly. Even Huffington Post released an article on the Pedesta leaks tying the HRC campaign to Saudi money. The madness continues on Wednesday. More pro-trump coverage on CNN. They have changed their tune from skewing polls with a 12 point clinton lead, and now Anderson Cooper is reporting on how the "race is tightening. The timing of this change in reporting seems to coincide with the Project Veritas videos. I feel like the establishment is pulling the plug on the HRC campaign. They either know Trump is positioned for a landslide, or there is bombshell dirt on the way. Thoughts?

       Just a theory, but the parts seem in place:
      </p>
      <p>
       1- They've got or killed Assange.
      </p>
      <p>
       2- Dead Man's switch is thrown, they know what it is and they've realized they can't stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       3- Throw her overboard.

       I've considered the exact same thing. I think Assange is alive, bc it's in their interest to keep him alive to keep the switch from dumping but who knows. Hopefully something big comes this week

       ever see the show LOST? i keep imagining Assange being held captive being forced to enter a code so the switch doesn't go off like Desmond had to enter 4,8,15,16,23 and 42 or something would the island would explode or something.

       Both are very possible. The 2nd one more so than the 1st. Especially since HRC has been backed up by so much corporate money. My personal theory though is that maybe journalists are actually having integrity and are sick of being told what to say/report on.  Like Glenn Greenwald leaving to write for the intercept. Cenk uygur leaving msnbc for the young turks (who are usually good except for right now).  Amber Lyon leaving cnn for...herself.   who knows.

       Just out of curiosity, why do you say this? Because before, I couldn't stand them, like maybe 2 years or so ago, and now I like them. It seems we have an opposite mindset.

       I saw some video where he took a ridiculous trump stance, but failed to acknowledge clinton has done the exact same stuff.  He's usually fair and considers all the facts, but sometimes personal opinion completely gets in the way.

       I havent subscribed to any one theory yet, maybe trump is truthful but the way he conducts himself is very suspicious.
I wont vote for him because he is on a major party ticket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im leaning towards the powers that be what trump to win, and they are using reverse psychology psyops on us... but that theory has holes too.

       They've realized that if they continue to make it seem to be an absolute certainty that Hillary will win, then there is the possibility that people will take it for granted and not go out and vote.  They are stirring the pot in order to keep people engaged in the election so that they don't become complacent, allowing the potential for a Trump victory.

       lmao, i was watching that too. I follow the MSM just to keep a pulse on their narrative, but the coverage shift seems rather odd. seems like they're distancing themselves from her.

       What if that is what they want?  They want us all to take notice and slowly get mad so when Hillary takes office, we will all revolt and there is where it starts.

       These CNN anchors are unbelievable. Just now getting into the Wikileaks and "breaking it down" for us commoners today. I love how they act like this is new information. I'm starting to think they are bracing for the worst.

       The POTUS is just a figurehead for who is in power. Trump will be our next president. It's all baked in.  Did the MSM finally raise the white flag? If not, they will. Market forces will demand it.

       Hillary is dead. She leaked too much and bill's pedo island trips put too much daylight on. She lost when we had to stop congress getting to the rulers communications. Remember the controllers have been patient since the THULE society days. We will wait four more for the next chance.  If we can't start the fall of the USA as outlined by the cfr and roll out COG before. Its so easy.

       Agreed. Trump will be a speed bump for globalism. The U.S. Citizens are essentially putting Washington in a time-out for 4 years.
