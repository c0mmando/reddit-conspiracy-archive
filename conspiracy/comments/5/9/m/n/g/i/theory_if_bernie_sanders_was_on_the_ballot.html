    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think HIS life was threatened. I think he was roughed up (see the wound under his eye when he&#39;s stepping out of the race) and his family, probably grandchildren, were threatened.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll have to search a bit, but the video of his delegate brother still nominating him after he&#39;s stepped down- the look on bernies face is pure anguish, embarrassment, love and rage at the same time, and his eye wound is fresh. I think it really killed him to step back. I also think he did so in a way that he could legally get back in should Hillary fumble. Unfortunately she could bite the head off a baby on live TV at this point and the press would spin it in her favor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would assume the CIA created her, so there&#39;s that also.  And the NSA doesn&#39;t seem to actually do shit (other than maybe providing the leaks) and the Senate will never fuck with her... so basically she has Congress and the public to worry about.  With increasing censorship of the internet and her stranglehold on the msm, the public is a long shot to matter in time.  And Congress is half in the tank for her anyways (fucking shills) and slow to act, but Chavez, Gowdy and Jordan are fucking stars, so you never know...</p>

It&#39;s easy to call a theory &#39;delusional&#39; when one lacks concrete evident to support it. But if one is in possessions of facts surrounding the claim, it&#39;s possible to make logic assertions on the missing information. With adequate reasoning and deduction you can get to the bottom of anything.

But to have any chance of still being able to get the nomination at the convention he had to be there physically. A common thing for these conventions is they won&#39;t allow someone to attend who does not support the majority candidate. With them there he still had a chance to pick up more votes but it didn&#39;t go that way.</p>

His wife is even bashing Clinton a little.  I was disappointed to see him come out for her, but I guess I can see it a little. I was a sanders supporter, but now I&#39;m for stein. As far as the house goes though, it is not out of reality for him to have been able to buy that on his own. </p>

I respect you for admitting you made a mistake and hopefully it will encourage you to spend more time researching and studying to try and decrease the likeliness of making future mistakes. Feel free to PM me if you have questions about the world and politics. I have dual bachelors in Psychology and Finance, and am about to finish my Masters degrees in Economics and Political Science(Foreign Identity Politics) BTW,  I too am wrong from time to time, but at the age of 35 I have likely made enough mistakes to hopefully help a few people to not make the same faults that I did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately it&#39;s not like that. If millions of people stand up and fight the media will paint us as terrorists and we&#39;ll be put into prison camps, or live as revolutionary refugees. Some of our families would push us away, and I&#39;m only saying that because I know mine certainly would. </p>

<p>Some people out there don&#39;t believe us. Millions more than us eat MSM and any form of mainstream media. I talked to two ladies today that genuinely thought Trump raped someone. I showed them all the evidence against such accusations and they couldn&#39;t believe what I was saying. </p>

<p>My point being (tl;dr), we must choose the exact right moment to launch such a movement or we will be demolished. </p>

I agree with you, waiting much longer isn&#39;t a good idea, but I&#39;m a normal dude from Kansas that is still a couple months from hitting 20. This game that is being played is happening miles above my head, and I&#39;m just someone that was curious enough to look up.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you underestimate how many people have been woken up during this election cycle. But then again, maybe I&#39;m overestimating it.</p>

<p>My main point is that nowadays, most people care a lot about the people around them if they&#39;re in trouble. MSM makes it seem like this world is all chaos and full of evil people, and they do that purely to spread fear and doubt. But most people that I talk to are very caring and loving people. Maybe that&#39;s just midwest mentality, I can&#39;t say the same thing for people in big cities, but I think that if s**t did go down, people would join in if they saw people being shot or jailed in mass</p>

<p>But the way I foresee it...</p>

<p>The media would break the revolution into smaller &quot;unrelated&quot; movements in their coverage. Something nationwide is hard to ignore, but it&#39;s easy to ignore riots in LA, NY, etc if you can say &quot;at least it&#39;s not here.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;movements&quot; would be painted as fringe activists, with each one having a different aspect emphasized. If people don&#39;t see the common thread or what they themselves have in common, why should they care?</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to manipulate the majority of people, because they don&#39;t have time to dig deeper. </p>

Is it the 40+ hour work week that you&#39;ll work for 30 to 40 years, going to a job you most likely don&#39;t enjoy unless you&#39;re the lucky 15% of the population that DO like their jobs? That whole 40 hour week just to pay for your bills and your house that you rarely get to enjoy since 8-10 hours are spent at work, 2-4 are spent running necessary errands, and 6-9 are spent sleeping. So if you work minimal hours, are quick with errands, and are sleep deprived every day, then maybe you can enjoy that house for 8 hours a day. But that&#39;s highly unlikely to be the case.</p>

<p>Better make sure that you put all that extra money into savings too, because it&#39;s financially irresponsible to spend your money on unnecessary things like a nice lunch, or going out to the movies. No, you better save as much as you can so that when you&#39;re retired, you can finally enjoy your life. But oh wait, then most of that money will be spent just to keep your health when you get older, so you can keep &quot;enjoying life&quot;.</p>

<p>We live in a capitalist society that has developed to the point where large profits are made off of EVERYTHING. You are a walking, breathing, profit machine for the wealthiest people in the world. Every aspect of your life is profit for people who don&#39;t care in the slightest about you. So yes, little worker slave, keep defending your beloved capitalism that shits on people who are worth less than 10 million</p>

<p>if theres an accurate/legit vote and count, we might be very surprised by the 10% turnout for HRC, she is detested or untrusted by many. </p>

<p>her legacy might be having the lowest vote in a POTUS race ever, that would be very embarrassing to say the least. and history book worthy in the worst way (snigger)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he would beat Trump in an actual election.  At the end of the day, he&#39;s just another politician, and literally everyone is tired of them.  People want Trump because he&#39;s an outside voice finally.  The fact that Sanders doesn&#39;t play along with the establishment just makes it easier to paint him as a failure, since he hasn&#39;t actually done anything meaningful in the 74 years he&#39;s been alive.  In addition, he clearly <em>is</em> willing to play ball, since he endorsed Comrade Hillary, and did half of her campaign for her</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, he&#39;s currently the most popular politician in the country, far surpassing either Clinton or Trump. Polls leading up the the primaries showed him winning in a landslide against Trump in the national election because he doesn&#39;t have Clinton&#39;s baggage and to some degree means what he says. His rhetoric has been backed up by what he&#39;s done over the past 50 years, and he&#39;s consistently been on the right side of history for LGBT rights, minority rights, workers rights, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His popularity doesn&#39;t mean that he would still be this popular if he was in the race, getting slandered every day.  Trump has the entire Western media against him, bashing him 24/7, and Hillary has 20+ years of terrible reputation working against her.  They are both less popular, because all of their dirty laundry is out in plain view.  If Bernie had spent the last 6 months being slandered every day, I seriously doubt he would be this popular</p>
