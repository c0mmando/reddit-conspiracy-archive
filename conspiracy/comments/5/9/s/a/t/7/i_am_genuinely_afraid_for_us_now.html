       In a few days, a coup d'état will occur in our country and we have only ourselves as a nation to be blamed.
I grew up actually believing that we were in a more or less functioning democratic country.  I enjoyed my 
U.S. Government class in high school and was reading Newsweek when most kids were still reading comic books.
Was their corruption sometimes and bad guys?  Sure. But ultimately I believed that our government would recover from 
whatever scandal, as it had done in the past, and everything would eventually be ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then as I got older and slightly bitter I begin to do some reading.
I discovered after much skeptical research that Lyndon Banes Johnson was complicit in the death of John Kennedy.
The first coup d'état took place in Dallas in 1963.  From that moment on- that seminal moment in American history, no future election
could be trusted to be completely the will of the people.  A government that is anything but fully transparent is a failed government.
We were meant to manage ourselves as a country.  A free person should have freedom to do as they please, within ethical limits.  The
ideas of our government were designed to be a reflection of that phrase, "by the people, for the people".  Instead we are seperated
from our government.  They are "The Government".  They know what they're doing.  No need to question it.  Sometimes bad people in 
our government do something naughty or sensational and they get a little slap on the wrist but that's ok.  They must have been doing
something right to have gotten elected so we support them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I joined the Army at 17.  I actually believed I was doing something noble.  I was a private in the Union Army just after
the shelling Fort Sumter, ready to defend my country and its ideals of freedom.  What a silly fool I was.  After four years I was
finished with it all and wanted so bad to be free.  I've stumbled about here in the country, going from job to job and woman to woman
ever since.  I'm done with all that.  I discovered that problems follow you so running away is not an option.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it's 2016.  We, as a nation, just witnessed the most blatant con ever pulled on the nation, yet.  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,
a former presidents wife and target of multiple criminal investigations and a rich, bigoted New Jersey moron are competing for the White House.
Knowing the politically correct climate we live in, Donald Trump knowingly acted like a complete douchebag and still managed to garner a 
large following.  His opponent, a total hag and crook who will sacrifice her own grandchild for the right price, has bribed and even murdered
her way to the top, trampling over a Vermont senator who could very well have changed the direction of this country for the better and bought off the 
director of the F.B.I.  Our F.B.I.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posit that Trump is colluding with her and if that's true then it can only pile on more shame of what we have allowed.  In a few days, Clinton
will be President.  I for one am not going to sit in the mud.  I see a bad moon rising.
      </p>
      <p>
       And consider this: if Hillary becomes president in less than a week think of what she just got away with.  Blatantly and in plain sight of the American
people, she stole the white house through corruption and murder.  We watched them dispatch Assange for releasing obviously damning evidence of her
crimes.  And yet we all site idly by and do nothing.  Now the fear that you are under control is perhaps starting to set in, here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think not just of what she got away with but of what she will try to get away with next.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are about to cross the thresh-hold into tyranny.  There is no going back.  What comes next is more distraction, more censorship and soon
after that... well- let's just say you'll never say essays like this anymore among many other very bad things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what can we do?  It depends on what you are willing to lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more complacent we become, the more enthralled by the latest TV or film franchise, the more we need that new electronic gadget, the more passive we
will be.  Sure, our government commits murder all over the world, like the kidnapping and probable murder of Jullian Assange, a man who was trying to keep 
the playing field even.  But that's ok.  I'm safe her in the Capital City.  Those yucky District rebels can't hurt me here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we don't do something now, she and her predecessors will do everything in their power to silence all detractors.  Freedom of speech will likely be 
the first thing we lose in this coming brave, new world.
      </p>
      <p>
       What frightens me most is that these things never end well.  One day, perhaps soon, the people will become tired of the coming tyranny and there will be blood.
I don't want to be here for that.  I am looking into finishing school and applying for Canadian citizenship.
       <br/>
       I want to stand up for my country, but I don't think it ever really was mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to miss Washington D.C. and all it's pretty museums.  I'm going to miss the sweet summer nights of the Deep South.  I'm going to miss the magic
of spring in Southern California.  I'm going to miss frigid cold of Buffalo, NY in a warm pizza parlor.  I'm going to miss the country we could have been
were it not for greed.  Greed will be the end of us if we don't find another way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm no fool.  I'm getting out before they take that freedom away.

       Sorry about the spelling errors.  Too stoned to find a spell check plugin and I want to get this posted.

       There is no coup d'etat going down.  People are sussing out the reality they are in, and the systems you have actually work if all y'all choose to use them.  Witness the recent court events in Oregon.  I reckon we should be wary of rhetoric that leads us towards violence and destruction.

       Agreed. 60-90% of people are already slaves. The Clinton /Bush regime has been doing what Hillary got caught with for years. No drastic changes coming. Little war to boost public opinion, throw us a little bone somehow economically while overall nothing really changes. Tell us nice things on TV. Status quo here in America.

       I really enjoyed your post, but unfortunately for me you lost me when you called Trump rich (as if being rich was a crime) and a bigot (he is not at all racist, that is all media manipulation). You could have called him many things that he is, like arrogant, pompous, a womanizer even... But he is not racist, that's a lie. At first I thought Trump was a joke, but have you listened to him speak lately? He is talking about things no one since JFK has even dared talk about in public. If he was a plant, whatever they did to him, maybe it was the personal attacks, but he had broken loose of his shackles. Hillary is 1000% corrupt, she lied, cheated, possibly even had people killed, what they may have done with Assange is absolutely appalling. But Trump is a man with morals, I really be live that, look at his children, look at his past history. He is the same man he was 30 years ago, this was actually the video that first peaked my interest in him.

       Then I read a speech he gave a little while ago, it was all about taking the government back from these crooks and liars, about outlawing special interest lobbying for politicians, so many other things that make sense. Until Election Day, when they lie to us and declare Hillary the winner I will continue to be hopeful that we can somehow take it back from her. It is true, with Trump it's a 50/50, but let's get him in, and see if he loves America as much as he says he does, if not then we can get him out of office. But when I listen to him talk, I hear honesty and feel like he actually does care, I'm usually very good at reading people, in fact when i listen to Hillary talk I literally cringe and move around uncomfortably, because I know.. And I can feel.. She is a fucking unethical liar and a crook. I do hope that enough people get together and do something about it if she does steal the election, but until that time comes I truly believe our best option is to make sure Trump can win it, and he will need big numbers to counteract the dead voters, the double mail in democratic voters, the electronic machine rigging, the bribes .. Etc. she's a crook of the highest order. Have hope friend! Until the time comes when I will join you.

       You are 100% correct! 
You know what the difference between those three people? Trump will benefit most of the US does well economically, he owns properties and businesses all over this United States of America. This is where he is invested, and he is a patriot, he loves America and what it has given him. Hillary hates regular people, and America. Fuck her

       You are wrong about Trump, he is the real deal. Congressional term limits. Border security. Simplified tax code. Fucking America first! Trump is our last hope to disrupt TPTB and defeat the Globalist agenda and begin to heal and rebuild our country. When our founding fathers created our government they pictured a man like Donald J Trump being president. A successful business man who was willing to volunteer his time to lead the country and defend and uphold the constitution. A patriot but not a lifetime public servant. If you haven't read this speech give it a go, maybe it will calm you down. Thank you for your courage
      </p>
      <p>
       In 26 days, we are going to win the state, and we are going to win the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing the political establishment will not do, and no lie they will not tell, to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Washington establishment, and the financial and media corporations that fund it, exists for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself. For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents an existential threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not simply another 4-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure. We’ve seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, likewise, the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates. Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before – and we won’t let them do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a struggle for the survival of our nation. This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not just conspiracy but reality, and you and I know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the central base of world political power is here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their financial resources are unlimited. Their political resources are unlimited. Their media resources are unlimited. And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our political establishment has no soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you. The only force strong enough to save this country is you. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People.
      </p>
      <p>
       They control the Department of Justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States – in the back of her airplane, while on the runway – for 39 minutes – to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what he’s done to one of our great institutions. Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings, and far more – and yet he let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a conspiracy against you, the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn’t need to do this. I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks. I’m doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell. But they are wrong, it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else – and I know what’s like to be an insider. Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam. Because I used to be part of the club, I’m the only one who can fix it. I’m doing this for the people, and this movement is just right – and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise. They know, that if we win, their power is gone and returned to you. The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted, and replaced with a bright future – but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future, or whether we let the American people decide our future.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business. We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit, we will end the rule of special interests, we will put a stop to the raiding of our country – and the disenfranchisement of our people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th. Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people.
      </p>

       You do know that his speech writer wrote that, right? The fact of the matter is that he spews just as much bullshit as his cousin, Hillary. Neither are fit to serve. His egoism would consume us just as much as her corruption(which he is a part of).

       . That's far enough removed to have little to no familial ties. Hell, Eleanor was FDR's 5th cousin and they had children together. If you go back far enough we are all technically cousins.

           For every negative thing you say, I can offer the paradox. Yes, things appear to be degenerating in many ways. Yet the number of people who doubt the "Official Story" and are pushing back on the narrative and not doing as they've been told hasn't been this great in the USA since the 1960s. Trump is terrible, but he's channeling something that may yet morph into something better, something he's not a part of but just a sign of.

       You're welcome to head to Canada, but things there ain't much better. Did you see that video in the Canadian Parliament where (elite bloodline phony) Trudeau grabs and manhandles that female political opponent? How about his draconian moves on freedom of speech? Not to mention the slow internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'd say, be cautious and attentive, but don't give up the ship yet. These are crazy, wild, exciting, anxious, strange, strange times. I'd recommending praying, see where it gets you.

       I hadn't heard of this, given the fact I don't follow Canadian politics, but haha! OH so Canadian, if you watch the video, you can clearly see a few politicians effectively blocking, like in Basketball, an opposition member, and when he tries to go around a few times, Trudeau walks over and pulls him through, The woman jumps into the wall, pretending to be shoved. This is exactly like a soccer player diving onto the ground to draw the ref's red card, or at least a yellow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know all the rules of that parliament, but there are clearly issues about crossing over, and members blocking, and accusing the other side to win favour from viewers. kinda pathetic really, watch for yourself and tell me this is not a soccer player dive!

       "not the sharpest tool in the shed." 
Neither of them are fit to be president. Hillary is basically dying and a pathological liar while Trump has the mental capacity of a ten year old and also a pathological liar. Ain't a snowball's chance in hell that I'll vote for either, but if I did it would be the person that has a history of politics and diplomacy. Trump's comments over this presidential campaign has proven that he's a fool and it's likely he'll be played like a fiddle from foreign governments, he doesn't know how to articulate a thought into words nor does he know how to shut up.

       Claiming bankruptcy is not a crime, it is an opportunity offered by the law. There is nothing illegal in his tax returns, he is a businessman. He uses the means offered by the law to reduce his financial losses and maximize his earnings. Totally legal and everybody with a working brain should do this. You would rather see a lying corrupt criminal in the White House that uses the sellout media and bribery of state officials to avoid criminal charges? Wow.

       Yes I have heard about it, please supply me with evidence that Trump has been on it because I did not find any evidence. Dodging taxholes is not patriotic indeed, however Trump has never been in a position to close these loopholes. Clinton has been and has never closed them. Clinton largest donors are the rich elite, big banks, big pharma and muslim royalty. Do you really think she has the interest of the average Joe in mind? I don't think so, her track record shows it too. Trump is not the average Joe, but the average Joe will never become president. Trump is your chance to end the oligarchy rule. I am not an American, but there is a revolution going on in the world of awakening and shaking off the false promise of globalism. Brexit was the first victory, this election can be the second and biggest yet. End the rule of the globalists and continue the revolution! The eyes of the world are upon America.

       The same flight logs that damn Bill Clinton, indicate that Trump was on board several times. Add to that mix, the fact that Trump has been a guest at multiple homes owned by Epstein, and you have a recipe for disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if heTrump hasn't been in a position to close the tax loopholes, utilising them in the first place should be construed as immoral in terms of the tax code -- it's hypocritical for someone to be expected to uphold the law when they espouse circumvention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton hasn't closed them. She utilises the same loopholes. She shouldn't be running either -- especially not since she and her husband use foundation money for personal matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I have previously stated, all politicians serve to empower themselves, not the average Joe. I have a degree in Political Science(Foreign Affairs), but my knowledge isn't limited. I pay especially close attention to my Country's politics. I have seen too much corruption all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump serves the Oligarchy. Clinton's emails more than demonstrate this. She used Trump to flush the Republican Party of its moderate contenders -- only to enliven the extremists and villify the entire party via the media(Fox News is one of her largest donors). Trump isn't on our side, but rather, that of the Oligarchy.

       You don't want to move to Canada, bunch of naive pussies. They think the world wants to hug and hold hands like in a North American suburb. None have ever had a real world experience with someone from a country where they will kill you dead for your sexual preference, your religion, your haircut, etc. go hitchhike through Africa and the Middle East, then come back here and tell me about how we need to be more accepting of others. Also, calling Trump a rich bigot was where he lost me, why do people hate others based on their success? Like he's rich.. Okay so what... Is it because you're jealous? and there is no proof that trump is a bigot, what? Lol that's ridiculous

       You are 100% correct! 
You know what the difference between those three people? Trump will benefit most of the US does well economically, he owns properties and businesses all over this United States of America. This is where he is invested, and he is a patriot, he loves America and what it has given him. Hillary hates regular people, and America. Fuck her
