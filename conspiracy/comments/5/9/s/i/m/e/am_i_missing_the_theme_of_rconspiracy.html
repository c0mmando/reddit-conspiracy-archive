<p>If you take away a few of the extra crazy people from r/conspiracy and actually changed the name to something other than conspiracy you would see that 75% of the things posted here are legit and usually include video or something to back it up.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll post some normal civil anti Hillary stuff in r/politics and see how it goes! You know stuff that actually affects America more than Trump bragging up hooking up with girls 10 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will be so beautiful! I was soooo inspired by the last debate when Hillary basically gave us a lecture on why we should go to war with Russia AND blamed them for leaking e-mails which was proven to be a lie. </p>

<p>Yes. Hillary will probably win but I&#39;m sure it had nothing to do with media and criminals helping her brainwash people. Have you went through her leaked e-mails or you don&#39;t care because it&#39;s Hilldawg!?</p>

<p>Trump has a 2% lead in Florida and I read an article today saying that Hillary had the 2% lead. They referred to the poll that actually has Trump at 2%... accidental though I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>He refuses to release his tax returns and other business records so we gave no way of knowing who he owns money to and might have a conflict of interest with.  Because they admit to having emails and other documents but refuse to release them we do not know if trump has the same issues. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing that has been released about Clinton that I&#39;m positive is not done by most ever other major politicians out there.  The difference is that I believe she&#39;s not doing anything different than others have done are are doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Trump. Pro-abortion, then anti-abortion. Anti-deportation, then pro-deportation. Wants to build a wall, but imports his own labor. Wants to lower taxes on the rich and let the poor carry the burden...knowing the rich barely pay any taxes anyway.  Claims he can &quot;get rid of ISIS.&quot; &quot;How?&quot; &quot;Be strong.&quot; Okay, buddy. Wants to fix healthcare. How? &quot;Abolish it.&quot; Okay, buddy. No ideas, just throws word salads out and people eat it up. Makes deals where he tells those he enters into a contract he&#39;ll do something...then doesn&#39;t. Every. Single. Time. What makes you think the &quot;contract&quot; he&#39;s making with you, he&#39;ll keep? It&#39;s stupid to believe him, just as it&#39;s stupid to believe Clinton. They&#39;re the fucking same, one&#39;s just able to compose complete sentences on the fly and the other just says, &quot;like, nuclear and tha cyber&quot; a lot like a gottdamned memberberry. They&#39;re both crooks, one&#39;s just better at it (Clinton). Trump isn&#39;t even trying to win the election, but people are so ready to believe absolutely anybody that they&#39;re lining up asking to be in fealty to him (meanwhile, <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/readout-of-donald-j.-trumps-meeting-with-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-ne">who&#39;s <em>he</em> in fealty to?</a>). It&#39;s fucking insanity.</p>

<p>And everyone thinks they&#39;re revolutionary for supporting Trump or Clinton - it&#39;s all a trap, the media has told you they&#39;re both fit for office and they both are not AT ALL. She&#39;ll get us into WWIII and he&#39;ll have us in camps making crappy t-shirts with gold embellishments. Either way, we&#39;re trapped and it&#39;s ridiculous that anyone believes either is a choice to be proud of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yup, this sub is totally loaded with vote suppression, for example, you&#39;ll notice your thread here will not remain on the first page of &quot;HOT&quot; for more than a couple of minutes. </p>

<p>There is no theme, the moderators I believe are doing a good job, but it&#39;s likely outside forces (who knows what org, or PR firm) that is coming on here and controlling thread votes, to push certain ones up the front page and others down and out of sight.</p>

<p>In short, no theme, just manipulation. I&#39;ve been saying for a while, check <strong>NEW</strong> often (see the SUB navigation menu), you could check HOT once or twice a day but you pretty much know what stories you&#39;ll get there. Rising is pretty good, but that&#39;s where you&#39;ll see odd movement of posts. I saw this thread by going to New.</p>

<p><em>Edit: I must say I&#39;ve noticed vote manip much more since Jullian Assange&#39;s internet got cut off a couple of weeks ago, and voting trends here doubled for worse. There was also rumors of new moderators taking over <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, but the latter was already a write off.</em> </p>

<p>Make no mistake, Reddit is fully compromised, you just have to know how to get around the censorship controls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad a lot of people on here think trump is the answer. Ridiculous, talking to them is like 
Edit: I took out the insult
&quot;big government is trying to take my guns away. They want to know everything and intrude in my life.
But hell yeah! We should crack down on the illegals and have a government monitor muslims.&quot;</p>

<p>The ironic part about the &#39;trump movement&#39; is you have half the people who don&#39;t want big government dictating telling them what to do. Yet they do want big government to ban muslims from entering and build a big wall at the border. Hypocritical irony at its best.  The funniest part is they turn a blind eye to bill Clinton having called trump before he ran, and the 200k he donated to the Clinton foundation. Not to mention to Hillary&#39;s campaign in 2007 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the thing is that what you just posted is not much better than some ridiculous shit people post on here.</p>

<p>Do you feel that you are an outside of the box thinker? I&#39;m genuinely asking. You are basically posting a TMZ article about how some guy says that Trump fucked 14 year old girls in the 80s with ZERO evidence. It&#39;s funny that it comes out right now. I&#39;m sure no one gets paid money to makes a story up that someone can&#39;t disprove. </p>

<p>What I see posted about Hillary on here comes from, ya know, her caimpaign&#39;s leaked e-mails? </p>

<p>That this stuff is coming out <em>now</em> when people have known about it for decades and it&#39;s been out in the open (seriously, Trump has been around for decades, everyone knows who and what he is - hell, he hangs out with Bill Clinton, ffs and was friends with John Casablancas and Jeffrey Epstein) shows what an absolute fix the whole thing is.</p>

<p>He exists to get Clinton into the White House. We&#39;re really freaking screwed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if you own a modeling company then you have sex with 14 year old girls? That is not even close to proof. Hanging with Jeffrey Epstein is also not proof.  MSM is barely even covering this because it&#39;s stupid. Do I have proof he didn&#39;t have sex with a 14 year old? No. But no one has any evidence whatsoever that he did. A &#39;witness&#39; comes out as he is running for office and you believe it to be true? Hillary is the one who got a rapist off the hook and then bragged about it.</p>

<p>In your opinion do you think Donald Trump is in on this plan that he exists just for Hillary? I&#39;ve thought the same thing before but I&#39;ve come to my own personal conclusion that he is not in on some scheme.</p>

<p>If Israel is calling him every name in the book in all of their news then that might tell you something. He also isn&#39;t proposing a war with Russia. I don&#39;t love Trump I&#39;d give every dollar I own to have had Ron Paul be in Trump&#39;s spot right now but you can&#39;t always get what you want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s necessarily in on it, he&#39;s super predictable re:ego - all Bill had to do was spin him up on it, he&#39;s always wanted to run, and there you go.

He runs on id, and is easy to spin up in any direction a smart person would want to spin him.</p>

<p>Israel isn&#39;t calling him every name in the book, actually. It&#39;s weird that his supporters are forgetting so much <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/readout-of-donald-j.-trumps-meeting-with-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-ne">about him</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can all be respectful. How about the Hillary Clinton supporters mention why you feel she is the better candidate and you support her?</p>

<p>Trump is not the best by a long shot but have you actually seen what Hillary Clinton has done? </p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s a bad thing to be on good terms with Russia which would lead to the end of a proxy war which has claimed 500,000 lives?</p>

<p>Trump being a personal asshole and being your typical business man is not on the same scale as the type of people Hillary Clinton is invoved with.</p>

<p>When you show a video of people &#39;related&#39; to HRC campaign admitting something illegal and then CNN calls it an unverified video, well frankly that should make you question how bad this shit is. The corporation&#39;s and the MSM support HRC 1000% but people can keep holding &quot;I&#39;m with her&quot; signs but the fact is she&#39;s not with you. At least in my opinion.</p>

<p>I honestly welcome people&#39;s responses to why they like her. We can be respectful.</p>
