       I think some Admins of this site have gotten tired of the fact that The Clinton campaign has basically bought the site..and is suppressing anything they dont like... Hey...wouldnt that be crazy if Someone had and leaked Undeniable proof that Admins are being paid by the Clinton campaign and there is an ongoing effort to Bury the juicy truth Wikileaks is handing out everyday and  hide her crimes...Ask yourself people.. what kind of president would someone Involved in so many scandals actually be? and not the allegations media circus kind of scandals undeniable criminal scandals do you think given executive authority Hillary Clinton would just just stop being such a piece of shit? or do you think that maybe all this fuckery we are witnessing in just the campaign alone is just a taste of the things to come from her....

       The Coup was attempted pre-WWII in 1933, but failed because they picked the wrong guy to lead the military, Smedley Butler who spoke up. (

       RE: JFK.That was stage 3. Stage 1 was the Civil war, where the North imposed taxes and big government on the agricultural south and then shouted racism. Stage 2 was the creation of the most recent and current Federal Reserve in 1913, coupled with the 1934 Gold Confiscation.

       Im not denying anything you are saying, but re: the civil war, the south was pretty racist. They kept people as slaves based on ill-conceived notions of race. That is racist.

       Very Few people in the South owned slaves. Only 5% of the population owned slaves.And the North to a lesser degree did as well.
Let's not forget about the Barbary Coast Pirates who enslaved Europeans for centuries, just prior to European immigrants in America enslaving North Africans. Read up on Thomas Jefferson and how/why the Navy was created to defeat the Pirates that were capturing Europeans.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Update: I will check on the 5% and provide sources or change it. Might take a few days, I'm slammed with school work.

       Yes, but they still owned slaves dude. And the whole point of the war was the South defending themselves (rightly so) against a foreign government imposing its will. It just so happens that this was the end of slavery. Was this perhaps by design? A crafted war to bring about some new socioeconomic change? Well, I wouldn't be surprised there.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Venezuelan friend (relevant because of the non-american perspective) said it best: "The South fought the wrong war for all the right reasons"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to delve into other people who owned slaves. That is off topic from what I am discussing here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and as for the racism aspect. The South was lynching blacks for a century + after the war, not to mention the institutional racism, aka Jim Crow laws.

       Your information is incorrect. In the southern states, between 1/4 and 1/3 of free white men/families owned slaves. Most of the whites that couldn't afford slaves still desired them, but were simply too poor. That 5% you reference means that 5% owned the majority of the slaves, not all. They owned something like 95% of slaves - most of the slaveholders only owned two or three.

       The coup already happened. Goldman Sachs has already declared ownership of Hillary by paying her for speaking wherein she reveals that the rich 1% is her constituency and the rest of us are deplorable scum. She even went so far as to declare there is one truth for the rich empowered and a different one for the poor schlump cattle. Just Say No to Clinton!

       The coup happened quite some time ago. It's just now, one of two things is going on:
      </p>
      <p>
       1- The Internet has made it a lot tougher to hide this shit and it's all coming out and they're fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       2- They want to rip off the mask and show us what it is exactly we're dealing with and they don't care. They're sick of hiding the closet fascism and satanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe both.

       It will still make life considerably more difficult for them if they do not have consent.  Superior force can take you a long way; but these people want someone to rule over, and that is hard to have when you've already murdered all of your subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as they need someone to feel superior towards, we ultimately still have some leverage.

       Every single day the global elite consolidate more of the wealth into their pockets.  Every day the middle class shrinks a little bit more.  The internet appears great, but it also creates full records and essentially biographies on every single person that uses based on their web history.  It would be extraordinarily easy to round up people with Military precision based entirely on common interests ( distrust in gov, "terrorism" etc).  My point is if you're not protecting your IP the internet is potentially your enemy as much as it is your friend.

       I think its probably likely that Clinton will win not legitimately our only hope right now is with wikileaks or other parties that have evidence of her crimes. and they need to release them asap. but wouldnt an impeachment be pretty fucking awesome?? We can rise up. and we can do it peacefully. In this world. The cyber world we are all connected and ideas and information moves to fast to stop it. they can send armed police to break up protests but they cant stop us here. the internet is beyond governments control and people have the power on the web.Educate people.

       It would be surprising if it was. People will need to protest. Some protesters will get hurt, maybe killed. Blacks didn't earn civil rights by sitting on their asses and waiting for the government to do the right thing. They kept marching and getting beat by cops and dogs until the people in charge realized they wouldn't quit.
      </p>
      <p>
       50 years later, everyone's civil rights are under threat, and it's going to take a protest movement at least as large to get them back.

       What if Trump is her puppet, and really just a way to get Authoritative power. Trump becomes dictator, and Hillary gets to pull the "Well I tried to warn ya". Then later the Dems come in and "save" us from Trump Empire, and the entire thing was a false flag. Now that would take some planning

       While I don't believe that is her puppet, your logic and rationalization is very good. Trump did quite a number on the public perspective of the Republican party and your proposed theory would compliment that point.

       A coup happens in America every few years.  The last one was in 2000; but then again, it would probably be more true to say that it was the last one which was blatantly obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will admit that when I see Americans as horrified as many of you are, about what a corrupt rats' nest your government is, I feel empathy for you, as I've already known about it for more than 20 years now.  I remember the early moments for me, though; that feeling where you put your hand over your mouth or your eyes in horror, and you realise that you can probably never trust anyone again, or at least no one in government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you learn that though, the next challenge is to avoid losing faith in humanity completely.  I'm still working on that one.

       Impressive dialog here. How about we as a nation (or at least Reddit users) demonstrate like those who marched on Washngton to inspire the end of the Vet Nam "Police action"? Would we now be considered terrorist? We as a people of these United States, need to take back or nation and remove ourselves from this oligarchy it's become. Were do we start?

       The first thing, the hardest thing, is to organize and put together a centralized mission/list of demands. This is hard to do when there is so much that needs to be fixed. It is also becoming exceedingly difficult to stay on message when the nature of privatized social media allows for easily controlled brigading. And when almost all the mainstream news media is clearly a primary enemy, when it should be a tool for investigative journalists to inform the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where to start? I believe in a successful movement you have to keep it simple and direct in the beginning: Stingrays. Kill the Stingrays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, the bottom line is that the people no longer have control over our government. What better blatant demonstration of this currently exists? Stingrays directly violate our civil rights; there is more than enough evidence regarding their operation that there is absolutely no question that they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       We thought NSA surveillance was scary, but that's nothing compared to agencies being able to perform targeted spying at the local level for whatever reasons they see fit. That is THE silver bullet of revolution, my friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think they flew over the Baltimore protests? It wasn't to protect the city. It was to make sure that riots remained riots and so no one who started saying anything important would be outside of their realm of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       A glimpse of the future. If you can squash unrest surgically, at the local level, it will never become part of the national conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's where we start. Kill the Stingrays.

       Well, the big problems are lack of awareness and more importantly no incentive to broadcast and accept opposing viewpoints. It is both a symptom of the chilling effect and the emotional human desire for confirmation of one's own beliefs by peers. Take a look at the state of Facebook (but really most social media platforms). It is a free "service", but the "product" is you, your time, and your interaction data. So of course it is designed as a time sink, where you think you're communicating freely but in reality spending time in the nice curated little echo chamber that has been created for you. If you do some experiments you'll find how true this is. My long detailed political posts barely show up, if even at all, to (most of) my friends news feeds, because they are far from click magnets. Whereas simple and riskless posts with pictures, like a fuck Trump meme, or a fuck Hillary meme, or a "Hey, remember Dragonball Z" are pumped up to the top because it's easy for viewers to go, "Heh", click to provide some more sentiment data, and move on quickly to do some more clicking.
      </p>

       Adding to that, in general, in the last decade or so, the social walls blocking any reasonable discourse critical of government have been built up pretty high. It totally amazes me that even though most people accept that there was definitely some government fuckery involved in JFK's assassination, as soon as you mention any (very real) questions about 9/11, those same people completely shut down and stop taking anything you say seriously.
      </p>

       That's a problem. Not because of that particular subject matter; the facts of which can be debated from here to the moon, but because people still firmly believe we're being protected by the good guys. When I hear average civilians talk flippantly about how Snowden should be locked up, it frightens me. "If you aren't doing anything wrong, you have nothing to hide." They are too far removed from the reality of the situation to care. If there was an unmarked van outside across the street with a satellite dish on the roof, pointing at their house, even Mister Rogers would be nervous and embarrassed, probably sing a little quieter. Since they don't need the van anymore, there is nothing imposing upon your senses to disturb you, so you just don't care they're doing it.  Looking ahead, that's so goddamn dangerous.
      </p>

       We are so distracted by things that don't matter. Race, religion, political leanings. Keeps us from organizing anything effectively. Media-driven echo chambers fuel this so hard. You can use the Black Lives Matter vs. All Lives Matter argument as a pure case study for this. Think of how much steam they would have behind their movement if they all dropped the divisive labels and became the Americans For Police Accountability. Hey, with that much focus we could've fought against the over-militarization of local police forces, no-knock warrants for nonviolent drug offenders, racial profiling, lack of body cameras, lack of training for nonviolent conflict resolution, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope. Echo chambers. All talk. It is our job to slowly break down the walls of these echo chambers. Google and their "fact checking" are about to make that a lot harder, and sometimes I can't believe that we are actually living during this permanent turning point of society.

       We start by not remaining silent. We dont keep our comments to ourselves anymore. we speak up. More people then you would believe are waking up and but are to afraid to be vocal.. as far as protesting goes what is the one place most minds gather? the internet. this is where we have to stage our protest.

       Dude are you illiterate? Check out the posts on this sub and you'll see 95% are about Clinton, Wikileaks, E-mails etc...If the admins are supposedly censoring anti-Hillary stuff they are doing a terrible job of it and should refund the Clinton Foundation...I for one can't wait for your b.s. sham elections to be over with so I can stop being assaulted with this constant barrage of partisan shit that passes for news these days...F.F.S. Americans make up 5% of the population of the planet, mostly the other 95% don't give a crap which globalist/elitist candidate the voting machines put into office...

       The Constitutional system has undergone gradual erosion ever since the initial signing; although what people are realising these days is that it was truthfully overrated to begin with.  Rome proved that you can not have a legislative branch that is not perpetually corrupt.  Senates are always populated by the elderly, and fear of impending death can cause people to try and grab everything they can, while they can.  The old tend to be driven by resentment to make war upon the young, as well; at least in Western society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Waco was really when the Jeffersonian party genuinely ended, though; that was a huge and chronic violation of Posse Comitatus, and in the end hardly anyone said a word.  That was a test by the government, and the public failed.  You are now dealing with the consequences, in terms of the domestic militarisation of the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Civil War did a lot of damage and set a lot of bad precedents; that of course more or less solidified the Union as an idea.  Then there was the gold grab and the Federal Reserve act in 1914, as well.  Some cite the New Deal as a bit of renaissance, but the only real reason why FDR did that, was to keep people willing to participate in the centralised/federal economy, because for a year or two at least, the Depression had encouraged people to try alternatives.

       Every single day the global elite consolidate more of the wealth into their pockets.  Every day the middle class shrinks a little bit more.  The internet appears great, but it also creates full records and essentially biographies on every single person that uses based on their web history.  It would be extraordinarily easy to round up people with Military precision based entirely on common interests ( distrust in gov, "terrorism" etc).  My point is if you're not protecting your IP the internet is potentially your enemy as much as it is your friend.
