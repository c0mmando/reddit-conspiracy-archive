    <div class="md"><p>If you could predict what was going to happen with any accuracy, it wouldn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>If WWIII does happen, it&#39;s going to be because of some unpredictable fuck up. Something that doesn&#39;t seem like such a big deal at the time ends up escalating out of control very quickly and you&#39;re in a war almost before you know it.</p>

<p>Just as a broad guess, I&#39;d say it will involve, Syria or the South China sea. The US is going to keep pushing and maybe underestimate the chances of someone else pushing back.</p>

<p>You always hear the US military saying how &quot;nobody can match our conventional forces&quot; and stuff like that. There seems to be this idea that nobody will ever resort to use of nuclear weapons out of sheer desperation.</p>

<p>One scenario? A sort of Sampson Option where the Russians figure, if they&#39;re going down... they&#39;re going to take their enemies with them.</p>

<p>We try and impose a no fly zone in Syria, hoping that the Russians will fight back. No way they have enough conventional forces to win and we don&#39;t think they&#39;ll use nukes because &quot;Syria isn&#39;t worth it&quot;.</p>

<p>Then, at some point, someone&#39;s calculations turn out to be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been reconsidering the notion that we are necessarily heading towards WWIII. As proof, I submit that the United States, NATO, and Saudi Axis don&#39;t have to put troops on the ground. If the ISIS and Al Nusra fighters can kill or displace enough Syrian civilians, then the Saudi American interests can build their pipeline right through Syria (even if Assad still holds Damascus). The Russians are the wild card here. If we assume that the Saudi American pipeline dream becomes reality, that is a major strategic blow to their energy empire.</p>

<p>In this way, we can expect that the Russians would have to be the first to act - time is on the side of the American Saudi alliance (as Syrians are getting killed or displaced). With the current political disunity within NATO, and the coming onset of the Continental winter, I would say that November would be the best time to strike. In this way, the Russians can threaten to cut off NatGas supplies to Europe, if they choose to join the fray. As far as how the attacks might be carried out, I have no idea (regional/global and conventional/nuclear). It is also doubtful that China would have any participation in the Syrian conflict as it stands.</p>

<p>A couple of other interesting points of note... The EU is also falling apart. The economic decay has been brutal, and the worst is yet to come (see: DeutscheBank and Monte Dei Paschi). Anti-immigration sentiments seem to be incredibly high, and there are more people pouring in every day. If the EU fractures, it could be possible to see another Holocaust scenario on the Continent, as angry locals try to take back their governments from Eurocrats. If the EU falls apart, Germany might have much more to gain with Russia than Europe. All that is assuming that leaders look out primarily for their national interests, which is false.</p>

<p>If the conflict stays regional, then it is definitely some shady stuff going on... Russia will need to cripple US force projection to win - an impossible task because of attrition. After thinking about it, I say that the Russians are going to let Assad dangle - then the Wahabbis go for Turkey and the Balkans. By then, NATO will be useless, anyway.  It&#39;ll be interesting to find out...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first nuke to go off will be a false flag.  Some poor Podunk American city will get nuked in the name of terrorism to further their agenda.  Then they can blame the Russians, again.</p>

<p>Why play this nuclear game of chicken with Russia?  It&#39;s one thing to pick on Saddam Hussein, but an other to pick on a nuclear power.  Gonna nuke the planet just to install some new banking systems.  Seems reasonable.   Could put an early end to it all by nuking the Goldman Sachs building first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WW3 will consist of three separate conflicts occurring simultaneously.</p>

<p>First of all you have <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/538328216729968642/SdfeQXSM.png">the free world</a> vs <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AediQLpoGGM/hqdefault.jpg">radical Islam</a>.</p>

<p>Then you have <a href="http://adaktusson.eu/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/nato3-06122014_0.jpg">NATO</a> vs <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/China-Russia1-400x245.jpg">Sino-Russo alliance</a>.</p>

<p>And finally <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/theodor-herzl.jpg">zionism</a> vs <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Star_and_Crescent.svg/2000px-Star_and_Crescent.svg.png">Islam</a>.</p>

<p>The war of the free world vs radical Islam began in 2001 in the form of the fake &#39;war on terror&#39;.</p>

<p>In order to spark war between NATO and the Russo-Sino alliance. A psy op will take place, in which Hoover Dam will allegedly be destroyed resulting in flooding which causes millions of deaths.</p>

<p>On this same day, China will simultaneously invade all countries on its southern land border and Russia will invade eastern europe.</p>

<p>Orthodox Jews who despise Israel will work as double agents, assisting Israels Arab neighbours in invading the country.</p>

<p>The free world will defeat radical islam, and the Russo-Sino alliance will defeat the west. Israel will triumph over its neighbours.</p>

<p>No, because nuclear weapons do not exist. This <a href="https://youtu.be/xx2MRo3M3Fs?t=2m31s">priest</a> describes working in Hiroshima in the days after the bombing without experiencing ill effects from radiation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cold war type emotions begin to bubble over as Russia begins to push into NATO territory. The US is expected to be the big bouncer but delays on any action. Finally after many more casualties in western Europe, the US finally sends a massive ground presence to stop the tide of russian red, and european dead. Just as the war enters it&#39;s second month, and things going as expected, North Korea fires a Nuke. It lands in the Pacific, and doesn&#39;t reach it&#39;s target of California coast. Now the entire US is seething, and the full war machine takes over. The Air Force gets aggressive and starts bombing interior Russia, &amp; North Korea. China, feeling like it&#39;s either being left out, or cornered joins the fray on the Russian side, and contributes men to front line effort of the European battle. </p>

<p>Something like that... </p>
