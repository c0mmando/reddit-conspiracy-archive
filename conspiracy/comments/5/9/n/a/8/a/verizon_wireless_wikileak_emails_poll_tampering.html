       I'm in over my head and deep down a rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I was looking at the Podesta emails from the Verizon Wireless Numbers:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=&amp;mfrom=9737690034%40vzwpix.com&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=1#searchresult">
        https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=&amp;mfrom=9737690034%40vzwpix.com&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=1#searchresult
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They're sent to Podesta using a Verizon Wireless multimedia message, but most lack pictures. The text for each message is sent in a .txt attachment. Many of the messages cc: other Verizon wireless numbers. Seems very cloak and dagger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        20 Dec 2015 - "First class..as always."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        27 Dec 2015 - "Tomorrow we will lock up the box kell for n.h. have them call me or give me the number. If irene is in she will confirm. Happy new year "
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly - I dug up a thread from r/thedonald wherein people searched the numbers and found DNC officials such as Kelly Maer and a strange connection to a forklift company called Liftec Inc.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://rebrn.com/re/someone-sent-this-email-from-to-podesta-saying-hillary-will-wi-2907468/">
        http://rebrn.com/re/someone-sent-this-email-from-to-podesta-saying-hillary-will-wi-2907468/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, I had a quick Google and found that kell for n.h. is 'Kelly for New Hampshire' - the campaign of a NH republican candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So I thought (and I'll admit that this was a leap): 'what if this has something to do with rigging polls?'
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So I looked up the race Kelly Ayotte is in and found that a particular pollster had been interested in the New Hampshire race at the time. A group called PPP, or Public Policy Polling. Conducting two polls in a month, they'd had Ayotte gain two percent on the Democrat candidate in a poll conducted on 2-4 Jan 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_New_Hampshire,_2016">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_New_Hampshire,_2016
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So I started looking a little into PPP, and it turns out they've been accused of a liberal bias. They rose to prominence in 2008 when they were able to poll accurately, with little margin for error, in unpredictable primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I searched the address (3020 Highwoods Blvd. Raleigh, NC 27604) that I found on one of their releases and found that they share a building and CEO (Dean Debnam) with Workplace Options (
       <a href="http://www.workplaceoptions.com/">
        http://www.workplaceoptions.com/
       </a>
       ), an Employee Assistance Provider. I found that there are two addresses in Raleigh used interchangeably by both companies. I also found a third company 'Debnam Properties LLC. This company is listed as 'Operative Builders' (they buy property, do it up, and move out).
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple information sites on this company estimate it as having two employees, though the website and linkedin list over a dozen and claims that they employ 500.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://listings.findthecompany.com/l/21737152/Debnam-Properties-Llc-in-Raleigh-NC">
        http://listings.findthecompany.com/l/21737152/Debnam-Properties-Llc-in-Raleigh-NC
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Employer=Workplace_Options/Salary">
        http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Employer=Workplace_Options/Salary
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Digging a little deeper - I find that Debnam bought the two buildings Raleigh in Nov 2015, a month and a half before the first of the Verizon Podesta emails came in:
       <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/real-estate/2015/11/workplace-options-dean-debnam-highwoods-office.html">
        http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/blog/real-estate/2015/11/workplace-options-dean-debnam-highwoods-office.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Workplace Options doesn't seem legit to me. It's website lists a 'Partner Conference' on November 6-9 (election time, yo) but clicking the link takes you nowhere:
       <a href="http://www.workplaceoptions.com/events/">
        http://www.workplaceoptions.com/events/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's some other interesting sounding companies cc'd in those emails, who have had some interesting movement lately:
       <a href="http://observer.com/2015/10/m-public-affairs-rebrands-as-kivit/">
        http://observer.com/2015/10/m-public-affairs-rebrands-as-kivit/
       </a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Anyway. I don't really know where to go from here. But PPP's rise in 08 meshes with this email far too well:
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Feb 2016 - "Oh boy john. Lets try and wrap it earlier. However john..kelly and jennifer are already organizing the,state for,victory as we did 8n 2oo8..booker and pascrell..as well..best john. Lets win this dam thing."

       I wonder what the outcome of this will become.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side note: for those new folks here in this sub... this is what r/conspiracy is all about. Digging into the rabbit hole and to make connections and to see what else is involved. It is doing research and finding things on your own. Also it's to list your sources and how you got there. This is where you become credible, not by saying what you think it is and providing one link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good research. Keep up the fight.
