       Trump, with Scottish ancestry from his mother, appears a bit orange, which is not a bad thing. That is a natural skin and hair pigment variation and we should be proud of our diverse genetics and differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was a Native American who looked a bit reddish in certain pictures, can you imagine these people calling him a "red buffoon?" Of course not. It is only okay to call Trump orange because he is white and these hypocrites have no self awareness.

        The Citrusy Mystery of Trump’s Hair
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Burnt-Cheetos auburn,” wrote Vanity Fair magazine’s Bruce Handy.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Tuscan surprise,” said the comedian Sarah Silverman.
       </p>
       <p>
        While it’s tempting to explain these transformations as the lighting’s tricks or a colorist’s tweaks, I think there’s something more magical and mysterious going on. Trump’s hair is his mood ring. It signals how he feels — and who he wants to be — in any given instant.
       </p>
       <p>
        A somber leader? Its brassiness fades, and there are shimmers of gray.
       </p>
       <p>
        A big bully?
        <strong>
         It flares orange, in chromatic symphony with his face.

       The New York Times published an article referring to his hair and face "flaring orange." The man is of Scottish decent and Scots tend to have orange hair and/or beards with fair skin that can glow red. These people are making fun of his genetics. Some of them might be only focusing on his fake tan, but to deny what I am saying is to stick your head in the sand.

       Scottish isn't a race, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it raises an interesting point- I have a great deal of Scottish blood coursing through my own veins. While I missed out on the red hair and fair skin, I have an affinity for alcohol and I
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       fucking fight you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So because I have this Scottish bloodline, that means I can mock trump's orange hair and spray tan without some SJW getting all pissy about it, right?

       Whether or not you want to call it a "race," for all intents and purposes of my argument, it is. These people are making fun of what Trump has been given genetically. That is racism. If you were to make fun of a black person's dark face and hair, you would be called a racist. I don't understand why you cannot understand such a simple concept.

       Don't talk down to me. I get the concept.

       paraphrased from your title:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Clinton supporters are hypocrites because they claim Trump and his supporters are racist, yet they make fun of his race by calling him an "orange buffoon."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure Clinton supporters (and Stein, Johnson, even McMullin &amp; Supreme supporters), as well as undecideds, believe Trump and (some of) his supporters are bigoted because of the things Trump has said; and that enough of his supporters either agreed with these things, or at least didn't have a big enough problem with them to sway their support, considering the fashion in which Trump won the GOP nomination.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, let's be honest about this- saying that "Mexicans" are thieves and rapists, that they're being "sent" here for
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       to deal with, is actually racist. No mental gymnastics required. He's not saying "brown skinned people with brown eyes and black or brown hair".
      </p>
      <p>
       Worse, it foments a mentality of hatred and other-ness that can do real harm to those who (through no fault of their own) were born in this country to illegal parents, as well as to those born in this country to parents also born in this country. (I like to refer to both of those kinds of people as American Citizens). Heck, don't even get me started about people who are legitimately fleeing insane cartel violence and police corruption south of the border, or, the refugees we're starting to feel from the ME...
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument is that people making jokes about Trump's bad spray tan and sometimes orange-ish hair is on the same level as treating American Citizens of Hispanic
       <em>
        descent
       </em>
       , or people of any descent who happen to be muslim, as perpetual suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see it that way. No comparison.
       <br/>
       Maybe if being mocked about the bad spray tan and orange-ish hair really bothers Trump, he'll sue the people saying these things?

       It is also not racist to claim that illegals have a higher chance of breaking the law. It may be correct or incorrect statistically speaking, and it has to do with country of origin.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also not racist to claim that Muslims might be a tad more violent than the general population. If anything, that is discriminating against a religion, not race.

       Btw, there are people who make fun of him for being orange because of his orange hair. The spray tan thing is part of it, but to say people don't make fun of his hair color is naive. See the article I cited above. That actually is racist.

        While it’s tempting to explain these transformations as the lighting’s tricks or a colorist’s tweaks, I think there’s something more magical and mysterious going on. Trump’s hair is his mood ring. It signals how he feels — and who he wants to be — in any given instant.

       Trump's hair isn't naturally orange. If you look at older pictures of him, it's dark brown. He chose to dye his hair a ridiculous color and he chose to get a ridiculous fake tan. Making fun of that is not racist. It's like making fun of someone's perm or weird haircut.

       My father also had a darker brown, barely red hair when he was younger. Trump is losing pigment in his hair, causing it to look lighter orange.

       Unless they have proof he dyes his hair orange, they are making fun of the man's genetics.

        Drumpf, with Scottish ancestry from his mother, appears a bit orange, which is not a bad thing. That is a natural skin and hair pigment variation and we should be proud of our diverse genetics and differences.

       I'm sorry but are you implying that Scottish people are orange? Besides that, Scottish isn't another race lmao good lord dude
