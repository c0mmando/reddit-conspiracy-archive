<blockquote>
<p>my argument  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>paraphrased from your title: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clinton supporters are hypocrites because they claim Trump and his supporters are racist, yet they make fun of his race by calling him an &quot;orange buffoon.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure Clinton supporters (and Stein, Johnson, even McMullin &amp; Supreme supporters), as well as undecideds, believe Trump and (some of) his supporters are bigoted because of the things Trump has said; and that enough of his supporters either agreed with these things, or at least didn&#39;t have a big enough problem with them to sway their support, considering the fashion in which Trump won the GOP nomination.</p>

<p>I mean, let&#39;s be honest about this- saying that &quot;Mexicans&quot; are thieves and rapists, that they&#39;re being &quot;sent&quot; here for <em>us</em> to deal with, is actually racist. No mental gymnastics required. He&#39;s not saying &quot;brown skinned people with brown eyes and black or brown hair&quot;.</p>

<p>Worse, it foments a mentality of hatred and other-ness that can do real harm to those who (through no fault of their own) were born in this country to illegal parents, as well as to those born in this country to parents also born in this country. (I like to refer to both of those kinds of people as American Citizens). Heck, don&#39;t even get me started about people who are legitimately fleeing insane cartel violence and police corruption south of the border, or, the refugees we&#39;re starting to feel from the ME... </p>

<p>Your argument is that people making jokes about Trump&#39;s bad spray tan and sometimes orange-ish hair is on the same level as treating American Citizens of Hispanic <em>descent</em>, or people of any descent who happen to be muslim, as perpetual suspects. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see it that way. No comparison.<br/>
Maybe if being mocked about the bad spray tan and orange-ish hair really bothers Trump, he&#39;ll sue the people saying these things?</p>

<p>It is also not racist to claim that illegals have a higher chance of breaking the law. It may be correct or incorrect statistically speaking, and it has to do with country of origin.  </p>

<p>It is also not racist to claim that Muslims might be a tad more violent than the general population. If anything, that is discriminating against a religion, not race. </p>

<p>Checkmate. </p>

<p>Btw, there are people who make fun of him for being orange because of his orange hair. The spray tan thing is part of it, but to say people don&#39;t make fun of his hair color is naive. See the article I cited above. That actually is racist. </p>

<p>Kek</p>

<p>Sorry making fun of his weird combover isn&#39;t racist, his hair is obviously dyed or else his whole head would be white. Also his skin color magically whitens around his eyes</p>

<p>I wonder why</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not racist to claim that immigrants commit more crime. It&#39;s just <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798">wrong</a>.</p>

<p>Also, who makes fun of his hair color? People make fun of his combover. His hair color wouldn&#39;t look weird at all if he didn&#39;t have the spray tan. </p>

<p>Also dude you have read hair and just read calling Drumpf orange on his hair color based on that.  Admit it bro.  You got you&#39;re own stereotyping to deal with.  I&#39;ve yet to hear, even trolls, call Drumpf a ginger, and that&#39;s proof enough no one&#39;s focusing on his hair color</p>

<p>Edit: Holy shit Trump is blonde, not even a red head!</p>

<p>Drumpf, with Scottish ancestry from his mother, appears a bit orange, which is not a bad thing. That is a natural skin and hair pigment variation and we should be proud of our diverse genetics and differences.</p>
