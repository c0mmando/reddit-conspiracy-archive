    <div class="md"><p>Since Assange&#39;s Internet connection was severed, or at least within a day or two after that, voter controls here have definitely been stronger. Non-Hillary bashing threads used to get up to 30 votes in about 12 hours. </p>

<p>Even though those were also suppressed, now these same topics are only getting about 12 at most.</p>

<p>The other more blatant change are stupid unfounded comments just denying others&#39; claims. I did not see such clear denouncements before. They&#39;d be loaded with more doubt if a commenter was saying it&#39;s not true etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure there would be QA. Also it would need to be multi-level where newbies only get to shitpost, and once you&#39;ve proven your loyalty you get to help actually correct the record. Then probably the next level is being a mod for a bunch of subs and staying below the radar while rejecting posts. Then once you&#39;ve got that nailed you might move into strategy, where you define which subs are targeted and how. </p>

<p>See there&#39;s a whole career path for you. Each with a promise of more money and more power, until you realise you&#39;re actually just as disposable to these people as a wet wipe. </p>

<p>I look forward to the day that those inside CTR &#39;defect&#39; to the public and tell us all just what lengths they were asked to go to, and where that message came from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first you need authenticity. This comes in the form of comment amd posting karma so you can appear to be genuine. There is a site that houses buying requests for high karma reddit accounts. I think 200$ was the most an individual would be willing to spend for something lile 50k comment karma. The numbers are estimates, but around there. This is the easiest way to get money for your account.</p>

<p>To be an active shill you would need to join some firm that would be an astroturfing organization. They would most limely have you sign a NDA, and would direct you on what to say and how to say it. Your computer at the firm would be monitored to make sure you did your job.</p>

<p>Lastly you can join an online organization who may or maynot pay you based on how many comemts you&#39;ve posted. The only evidence of this has been from a pro-zionist group who paid 5$ a comment for a maximum of 3 comments a day and had a list of users and places to seek out, and gave bonuses when you could find anti-zionists real info for doxxing.</p>

<p>In conclusion it doesn&#39;t seem like astroturfing pays well unless it&#39;s your 9-5 .</p>
