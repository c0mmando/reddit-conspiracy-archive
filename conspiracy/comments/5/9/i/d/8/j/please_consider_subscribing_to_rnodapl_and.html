       Energy companies and law enforcement are currently conspiring on an illegal land grab and trumped up charges against Water Protectors.

       could really use some more attention. The battle to stop the pipeline in North Dakota is a historic and important case in which private entities are making a land grab with law enforcement being used to enforce the illegal efforts. Only 348 subscribers at the time of this post.  I would like to see more on the reddit front page. Thanks to anyone who helps in any way.

       Basically, the oil companies don't give a shit about normal people, especially not minorities, only money. The thing about the Access pipeline is that Native Americans in North Dakota are trying to protest the construction of the pipeline on their sacred lands, and it would affect their water supply if a leak occurs. It's gotten lots of attention in part thanks to
       <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2016/9/4/dakota_access_pipeline_company_attacks_native">
        Amy Goodman

       ; she reported the security guards working for the pipeline were using force against peaceful protesters, using dogs to attack them. Shit remains real today.

       This is the CEO and Chairman of Energy Transfer Partners. His home address, etc are all but listed. Why cant people protest at his home and make sure it gets media coverage? Corporations are just crappy people hiding behind an entity. Picket his driveway. he has other property in Colorado as well. What's the problem?

       No. That's insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       DAPL absolutely did their due diligence in planning this project. This is a billion dollar project, not a bunch of roughnecks shooting from the hip.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pipeline is not on tribal land, it is on private land. No land is being stolen, no rights are being violated, no sovereignty is threatened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The area in question was not considered 'sacred ancestral ground' until weeks after the protest started.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was originally going through Bismark- they said no. It was rerouted to tribal land- they said no. Finally it was routed to private land and is following an existing pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
       DAPL has been completely transparent through the entire process.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's my stake in this? I'm an oilfield driver and crane operator. The pipeline actually hurts my income by taking trucks hauling crude off the road thereby increasing the pool of available drivers which depresses wages. I'm for it- truck and rail hauling of crude is significantly more dangerous than pipeline.

       The Standing Rock tribe consulted nine times during the planning phase of the DAPL. Nine. They weren't blind-sided by this.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much do you actually know about pipeline construction?
      </p>
      <p>
       The pipe they used is
       <a href="http://baummags.a.cdnify.io/files/slides/locale_image/medium/0059/14549_en_6554a_99_c06-carboline-polyclad-aro.jpg">
        coated
       </a>
       to prevent all corrosion. The coating is inspected and repaired before it is buried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every weld is literally signed on the pipe by the
       <a href="http://www.gowelding.org/welding-certification/">
        certified pipeline welder
       </a>
       that performed it. The weld is
       <a href="https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Radiography/TechCalibrations/RadiographInterp.htm">
        x-rayed
       </a>
       by a certified two man 3rd party team and verified that it was correctly performed and then coated before the pipeline is buried. This is documented and there is accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pipeline then receives a
       <a href="https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/FactSheets/FSHydrostaticTesting.htm">
        hydrostatic pressure test
       </a>
       after it is buried that far exceeds what it will ever experience while in service.

       Yeah, and heat death of the universe will eventually be the end of everything. Logical extremes are not valid arguments. Eventually that river will dry up. Eventually a giant mutant sloth will come over from Fukashima and fart on the pipeline, shattering it to bits.

       Of course everything fails with time as it's all looking for its resting state, but these things will last a very, very, very long time. It's fucking coated metal in one of the most stable zones approved by engineers from multiple parties.

       Yep. Thats the thing. This is on private land, not some tribal sacred ground. Also, they had the opportunity to file objections but instead, just let the deadline pass. Is just a money grab and tribe is pissed that they didn't get a cut. Since they went through private land, THOSE landowners got paid instead.

      <p>
       Others just hop on the bandwagon because it sounds like some huge oppression and injustice on the surface, but MSM doesn't really show whats really happening and how the protesters are the ones out of line and starting shit on land that isn't even theirs; harassing construction crews just there to do their damned jobs.

       The contention here is that the tribes land was never surveyed properly to include the burial grounds that dapl destroyed.

       No. It does not cross into the Sioux reservation. Landowners are compensated monetarily and have signed the easements. There is the bit about corp lands I think, but its in process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for standing up for peoples' rights, but they don't have any in this case and is just a bunch of greedy posturing people. Again, they also had time to protest this but failed to file a claim by deadline (probably because they knew they didn't have one).

       That's what I'm saying, it's not part of the reservation because the government screwed them over when they failed to survey it.
       <em>
        It's supposed to be part of their reservation, but it's not although they have claim to it.
       </em>
       That claim needed to be settled before construction but, yet again, their concerns where ignored and marginalized despite those burial grounds clearly belonging to them.

       From what I've seen, they are landowners lands. Then they tried to block it, claimed a rock was significant and then tried to say that the old survey was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       They went off of a survey. Maybe they should've done a new one to cover their asses, but they had one and got easements from the titled legal landowners.

       If you have another source aside from the big rock POSSIBLY being representative of significance, then I am interested.

       Having worked with and on Fort Berthold Reservation for several years I can only agree with you assessment. Doing business in the reservation is very similar to China in its mafistic structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want a work pickup truck on the res? Gotta buy TERO stickers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to work on the res? Partner with a 51% min Native ownership company owned by a tribal leader that takes 10-15% off the gross of every invoice but does no actual work other than existing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Driving a semi? Get ready for compliance checks while driving down lease roads from Taro, TAT, Segment, and New Town PD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poor starving neglected natives? Fort Berthold residents get $30k/year in dispensations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fort Berthold had $750,000,000 in oil field profit in 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal thoughts? A tribal leader asked for too large of a kickback and it ended up being cheaper to go private land. The protest was started on that pretense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub wants to investigate real corruption and conspiracy it needs to spend some time looking at Fort Berthold.

       Well, and not sure about the res that you worked on, but one that I'm close to, well, there are better ways for their res money to be spent; like on education and programs. Instead, you get a bunch of folks with subpar education and domestic issues.

       I should that residents of Fort Berthold are not required to have car insurance if their car never leaves the reservation.

       I can't remember if she had insurance or not. My husband worked with the guy on roadcrew who got killed. It was a sad ordeal and even moreso when realizing that it was preventable and she wasn't supposed to be on the roads because of previous offenses. On top of it, this was in broad daylight in a construction zone where the speed limit was reduced.

       Just glad that our permanent residence isn't in the area around there.

       I could, as I just looked it up to make sure that it was still on there, but I'm not doing that because of location and other identifiable info.

        AI/AN have a relatively high prevalence of alcohol-impaired driving and the highest alcohol-related motor vehicle mortality rates among racial/ethnic populations.
Among AN/AN fatal crashes in 2012  an estimated 42 percent were alcohol-related. Nationally, during this same time period, 31 percent of total crashes were alcohol-related.

       Also, try googling: reservation domestic violence statistics
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several links there to check out, but would look at several.

       Its a very sad situation. Like.. the reservations also end up protecting the aggressors and perpetrators a lot of times. You get high alcoholism and DV in a tight community and then the law can't do anything about it so it just.. festers and the cycle continues. They've changed some things now on ability to persecute, but it will take awhile to solve.

       The contention here is that the tribes land was never surveyed properly to include the burial grounds that dapl destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, it's not private land; it's land with significant claims against it.

       Having worked with and on Fort Berthold Reservation for several years I can only agree with you assessment. Doing business in the reservation is very similar to China in its mafistic structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want a work pickup truck on the res? Gotta buy TERO stickers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to work on the res? Partner with a 51% min Native ownership company owned by a tribal leader that takes 10-15% off the gross of every invoice but does no actual work other than existing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Driving a semi? Get ready for compliance checks while driving down lease roads from Taro, TAT, Segment, and New Town PD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poor starving neglected natives? Fort Berthold residents get $30k/year in dispensations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fort Berthold had $750,000,000 in oil field profit in 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal thoughts? A tribal leader asked for too large of a kickback and it ended up being cheaper to go private land. The protest was started on that pretense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub wants to investigate real corruption and conspiracy it needs to spend some time looking at Fort Berthold.

       The Standing Rock tribe consulted nine times during the planning phase of the DAPL. Nine. They weren't blind-sided by this.

       How much do you actually know about pipeline construction?
      </p>
      <p>
       The pipe they used is
       <a href="http://baummags.a.cdnify.io/files/slides/locale_image/medium/0059/14549_en_6554a_99_c06-carboline-polyclad-aro.jpg">
        coated
       </a>
       to prevent all corrosion. The coating is inspected and repaired before it is buried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every weld is literally signed on the pipe by the
       <a href="http://www.gowelding.org/welding-certification/">
        certified pipeline welder
       </a>
       that performed it. The weld is
       <a href="https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Radiography/TechCalibrations/RadiographInterp.htm">
        x-rayed
       </a>
       by a certified two man 3rd party team and verified that it was correctly performed and then coated before the pipeline is buried. This is documented and there is accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pipeline then receives a
       <a href="https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/FactSheets/FSHydrostaticTesting.htm">
        hydrostatic pressure test
       </a>
       after it is buried that far exceeds what it will ever experience while in service.

       They're not just throwing shit in the ground.
