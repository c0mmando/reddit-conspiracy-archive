       So apparently this guy is dropping hints left and right that Hillary's deleted emails are about to be dumped by Wikileaks.   This guy is either about to become a legend or the most irritating troll in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ten hours ago he tweeted a video of himself acting mock surprised with the audio "you've got mail" @ Wikileaks.    He has been suggesting for months that the big leak would come on Hillary's birthday (today).  Trump said at one point that the leaks could have come from "some 400 pound guy lying in bed."   Kim is 385 pounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of suspicion that Assange is either dead or has been kidnapped by the US.   The Wikleaks Twitter feed is just bizarre at this point.   However Kim is supposedly a friend of Assange, which gives me hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will Kim/Wikileaks come through?   Are we being trolled?   WTF is going on?

       Hey, wasn't that guy flyyyyyyyy a moderator? Don't see him anymore and haven't seen him post in a while, either. Usually liked his stuff, though he was a proponent of the CGI planes on 9/11 stuff, which is beyond my ability to accept.

       The "CGI plane" bullshit was obvious disinformation designed to discredit the movement.   Interestingly Morgan Reynolds, who served in the Bush admin, came out in support of 9/11 truth only to turn into a proponent of "holograms" and "space beams".

       Assange and KDC have some relationship, because Assange appeared by VC at a KDC event in New Zealand a couple of years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing is that KDC is battling extradition and also knows he was under sting-ray type surveillance once before.
      </p>
      <p>
       So KDC and JA should reasonably suspect that KDC is under full surveillance, and has been for a very long time. Therefore I conclude that JA / Wikileaks would not have taken the risk to send stuff to KDC just from an opsec viewpoint. (Let alone that KDC is a bit rouge and reasonably unpredictable.) but JA likely shared the sort of thing that he had, so all KDC knows is that it's big but might not have the actual content.
      </p>
      <p>
       My conclusion is that KDC is just firing people up, and he thinks JA is going to release good stuff - and is hoping that JA is still able to release it.....
      </p>
      <p>
       But the clock is ticking and JA is missing, and the wikileaks director and lawyers are dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit minor correction over who appears via vc.

       I hope I'm wrong, but I think we are getting trolled.
      </p>
      <p>
       KDC's latest tweet says to use Xkeyscore to get the missing emails. This is the infuriating thing to most of us who are aware of current NSA data collections - nothing can truly be deleted anymore. The official narrative has ignored this fact completely. It feels like a slap in the face to those of us who know the that it is out there.

       Me neither. Perhaps he's trolling the establishment more than the rest of us, saying what they have refused to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the idea is to get the people all riled up asking these same questions... in that case, it's not really trolling, but posturing. In any case, whether or not he has access to these files, I doubt that they see the light of the web (I would love to be wrong).

       He's probably salty because his house was raided on his birthday by 76 heavily armed soldiers and 2 helicopters. It was also later ruled as an illegal raid. You might be a bit "salty" as well.

       That's why Assange's status is so important. If he's alive and well, we can assume it's just in the hands of someone else within the organization. Without proof of life there is no reason to trust the Twitter account's recent shift. As far as releases, I believe the Podesta Emails are automated to release daily.

       Retweeting an abundance of articles, political cartoons and general sporadic nature of some of the tweets. If you've followed their Twitter for some time you definitely notice the shift. Previously handled in a very professional, well spoken manner. It's definitely changed hands.

       Tweeting weird random partisan political things, some with misspelled words that appear on the surface to spell out a secret message such as "HELP HIM", but I think this is someone pulling our chains. They could just Tweet "HELP HIM" straight up, instead of hiding a secret message. Someone controlling that Twitter is having some fun, Assange would not be pleased by the recent unprofessional activity that only aims to hurt their credibility.

       DISCLAIMER: I'm not saying there
       <em>
        isn't

       a secret message hidden in those Tweets. There very possibly could be a secret message, but so far nothing too compelling has been found. "HELP HIM" is not very useful. We already know he needs help, they cut his internet ffs. So what I'm getting at here is the secret message could be something else, like an encryption key. Maybe the weird Tweets were his dead man switch. I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these Tweets started around the same time a bunch of new mods swooped into
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       and took over, started creating a bunch of SJW "rules" and banning everyone, stickying cat pics, pushing "proof of life" threads which are actually old content from months/years ago, shit like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual LEAKS are probably still legit, as they are being published automatically on timers that nobody can stop. So basically the Wikileaks Twitter and subreddit (both compromised) have to just go along with it at this point. Controlling the opposition methinks.

       Wikileaks is posting from the twitter. Assange is just the founder, not the primary user. Assange hasn't directly posted to the account in the past 4 years since he's been in the embassy.

       Whether it was Assange tweeting directly or not, it has changed hands recently. Also, Assange has a Twitter and Instagram for his cat @EmbassyCat who has also gone dark for 10 days. They must provide proof of life. An extremely simple task.

       It makes sense that the cat account would be dark when his Internet is cut. It was cut for the purpose of not influencing the election, which means they probably also wouldn't allow anyone to see him or speak to him til after the election, assuming he's still at the embassy as Ecuador says. I'm not saying I believe that story either, I'm just trying to maintain a healthy level of skepticism about everything until more solid proof is revealed either way. There are plenty of reasons why proof of life might be harder than we realize under present circumstances.

       Then why is there literally no word or sighting of him? If his internet was cut he would most assuredly be making an announcements via video or even picture. He has no confirmed visitors and no confirmed contact in 10 days during arguably the most impactful month Wikileaks has ever had...

       If the powers that be believed silencing Assange from the outside would stop the leaks from happening then why stop with just his Internet? Why cut his Internet and then let him contact whoever he wants and send whatever messages he wants to send. That defeats the purpose of cutting off his Internet.

       Well, for one, he's not a fucking prisoner and still has rights. Silencing him in any capacity is inhumane. The only reason they would silence him is because he publishes things they don't like. (ie. the truth). Meanwhile, you have mainstream media plastering garbage claims on a minute to minute basis. Better silence them as well because they are totally "influencing the US election".

       Well for one, the MSM members are US citizens. Assange is not. Furthermore, Ecuador is currently accountable for Assange because they are protecting him from the the powers that be. By leaving Assange to do as he will Ecuador would, by proxy, be influencing the US election. They had to make a choice, cut off his Internet or piss off the world's biggest terrorist organization... Which would you choose?

       There are plenty of MSM sources located outside of the US. They have not only cut his internet but effectively made him a prisoner inside the embassy. Zero communication, visitors, or proof of life in the 11 days since. Plenty of ways to provide this without internet assuming he is still alive and/or in the embassy still.

       Your guess is as good as mine, I can't speak with any certainty on his intentions, only the fact that ip traces on posts/logins have never come back to the location of the Ecuadorian embassy in the time he's been there and references to Assange are always third person

       he's talking about identifiers like user-agent, screensize, if an idiot posted an image with exif data. I would not expect hackers to be this stupid...but hey "metadata" fits the narrative so we'll just go with that.
