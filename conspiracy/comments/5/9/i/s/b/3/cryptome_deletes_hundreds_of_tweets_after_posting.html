<p>What is strange is that this site if a free speech site that will give a platform to almost anything, even fake information. I don&#39;t understand why they would ever self-censor or delete anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s supposed to be in the Embassy, not the Consulate. They are completely separate buildings, blocks away from one another. </p>

<p>There were two relevant Cryptome tweets that included coordinates, first one about the bolthole and the perch at the Embassy (51째29&#39;56.62&quot; N 0째09&#39;40.51&quot; W) with the flag still flying, and then a second one about the Consulate (51째31&#39;49.39&quot; N 0째07&#39;01.46&quot; W) and the getaway. I don&#39;t have the full or exact wording of either tweet, but since I commented at the time, I do have the coordinates.</p>

<p>How&#39;d he get from the Embassy to the Consulate?</p>

<p>My working theory is that Cryptome was attempting to create white noise or disinfo for distraction.</p>

<p>Your instincts are good. In 20 years time, when we finally find out that Assange has died in a US military prison, remember this moment. Disinfo from every direction. </p>

<p>Either Assange is hiding for dramatic effect, or he&#39;s being water-boarded as we speak. I&#39;m not betting on dramatic effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if he is trying to escape he would have to move very slowly. There are so much CTV camera footage in London, if you move quickly it would be easier to track you. If he did leave England, it would be smarter to leave by boat, and that means he would be out of contact for several weeks depending on where he was going to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I&#39;m still hopeful he&#39;s hiding for dramatic effect, but I agree it isn&#39;t looking likely. I also very strongly doubt he escaped. And, if his enemies managed to raid the Embassy, they&#39;d&#39;ve offed him immediately; not to be grim, but his <em>body</em> could be eliminated from that site in any number of covert ways. They know his deadman&#39;s switch would be impossible to compromise with torture, so why bother going to the trouble of renditioning him? I&#39;m further guessing that they figured out the frequency with which he had to reset the switch and took him out within a time frame that ensured it wouldn&#39;t be tripped until well after the US election. They can then deal with the fallout of the big, final leak with the full resources of the US gov&#39;t to bury/discredit it.</p>

<p>Really hope I&#39;m wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can dig it. I agree. I hope we&#39;re wrong too.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the whole &quot;assange the shill&quot; theory. While I&#39;m certainly open to it, I tend to think he&#39;s legit. Especially now that he&#39;s &quot;missing&quot;. </p>

<p>He&#39;s kinda like Luke Skywalker, in my mind.</p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised at how emotional I am about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know he was at the Embassy, but if he was escaping and needed to hide him somewhere for a couple of hours they could move him to the Consulate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the first coordinates are actually for the window at the Columbian Embassy (which is part of the same building where the Ecudaor Embassy is at). And the Ecuador government still supports Assange, but are under extreme pressure, so the &quot;they&quot; would be some combination of the South American government officials that are sympathetic to Assange and anti-American. Columbia is a mess due to the US drug war, so it wouldn&#39;t be unimaginable for someone from the Columbian Embassy to help out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right about the coordinates and the US-Columbia/Ecuador relations. Here&#39;s a thought - there are security cameras all over the outside of that building, there&#39;s footage of every coming and going. Unless he tunneled out, there would be footage or suspicious gaps in footage. Wonder if Columbia and Ecuador are pissed off at the US enough to make the last week and a half of footage available for perusal?</p>

<p>I know I sound like I&#39;m grasping at straws, but I&#39;d like proof of life as much as anyone else at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The interesting thing about about tunneling out is that it very easy to do in London. London is over 2000 years old and has hundreds of tunnels. Tunneling out could be as easy as opening a door in the basement. I have no clue where you could find maps of subterranean London, or if there are maps, that show what is under the Embassy. </p>

<p>Without proof of life, all the talk of escape is just conjecture. However, I would much rather hope he got out, rather than him be killed or trapped in a black site or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Cryptome tweeted the coordinates, I ran directions between them to see different ways one could take from the Embassy to the Consulate. One of them went from Knightsbridge Station, along Piccadilly Line, runs right in front of Buckingham Palace to King&#39;s Cross Station (nearest station to the Consulate). I mean, you couldn&#39;t ask for a more spy-novel-ish setting. Entertained a bit of fantasy that maybe he did use some old tunnel to access the Tubes and made a break for it... </p>
