    <div class="md"><p>Most realistic, in my opinion.  The senior Bush was behind it.  He was head of C.I.A. at the time; and he could have the kind of clearance to prevent JFK&#39;s bodyguards from riding with him on his motorcade that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about it.  If you killed the president in a remote area, everyone would scream assassination.   But, do it in front of the while country, and you can feed them the &quot;lone&quot; gunman theory.  Besides, TPTB love to put their work on display.  Example, 9/11.  </p>

<p>The SUBCONSCIOUS is at play here as much as the conscious. Almost everyone in America knows the JFK murder was a conspiracy and that the country&#39;s been taken over--maybe not consciously, but deep down. Same with 9/11. When I really talk to people about this stuff, and you start to nudge, a lot of time the answer becomes &quot;I just don&#39;t want to think about this,&quot; or &quot;I just don&#39;t want to believe the world works that way.&quot;</p>

<a href="http://mileswmathis.com/barindex2.pdf">http://mileswmathis.com/barindex2.pdf</a></p>

<p>Most of the other theories assumes from square one that JFK was in fact murdered that day in that car. Which is not a logical assumption imho considering that the only photos of the body shows clearly that it’s not JFK. And following that assumption comes all that hula hoop about body switching. </p>

<p>It’s more conceivable to assume that the entire murder and the photo material was staged, including the murder of Oswald.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that does nag at me...</p>

<p>Why so few people in Dealey Plaza? If you see video footage from elsewhere along the motorcade, people are packed deep along the sidewalks to see the president. </p>

<p>But if you dig into the esoteric elements of the JFK assassination, you see the fingerprints of Freemasonry everywhere (Michael J. Hoffman&#39;s work, &quot;Kill King 33&quot; and so on have all explored this). Catholics and Freemasons, far as I&#39;m aware, don&#39;t really mix much. Unless, of course, the whole thing is run from the top down and it&#39;s really the Pope pulling the strings (or the Black Pope?). </p>

<p>So many questions around the JFK assassination. So few satisfying answers, even the ones we&#39;re pretty sure are right. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Mathis has the best explanation for this I think: The part where JFK is shot, is staged and filmed well beforehand. The extras are of course not told this is about faking the JFK murder, but to lower the risk of someone connecting the dots and talk, the don&#39;t use that many.</p>

<p>The umbrella man is the director. When he turn the umbrella it means action.</p>

<p>The Oswald murder is also obviously faked. As a photo shows in Miles article, it was pre miked</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but also the exact frame of thinking you need for this :-)</p>

<p>They typically layer an operation like this, and intentionally leave holes in every layer for people to figure out. So at the top layer we have Oswald as the lone gunman, but that layer has lots of intentional holes that smart people see. So for them there is the layer with multiple shooters and the grassy knoll. The obviously fake body. The fake Oswald murder and all that. And then they release some wacky conspiracy theories on top of that. This way they ensure the truth is sufficiently buried and will probably never be uncovered unless they decide to tell the truth, and chance is nobody will even believe the true story now.</p>

<p>I read a good article about how 9/11 might also have been layered, with Bush and Rumsfeld unaware about the third layer. That may explain their weird behavior that day. They thought the planes would only hit WTC because that would have been enough to start &quot;The great war on terror&quot;. But they did not know what the hell was going on when WTC was also demolished. Uh sorry, fell down because of ordinary fire...Lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll share but mind you I&#39;m not citing any sources.  I find it very compelling to see the film of the secret service confusion when told to stand down in Dallas.  It shows the bumper rider lifting his shoulders and hands in a &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot; way three separate times.  Clearly, the guy was confused at direct orders from his boss.  </p>

<p>LHO story is also very interesting, as he was working in a lab with Jack Ruby where cancer was being researched and had possibly been injected into millions of Americans .</p>

<p>Finally, Kennedy was attempting to return our economy to a silver standard, meaning there had to be enough actual capital for banks to loan out, as opposed to the electronic money that is now and was then used for loans to banks from the Fed.  That is why he was killed,IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The kill shot came from the &quot;grassy knoll&quot;. There is ample evidence to support this, including the Zapruder film which shows JFK&#39;s head snap back violently. This could&#39;ve only happened if he was shot from the front, while Oswald&#39;s shooting position was behind the President&#39;s car. Also, the sheer kinetic energy of the shot that blows off a quarter of his skull could not have been generated by the 6.5mm ammo of Oswald&#39;s rifle from 50 yards. Hope this helps.</p>
