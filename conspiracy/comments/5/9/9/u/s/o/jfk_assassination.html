       I'm currently watching a documentary of the JFK assassination. So much seems so weird to me and doesn't make sense. Ever since I learned about it and was old enough to understand what had happened I found something very odd about the whole thing. I look up conspiracies on this often and was wondering what the people of Reddit believe to be the most realistic.

       And of course the significance of Allen Dulles is that he embodied the Anglo-American establishment in the first half of the 20th century. He was THE man of the globalists, CFR, Rhodes Round Table, etc. This guy was one of the most epic agents of the shadow government, on the level of a Kissinger or Brzezinski.

       Most realistic, in my opinion.  The senior Bush was behind it.  He was head of C.I.A. at the time; and he could have the kind of clearance to prevent JFK's bodyguards from riding with him on his motorcade that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit*. Bush was C.I.A., not the head of it.  His director rule would happen several years later.

       Simple.  JFK wanted to disband the C.I.A., and G.H.W Bush was not ready to give up that kind of power.

       But the one thing that bothered is why did they wait for him to drive off? Obviously that would be a far harder shot to hit as apposed to a shot on him standing still. They show him talking before it at a stand. Why not take the shot then? Even the best gunman would rather take that shot than a moving shot.

       Think about it.  If you killed the president in a remote area, everyone would scream assassination.   But, do it in front of the while country, and you can feed them the "lone" gunman theory.  Besides, TPTB love to put their work on display.  Example, 9/11.

       The SUBCONSCIOUS is at play here as much as the conscious. Almost everyone in America knows the JFK murder was a conspiracy and that the country's been taken over--maybe not consciously, but deep down. Same with 9/11. When I really talk to people about this stuff, and you start to nudge, a lot of time the answer becomes "I just don't want to think about this," or "I just don't want to believe the world works that way."

       You're right, he was not head of the C.I.A. at the time of JFK's assassination.  But, he was definitely top brass in the group.  He had a lot of shady family business/wealth that he covered through his C.I.A. handlings.  Look up his father Prescott.

       The "Official Story" says Bush had no affiliation with the CIA until he was named its director under that sap Gerald Ford. Just another insulting lie that the majority of the country tells itself to believe.

       I think Miles Mathis theory is the most convincing

       Most of the other theories assumes from square one that JFK was in fact murdered that day in that car. Which is not a logical assumption imho considering that the only photos of the body shows clearly that it’s not JFK. And following that assumption comes all that hula hoop about body switching.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s more conceivable to assume that the entire murder and the photo material was staged, including the murder of Oswald.

       I honestly think this is the most likely situation.  So many other historical events have turned up as fabrications and hoaxes, it seems par for the course.  Another story to tug the heartstrings of the masses in the direction TPTB want them to go.  They even created a murder mystery that people are trying to solve to this day.  Twist is there was no murder.

       Yeah I know. But I really like his logic and reasoning. And he's excellent at analyzing photos and faces. And if the body at the morgue was not JFK, why assume he was killed at all that day?

       One thing that does nag at me...
      </p>
      <p>
       Why so few people in Dealey Plaza? If you see video footage from elsewhere along the motorcade, people are packed deep along the sidewalks to see the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you dig into the esoteric elements of the JFK assassination, you see the fingerprints of Freemasonry everywhere (Michael J. Hoffman's work, "Kill King 33" and so on have all explored this). Catholics and Freemasons, far as I'm aware, don't really mix much. Unless, of course, the whole thing is run from the top down and it's really the Pope pulling the strings (or the Black Pope?).

       So many questions around the JFK assassination. So few satisfying answers, even the ones we're pretty sure are right.

        Why so few people in Dealey Plaza? If you see video footage from elsewhere along the motorcade, people are packed deep along the sidewalks to see the president.

       Mathis has the best explanation for this I think: The part where JFK is shot, is staged and filmed well beforehand. The extras are of course not told this is about faking the JFK murder, but to lower the risk of someone connecting the dots and talk, the don't use that many.

       The umbrella man is the director. When he turn the umbrella it means action.

       The Oswald murder is also obviously faked. As a photo shows in Miles article, it was pre miked

       Yeah, but also the exact frame of thinking you need for this :-)
      </p>
      <p>
       They typically layer an operation like this, and intentionally leave holes in every layer for people to figure out. So at the top layer we have Oswald as the lone gunman, but that layer has lots of intentional holes that smart people see. So for them there is the layer with multiple shooters and the grassy knoll. The obviously fake body. The fake Oswald murder and all that. And then they release some wacky conspiracy theories on top of that. This way they ensure the truth is sufficiently buried and will probably never be uncovered unless they decide to tell the truth, and chance is nobody will even believe the true story now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read a good article about how 9/11 might also have been layered, with Bush and Rumsfeld unaware about the third layer. That may explain their weird behavior that day. They thought the planes would only hit WTC because that would have been enough to start "The great war on terror". But they did not know what the hell was going on when WTC was also demolished. Uh sorry, fell down because of ordinary fire...Lol

       Yeah, I saw that three-layer theory of 9/11 somewhere too, recently. Saved the document, now I can't find it, LOL. It's interesting, but wow, that's some heady shit.

       I'll share but mind you I'm not citing any sources.  I find it very compelling to see the film of the secret service confusion when told to stand down in Dallas.  It shows the bumper rider lifting his shoulders and hands in a "what's going on?" way three separate times.  Clearly, the guy was confused at direct orders from his boss.
      </p>
      <p>
       LHO story is also very interesting, as he was working in a lab with Jack Ruby where cancer was being researched and had possibly been injected into millions of Americans .

       Finally, Kennedy was attempting to return our economy to a silver standard, meaning there had to be enough actual capital for banks to loan out, as opposed to the electronic money that is now and was then used for loans to banks from the Fed.  That is why he was killed,IMO.

       I felt like there was multiple gunman though. Even in the interviews with people who were there said they heard three shots. But then why would they frame Oswald? I honestly don't think it was him but if it was, I believe there were other shooters involved.

       The kill shot came from the "grassy knoll". There is ample evidence to support this, including the Zapruder film which shows JFK's head snap back violently. This could've only happened if he was shot from the front, while Oswald's shooting position was behind the President's car. Also, the sheer kinetic energy of the shot that blows off a quarter of his skull could not have been generated by the 6.5mm ammo of Oswald's rifle from 50 yards. Hope this helps.
      </p>

       Zapruder film:

       I get what you're saying but I'm talking about that day. It showed up speaking before he was in the car and everyone was around him listening. I might misunderstand what was happening but fro what it showed was him speaking in front of others. So why not do it then whilst he's standing still?

       My question is...how come people do not believe James Files' story? I watched the interview he did from prison and I thought he was convincing. I'm not saying I'm convinced, but I'm just wondering why nobody ever talks about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely CIA. Definitely GHWB. Definitely Johnson. I believe the Lee and Harvey theory. Currently I believe James Files made the kill shot.

       "Illuminati wife tells all". On youtube. Basically she talks about how there are marines who had shit backgrounds and the order or whoever was in control chose them for their horrible backgrounds because it made them easy to control. Oswald was one of those very people who were easy to control. He was military. As well, theres this documentary that basically says lincoln and jfk were two presidents that didnt want to fall in line with the rothschilds regardless of their destiny or what have you. They just didnt want to comply.
