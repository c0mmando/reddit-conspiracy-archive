<p>The only economic system I believe in is sacred economics which doesn&#39;t use money and there is no ownership. Before you yell communism, remember that communism uses money and the elite steal a lot of it before dividing it up.</p>

<p>Sacred economics is based on sharing. Capitalism is based on greed and selfishness. Sacred economics is based on love.</p>

<p>Everything is free.</p>

<p>We all work our passions.</p>

<p>Switch jobs at anytime.</p>

<p>No bills.</p>

<p>Rough jobs like janitor work is now respected instead of looked down on.</p>

<p>No accounting.</p>

<p>No banks.</p>

<p>No elite.</p>

<p>No financial worry.</p>

<p>No superiority or inferiority complexes (related to money).
Increased cooperation and love for mankind.</p>

<p>No hoarding of wealth, technology, or resources for profit.</p>

<p>No homeless.</p>

<p>No national debt.</p>

<p>Faster societal progress since everyone is mostly working their passion which helps a lot.</p>

<p>Probabaly less than 8 hours a day of work. I can see 5 hours a day easy if 95% work.</p>

<p>Work becomes honorable and fulfilling.</p>

<p>There are so many benefits, it&#39;s mind boggling. Jesus was right. Money is the root of all evil. Evil is actually regress while good is progress. Money is literally a ball and chain on mankind and it&#39;s holding all of us, except the elite, back.</p>

<p>People are bombarded with bills. This is slavery. It&#39;s no wonder why so many are doing drugs. The drug trade is run off of money. Take the money out and people won&#39;t be incentivized to commit criminal acts. Better yet, legalize drugs and create social systems to get people off them and aware of the dangers.</p>

<p>We need to get off our dependacy on money. We can start in 1 state as an experiment. I&#39;m positive it would work. I got this idea from conversations with God months ago and have thought long and hard about it.</p>

<p>Money is Pandora&#39;s box.</p>

<p>What about the jobs no one is passionate about? Who would clean toilets without a financial incentive? Who would work in factories? I&#39;ve worked in factories. You can feel your soul being drained a little every day working in a factory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have such little faith in the human heart. People are a lot more human than you think. They run capitalism on the basis of greed and greed is NOT human nature. Greed is a learned trait and the only way it can be learned is by teaching it and forcing people to engage in greed regularly. </p>

<p>Love is the natural material the mind is made of. Once people get a taste of it, they want more and more. Giving love by taking odd jobs is utterly satisfying for many but some people need to experience these things on a daily basis as they don&#39;t understand who they are yet. This is the core feature of the natural mind when self actualized. It&#39;s what keeps society together and we rarely practice this in media or in systems such as the economic system. </p>

<p>Have faith in others. Have faith in yourself. The more we cooperate with each other, the better our quality of life becomes. We will have a town hall like Reddit where we discuss strategies among ourselves the keep the planetary machine moving and solve issues. No laws, no jails, just self regulation. </p>

<p>This would be a huge pathway for the 5 things the self actualized mind truly wants to experience across the masses which are:</p>

<p>Love - we work for each other as equals and therefore give and receive love regularly based on humanity rather than based on how much money someone has. This is a huge jump and has insane benefits to the mind as love heals all and puts things in order. The 4 others below are subcategories of love. </p>

<p>Peace - everyone wants to sleep in peace and wake up in peace. We all have each other backs in the new economy wile capitalism is an &quot;every man for himself&quot; system that I should brutal and cold. </p>

<p>Freedom - Money restricts freedom and so does hoarding. Most of the hoarding is done by the elite but we all have garages full of useful stuff that we can share and imrpove society as a whole. </p>

<p>Unity - we are a giant army of humans and a United front against poverty and helplessness is a sweet gesture. </p>

<p>Joy - believe it or not, having fun I should a core and very important aspect of the mind. Lack of fun leads to sadness and then to depression. We can have a lot of fun. Most people will need to work a passion or desire to have fun. In our town hall meetings, we can figure out agreed upon systems to volunteer for shit jobs. Honestly, with 7 billion in the world, there are plenty who will do so with love towards mankind and the new way of life. Look at all the shit you do now to survive in capitalism. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to understand how this would feel as there are so many benefits. Let&#39;s share our world. Why does the Middle East take all the oil just because it&#39;s sitting on it? Why are we hoarding and spending some much time with money that I should being stolen from us at every single passing second? This is unfair and the flaw in the system is that money can&#39;t be tracked. We can turn the slaveship around. </p>

<p>Greed would not exist if it were not human nature. Never in the history of mankind under any system has there not been greed. </p>

<p>It is nature&#39;s system to reward actions and punish actions. If sex was not pleasurable would humans/animals reproduce? If not for pain would you be careful not to damage your body? If you never felt hunger would you forget to eat?</p>

<p>The incentive/punishment system is nature&#39;s system and is hard wired into the brain.

<p>Greed is a learned trait. We aren&#39;t born with it. It has been taught to us for thousands of years by the elite. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a psychologist myself and let me clarify reward and punishment. Reward is great. That is natural. Punishment is not natural and it is inflicted. Whenever humans make mistakes, there is something called &quot;consequences&quot;. These consequences are painful and are built into the system to teach us not to commit certain behaviors. Punishment from man is a kind of &quot;double punishment&quot;. We are crushing each other on top of the natural consequences and so punishment is yet another failed belief that humans hold. Once the iron fist is removed, behavior resumes. The only way to change behavior is to change beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe your skull might be 4-6x thicker than average. The fact that you think it&#39;s not possible and we will have all kinds of people sucking the tit of the system is hilarious. How many people are currently unemployed in the US? 93 million according to my quick google search. That&#39;s over 1/4 of people in the belly of the beast.</p>

<p>Your mentality is so illogical.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s have it your way then, we&#39;ll cram the ground full of chemicals to extract clean water. We&#39;ll feed everyone poison to reduce human life span and kill them with big pharma right when they start to get sick.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll continue to fly air planes into our own buildings killing our own people so that we can invade a country to kill more people and use it to pay all our slave masters.</p>

<p>Then we&#39;ll continue to destroy the environment and killing any last thing we have left that resembles alive. Kill the trees, kill the animals, kill the fish, kill the bugs, kill the grass nothing alive is left. Anything alive must be GMO&#39;d.</p>

<p>Next we will add more fluoride to the water so that no one will ask any questions and everyone will become even dumber and be happy with it.</p>

<p>After that we will make meth and crack more readily available to anyone. We will increase opium production in afghanistan to reduce prices over here in good ol&#39; USA.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the american dream because you&#39;ve gotta be asleep to believe it. Keep them sleeping up the chemicals and implement virtual reality. From there we will have everyone on a routine like so.</p>

<p>Work 8 hours - sleep 8 hours - touch yourself 2 times a day - eat as many meals as you can a day to keep the sugar high as consistent as possible - feed everyone mass anti depressants in the water - more frequent vaccines going later into your life in the name of disease prevention. - Television everywhere filled with more and more bullcrap facts than ever before - watch every citizen and make sure anyone who is peering through the fake world is quickly dealt with by cramming tons of &quot;facts&quot; down their throat until they somehow go back to believing the lie - Next we&#39;ll up the police state and put army tanks and assault rifles in every city just so everyone knows they are watching - By then no one will ask questions and any who do will be met with a massive penalty in the name of debt.</p>

<p>Anyone who wants to pay off the debt must be a debt slave. If you are not a debt slave you are 10% free because you have the choices of which brain washing you prefer to listen/watch/play today. Welcome to the new world I hope you have a great stay</p>

<p>After we&#39;ve done all that we can easily implement our scheme of knowledge to fit our means. People will be too stupid to read between the lines so we can easily make it idiocracy(if it isn&#39;t already that movie as it is)</p>

<p>&quot;Brondo&#39;s got what plants crave, yeah it&#39;s got electrolytes.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t talk to those people it&#39;s called brain washing and them being convinced with no other possible explanation. Yes you are 100% right in my opinion. I have always described it like this -</p>

<p>There are 8 billion people in the world, do you think it&#39;s possible we just set up massive buildings/fields of food to grow for everyone on earth? The answer is quite obviously yes.</p>

<p>Next you take Tesla&#39;s free energy model they claim to be &quot;dangerous&quot; and you implement it. There is food for all and electricity for all in 2 simple steps.</p>

<p>Take out all the BS paperwork people have to do and bring out better technology that is made to last and not to break. Make proper housing everywhere for people to stay at. Fix the world issues like environment by simply reinventing the way we get things.</p>

<p>For example instead of throwing out 4 water bottles a day create a way to harness water straight from the air we are surrounded by. It&#39;s already complete and runs off electricity, the free energy we can implement. Get machines to create whatever we need in mass. Like glasses and plates. Have people do pottery as a job and create unique plates. Hell, make people instructors so that we can make our own plates, do glass blowing and create your own glasses. I&#39;m sure there are people who will do what they want and also create for other people. I work at a job right now in a factory in a positive environment and as much as I hate my slave wages I don&#39;t even mind working because it&#39;s pleasant to be around people who are positive and nice. Create that environment around the world is the true goal.</p>
