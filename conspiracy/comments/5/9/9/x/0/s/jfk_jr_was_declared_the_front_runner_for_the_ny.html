<blockquote>
<p>&quot; Although Kennedy never publicly ruled out the possibility, it was thought that he privately ruled out elective office for himself. The two friends, however, told a different story. The friend who expected Kennedy to seek office in the &quot;foreseeable future&quot; also told of speaking with Kennedy earlier this year about the Moynihan seat. &quot;I asked him was he casually thinking about it, or was he serious. He sort of said, &#39;I&#39;m not sure. Let me think about it.</p>

<p>&#39; &quot; But the second friend called Kennedy&#39;s interest &quot;pretty serious,&quot; adding: &quot;I think he was intrigued by the idea. . . . Would he have decided in the end to go for it? I don&#39;t know. But he was clearly thinking about it. He talked to a few people about it. Then the Hillary thing ended it pretty quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but remember the context: JFK, Jr had launched &quot;George&quot; magazine as his first tentative foray into politics. It was widely seen as his initial toe-testing before he ran for Senate or Congress.</p>

<p>Everyone talked at the time of his new-found ambition. (I remember: I was alive back then. An adult, even.)</p>

<p>I bought the first issue of &quot;George&quot; magazine, with Cindy Crawford on the cover.</p>

<p>And I recall that he did in fact consider running for Daniel Patrick Moynihan&#39;s open seat after he died. Here&#39;s an article on it, entitled &quot;JFK, Jr. Mulled Run For Senate&quot;: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/jfk-jr-mulled-run-senate-2000-article-1.847866">http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/jfk-jr-mulled-run-senate-2000-article-1.847866</a></p>

<p>So it&#39;s simply not true that he wasn&#39;t thinking of running.</p>

<p>There was great social pressure <em>for</em> him to run, too.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s the Wikileaks disclosures speaking . . . but (knowing Clinton collusion with the media and their wide network of operatives) is it just possible that the narrative that JFK, Jr. wasn&#39;t going to run a talking-point put out by the Clintons themselves? An attempt to gas-light the public that there was no connection between JFK, Jr.&#39;s untimely death and Hillary Clinton&#39;s abiding good-luck?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s quote the article: &quot;Two friends said yesterday they believed he would have run for office some day. Earlier this year, in one of the best-kept secrets in state politics, Kennedy considered seeking the seat of retiring Sen. Daniel Moynihan in 2000, friends confirmed yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>So this claim that&#39;s being floated on this thread that he wasn&#39;t thinking of challenging Hillary seems bizarre to someone like me [who was alive at the time and remembers the media cycle]. The John-Was-Never-Gonna-Run narrative seems like a talking-point of dubious authenticity.</p>

<p>Just sayin&#39;.</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: The reason why the public at the time suspected a Clinton hit was that that&#39;s how the Clintons took out Ron Brown. In a plane crash. They used the plane crash methodology a number of times, if you go back and research. So the JFK, Jr. death didn&#39;t take place in a void. It took place after a string of coincidentally lucky deaths that personally and professionally benefited the Clintons, related to plane crashes.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In a December 26 e-mail to his siblings, George W. Bush wrote that he was &#39;thinking about eulogy&#39; and solicited stories that best illustrated their father&#39;s sweet nature, favorite jokes, and acts of kindness. &#39;Hopefully I&#39;m jumping the gun,&#39; noted Bush, who added, &#39;But since the feeling is that you all would rather me speak than bubba, please help.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;The mention of &#39;bubba&#39; is apparently a reference to Clinton, whom Bush has referred to as a &#39;brother&#39; due to his close relationship with George H. W. Bush.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, he was flying in poor conditions, and he wasn&#39;t instrument rated. He had also recently purchased the plane he was flying.</p>

<p>It gets interesting when you learn that JFKjr always took an instructor with him on flights, and that this would have been his first flight w/o an instructor (at least in that plane, maybe overall). He and the two other passengers were also seen waiting around in the lounge before they departed, even though ostensibly their whole party was there.</p>

<p>I realize that&#39;s all circumstantial, but there&#39;s a lot of other circumstantial evidence, that when taken as a whole makes this incident look suspicious.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/jfkjr/stories/kennedy071899.htm">President Clinton spoke yesterday with Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, John&#39;s sister, who was returning to the compound from a trip out west. He also called Sen. Kennedy, John&#39;s uncle, and spoke with Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo, who is married to John&#39;s cousin Kerry. &quot;He wanted to let them know he was thinking about them, that we&#39;ll do everything we can, and that our prayers are with them,&quot; said Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the New York Times:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/22/us/bodies-from-kennedy-crash-are-found.html?">President Clinton, who has talked continually with Kennedy family members since the plane was reported missing, said he had authorized a continuation of the unusually long search, which has been criticized as excessive for three private citizens.
&#39;&#39;Because of the role of the Kennedy family in our national lives and because of the enormous losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes, I thought it was appropriate to give them a few more days,&#39;&#39; Mr. Clinton said this afternoon during a news conference on other topics.
&#39;&#39;If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at fault -- I am,&#39;&#39; Mr. Clinton said. &#39;&#39;It was because I thought it was the right thing to do under the circumstances.&#39;&#39;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and I am trying to explain that this is not surprising when the person missing is a president&#39;s son, a senator&#39;s nephew, and personal friends with many people in the ranks of the government elite at the time.

<p>On topic, the involvement of the military, while unusual, doesn&#39;t seem so far an excess when compared to the additional effort that goes into celebrity crashes. So if we pulled out a lot of stops for John effing Denver, why wouldn&#39;t the NTSB pull out all the stops for the son of a ranking senator? </p>

<p>Of course its excessive. But that doesn&#39;t automatically imply anything other than the NTSB going all out to find the cause. If your point is that it&#39;s excessive and that the public is treated differently than the elite, I agree. </p>

<p>If your point is that this had some broader significance, or that he was murdered, I don&#39;t know who gained from it or what the motive was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve seen it too? It&#39;s funny how much flak I&#39;ve gotten on this sub given that not too long ago the movie that it is a sequel to was the pic on the sidebar of the sub.</p>

<p>I also would like to know your opinion of those films? I thought they laid out the evidence well, but the production was so bizarre. It seemed like the narrator&#39;s accent was all over the place. Weird phrasing of things. The abrupt shift to calling the conspirators &#39;devils.&#39;  Which might sound normal in print, but was a truly odd thing for a narrator to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i came out thinking, between all the conflicting reports of generals and search teams, them confirming information and then going back on it, the time frame, looking in areas that didnt make sense, the missing co pilot seat after them seemingly waiting on another pilot to make the trip. Fuel cut off switch. No logs. The path the plane took into the ocean. It was pretty cut and dry for me. Narrorator is a bit odd, but the information is plentiful and when examined as a whole really makes the whole thing look pretty damning. It kills me when people just throw out that he wasnt trained well enough and made a dumb mistake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I feel safer with you owning handguns. </p>

<p>When you are not at the range, honing your skills; here is some reading material.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm">&quot;The Gentleperson&#39;s Guide to Forum Spies&quot;</a></p>

<p>Snippet:</p>

<p>Technique #2 - &#39;CONSENSUS CRACKING&#39;</p>

<p>A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com">www.abovetopsecret.com</a>) is &#39;consensus cracking.&#39; To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger &#39;evidence&#39; or disinformation in your favour is slowly &#39;seeded in.&#39; Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then &#39;abort&#39; the consensus cracking by initiating a &#39;forum slide.&#39;</p>

<p>Technique #3 - &#39;TOPIC DILUTION&#39;</p>

<p>Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a &#39;RESOURCE BURN.&#39; By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a &#39;gossip mode.&#39; In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to &#39;drive in the wedge.&#39; By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.</p>

<p>&quot;In present day life, it is ironic that the media, like the Greek Furies of old, have inherited the malevolent capacity to drive any one of us mad. In essence, with the echoing power of modern communications, they have replaced the assassin&#39;s bullet as the means of political destruction. Their capacity for malice has been phenomenally effective in ending the presumptions of outspoken iconoclasts by simplifying and marginalizing them.&quot; - <strong>Oliver Stone, Our Counterfeit History, George Magazine, October 1998</strong>. </p>

<p>But why would anyone want to kill John Kennedy Jr.? He was planning to run for National office according to Newsweek and People. He told friends he would have run for Senate in New York, but let Hillary Clinton run instead. And he would have won. He was the most popular man in the US. And for good reason. He was a great guy.

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair,  calling her Shillary cLIEnton is a childish way to discredit her. Calling her crooked is just pointing out her own patterns and habits. I think at a certain point, you should be discredited if your justly deserved nickname is &quot;Crooked Hillary&quot;.

<p>It&#39;s not a matter of fairness. It&#39;s human perception. Psychology. You can call her all those names among peers who use the same nicknames and you&#39;ll be fine. But if you&#39;re looking to persuade others, you&#39;re better off sounding more professional. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but let me stop you there. This is not only a political topic, but a story of the dangers of aviation as well. IIRC, JFK Jr was flying IFR (Instrument Flying Rules) in horrible weather with no sight. He got the feeling that he was flying high, so he nosed down. What actually happened, however, was his body tricked him and he didn&#39;t trust his instruments, so he flew himself straight into the water. It&#39;s a strong lesson on why you can&#39;t trust how your body feels during flight and must use your instruments, especially in no-vis conditions! </p>

<p>jfk jr made radio contact with the control tower at martha&#39;s vineyard. </p>

<p>the pentagon, as proven in newcast video footage above, silenced the coast guard and pretended jfk jr was lost hundreds of miles away.</p>

<p>jfk jr&#39;s plane also made a sudden nosedive as they were just a few miles away from martha&#39;s vineyard.  flight record logs prove that.</p>

<p>conspiracy and coverup confirmed.</p>

<p>edit:  and who could forget the fact that his plane&#39;s fuel control valve was switched off (the reason for the admitted nosedive off martha vineyard&#39;s coast).  either jfk jr was suicidal, or someone on that plane wanted him dead/them dead.  it is no surprise the passenger seat was missing.</p>

<p>Btw.: Sanders did something else: He forced Clinton to adapt some of her positions as a trade in for his support for Clinton which could very well be the best case scenario - something I&#39;m pretty sure Donald Trump would never even have tought about...assuming that Trump <em>has</em> political positions aside from witty oneliners..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so he may not have actually run for the seat but the events surrounding his death are very suspicious. He was a very tedious and calculative man and was not keen to flying without a flight instructor. Especially as he had only had his new plane for a little more than a month. The search did not begin for 15 hours after the last contact he had with the air  traffic controller and the Air Force took over the search operations and delayed it well over when they should have actually gone looking. They had reasons to oust him early. He would have been what his father and Robert were supposed to be, the leaders of a new generation of America that would hoist us from the clutches of big bankers and the elite. They knew the power he possessed and his smarts and good looks were a threat to the establishment. Conspiracy or not the death of JFK Jr. was suspicious and we should be looking at that aspect of it and not if he was running for a seat or not and arguing over that one simple little misinfo.</p>

Like Time and Life that kinda stuff. There was one Magazine that had an expose kind of thing about John F Kennedy and Kennedy Jr. About how he would play in the oval office and stuff. So there was one paragraph that described about how Jr was obsessed with playing with his toy planes and one day wanted to be like a pilot or something. I thought it was kinda foreboding (if thats the word) it got really into planes and Jr though. If anyone wants to know the issue/mag I can prob find it quick.</p>

He was asked or told by more experienced pilots to wait until morning.  He chose not to do this.  It&#39;s really easy to flip a plane upside down, and not realize it in those conditions.  So, when he thought he was going up, he was going down, and believed that his instruments were giving him bogus readings.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was surfing the net one day &amp; something popped up about JFK Jr.&#39;s plane crash being a conspiracy. I thought that was ridiculous but then read the article--which led to another, then another--and began to have second thoughts. Nothing&#39;s definite, of course, but it&#39;s all interesting reading.</p>

<p>Initial news reports said that the haze was bad on the flight from Teterboro Airport to Martha&#39;s Vineyard. He filed no flight plan, made no contact with any air tower after leaving NJ, ended up w/spatial disorientation &amp; spiraled out of control into the ocean.</p>

<p>Supposedly he did not file a flight plan, which isn&#39;t always required anyway, BUT I think it&#39;s a law when the weather is questionable. Would the haze in Teterboro qualify? I definitely would have filed one just to be on the safe side. If the weather was bad, couldn&#39;t he have used the autopilot? The media also spread the story that JFK was a careless, reckless pilot, but one of John&#39;s best friends said he would have flown anywhere with him; he was a good pilot, he certainly wouldn&#39;t have endangered anyone intentionally.</p>

<p>The haze did not extend to Martha&#39;s Vineyard, eastern Massachusetts was perfectly clear for around 8 miles to the east (the direction JFK was arriving from).</p>

<p>John supposedly did make contact w/Martha&#39;s Vineyard even though he was past his ETA time due to a late start in leaving NJ. He radioed around 9:30 p.m. saying he&#39;d be landing w/in 30 minutes, dropping off his sister-in-law, then leaving shortly for Hyannis. He may have even had the lights of the runway in sight, they were certainly bright enough because local residents had been complaining about the brightness. </p>

<p>Around 9:35 p.m. a fisherman on the beach saw a flash of bright light, followed by a LOUD explosion, apparently in the direction of where John&#39;s plane was coming from. What could it have been?</p>

<p>The hasty burial at sea struck me as odd &amp; makes no sense to me whatsoever. Why did the Kennedy family agree to it? John was never in the Navy like his father. I doubt he would have wanted it, neither would his wife. To this day I can&#39;t figure out why he wasn&#39;t buried in NYC, a city he loved &amp; considered home.</p>

<p>I read somewhere that John was thinking about announcing his candidacy for the vacant NY Senate Seat in August of 1999, which ended up going to Hillary. We&#39;ll never know what he was thinking, but I believe he was going to end up in public service eventually. No doubt if he ran he would have been elected due to his image, good looks and pedigree, even if he had no experience. None of that would have mattered &amp; I think he could have done a good job regardless.</p>

<p>GEORGE magazine was supposedly started because JFK Jr. always wanted to know who killed his father; the magazine provided a good cover for his investigation. George Bush Sr. was the head of the CIA in Dallas in 1963. If the CIA was involved with JFK&#39;s assassination, Bush would have known about it. The name of the magazine was a sign to the Bush family that John was on to them and perhaps even planning to publish his findings once he had more proof.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t put anything past the Bush or Clinton families. If there was/is a conspiracy for both JFK &amp; JFK Jr., the tracks have been extremely well covered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry let me rephrase. </p>

<p>Do you even understand critical thought process or just mindless regurgitation of &quot;facts&quot;?</p>

<p>A conspiracy is a plausible explanation to an event through an analysis of whom could have pulled what strings and would also benefit, contradictory or even independent of what the &quot;official&quot; explanation is. Mostly based on inconsistencies and inaccuracies as well as new evidence as well as evidence deemed &quot;unrelated&quot; to the situation.</p>

<p>Your using an &quot;official&quot; story as if it is rock solid evidence to support your argument… in r/conspiracy. People call this sub crazy yet this is what we have to deal with</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay let me explain.</p>

<p>You&#39;re playing a game with very structured coding. However, your particular version of the game had changes made to its code. </p>

<p>The copy you&#39;re playing won&#39;t let you get passed level 1. You can&#39;t win, the game has been broken by external forces. Everything else is that same except the one task you must complete to move on simply doesn&#39;t exist in this version. </p>

<p>You are destined to die and never move past level one because someone else screwed around with the code. Do you get it now? </p>

<p>Pilot error = equipment that has been tampered with. </p>
