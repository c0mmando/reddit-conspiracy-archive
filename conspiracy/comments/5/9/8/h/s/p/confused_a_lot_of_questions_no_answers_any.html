        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;m fairly new to this sub, and you could say newly awakened. Maybe 10 years ago or so I started looking into a lot of things 9/11, Illuminati, Freemasonry etc... However after a year or so I felt I was going to far down the rabbit hole and it consume me. So I stepped away and went on with my daily life not thinking much about it at all. </p>

<p>Now with the election going on the emails and everything I&#39;m seeing with wikileaks and Julian Assange I&#39;m starting to wonder again. Part of me though wonders if it&#39;s all going to turn into a 2012 end of the world Mayans predicted it situation. Am I wasting my time, is any of this legitimate, am I going to far down the rabbit hole?   </p>

<p>Before I&#39;m called a plant or whatever. I&#39;m just asking for information and help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please try to predict my &quot;religious views.&quot;  Should be interesting. </p>

<p>What is your &quot;awoken&quot; philosophy of life that makes the world more beautiful and amazing? </p>

<p>There is no truth that is &quot;mine&quot; (relativism is inherently absurd). God is the only Truth. There can be no meaning in life (or existence) without God. He is the one who holds you out from nothingness.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Rationale for the Self-Evidence of God&#39;s Existence
1-  Each new moment, we are standing out from nothingness in a new way -- a way in which we never stood out from nothingness before.  I never stood out from nothingness before in the way that I am doing right NOW and right NOW and right NOW, etc.
2-  Where does the new existence come from?
3-  A cause cannot give what it doesn&#39;t have.
4-  I have no actual future existence to give myself right now.  I only have present actual existence.
5-  Therefore, I cannot give myself any actual future existence, since I have none to give.
6-  Nor can any other creature -- or even an infinite set of creatures -- give me actual future existence, since none of the have any actual future existence to give -- they are all in the same predicament that I am in.
7-  Therefore, the only Cause that can give me moment-by-moment existence is a Cause that transcends the problem of existential change, a Cause which does not undergo existential change, but which can give existence without in any way being undiminished in so doing.  It must be an Eternal, Immutable, Undiminishable Cause.  And this is what we call God.   Therefore, God exists.</p>

<p>The Rationale for the Self-Evidence of God&#39;s Existence is based on Necessary and Sufficient Conditions.  It is essentially a Transcendental Argument.  It involves a Virtuous Logical Circle, so it is circular, but not in a vicious, fallacious way, but in a Transcendental, Virtuous way.
1- When we affirm that some finite existent  exists or has meaning, we IMPLICITLY CO-AFFIRM that the Necessary and Sufficient Conditions must also exist, otherwise it would not exist or have meaning.
2- But God is the Ultimate Necessary and Sufficient Condition for all existence and meaning, since no existence and meaning  can possibly be accounted for apart from Him.
3-  Therefore, to affirm the existence or meaning of a finite existence is to IMPLICITLY CO-AFFIRM the existence of God.</p>

<p>Premise 2 seems to be begging the question, but it really isn&#39;t since it can be demonstrated that anything less than the Immutable Self-Existent God cannot give an ultimate ontological explanation for the existence and meaning of anything.  And this can be shown by The  Argument from Existential Change as presented above.  </p>

<p>So The Rationale for the Self-Evidence of God&#39;s Existence and The Argument from Existential Change  go together and Co-vindicate one another.
They are a powerful, irrefutable combination.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say you&#39;re far from crazy and I&#39;ll give you a some reasons why.</p>

<p>Everything goes up in price nothing goes down, good jobs are always lost and terrible ones replace them. Therefore we make less and everything costs more. That part of the system will forcibly snap one day, if not now, in the near future.</p>

<p>Everything made today is made to break. We only have so much litter we can pollute the world with. It&#39;s already terrible but look around, cars break easier, computers, everything literally breaks very fast. I bet my playstation4 is going to die before my playstation 2, I bought my PS2 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Free energy is real and we are paying ridiculous amounts for hydro.</p>

<p>Everything is rigged, the economy is rigged, everything is a stage. One day we&#39;ll change it but for now we are forced to live inside of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, there&#39;s a group of ppl who are intentionally engineering the conditions for a global collapse, cos shit is all fucked up and is clearly not moving in the direction of being fixed (or is it! that&#39;s another debate entirely), so why not smash it and rebuild.  They&#39;re really well advanced in their narrative.  Personally I think they should smoke a doobie and ponder lost potential.  I think the failures in humanity they observe have cognitive causes that are addressable, and a reset is an overly harsh tool for a nuanced problem.  All a reset does is provide a fitness test for anti-resetness and not for any of the other talents humanity has.  It&#39;s a monometric solution for a polymetric reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What sort of information do you want? Some key books, without even touching on the spiritual end of things, would be:</p>

<p>&quot;Tragedy and Hope 101&quot; by Joe Plummer. He&#39;s got a free pdf on his website, google your way there.</p>

<p>&quot;The American Deep State&quot; by Peter Dale Scott. It&#39;s on Amazon, and you can read a lot of it for free on Amazon. </p>

<p>&quot;JFK and the Unspeakable&quot; by James Douglas. It&#39;s the best book on the event that got this whole mess rolling. I think there&#39;s also a pdf of it floating around online somewhere. </p>

<p>&quot;The Devil&#39;s Chessboard&quot; by David Talbot. Makes a good companion piece for the JFK book, about Alan Dulles and the CIA. </p>

<p>Good luck! Let me know if you read any of these and what you think!</p>
