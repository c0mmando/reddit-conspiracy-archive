<p>Most (not all) only care about buying shit, showing others they bought shit, going to work and showing people they know shit, and saying, &quot;See manager I did an awesome job shovelling your shit&quot;, now gimme some cheddar so I can repeat this cycle.

    <div class="md"><p>As an Agnostic, I sometimes wonder  if Christianity and Catholicism aren&#39;t the lesser evil. The philosophy that&#39;s embedded in western religions does seem to help mitigate moral and ethical debacles comparatively better than faith in governments. Though both are pretty fucked up. Some people literally need to be trick and lied to in-order to make them not be shitty people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it depends on which parts of Christianity or Catholicism you follow or believe in.  Obviously people have done (and still do) horrible things in the name of Christianity and/or Catholicism.  On the other hand, if you think of Christ as a historical figure or even as a historical concept, he was kind of a revolutionary for the common man. 
Same deal with government, it CAN be a force for good, but government seems to eventually be used by bad people to achieve their own ends.<br/>
I agree that &quot;some people literally need to be tricked and lied to in order to make them not be shitty people&quot;, but the more intelligent psychopaths of the world who end up moving to the top of governments and corporations aren&#39;t guided by morals or ethics.  Those are just public relations tools to them.  So how do you deal with those people? It&#39;s becoming very clear that these leaders don&#39;t have any moral compass and use that to their advantage. They wouldn&#39;t pay any attention to any religious guidelines, and they have no allegiance to the people they rule, and they have it set up so that their own governments will not prosecute them.  Hmmm...we&#39;ve got a big problem don&#39;t we?</p>

<p>Or, perhaps stripping people of their agency makes them more likely to exhibit shitty behavior. Less likely to step up and prevent others from acting wrongly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that the U.S. Marshals are part of the Dept. of Justice.  The DoJ doesn&#39;t want to prosecute certain people. I read something that helped clarify federal prosecutions in &quot;The Divide&quot; by Matt Taibbi.  It was about the &quot;Holder Memo&quot; or &quot;Holder Memorandum&quot;.  This memorandum was written by Eric Holder when he worked as the Deputy Attorney General in Bill Clinton&#39;s administration.   Its a guideline for federal prosecutors that says when considering whether or not to prosecute someone for corporate crimes, take into account any &quot;collateral consequences&quot; of prosecution.  This is why none of the big banks were prosecuted years later in 2008 when shit hit the fan (and coincidentally, when Holder had become A.G.)  <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/06/holder-laid-the-groundwork-for-too-big-to-jail-in-1999.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/06/holder-laid-the-groundwork-for-too-big-to-jail-in-1999.html</a>  (By the way, don&#39;t bother googling &quot;Holder Memorandum&quot; Taibbi or &quot;Holder Memo&quot; Taibbi - you have to use Bing to get results. It&#39;s stunning how partisan google results are.)
Problem with this approach is that people who commit huge corporate frauds are NOT prosecuted - so gee, I wonder if they or others might do it again.<br/>
For the purposes of this thread though, the point is, the DoJ decides who gets prosecuted.  They don&#39;t prosecute those they don&#39;t want to prosecute.  Therefore, it&#39;s pointless for U.S. Marshalls to go after these criminals running the country.  In fact, it&#39;s probably impossible for them to do so without being quickly shut down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know that the police can shoot an unarmed black person in the back while running away and just get a slap on the wrist--by that i mean 2 weeks suspension WITH pay--so I think the US Marshalls--being &quot;higher up&quot; than police--not growing a pair and RICO arresting someone to an undisclosed, and then uploading video confessions to those detained&#39;s crimes to multiple accounts on youtube and various sites simultaneously through Tails/TOR while uploading to freenet and darknetsites, means they must be complete cowards and antipatriots.  And bad at their job.  And criminals themselves.</p>

<p>If you catch them all, at the same time, then there won&#39;t be anyone who can &#39;suicide you&#39;.  Also you can request witness protection covertly via anonymous groups and whistleblower protection groups.  </p>

<p>If you have enough evidence to determine their guilt without any doubt, then the police and FBI and DOJ are obstructing justice so the whole agence is in contempt of the United States and are violating popular sovereignty and therefore one could make a case that if you took a vote, then even 1% of the united states could dissolve those agencies and fire every single employee in them; and if they say no, then that 1% gives permission to 100% of citizens to not pay their taxes until such time as those people resign or are themselves, each arrested and detained indefinitely as enemies of the state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Individual U.S. Marshalls are not likely to be as passionate as you about patriotism. They are also, most likely, not awake to what is going on.  Even if they are, they probably have to worry about paying for their kids college tuition, a big mortgage, the car payments and on and on.  So they&#39;re afraid to risk the paycheck.  They see what happens to the people who stick their necks out and they aren&#39;t willing to have their own necks on the chopping block.  Instead, they make their fantasy football team draft picks, and keep their minds off of moral dilemmas.
And that&#39;s how we&#39;ve been conditioned to behave.<br/>
But as more of us have less, the system becomes less sustainable, because we have less to risk.<br/>
Why is that when rich people commit crimes, they don&#39;t seem to have to go to prison?  Because of our system of prosecutorial discretion.  The Department of Justice, that is, the Attorney General, doesn&#39;t have to prosecute these people. So they don&#39;t.  They come up with ridiculous excuses so they don’t have to prosecute their friends or benefactors. That sucks and is completely wrong. 
What&#39;s the point of having laws if the biggest criminals are not prosecuted for breaking them? It has become very clear that the very wealthy can break laws with impunity.  There is no rule of law when it is only selectively enforced.  This broken system is not sustainable and, just as they have always done throughout history, the ruling elite will push the bounds as far as they can because greed knows no end among these sociopaths.  Unless there is some miraculous change, unless somehow our political system is cleaned of its corruption, then there will be a tipping point. When the rule of law becomes a farce, and the people have nothing left to lose, then the people will demand justice.</p>

<p>Doing anything now, is going to require mountains of people throwing their bodies on the gears of power before anything will change.</p>

<p>There is no social impetus, to cause anyone to care about the situation, even IF they took the time to try and understand the situation.</p>
