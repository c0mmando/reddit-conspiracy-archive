Their crimes are being exposed so fast by leaks, their global free trade plans actually got read and countries are backing out, the currency game is faltering..They are being exposed at a exponential rate and are desperate as hell.

<p>Absolutely this. You think guys like George Soros give a fuck about Hillary Clinton? Hell nah. Like Bob Dylan said: &quot;Only a pawn in their game.&quot; The second it suits him, she will be hung out to dry just to save his slimy ass. That said, maybe the Joker is a more appropriate source to quote: &quot;Let&#39;s see how loyal a hungry dog really is.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scapegoating these people is ok with me.  It&#39;s a short list we can start with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dick Cheney</li>
<li>Donald Rumsfeld</li>
<li>Both Clintons, and maybe Chelsea also</li>
<li>Both Bushes, and Jeb</li>
<li>Obama</li>
<li>James Comey</li>
<li>Every director of every intelligence agency</li>
<li>Every employee at NIST, then you close NIST and you pay an annual membership to German NIST because we failed at science</li>
</ul>

<p>They can still have their shadow horseshit, and it will continue to produce more baddies: that&#39;s expected.  But meantime they WILL be giving us these people in chains.  We also need to legalize pot and take all the pot offenders out of jail and give them their money / pot back, give them a job at the national cannabis hydrofactory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did Silvio Berlusconi go to prison at all for crimes he committed before being Prime Minister of Italy? No. He changed the laws that he broke once he got into office. In the revolving door of politics that is the United States, where a lawyer, banker and doctor can come from the private sector, become a Senator, Representative or Governor, do their terms, then go back to the private sector and earn lucrative money off the laws they helped formulate, I&#39;d say this is very much the wild west, only we don&#39;t think we can do anything to counter the corruptness in the town. These families that are in (real) power today have been in power for hundreds of years (many can be surface web traced to the 1400&#39;s and some even as far back as the 1100&#39;s). Sure there are some scapegoats for each era of chaos, but factually it is naive to argue that laws don&#39;t work that way. Certain connected people&#39;s feel they are above the law. That has occurred since the code of Hammurabi.</p>
