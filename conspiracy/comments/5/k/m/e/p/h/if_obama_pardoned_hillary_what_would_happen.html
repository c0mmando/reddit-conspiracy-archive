       Hmm.. with Nixon the evidence was lined up and ready for charges to be filed. With Hillary she's been"cleared of wrongdoing" by FBI so I would hope it's a bit of a stretch to pardon her for crimes she may have committed even if FBI said they weren't crimes.

       That's not true. A pardon can be issued for crimes which may or may not have been committed.

       That doesn't sound right... I'll have to look into that... you think that is why they got the fake birth certificate thing lined up? "Oh? You wanna pardon yourself? Guess what! You
       <em>
        never were
       </em>
       President! No pardon powers for you!"
      </p>
      <p>
       edit - I guess he can but a pardon cannot be used on civil or state crimes... so there is that.

       Who knows - the situation appears to be extremely convoluted; it seems like it is substantially more complicated than the public realizes.  One thing I will compliment the government on is that they have done a great job keeping us in the dark about exactly what is happening - no leaks whatsoever.  We are stuck with sheer speculation

       So, do you have a fairly positive opinion on Trump?  Do you see him as the sort of 'conduit' that the honest channels of govt needed in order to push a crackdown?  Or do you see him as irrelevant?

       You are correct... Trump is just the tip of the spear... the long arm of the law... FBI 2.0's Flashbang... He's a pretty small part of the equation... but still very important. There are a lot of moving pieces but none of it hinges entirely upon him... He's got fucking balls of steel though... he knew assassination lurks around every corner... so you know he trusts the FBI &amp; Friends... they got the armed forces on board... These are organizations made up of people... good one and bad ones and everything in between. The good guys are sick of being shit on... the baddies are outnumbered, outgunned and outsmarted. They are fuckin' done... sent reeling for a century at least...  It's always gonna be Yin and Yang... but were now shifting to a very creative and constructive epoch... with just a touch of destruction.

       Because, I think the public is generally 'good'.  But that doesn't mean that the 'good' has any level of representation in the government body.  It could just be two different types of Evil that are fighting to take control over the docile 'good' people.  Two different evil factions, basically- thats generally how governments work, anyways.

       Man I wish had the faith in Trump that is exhibited by this post. If any action is taken against Hillary for selling influence to foreign governments that would keep Trump from being allowed to do it. That is the whole point of Wikileaks. If you know officials (Hillary) are that corrupt from reading their own words and no action is taken then it must be the will of the people to be ruled by scum.

       I have hope that enough good people have not succumbed to nihilism that real change can still happen. Unfortunately, I don't have any inside information and will have to wait with the rest of the mushrooms (kept in the dark and fed bullshit) until after Jan. 20 to see if change for the better occurs. Cool logo, if the FBI acts in the interests of the peoples of the US it will be a welcome change to co intel assassinations and other mischief they appear to be guilty of.

       That was an interesting article to read. That it might root out some high level criminals in our government is encouraging I believe in a free market with the same rules for everyone. The corruption that frightens me even more is organizations like dyncorp and statfor that seem to be as much a part of the government as they are the private sector. They seem to profit by destabilizing and creating fear and violence.

       Odebrecht was just as bad as Stratfor... they just didn't get their shit leaked so we don't know how bad it was... Even in the 90s they fucking assassinated a Brazilian governor and burned his office down to hide their corruption... I think Odebrecht helped get Qaddafi killed... The article reads like a crime thriller... and it says right there that the FBI &amp; Friends found all the secrets in their spreadsheets. This is the beginning of the end for a lot of corruption... I've been spending months in the .gov matrix... I can read the code... it's impossible to describe... but they are gonna Drain The Swamp for real.

       Thank you. I hope you are correct. Positive change brought about non violently will be beautiful to observe. Don't get me wrong, if guilty scumbags have to be brought to justice with violence so be it. I have bookmarked the justice.gov link and I will watch for further progress. Reading good things the government is doing is just as entertaining as reading about the bad.

       You are correct... Trump is just the tip of the spear... the long arm of the law... FBI 2.0's Flashbang... He's a pretty small part of the equation... but still very important. There are a lot of moving pieces but none of it hinges entirely upon him... He's got fucking balls of steel though... he knew assassination lurks around every corner... so you know he trusts the FBI &amp; Friends... they got the armed forces on board... These are organizations made up of people... good one and bad ones and everything in between. The good guys are sick of being shit on... the baddies are outnumbered, outgunned and outsmarted. They are fuckin' done... sent reeling for a century at least...  It's always gonna be Yin and Yang... but were now shifting to a very creative and constructive epoch... with just a touch of destruction.
