<p>A presidential Pardon of Richard Nixon was issued on September 8, 1974, by President of the United States Gerald Ford, which granted former president Richard Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he might have committed against the United States while president.<sup>[1][2]</sup> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who knows - the situation appears to be extremely convoluted; it seems like it is substantially more complicated than the public realizes.  One thing I will compliment the government on is that they have done a great job keeping us in the dark about exactly what is happening - no leaks whatsoever.  We are stuck with sheer speculation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dang, thats some heavy shit.  Funny - i didnt see that reported ANYWHERE.  But it is an extremely insightful article that does indeed hint that what you&#39;re saying is correct.</p>

<p>So, do you have a fairly positive opinion on Trump?  Do you see him as the sort of &#39;conduit&#39; that the honest channels of govt needed in order to push a crackdown?  Or do you see him as irrelevant?</p>

<p>I am struggling to determine if this is actually a game of Good vs Evil; or if it is just two different shades of evil in Evil vs Evil for control of power</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct... Trump is just the tip of the spear... the long arm of the law... FBI 2.0&#39;s Flashbang... He&#39;s a pretty small part of the equation... but still very important. There are a lot of moving pieces but none of it hinges entirely upon him... He&#39;s got fucking balls of steel though... he knew assassination lurks around every corner... so you know he trusts the FBI &amp; Friends... they got the armed forces on board... These are organizations made up of people... good one and bad ones and everything in between. The good guys are sick of being shit on... the baddies are outnumbered, outgunned and outsmarted. They are fuckin&#39; done... sent reeling for a century at least...  It&#39;s always gonna be Yin and Yang... but were now shifting to a very creative and constructive epoch... with just a touch of destruction. </p>

<p>You know good exists... why would it be 2 evils facing off? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because, I think the public is generally &#39;good&#39;.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that the &#39;good&#39; has any level of representation in the government body.  It could just be two different types of Evil that are fighting to take control over the docile &#39;good&#39; people.  Two different evil factions, basically- thats generally how governments work, anyways.</p>

If any action is taken against Hillary for selling influence to foreign governments that would keep Trump from being allowed to do it. That is the whole point of Wikileaks. If you know officials (Hillary) are that corrupt from reading their own words and no action is taken then it must be the will of the people to be ruled by scum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have hope that enough good people have not succumbed to nihilism that real change can still happen. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have any inside information and will have to wait with the rest of the mushrooms (kept in the dark and fed bullshit) until after Jan. 20 to see if change for the better occurs. Cool logo, if the FBI acts in the interests of the peoples of the US it will be a welcome change to co intel assassinations and other mischief they appear to be guilty of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was an interesting article to read. That it might root out some high level criminals in our government is encouraging I believe in a free market with the same rules for everyone. The corruption that frightens me even more is organizations like dyncorp and statfor that seem to be as much a part of the government as they are the private sector. They seem to profit by destabilizing and creating fear and violence.</p>

Even in the 90s they fucking assassinated a Brazilian governor and burned his office down to hide their corruption... I think Odebrecht helped get Qaddafi killed... The article reads like a crime thriller... and it says right there that the FBI &amp; Friends found all the secrets in their spreadsheets. This is the beginning of the end for a lot of corruption...

    <div class="md"><p>Ooooh... I know exactly what is going on... they can&#39;t legally tell us everything, but they will tell us everything they legally can. </p>

<p>Huge changes to the government coming in... that drain the swamp rhetoric is actually going to happen... this has been in motion for years... so many people are going to prison it will be nuts... no need for Hollywood when real life is such much more of a spy thriller.... </p>

<p>Sneak Preview of things to come post-inauguration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct... Trump is just the tip of the spear... the long arm of the law... FBI 2.0&#39;s Flashbang... He&#39;s a pretty small part of the equation... but still very important. There are a lot of moving pieces but none of it hinges entirely upon him... He&#39;s got fucking balls of steel though... he knew assassination lurks around every corner... so you know he trusts the FBI &amp; Friends... they got the armed forces on board... These are organizations made up of people... good one and bad ones and everything in between. The good guys are sick of being shit on... the baddies are outnumbered, outgunned and outsmarted. They are fuckin&#39; done... sent reeling for a century at least...  It&#39;s always gonna be Yin and Yang... but were now shifting to a very creative and constructive epoch... with just a touch of destruction. </p>

<p>You know good exists... why would it be 2 evils facing off? </p>
