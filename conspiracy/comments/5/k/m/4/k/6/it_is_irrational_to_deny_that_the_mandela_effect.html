       The Mandela Effect is not about spelling differences. Yes, Draino is now and has "always been" Drano, but there are more interesting changes taking place.

       And I can't exactly prove it but, damnit, "dilemma" was never the correct spelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many people affected by the Mandela Effect and so many "changes" and so much evidence of those changes that it's time we start talking about what is happening instead of whether or not something is happening. This shit is real.

       That's it exactly though. As sure as you are and for exactly the same reasons, we know he was a black man. He was a big part of black history for us. That's what's in the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while you were living in a reality where Eli is white we were living along side you in one where he's black. It's not like we just discovered we made this historic mistake. White Eli has been on a stamp since the 50s.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was an old famous white dude while he was a famous black dude. That's why it's crazy.

       No. You haven't.

       Let's create an example. Here is Dave. Dave thinks that Darth Vader says, "Luke, I am your Father" in Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is Bob, Bob remembers the actual quote from the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dave misquotes the movie, Bob corrects him. Because Dave is angry he can't remember Star Wars lines, Dave manufactures a belief system that informs him that Bob is the one who is wrong. Why does Dave manufacture this belief system? Because it is more comforting to Dave than admitting he was wrong. Dave was
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       sure of something, but now that Dave
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       so sure a wave of discomfort, dissonance, has washed over him. To alleviate that discomfort, Dave suggests that
       <em>
        he
       </em>
       isn't to blame, it's
       <em>
        reality
       </em>
       that is to blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bob scoffs. But Dave goes online and finds other people who also misremember the quote, some who even misremember the quote differently than Dave misremembers it. This is evidence, Dave says, that something strange is afoot!
      </p>
      <p>
       But Dave does not understand cognitive dissonance theory, groupthink, or much about human cognition period, and because Dave is desperate for meaning, he ignores decades of research into how memories are made and how the human brain works to come to the conclusion that we are all living in a Matrix, or victims of shifting timelines due to time travel, or something fantastical enough to fill the void in Dave's life, something to give Dave meaning, something to set him apart from everyone else and the rest of the mass produced sheep bleating the party line. The fact is Dave is nothing more than the victim of mental conditions that have arisen from late stage capitalism and the stripping of individuality from the individual. Desperate for meaning, Dave has found his meaning, and it is in peddling fantasies that give him an identity unique to everyone else's.

       <em>
        This
       </em>
       is what the Mandela Effect is about. People are broken and desperate for something larger than themselves to believe in, but because they have lost faith in God, because they have lost faith in government, because they do not trust authority, they are left with nothing to believe in. Enter YOUTUBE and REDDIT, peddling bullshit that gives people something greater than themselves to believe in. I do not doubt that there is a multi-generational conspiracy of men who wish to control the world, you can see the evidence of this in history. Their goal is a one world technocratic system of government. They make no secret of it. That is the true conspiracy. This nonsense about aliens, Hollow Earth, Flat Earth, Satan, Reptoids, alternate realities, and simulated realities, while fun to think about, is all meant to keep the people talking and fighting for the Truth when in fact the Truth is staring us right in the face. You can go read Foreign Policy or anything written by Kissinger or Brzezinski and read all about their plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I think what the Mandela Effect is about is creating a memory hole in our own minds so we do not trust even what we know to be true. It's about wrapping us up in this "

       There is no evidence. You people are experiencing a mass delusion, no different than people who believe in an invisible man in the sky passing judgement on those who don't believe in him. You misremember a quote from Star Wars, you think Chick-Fil-A is spelled a different way, therefore your garbage memory and the garbage memory of others equally as desperate to believe in something as you is proof of something. You reinforce one another's delusions and bam, you folks think there's an alternate timeline and you've discovered the truth of it. It's absolutely ridiculous and it's a sign of our times just how ludicrous and broken people have become that they're willing to believe they're living in The Matrix or Dark City instead of accepting their memory is to blame.

       How do I explain you? I can't. I have no idea why some people are so hostile about this. It's really strange.

       Or do you mean how do I explain our disparate memories? Again, no idea. But science does allow for the possibility of parallel or multiple universes. The best minds agree that it's possible. Perhaps you are from a ruder universe?

       What's amusing is that you think because someone disagrees with your bullshit they are being rude. Scroll up. You called me mean because I offered an alternative explanation to the mass delusion you people are experiencing and because that threatens to supplant the worldview you've worked so desperately to cultivate ever since you discovered this "phenomenon" you immediately jump on the defensive. I didn't call bullshit until, rather than consider what I said, you instead chose to play victim. "You're being so mean hurting my feelings bringing logic and reason into this discussion!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I am all for keeping an open mind, but the fact is that much of what you people point to as evidence is nothing. The Internet has brought together a bunch of people who have piss poor memories and because they all remember things poorly they've convinced themselves that things happened that did not. The Mandela Effect is nothing more than a fine example of how our worldview is shaped by the reality bubbles that we inhabit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: And if you would like to ascribe emotion to my words, the one you are looking for is annoyance. It is this bullshit disinformation peddled about The Mandela Effect and Flat Earth and Reptoids and other such nonsense that drowns out the Truth. You have a right to peddle your fantasies, but you do not have a right to be humored for them.

       "Stormed into this thread"? Look at you, wearing your entitlement on your sleeve. This isn't
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       thread. Creation of a thread on Reddit does not give you ownership of it. Moreover, the fit you're throwing highlights just how fragile this worldview is of yours if a contrarian opinion is so destructive to the echo chamber in which your head firmly sits well insulated from any opinion that threatens that view. You people aren't interested in entering into a dialectic and discovering Truth, you want to reinforce fantasies that help you make sense of the world as
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       see it. While we might very well be part of a multiverse, the most likely of explanations for spelling differences and misquotations and misunderstandings of geography and world events is not shifting timelines, or worlds bleeding together, it's the result of uninformed people reinforcing each other's uninformed worldviews. The reason you've been misquoting Star Wars, the reason James Earl Jones is misquoting Star Wars, is because
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is how we collectively remember that line. When you watch the movie, however, the line is,"Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. I am your father." Why the difference? Because we
       <em>
        shorten
       </em>
       it in our heads to the relevant information. It has nothing to do with parallel universes or CERN or a glitch in The Matrix. It has to do with how our minds work, it has to do with human cognition and psychology and with GROUPTHINK.

       Nice ad hominem attack. Keep going through life leaning on fallacious logic to justify the nonsense you believe. You're an imbecile attempting to justify the logic that alternate realities or time travel are to blame for failures in yours and everyone else's memories. You are comparing the belief of this absurd "theory" to a step in human evolution, as though your belief in this has unlocked some secret for you that will lead to some achievement on par with the creation of language. Again, delusional. You even justify the inconsistencies in the memories of those who believe this nonsense by making that part of the narrative. "The time lines are flipping back and forth and changing! That's why you remember different spellings of things than me!" Every possible explanation for what is nothing more than failed memories reinforced by groupthink and selection bias is brushed aside as part of the Mandela Effect. In short, you people have manufactured a way of continuing to convince yourselves your bullshit is real even when there is no rhyme or reason for the bullshit you believe.

       Maybe you should, instead of desperately attempting to maintain cognitive consistency and a belief system that shields you from the uncomfortable truth of reality, open your mind and do some research and learn something. I'm wondering, how far back through my history did you go through to find something on which to lean to make this pisspoor argument? "Aha! He talks about pizzagate! Rather than discuss what he said right here, which is confusing and too complicated for me to understand, I will search out something that I can bring up to refute this guy's points rather than develop a logical, reasoned response to explain
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       this guy is wrong." In other words, what you're doing is leaning on a fallacy. Comet Ping Pong and Pizzagate should be investigated. Are you saying pedophiles who use pizza parlors to groom children shouldn't be investigated? Now, to be clear, no-one ever said Hillary Clinton was sacrificing children underneath a pizza shop, and if they did they were taking the original story and distorting it. The story, which arose from Wikileaks emails that are DKIM verified by Google, was that Hillary Clinton is
       <em>
        associated
       </em>
       with people who use a pizza parlor in Washington DC to groom children, kinda like

       guy did with his pizza place. The owner of Comet Ping Pong, the pizza place in question, is James Alefantis, one of

        GQ's

       But you're not going to look any further than you were told to look. It takes a lot less effort to roll your eyes and to ignore the uncomfortable truth than it does to acknowledge the truth. It takes a lot less time to just take it on faith that the talking heads telling you Pizzagate is no big deal aren't lying to you. The fact is that by smiling and nodding and parroting the propaganda peddled to you by the mainstream media you are only reinforcing whatever mass delusions benefit the power structure. The fact is that by accepting the lie you are doing so because it means you do not actually have to do anything. If you were to accept the truth, that among the elites are corrupt, sick fucks who use the power of government to do evil, then that would require you to do something more than showing up to fill out a ballot every four years, feigning interest and knowledge in politics. If you were to recognize that the system is
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       broken then you would have to do something more than just pretending to care. As long as you just smile and nod and accept what you are told then you can go through your life in a peaceful haze of ignorant bliss. So mock, marginalize, deflect. "There are no kiddie diddlers in politics, there are no corrupt politicians, there are no sociopaths or killers in government, not until they're caught anyway."

       Mandela Effect has absolutely nothing to support it beyond the assertions of wildly uninformed people online whose delusions are being reinforced by an echochamber of equally uninformed and delusional people. Elite pedophile rings have existed for who knows how long and, from Jimmy Savile and the Westminster pedophile dossier, to Dennis Hastert, we have evidence of it. Your willful ignorance, or the willful ignorance of those who subscribe to this theory about the Mandela Effect, does not negate the facts. As Aldous Huxley put it, facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored. While in
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       mind, in the subjective reality that you exist in these two things are equal, the fact is that in the objective reality that we all inhabit they are not. Google how many children are sold into sexual slavery in the world. Google how many children are abducted every day in the United States alone. Lookup the Westminster pedophile dossier. Lookup Jimmy Savile. Lookup Dennis Hastert. Lookup Dojo Pizza. Or, continue to spout off ignorant nonsense about how there aren't very rich people who skirt the law, fuck kids, kill people, and get away with it. Hell, look at the DuPont heir who fucked his infant daughter and received a slap on the wrist. If you believe alternate timelines, existing within a Matrix, the Mandela Effect is the
       <em>
        same
       </em>
       as rich people fucking kids and using their status to get away with it, that is more of a testament to just how broken
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are. In the realm of possibility, rich people involved in government diddling children is more believable thanks to precedent than time travelers altering our timelines, or all of us existing within a simulation of reality.

      <p>
       You just posted a story about a
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       , an opinion piece on a
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       , and a youtube video on a
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       . What is a scientific theory? "A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and repeatedly tested and confirmed, preferably using a written, pre-defined, protocol of observations and experiments." As the links you offered point out, there still isn't enough proof of these theories because not enough research and experimentation has been done. What you need to do is learn
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       to reason. There is precedent and evidence that very rich people involved in government fuck kids, kill them, and government often covers it up. Again, look at the Westminsters pedophile dossier and the Thatcher administration's active role in covering that up. There is
       <em>
        tangible
       </em>
       evidence that some very wealthy people fuck kids and get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, what you are doing is using fallacies to take us down a rabbit hole and away from the point, as all fallacies are meant to do. The topic of discussion was the Mandela Effect, not "pizzagate." Out of desperation, because you are incapable of actually debating the point, you went in search of fallacies that you could use to prop up your lack of a reasoned, cogent argument. "I'll dig through his history and make him look stupid!" Only you're the one who looks stupid, friend. There is no evidence that the Mandela Effect is real. None.
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       posted stories from reputable sources that demonstrate "pizzagate" is not only possible, but that it is likely.  Mind you, we're not talking about Hillary Clinton peddling children from a dungeon, we are talking about James Alefantis being involved in a pedophile ring, just as the Loren Copp was caught using Dojo Pizza for the same thing. Rather than refute
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       , you've changed the subject because you
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       refute any of that. In fact, you likely didn't even read a single one of those articles I supplied. You've spent more time trying to reinforce
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       worldview than you have spent learning about
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       that worldview is distorted.

       This is simply untrue. The fact that pedophilia exists does not make it
       <em>
        likely
       </em>
       that there is a pedophilia ring being run out of Comet Ping Pong. You did not arrive at that conclusion through any rational means.

       Again, you need to spend less time reinforcing what you
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       you know and more time reading. I can see right through you, pal. You don't even take the time to read what other people are saying, you hit a wall of words that stirs dissonance in you and you immediately go on the defensive. So, again...
      </p>
      <h2>
       From the Westminster Pedophile dossier and the Thatcher administration's role in covering it up, to Dennis Hastert, to Jerry Sandusky, to the Catholic church, there is no limit to the examples one can find that demonstrates elite pedophile rings are in existence and that pizza parlors like Comet Ping Pong have been used in the past as hubs of these rings and places to groom children. There is
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       evidence that the Mandela Effect is real. Multiple universe theory comes from how quantum particles function, the belief comes from observation by scientists. It does not exist because someone misremembers a quote from Star Wars. Not even those articles you linked to about parallel universes makes mention of the Mandela Effect. No scientist, no serious person, takes the Mandela Effect seriously. On the other hand, child prostitution, sexual slavery, corrupt elites, all of these things are
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       and can be easily researched. You, however, want to maintain cognitive consistency and so you ignore anything that threatens that. That is why you've been arguing for like an hour that rich corrupt individuals don't fuck kids or murder people, but we are all existing in an alternate reality that is the product of a simulation or time travel.
      </h2>
      <p>
       Edit: Your line of logic actually highlights
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what I said earlier. Nonsense like the Mandela Effect is used to obfuscate real crimes and real conspiracies. Just look at this conversation right here. People
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       believe it is more believable we are existing as part of a simulation than Hillary Clinton could be associated with individuals who break the law, even though she flew to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted child rapist's, private island on "The Lolita Express," even though Bill flew nearly 30 times on the same plane, even though John Podesta was a good friend and traveling companion of Dennis Hastert...

       That's why we need to talk about this. I was confused about "weird things" for years but I thought it was just me.

      <p>
       Like Chic-Fil-A. I passed by 2 of those every day. Never could remember if it was Chic or Chik but it definitely was never Chick. And I would look at the sign and think, "I could have sworn it was Chic but now it's Chik. Huh?" But there was never an explanation.

       Chick like Chicken. That's so easy to remember. It would never be an issue.

       I like your sentiment but I've pretty much accepted that the majority will always think of the effect as batshit, even when being smacked in the face with a retroactive change in world facts. Their list of excuses is far longer than our list of evidence. And if it were ever to get picked up by MSM, I fear it would be for all the wrong reasons and used to push ulterior agendas and what not.

       I've seen a few converts after they experienced a few flip-flops, so I'm still hopeful. But yeah, the only reason that I researched the ME was because I was in the mood for researching a batshit crazy theory. The ME took me for the craziest ride of my life.

       Some of the examples I have seen on youtube I'm unsure of but the two I got down voted for I remember quite well. The one where C3PO has always had one silver leg is not how I remember the first star wars either, he was all gold colored, including both legs. Edit* Regarding 3PO, if anything I thought he got partially disassembled in one movie, the one where the rat takes one of his eyes and at that point maybe got got a silver leg but no way he was like that in the first one.

       Dr. David Anderson alludes to this phenomenon in his time travel work.  Basically if you conceive of time as being similarly mutable as matter in "normal reality", then someone with time travel could alter past events and have them impact current events.  Back to the future stuff.  It makes you think about Time Lords and maybe Chronus a little differently.  I totes remember the sunglasses too.

       many of these models of reality are kinda scary.  it's like we have to look inside ourselves to figure out what optimal values are, before we manifest them.

       If traveling back in time is ever technologically possible, then it stands to reason that it would eventually become commonplace.  Barring some technological reset, like any tech it would eventually be accessible to many.  With this reasoning, if it is ever possible people have already traveled into our past and present from the future.  Thus, changes to the timeline or creations of multiple alternate timelines would have happened in our past and would continue to occur.  At least that's how I see it.

       Yeah, and self-defensive or policing efforts would probably come into existence (aka Time Cops) to prevent people from screwing around with the timelines.  Protocols like non-intervention might become standard because it's deemed the most optimal from a public welfare standpoint.

       I don't buy it. The star wars thing is the least compelling wvidence I've ever seen for a theory. In fact the whole theory relies on accurate human memory, and memory is the least reliable form of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the whole Eli whitney was black vs white, I always learned that he stile the idea, or part of the idea, from a black man  and that's where the confusion stemmed from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the evidence for the mandala effect stems from memories people formed as children, things we were taught as kids or films that were impactful to our childhood. While children learn unbelievably quickly, I think those early formative memories are the most likely to get diluted or altered over time. That is the fallability of human memory, not some plot to retcon the world.

       If it's just childhood memories, why are adult experts getting things wrong? Sagan knew his shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a lot of these things have nothing to do with childhood, though some do. Those childhood memories are rooted in specific and repeated events. Like the Berenstein bears. Those books were a staple of many homes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Chic-Fil-A wasn't around when I was a kid. I didn't buy Bragg's Vinegar (now Bragg) as a kid. I did read Peanuts and it was Shultz not Shulz. But it was Shultz way into adulthood.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the human memory is as fallible as some suggest, then there is no point in receiving an education. We'd never remember 2+2 much less that Hitler had brown eyes (now blue).

      <p>
       I remember my first phone number, all of my teachers' names, what I wore on the first day of high school, and that the host of The Twilight Zone was Rod Sterling not Serling.

       Here's another one from my youth I have not seen anyone else mention. The line in the opening song was not "what can they do for fun" it was "what can two Indians do".

       It seems there were at least two different versions of the theme song.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe from different seasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       or maybe different syndicated versions.

      <p>
       I'm leaning towards it being from different seasons.

       It was originally part of the Underdog show and later it's own tv series. It was also part of the show "Space Kidettes" for a while.

       The line "What can two Indians do?" kind of sounds like Don Adams saying it.

       I wonder if it is or not. After all, he did Tennesse Tuxedo around the same time for the same company.

       This is simply untrue. The fact that pedophilia exists does not make it
       <em>
        likely

       that there is a pedophilia ring being run out of Comet Ping Pong. You did not arrive at that conclusion through any rational means.

       Again, you need to spend less time reinforcing what you
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       you know and more time reading. I can see right through you, pal. You don't even take the time to read what other people are saying, you hit a wall of words that stirs dissonance in you and you immediately go on the defensive. So, again...
      </p>
      <h2>
       From the Westminster Pedophile dossier and the Thatcher administration's role in covering it up, to Dennis Hastert, to Jerry Sandusky, to the Catholic church, there is no limit to the examples one can find that demonstrates elite pedophile rings are in existence and that pizza parlors like Comet Ping Pong have been used in the past as hubs of these rings and places to groom children. There is
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       evidence that the Mandela Effect is real. Multiple universe theory comes from how quantum particles function, the belief comes from observation by scientists. It does not exist because someone misremembers a quote from Star Wars. Not even those articles you linked to about parallel universes makes mention of the Mandela Effect. No scientist, no serious person, takes the Mandela Effect seriously. On the other hand, child prostitution, sexual slavery, corrupt elites, all of these things are
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       and can be easily researched. You, however, want to maintain cognitive consistency and so you ignore anything that threatens that. That is why you've been arguing for like an hour that rich corrupt individuals don't fuck kids or murder people, but we are all existing in an alternate reality that is the product of a simulation or time travel.
      </h2>
      <p>
       Edit: Your line of logic actually highlights
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what I said earlier. Nonsense like the Mandela Effect is used to obfuscate real crimes and real conspiracies. Just look at this conversation right here. People
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       believe it is more believable we are existing as part of a simulation than Hillary Clinton could be associated with individuals who break the law, even though she flew to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted child rapist's, private island on "The Lolita Express," even though Bill flew nearly 30 times on the same plane, even though John Podesta was a good friend and traveling companion of Dennis Hastert...
