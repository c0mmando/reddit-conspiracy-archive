        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since the beginning of the Internet and the age of information, the elite knew that eventually we would start listening less and less to MSM and we&#39;d start paying more and more attention to each other. This especially became evident when social media took over.</p>

<p>The powers who are in control are not stupid people and they even hired think tanks to predict trends and study the behavior of the American people. They are always one step ahead of us.</p>

<p>Knowing this, they planned from the very beginning to first divide the American people into thinking there were only two parties you could choose between, and pretend to have someone infiltrate one of those parties to give the American people the illusion that we could throw a brick at the establishment.</p>

<p>Some people might say that it&#39;s obvious the establishment didn&#39;t want Trump to win. Some might say that MSM did all their power to prevent Trump from winning.</p>

<p>MSM actually did everything they could to get Trump to win. They knew from the beginning that any &quot;controversial&quot; coverage of Trump only increased his chances.</p>

<p>Clinton knew she was going to lose too. They both colluded. In fact, Trump made it seem like he wasn&#39;t just a Clinton puppet by saying he&#39;d prosecute her. Now? He has completely changed his mind.</p>

<p>Some people are going to ask why Clinton would want Trump to win, if she spent so much money campaining. You&#39;re fools. This is what you see on the outside.</p>

<p>The establishment wants to see us divided over this, because that&#39;s how they have power over us.</p>

<p>Everything was made to look like the establishment lost.</p>

<p>With Trump, the establishment just got 10x more powerful. </p>

<p>Open your eyes</p>

<p>These people are not stupid. They could see that Clinton was balls deep in scandals and her winning the election would have been too obvious.

<p>My eye is wide open.  </p>

<p>There are shills everywhere.  The reality of life is that you can go out on the street and ask a random person their opinion on something and they&#39;ll probably get it completely wrong.  That is life.  If you have a critique of the shilling, then critique it.  Meta labels, absent rationalization, are as trustworthy as their design.</p>

<p>if you mean he&#39;s on the money tit like everyone else on the planet, then sure.  if you mean his MO is to cause more strife and dissent on the planet, i&#39;d think you have it wrong.  but we shall see.  if Trump turns out to be the anti-christ/insertboogeymanhere then it will be yet another example to us all that we need to fix our collective design.  we get better or we don&#39;t.  and the road to that improvement doesn&#39;t involve more division.  that is what seems obvious to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol Trump was simply the alternative to Clinton.  Not many of his voters love Trump, see him as qualified or even genuine - but Clinton was just blatantly awful and there was no mystery.  At least Trump is somewhat unpredictable.</p>

<p>I saw the election more symbolic than anything.  It was a catalyst for the people to at least realize that despite the media, hollywood and entire political system cramming Clinton down our throats, we were still able to keep her from presidency.  It gives people a reminder that we have a voice and we have power, which is more important than whether Trump turns out to be an establishment whore or not</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These people think Trump supporters are fucked cuz he went back on silly chants during the election. Who the fuck cares? Most people are smart enough to know that no matter what Trump or Clinton they will say whatever they have to to get elected. I voted for Trump simply because I think hes good entertainment and id much rather watch the Orange racist trigger half the country than have Clinton tell us why white men are the root of all evil. People look way to much into this, we know Trumps an elite and is rich and likes to say things that get attention and NO that does not make us stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL@&quot;the Orange racist&quot;.</p>

<p>Now on to a more serious question. You believe the global elite allow the common Joe to decide to the leadership of the richest and most advanced country on the planet, by filling in bubbles next to names printed on paper?</p>
