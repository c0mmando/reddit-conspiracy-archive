       I was a strong supporter of Trump since the beginning, and I even voted for him in both the primaries and general elections thinking he was going to get rid of the Israeli lobbyists that are destroying good country.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I believe he is a straight up Israeli puppet and he lied out of his teeth to get his base to elect him, and unfortunately I was part of that based.

       In general it's been pretty critical of Israel-US relations, which makes sense with the billions they get every year and the "drain the swamp" and all that.

       Trump's always been a strong backer of Israel. You take the bad with the good. Look at it this way -- if Trump had come out strongly against Israel during the election, would he have still won? No, he would have lost.

       You want proof of what? That Trump isn't lying when he says he wants to make his country great again? That he's gonna sell out his country for Israeli's benefit? You'll get proof it's coming soon, until then these ridiculous claims are borderline prophetic and fortune tellerish.

       There will be plenty of reasons for you to judge Trump's intentions and feel you know matter of fact-like he is doing this for evil or selfish reasons. But simply the fact is you don't know and neither do I for certain. The pictures are painted for you they started painting them since last year. Have Hope, my belief lies in knowing a few things, knowing the family of one of those big picks, and I can tell you when we take down the big boys and u should know who the big boys are - you'll know then. However first he needs to get in without them bringing the world into a shock

       Unfortunately, I don't have your knowledge of who these 'big boys' are. Perhaps you could help me here? As you say, we don't know for certain what the future holds; but what insider knowledge about the family of one of his 'big picks' do you have which leads you to a different opinion from mine?

       The one I know was one of the bigger picks position wise and one of the wealthy ones too. Wife knows this persons parents we've had close relationship with their family. Never would know them to have the status and wealth they have standing next to them. Doesn't want to do the job didn't need to do the job. Only doing it to save this country before their times up. Never would harm a hair on an Americans head in any way.

       Nope, but then again you’re incapable of reading and comprehending two fucking sentences in a conversation’s context, so I don’t really expect you to comprehend what marxism is or isn’t.

       Because they haven’t grown poorer, which any HUMAN BEING with an IQ above the single digits–not an exaggeration–can parse, given the context of the conversation, as long as they’ve had at least one year of experience in, you know, HOLDING conversations. It is beyond comprehension that you could be so stupid that you didn’t understand that I meant you were wrong when you said people had gotten poorer, so you’re either illiterate or trolling.
