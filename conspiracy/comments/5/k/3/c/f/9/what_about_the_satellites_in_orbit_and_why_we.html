<p><a href="https://youtu.be/7iza7lNy69g">https://youtu.be/7iza7lNy69g</a></p>

<p>So if there are thousands of satellites up there in orbit, how do they not collide? How are there no malfunctions constantly happening and they fall to Earth. All of the known science about the temperatures in space hot, cold and radiation(!) surely would do a number on satellites. No maintenance required? </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t add up. </p>

<p>You just about never hear it on the news. Sure is strange! I wonder why that is.</p>

<p>I just saw a really low quality image that gave me the thought </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/WaiBc">See for yourself how many are up there.</a></p>

<p>Be vigilant in your pursuit of truth. The bots and shills are out in vast numbers today. </p>

<p>God bless.</p>

<p><em>People call this debris &quot;space junk&quot;. &quot;Space junk&quot; orbits at a speed of roughly 7.5 kilometers/second. That is close to 17,000 miles/hour! Think of the damage even a small speck of paint could do to the space shuttle if impact occurred at such high speeds</em></p>

<p>Those are some very nimble satellites. All 2,271 of them, all dancing and avoiding each other, all at once, all at the same time. No incidents, no crashes or catastrophies over mainlands. Must be some miracle of math.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would counter and say that satellites and getting them to space is an enormous investment, lots is spent to make sure they don&#39;t have to do it again or replace them.</p>

<p>As far as no collisions I would say it would be a lot like air traffic in the world, thousands of planes fly everyday with no collisions I am sure in space it would be easier to make sure this didn&#39;t occur with mathematics and again no one wants to risk damaging such an investment.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON - Iridium Satellite LLC confirmed today that one of its satellites was destroyed Tuesday in an unprecedented collision with a spent Russian satellite and that the incident could result in limited disruptions of service.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think you would be able to see a car, or even a full-size semi truck from 120 miles away with your naked eye?  Probably not right?  I think there are some real conspiracies but this isn&#39;t one of them in my opinion.  Look at satellite imagery or go use the GPS on your phone.  How would those things exist if satellites are fake?  I&#39;d gladly listen to any theory anyone has on this.  I&#39;m just saying I can go on google maps/earth and look at pictures of my house and see my car in the driveway.  Who would have the time or motive to create terabytes of fake images of the earth that happen to be 100% accurate just to create the idea that satellites are real if they&#39;re not?  </p>

<p>There&#39;s alot of scientific concepts and discoveries that totally blow my mind everyday, but just because I can&#39;t immediately understand how complicated systems work at first glance doesn&#39;t lead me to believe that they are fake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a balloon program.  Their height fluctuates with temperature.  GPS is a ground based system.  If the military needs &quot;satellite&quot; support in a remote area, a plane with sensitive, yet powerful, equipment is sent over to provide coverage, like a mobile tower.  This can still be a little spotty.  Proof of GPS not being satellite-based is that airplanes aren&#39;t tracked across the oceans past a certain point when leaving land.  Their trajectory (flight path)  is estimated (projected) based on a few variables provided by the flight computers to GPS towers.  Images on Google Earth are from airplanes doing numerous flyovers and having all images meticulously combined into a (sometimes; other times there are clear multiples of an area that was partially missed or needed updating) single composite rendering of our Earth.  Perhaps there are satellites, but I&#39;m not convinced either... despite &quot;Google Mars&quot; and &quot;Google Moon.&quot;  NASA, ESA, and other space agencies have 0 (zero) credibility in my book.  If they told me that I exist, I&#39;d seriously start to question it, more than I already do.</p>

The video shows that space programs can simulate things for training, and then it shows some views of the Earth where whoever made the video says, &quot;This looks phony&quot; in essence. That&#39;s it. So like, what are we supposed to debate? </p>

<p>And yes there are thousands of satellites. You can find thousands of buildings in a city, for perspective, and realize that thousands is not actually a very high number when it comes to the available room in the atmosphere. Like there are several times more buildings in New York City than there are spacecraft orbiting the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When something is already in orbit, they don&#39;t just randomly fall to earth... Where in the world did you figure that from? Also, even if they did, a majority of the pieces would disintegrate from heat generated by friction upon reentry into the lower atmosphere. Furthermore, 71% of earth&#39;s surface is water, leaving only a 29% chance for a satellite to even crash on land, much less a person...

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you dude. I stumbled across a flat earth page and although I don&#39;t know what to make of all the pictures, there is something I can&#39;t figure out. </p>

<p>ANYBODY, PLEASE FIND ME A REAL PICTURE OF OUTER SPACE, WITH A REAL (non-cgi) SATELLITE. There are 0 pictures. ZERO REAL PICTURES OF SATELLITES IN &quot;OUTER SPACE&quot;. I&#39;m beginning to think it&#39;s called outer space because we are stuck inside Earth&#39;s atmosphere. It&#39;s odd. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s all a lie, but it&#39;s not all truth in the books. We are living in a gray area full of info but we can&#39;t seem to find the TRUTH.</p>

<p>Quick edit: All those videos of rapairing a satellite are supposedly in outer space... but where are all the bright stars, planets and other satellites? ... It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s a pitch black cgi background. Hmm...</p>

<p>Nasa admits they photoshopped the image of 2012 Earth. How many pictures of CGI rendering do we need to see? People can watch the movie Gravity and be so enthralled by how REAL it looks. NASA has trillions of dollars invested of the years.... how much technology do <em>you</em> think they possess that&#39;s beyond disney movies?</p>

<p>Google search for the information yields the information. Youtube video of the man that created it, saying he photoshopped the Earth. It&#39;s his job. </p>

People really beLIEve it because NASA &quot;posted&quot; it.

It really is all about the money in many situations.

<p>But if it&#39;s got its lights on, you can see the lights further than you would otherwise see the plane.</p>
