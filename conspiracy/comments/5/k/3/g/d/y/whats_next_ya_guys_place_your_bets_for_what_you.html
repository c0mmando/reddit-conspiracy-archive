<p>And the way people have behaved since, sure seems like they&#39;re subconsciously anticipating it. </p>

<p>But anyway i was saying that the bible had predicted that these are the last days and shocking events are about to unfold one by one as if they were planned and the public seems to be going along with the plan unconsciously. Crazed behaviour, go along attitude to all tyranny and inability to realize deception says it all.</p>

<p>But as god actually seems to be a wicked creator that is both god and satan, i am not sure that if it is a plan or a warning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is there such a heavy religious slant on this subreddit? </p>

<p>I come here with an open mind and ready to have my own opinions based on evidence or ideas presented. When people chime in with &quot;angels&quot; or the bible, etc, I just tune out automatically. </p>

<p>I believe religion says a lot about humanity and that it is used against us intentionally. Additionally, I believe that a portion of the elite are heavily religious but not in ways publically acceptable, legal or known to most of us. </p>

<p>That said, when talking about a new American civil war and other things like it, serious things with huge implications, someone almost always chimes in non-sarcastically about the bible or god.</p>

<p>It&#39;s insulting, to be honest.</p>

<p>Not trying to be divisive, I just don&#39;t understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not religious, but I feel like religion is going to be playing it&#39;s part in this process. Christianity is the one religion that is ok to hate on and they are feeling persecuted. It&#39;s almost like their values of morality are getting shit on by mainstream society and I could see that causing an uprising. Most religions have something to say about the &quot;end times&quot; or &quot;ascension&quot; and I think that&#39;s what&#39;s playing out in whatever way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now take a look at all the countries you would guess would be in a world war...</p>

<p>If you look at the US, we started it, and we get hit the worst, even worse than the UK, with a 78 percent decrease. Italy, germany, spaid, belguim, UK, USA, russia, etc. Then the ones that wouldn&#39;t take part only go down a tiny bit compared to the 50 percent decreases, and some others increase.</p>

<p>Even more terrifying is if you look at the US portion, and look at the chart for inports/exports when you click it for more details, our trades/imports/exports go down to basically zero <em>next year</em>.</p>

<p>So if you think about all the shit that&#39;s being pulled with russia(the ambassadors) and all the other bullshit that happens, I think it will be pretty bad. I don&#39;t think it would be biological warfare because it doesn&#39;t spread to non-developed countries like cuba and indonesia.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not being alarmist but I&#39;m probably going to buy some seeds, masks, and tools at the store so I can grow food when I can&#39;t go to the store and buy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump will launch attack on Saudi Arabia,
justified by</p>

<p>a) 9-11 involvement ( It need go no further than the Saudis).
b) Saudi military personnel dragged from NATO bunkers in Aleppo.
c) Evidence of an global CP network involving the Sauds/ Dems/ CF etc.</p>

<p>The attack will occur almost immediately. ( February is good as its cold). The attack will take around a week from start to finish. This will be a US Philippines joint attack. </p>

<p>CIA headquarters will be targeted in a Cruise Missile Strike. All their secrets will be destroyed. </p>

<p>An international taskforce will be created to hunt down ISIS and all its advisors supporters and funding. </p>

<p>A new form of punishment will be established called the Christening where once found guilty the ISIS insurgents will be individually drowned by one of families of their victims. </p>

<p>This controlled and dignified form of blood letting will be required to control the people. </p>

<p>Saudis huge overseas wealth will be seized to pay for attack, 9-11 reparations, and reparations to the huge overseas workforce in the country. Many will decide to stay. </p>

<p>Saudi Oil production will be used to rebuild US infrastructure,
but production will be controlled to stabilize the price of oil at an appropriate level $95/pb by Dec 2017. </p>

<p>The Palestinians will be given a homeland North around Tabuk. </p>

<p>Israel will invade Jordan and seize sufficient land for 50 years of settlement.</p>

<p>The vast Rub Al Khali (Empty quarter) will be covered in solar power. Suppressed electricity transmissions technologies and together with advanced permaculture techniques the desert will converted into an electricity producing rainforest with small scale sustainable farming interspersed.</p>

<p>This Solar/Permaculture development model will be recreated across much of the equatorial regions of the world.</p>

<p>Millions of displaced and hungry people will be fed and housed.
With the huge greening of the planet carbon levels will be reduced ( not that this was important but will silence the cabal of scientists who have staked their all on this bullshit).</p>

<p>There will be no financial crash.</p>

<p>What is the deal with Trump? Well its no about Trump. Trump just uses the deal from circumstances of relatively nothing, as far as billionares go.Diid he get there without inflicting liberties on you in person? </p>

<p>That makes him the good guy rascal that he was on the TV to great popularity only upto when he said he would run. And kapoow there come the barn stormers and crowd pleaser to the back of the wall. That woke you up and now he&#39;s in. Cant you see the brilliance of this, no significant violence has yet occurred. There is help in places you would be scared to look, However negotiations are occurring. Most for the good. What you would essentially call the good man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly my prediction. I honestly feel that if Trump survives, and he does in fact investigate and arrest the Clintons/Obamas, Saudi WILL be heavily implicated too. They are involved in everything. From corruption in American politics, to the migrant crisis and ISIS. Trump will have very good reason to start a war. Also, he could make an agreement with Putin to eliminate ISIS and perhaps even get his support to go after Saudi. If I would support any war, it would definitely be a war on Saudi. Those monsters... You could eliminate Wahhabism. Also, the oil, money and gold you would gain from taking Saudi could restore the American economy. An agreement with Russia would also take away some tensions with China. Trump is honestly the best thing that could happen to us. </p>

<p>Nothing excites me more than prospect of USA fucking Saudis over.</p>

<p>Russia would help since they fund wahhabis in Chechnya and Dagestan too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other Gulf states in Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait are also in on it with Saudi &amp; the Democrats. I have not found direct links with Oman or the United Arab Emirates but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. However these countries have no real military power as individuals and would be forced to bend the knee quickly. So either they would have to let the US have free access to their bases or they risk being eliminated themselves (Bahrain, Qatar, UAE are all very small countries). Saudi would be surrounded on all sides. It would take just a few bombs to destroy Dubai or Doha entirely for example, I don&#39;t think they would risk that by not allowing the US their base anymore.  </p>

<p>Good point about wahhabists in Chechnya and Dagestan. Even the migrant crisis in Europe isn&#39;t very good news for Russia. Instability and uncertainty there means the same for the Russian economy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. I would imagine it starting with - hey guys send all the expats home safely and surrender yourselves now or else.</p>

<p>Yep. Although it is not proven that they develop nuclear weapons themselves, they have been caught funding the Iraqi nuclear program, they&#39;ve been caught collaborating with the Chinese on atomic bombs and they directly fund Pakistan&#39;s nuclear weapon program. This Pakistan-relationship has even been proven by the MSM BBC. So even if Saudi doesn&#39;t develop nuclear weapons on their soil, they have their arsenal in Pakistan. Also, some Saudi prince said a few years ago that Saudi would look into developing its own if Iran was ever allowed to have a nuclear weapons (thanks Obama). They definitely have access.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what do people think of the factor of stronger ties between Russia and the U.S., in regards to the agenda to create a central world government (officially declared or just in practice)?</p>

<p>Like for consideration, right now there is a war of the journalists/media/government-talking-heads going on over what is really happening in Syria. In that regard, Russia and the West are pitted against each other.</p>

<p>Yet simultaneously, it seems that Putin and Trump will likely wind up strengthening ties and team work between the two nations (U.S. and Russia).</p>

<p>What are people&#39;s thoughts on these two situations unfolding side by side? </p>

<p>I am inclined to believe Eva Bartlett and others that it is the West that is funding terrorism to destabilize Syria. Which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that Russia is an innocent angel, I don&#39;t really see it as a &#39;versus&#39; situation entirely. </p>

<p>But like in this debate, it is easy to tell that that is the narrative that many are trying to push, i.e. Russia vs U.S. since whenever anyone (like Eva, herself) tries to point out the corruption from the West involved, the opponents (who like the guy in that debate can&#39;t make an actual case and can only interrupt and launch personal insults, which is very telling) try to frame it like.. &quot;If you call out corruption from the West, then it must mean you support Russia/Assad&quot; which is a logical fallacy (but still one that is being pushed heavily none the less). </p>

<p>Debate: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkjVK18H1z8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkjVK18H1z8</a></p>

<p>Yet, again, what we are seeing over here in western MSM is people pushing this idea that Trump and Putin are going to be close pals.</p>
