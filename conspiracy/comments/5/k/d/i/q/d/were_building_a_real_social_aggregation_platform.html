       We're the creators of Deep News (Pretty much a test name for now), and we're trying to build a information platform that supports
       <strong>
        real
       </strong>
       content. We have boot strapped to this point, but due to machine learning being quite expensive we're beginning to run low on funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're trying to have the platform completed by 2.1.2017, and this isn't our first rodeo in the tech or startup world. We're not looking to jeopardize the integrity of what we're building by allowing any outside investors to influence us before we get our roots in.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Current UI, this will change substantially
       </strong>

        https://i.imgsafe.org/144be16a8c.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally we're looking for one more Full-stack dev. So if you fit the bill or know of someone who does. Please contact me. Below I will go into a little detail about what we're doing, and below that I will go into much more detail about how the website works. I highly recommend you take a read through, spread the word, and MAGA. Please MAGA.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Summary:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting unbiased or even real news in today's society is becoming increasingly more difficult despite the era we live in being dubed the "information age". News outlets from The Washington Post to CNN have told us time and time again what they are telling us is the truth, despite many untruths. Websites/Apps like Reddit and Facebook have begun to even sensor the information we get through their platforms. Trying to Google it will only lead you searching through click-bait articles. As for local news stations, well... we all know how hit and miss those are.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a solution called Deep News a mobile application (iOS /Android) and website designed to provide users the most desirable crowd sourced content made possible with artificial intelligence. Deep News is a platform for socially aggregated news/links/comments mixed with a rating system made up of Users, and verified professionals in that niche.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deep News will automatically posts news articles in their respective category &amp; locations, but users can also post content, or discussions in their respective subcategories. Users gain more privilege over time and so do the weight of their votes. This helps us to better eliminate the amount of vote manipulation on the site. Very active users can also become Power-users which will give a multitude of benefits including more visible comments, and vote weight. We're also screening verified professionals in their niche, much in the same way twitter verifies their users.  This can also be made much easier with new technology like:
       <a href="https://keybase.io">
        https://keybase.io
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Deep News feeds can also be sorted many ways, but I will focus of three major areas of improvement...
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Category trees that make sense - Deep News will have large categories like technology, politics, entertainment, but we don't allow users or our articles to be posted directly to these. Instead of posting in Politics for examples we would have to post in a subcategory such as libertarians, or republicans. From this point the post could continue to rise, and be posted in other categories so long as it was doing well, wasn't flagged as spam, and rising. This allows for users who are more passionate about one area assist with the screening process of getting a post to the front page of a major category.
      </p>
      <p>
       Users can create new subcategories under certain major, and subcategories and watch their communities come to life!
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Two rating system - The two rating system incorporates a user rating (not bots), and a verified rating. As time goes on we will be able to verify professional in their niche that will attribute to a links professional rating. Anytime a professional down-votes, they must leave a comment as to why and at certain times to upvote they will be required to add a comment as to why. These comments can be judged by users, and other professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Journalist Ratings - Publications posted to the site will allows us to achieve the journalist writing them and allow us to assign the Journalist a user and professional rating. This system will allows journalist to be kept in check while keeping others in check.
      </p>
      <p>
       We stopped a last project in the dust in order to start working on this project. For the last month we've made great strides, but we could use some assistance. The money will be used for freelance work, server + hardware costs, and a little for marketing/promotional purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We come from various areas of the tech spectrum, but everyone currently on the team has spent a few years working in the tech industry from backgrounds in machine learning to growth hacking, we're not new to the startup game either hence the reason we're trying to crowdfund the project so that we can protect the integrity of the website.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        More Detail:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary - DeepNews is a content aggregation with an initial launch in the form of a mobile application. The idea of is to a palatable and intuitive platform for users to easily navigate the topics that keep them informed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eliminate Bias - You’ll  never fully eliminate bias, but we can try to fan it away. The first step is to separate serious articles and discussion from entertainment, and sarcasm. After this we employer a dual rating system of user, and verified rating not only for articles, but also for the journalist writing them. We invite journalist to take advantage of the virality of our platform, while at the same time expecting them to respect the community when they speak the “truth”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eliminate Vote/Comment Rigging - Using various forms of account hierarchy we can narrow this down a bit. In addition to mobile adding an anti-rigging layer. Finally we also incorporate machine learning to pick up on the even the most complex, and subtle vote manipulation patterns to investigate.
      </p>
      <p>
       A real outlet for local news - Amateurs, and local news teams can bring forth some of the most riveting stories. However in today’s society those people rarely get discovered, and when their stories finally do blow up, it’s not them reporting.  Not only do users have multiple options for local, national, and world wide news on the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creating a more incentives advertising platform that advertising can take advantage of. We can also allows for users to change the way in which adds are offered to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The users feed breaks down as follows…
      </p>
      <p>
       Catagories
      </p>
      <p>
       Categories should be thought of as subreddits, but even more than that subreddits, inside subreddits in which articles can generate views.
      </p>
      <p>
       EX: 1. Technology → 1.1 New Tech | 1.1Business Tech ----&gt;1.1.1 Mobile Applications 1.1.2| Machine Learning
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the smaller categories under Tech for example Mobile Applications may show up under Business Tech, and New Tech, but could also show up in a completely different major like Business or Finance. It would be nice to have a system that notified us of articles that would trend well in other places based on the current likability and keywords.
      </p>
      <p>
       Location
      </p>
      <p>
       We can feed users news based on the location they are in. For example a user could give us their location info, and we give them a local news area. They could expand that area, and also add completely different areas under their local news feed. Locations can also be verified, and in the future we can add present location requirements, and updates where we verify the persons location upon posting. This could prove to be very beneficial on chaotic news days where people want insider information.
      </p>
      <p>
       World ---&gt; National ---&gt; Locals
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also search local from an All category view or by specific categories and subcategories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Type
      </p>
      <p>
       Feeds can additionally be magnified by the type of posts it is. The three types are…
      </p>
      <p>
       Publication - Publication is a link to a website, typically an article. Also blogs, and scientific journals, essays, etc accepted. Publication also follow a more strenuous weight in regards to how posts votes are weighted in addition to how he comment section is displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally we will allow media, and podcast.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)     Self Post - Self post under a category. So just think of a regular discussion or question post on reddit,com
       <a href="/r/machinelearning">
        /r/machinelearning
       </a>
       for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)   Shout - Think a tweet or a link/headline. Also think of how you might post some form of media that is funny or example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rating
      </p>
      <p>
       Users can sort how they view based on ratings…
      </p>
      <p>
       User Ratings  - There will be a hierarchy on users. Some of it will be unbeknownst to users and some of the identifiers will be know. As are as what as known we can deliver a power user badge for very active members. This badge could affect how much weight their vote casts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to known unknown ways to weed out voter rigging will be used. A great way is to allow accounts that are also signed up on mobile to cast a higher weight considering it’s harder to spoof phone verification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trends in how users vote should also apply. Users who are extremely active in artificial intelligence might be able to cast a large vote in that sub. That vote might affect how it ascends in a major like technology.  However if a users is very active in the Democrats sub, we might not want them casting the same amount of weight in the overall politics sub. However in a democrats sub it could be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Professional Ratings - Are by users who are verified on our end as media or journalist, but also includes users who are professionals in some matter. We will award badges for verifiable experience in many categories as well as expanding to include new ones. Professional ratings vary, but obviously a A.I. researcher will carry more weight than a UI/UX designer on a deep learning paper in virtually every sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       When professionals upvote they are encourage to comment why, but not required. When a professional user downvotes they are required to comment why.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Journalist receive ratings on all the content they author that is posted to the site. We give two ratings denoting the user ratings + professional rating. The ratings are meant to enforce Journalistic integrity on the site.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Time
      </p>
      <p>
       Users will be able to easily edit the timeline they wish to commit to. While our default is daily 24 hours links, users can search within a multitude of timelines leading all the way up to all-time.

       This sounds similar to a project I started a few weeks ago called
       <a href="/r/opsauce">
        /r/opsauce

       - except for AI, it's based on crowd intelligence.

       If there's interest I would like to combine forces, I have ways to fund this project outside of traditional channels; and major support with infrastructure.

       As someone that follows machine learning for a few years now, you get a very stern look from me when you say that ai is costly. It's not AI, it's machine learning. AI implies unsupervised learning which we most definitely haven't come close to mastering. And machine learning has never been easier to get into. You just need someone that knows what he's doing, use for word2vec/glove where appropriate, and you're good to go. Just remember it's all a black box of sort, and you'll never have any hard guarantee that your NLP will give you the results you want, only the results you trained it to. That's why I suggested a long time ago that forums should use a naive Bayesian approach (like early spam filters) on each individual user so that each user lives in his "bubble" of like minded individuals. This fights off beautifully shills as they have no silver bullet posts they can do, as well as force shills into a terrible situation between extremely targeted content for one user (a lot of work) or post extremely conservative content that mostly matches what the user is interested in (also a lot of effort).
      </p>

       Anyway, good luck. I know how much fun you'll have trying to tweak things together without knowing if you're doing a good job or not. Never forget that any sufficiently tortured data will tell you anything you want to hear. And if your enemy knows that you aren't doing a proper job, they can and will adapt to your efforts. I hope you manage to train a model that doesn't require constant maintenance, is easy to deploy and replicate, fast to run, and accurate. You'll soon find out what it means.
