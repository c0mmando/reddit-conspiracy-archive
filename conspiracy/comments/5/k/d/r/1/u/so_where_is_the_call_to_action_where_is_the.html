    <div class="md"><p>My call to action is to re-program myself in the phoniest possible way.  For example, if someone brings up 911, I say right away that I am not a structural engineer and there is no evidence of any thing except Arabs, airplanes, and Bin Laden attacks on our freedom...If someone brings up the moon landing I <em>don&#39;t</em> say that our gubmint is looking at outtakes from the Matt Damon &quot;Martian&quot; movie to get astronauts to Mars soon...You are correct, sir...We need to change ourselves so that the phony responses of MSM&#39;s fake news to the realities of sinister conspiracies can be even more apparent than talking it up can do...For example, with truly fake emotion, point out how moved you were when President Obama cried about Sandy Hook and said it was the low point of his presidency, as indeed W&#39;s low point was Kanye West calling him a racist (so he writes in his highly-tauted epic memoirs)...And Bill Maher, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and all of the MSM aren&#39;t anything but on board with lone gunmen cover-ups; why not just make it unanimous?

    <div class="md"><p>Call to action would be different for each person of course. It is simply people organizing around an idea to engage with something.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all on a case by case basis bro.</p>

<p>So for example to protest money in politics we probably wouldn&#39;t go ice fishing cause that wouldn&#39;t make much sense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called advocacy and it does work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most important thing we can do right now: stop the spread of fear, and instead promote love and justice.</p>

<p>Fear is most often spread by the media we consume. Mainstream media, social media, and even alternative media. We already know how fucked up our world is. Don&#39;t spend your entire day reading and commenting about it on Reddit. Make it a New Years resolution to consume less media.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re wondering how to spread love, it&#39;s easy. Talk to a stranger. Help people who are in need. Build a garden and cook food for others. Spend less money! We are spiritual beings with an intuitive sense for how to love. Find the way that works best for you.</p>

<p>If enough of us do this, the broken system will eventually collapse, or at least become very weakened. It feeds off of your attention, and in turn your fear. Don&#39;t give it to them! ❤️</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is my actual answer. It has nothing to do with virtue signaling, and everything to do with taking direct action to replace fear with love. Would you mind explaining in more detail why that won&#39;t work?</p>

<p>I realize it seems like it should be more complicated than that. But I would encourage you to change yourself first, and then watch what happens in the outside world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, thats extremely sad. You really need me to detail how doing nothing will do well nothing? Im looking for actual answers. Not an answer that a child in kindergarten would say. What you and the other idiot are saying is basic shit. Its not working and it hasnt worked for the same reasons. Its not an actual answer. its not an actual solution. Its blanket bs that only serves to soothe idiots that fall for it. Sending out &quot;good vibes&quot; doesnt do anything whatsoever. Neither does saying &quot;no one is doing something, we gotta do something.&quot; You can find a million posts like OPs here in this sub. Most of the time they dont propose anything, they just say &quot;why arent we doing anything?we need to do something!&quot;  Its useless, its a waste of time, and its where weve been for at least 3 years if you look at this sub alone, definitely longer than that as a whole.</p>

<p>So lets recap. Peace and good vibes - does nothing as a whole</p>

<p>saying we need to do something - does nothing as a whole</p>

<p>virtue signalling - does nothing as a whole</p>

<p>not presenting actual plans or ideas for what to do - does nothing as a whole</p>

<p>Again just referring to this sub alone but you can see different groups of people coming together for the same reason but accomplishing nothing due to differing ideas about fixing things.  </p>

<p>We have the people saying its futile trying to fight. </p>

<p>We have the people saying we can fight but its gotta be violent. </p>

<p>We have people saying we can fight but its gotta be peaceful and political. </p>

<p>We have the people saying we need to fight but they dont know what we can do. </p>

<p>Then we have the worst of them all asking why we dont fight but not presenting a way for us to acyually fight and also the other idiots who think we can fight criminals  with good vibes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re (maybe deliberately) misrepresenting what I said. I didn&#39;t say &quot;send out good vibes&quot;, because I agree that&#39;s meaningless. I said that you need to stop supporting the system of fear, consumerism, and individualism, and replace it with a new system rooted in love.</p>

<p>Concrete idea #1: stop spending money at McDonalds, and start cooking or even growing your own food. Give it to others so they can reduce their dependence on corporate food.</p>

<p>Concrete idea #2: delete your Facebook, talk to people in person. Starve them of advertising dollars.</p>

<p>Concrete idea #3: limit or stop your consumption of fear-based media, whether mainstream or alternative.</p>

<p>For you personally, I would suggest spending less time calling people &quot;idiots&quot; on the Internet.</p>

<p>I hope that helps. Much love ❤️ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now we&#39;re spreading information and enlightening everyone. More and more people aren&#39;t falling for the US bs  anymore especially after this election. Just look at CNN they had a record low rating. Just give it some time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that is good but it also can turn into something along the lines of what we already have in American culture. Constant consumerism, political action that just becomes another outlet for advertising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The MSM being so wrong on the last election woke alot of people up. It&#39;ll start spreading and we&#39;ll have a mass awaking. The dominoes are starting to fall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to push for law and order. If people like Hillary and her team, or Trump and his team can get away with corruption and breaking the law, what incentive is there to stop the corruption with the next people in power? They are always protected under the guise of not persecuting the previous administration. I say fuck that. If the previous administration broke the law, they need to see the inside of court. For this to really happen, we need an attorney general who isn&#39;t in on the corruption, and who is voted in by the we the people. That&#39;s a start. </p>

<p>edit: TPTB have infiltrated almost every unorganized militia group, and the FBI has labeled them as the single greatest threat to our country; domestic terrorism above even international terrorism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth is solitary work. Do your work amongst those you know. Organising people around one truth suits no purpose. The rabbit hole is just an entrance.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JpdVspEhMk0">Mr. Robert Welsh</a> has some great info on how the pieces fit together, and to understand how it can all happen, understand Communism. This is a keyword for society, and a very explicit one. </p>

<p>What is all boils down to, is to walk with morals and ethics, upright and just. Do what is right, and be a guide to those around you. Walk in truth and honesty, and reject those who lie and cheat, on every level. </p>

<p>The left hand path is opposite of right. The collectivist is opposite of the individual. Carry the Constitution and the New Testament in heart, and walk upright in windy conditions. You won&#39;t have to organise. Those who see you will reckognize you, and walk by your side, and you won&#39;t always even know it. Trust your gut, and take the high road.</p>
