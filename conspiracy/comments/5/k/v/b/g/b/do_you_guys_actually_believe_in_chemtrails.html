    <div class="md"><p>A few other things, but yes. You&#39;re right.</p>

<p>Congratulations. You are now a chemtrailer. You have my deepest sympathies.</p>

<p>Most people, including OP believe it is just water.</p>

<p>They really think this.</p>

<p>No, not c02 with some other compounds. But water.</p>

<p>Getting people to even acknowledge exhaust gasses contain anything other than water is near impossible. To go the next step and discuss materials that are  included to alter the atmosphere is just too far. You&#39;ll only end up going in circles.</p>

<p>It is not a subject that can be discussed in any rational sense. Or at least I don&#39;t know how to.</p>

<p>All I can say is do some research. Speak to people. And most importantly, just look up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re combining questions here and they actually need to be separated.</p>

<p>The questions are:<br/>
1) Do we believe the govt is spraying something in the atmosphere?<br/>
2) Do we believe that whatever they&#39;re spraying is for the purpose of mind control?  </p>

<p>When you&#39;re outside on a sunny day and see numerous trails across the sky stretching from horizon to horizon in multiple directions then yes, it appears quite honestly like someone is spraying something.  It&#39;s far too difficult to believe these are simply contrails caused by changes in air pressure over airfoils.  Keep in mind, contrails are very real and different than chemtrails.</p>

<p>So my answer to #1 is yes.  </p>

<p>However why they are spraying is another matter all together.</p>

<p>I&#39;m old enough to remember that back in the 80s and 90s it was common knowledge that the govt would &#39;seed&#39; clouds.  This was back before the internet but I remember lots of conversations about seeding clouds to make rain and I never really questioned it.  I was just told they&#39;re spraying to make it rain.  Ok....cool.</p>

<p>However do I think they&#39;re spraying for mind control?  I don&#39;t know but it seems a bit far fetched.  The question that has to be answered is &quot;how are they avoiding the effects?&quot; because the spray has to hit them and their families.</p>

<p>So my answer to #2 is I don&#39;t know but just because something is difficult to explain doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not true.  There have been many conspiracy theories over the years that were later proven to be true.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That is because they are not caused by the airfoil; they are caused by the fuel. Jet fuel is a hydrocarbon. It breaks down into carbon dioxide and water when it burns. Lots and lots of water. In fact, 1.2 tons of water for every ton of fuel burned. The temperature up there is -50 so the water freezes instantly into ice crystals. Depending on how much moisture there is in the air, these crystals will either disappear through sublimation, or grow in size through deposition. (Contrails either disappear or grow in size).</p>

<p>A lot of people experience side-effects from the spraying including flu-like symptoms and minor to severe bronchial distress. </p>

<p>If you read the article or looked at any of the additional data provided, you&#39;ll have seen aerosol injections have already been done in India and there&#39;ve been studies to see how they&#39;d work in other areas.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re lucky, you won&#39;t ever experience any side-effects from the spraying. If you one day have trouble breathing or find yourself gasping for air similar to a fish out of water, you might want to take a look at the sky and see if there&#39;s something resembling a checkerboard or a game of tic-tac-toe overhead; after a while, it&#39;s difficult to deny the correlation of symptoms to the spraying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My grandfather was a pilot and he told me once that they used to spray over areas that were subject to drought to influence it to rain. And this was back in the early 90s. Imagine what they can do now with the same methods? Chemtrails are definitely real. You guys give the gov and military complex way to much credit when it comes to being &quot;good guys&quot; rather than what they really are. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;the government is using aviation for mind control.&quot;</p>

<p>Weather control is the main function, though there are multiple applications I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so ridiculous to me that people can actually 
believe...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You sound like somebody that says &quot;bulilding 7 was brought down at free fall speed by office fires&quot;.  </p>

<p>They have been spraying the skies for years now and it&#39;s obvious if you pay attention.  </p>

<p>Perfect x&#39;s in the sky much of the time only in front of the Sun.  You are very naive if you believe that the government trying to manipulate the weather is &quot;so ridiculous&quot;.  You will be shocked when you discover what else they do or have already done in the past.  </p>

<p>There is far too much documentation proving this.  Shills like &quot;Mick West&quot; desperately try to &quot;debunk&quot; chemtrails and look ridiculous because it is so blatant to anyone who actually does the research into the subject and observes the skies with there own eyes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t believe it.  But this issue like many others in the conspiracy community is trapped in a web meant to confuse. What I mean by this is their is zero proof of chemtrails that brainwash, dumb down or make people infertile.  However cloud seeding is a thing, basically trying to make clouds/rain in a controlled fashion. The people that push the chemtrail BS purposely sprinkle in some truths of cloud seeding into their fantasy of chemtrials to try and make their claims look legit to low information people.   </p>
