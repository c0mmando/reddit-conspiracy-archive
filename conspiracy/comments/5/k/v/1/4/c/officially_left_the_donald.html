<p>Perhaps, but I suspect the similarity of talking points may have some cause in sectors of the the Alt-Right.</p>

<p>For example, I&#39;ve listened to a couple episodes of &quot;The Daily Shoa,&quot; and &quot;Fash The Nation.&quot; On both shows there is frequent discussion about spreading their message and recruiting new members. The principle method is to create and share memes in places like 4chan until they go viral.</p>

<p>So you can see how a viral meme would result in similar talking points coming from the meme&#39;s hosts.</p>

<p>says the guy with a 3 week old account. I&#39;m part of the wave of people that subbed <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because of the podesta leaks. Personally, I like anti-trump ideas that go around this sub, they tend to be based on rational theories rather than spewing propaganda like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. This should be a sub where the power of an idea wins over the mud-slinging of either side...but you seem to be the mud-sling first, ask questions later type.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump gained a surge of support for people like us who question the status quo, but his erratic nature, his contradictions, his lack of fact checking, his bigoted viewpoints -- he may believe in the validity of certain conspiracies, but he is NOT the ideal personification of them and there&#39;s now a slew of data linking those who support conspiracy theorists to Trump supporters, but this a sort of false flag; conspiracy extends beyond democrat and republican, and in fact many would argue the two parties are actually collaborating behind the scenes. He is ultimately talking head for the elite, and his conspiracy theories are rather under-developed and self-serving in the long run. It&#39;s well known on this subreddit the evils of Clinton, but I think too many people are seeing Trump as a sort of saving figure, a figure that will bring justice and expose truths in politics, but this simply isn&#39;t true. If you want true change, you won&#39;t find it in the corrupt two-party system. Both Trump and Clinton are pushing for their own self-centered agendas. Clinton was taken down largely due to the information of WikiLeaks, but once Trump is actually president, the hope is that more leaks will come revealing that he himself and his cabinet are not to be trusted either. You must find your own path, your own truths, you must research conspiracies without political affiliation and partisanship hindering you from seeing the larger picture, for this is an issue that extends beyond either candidate.</p>

<p>God, I can&#39;t even say I think Trump and Clinton are both horrible people without you guys immediately overlooking the fact I DON&#39;T have any sympathy for Clinton, nor for Trump, nor even Sanders if you&#39;re going down that route.

    <div class="md"><p>No, I get what you&#39;re saying. I just feel like bigot is a buzzword people use that makes no sense against Trump. I just brought up Trump because you brought up Trump lol, it&#39;s all good in the hood. I always feel like the second you feel like you 100% believe something, is the second you become truly ignorant. You don&#39;t KNOW Trump is part of the corrupt system. I&#39;m a big Trump supporter, but even I have to keep that 1% of my brain skeptical. So don&#39;t lose hope, maybe he&#39;ll surprise you ;)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump himself has shown he IS part of the corrupt system and he has repeatedly stated that he used the power of financial influence over politicians. He has appointed all people from the financial industry who is the most corrupt part of our country. The biggotedness comes from things he says and has done. Most people have biggotted ideas or thoughts, but this man has no filter. He just spews whatever is on his mind to the masses, and then backtracks consistently. </p>

<p>Until you guys admit that you got played big time, you will just keep getting taken advantage of. And that is what people who were here before <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> came are saying. Reject the system and what you are told by the system. Don&#39;t just blindly put your faith behind a man that has not proven to you he will or is capable of doing any of the things he has promised. On what facts do you base your faith in Trump? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I trust him because of his transparency. Truly evil people don&#39;t appear that way. They put on a mask, and &quot;smile and wave&quot;. The fact that Trumps flaws show, is evidence that he is speaking and acting true to his heart. He&#39;s being genuine. If he were truly part of the corrupt system, why in the hell would he admit to paying off politicians? On paper, I can see how trump seems like a bad guy. But with a little CRITICAL THINKING, it becomes apparent that he is indeed a good guy that&#39;s on our side. Again, you always have to remain skeptical, but I still have my hopes </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fun while it lasted atleast. I too unsubbed. As i can&#39;t stress this enough: criticism of Israel doesn&#39;t mean your anti semetic, or a nazi. Settlers are working with the Israeli government to stage attacks to justify bombing areas in the west bank and justify expansion because terrorists. Meanwhile women and children are dying and people are displaced, meanwhile everyone involved gets rich. How is that okay in anyones view point? If that makes me a nazi, then this truely is fucking bizaro world.</p>

Partly the frat boy donald supporters, partly people like the posters here (general terms) that just opposed the media manipulation, clinton scandals, etc, and then of course the minority - people who actually supported Trump because they thought it was funny or really did have racist ideas.</p>

<p>Now that the election is over I would say most of the anti establishment/conspiracy crew has migrated out, and only the other groups are left.</p>
