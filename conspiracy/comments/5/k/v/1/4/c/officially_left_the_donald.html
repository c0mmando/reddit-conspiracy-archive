       This will be my first official post here but i'v lurked for years before making an account. The Donald has become an Israel circle jerk subreddit. 100's of posts getting deleted for simply disagreeing with the politics of Israel. It seems people have traded one form of brainwashing for another, but I won't be apart of that so I'm here. I'v been deep into conspiracies and have also practiced the occult for years so I hope I can bring valuable insight to your subreddit.

       I've been curious if he has his own CTR on here with T_D as a sort of hub. I frequently come across young accounts that speak very similarly and use the same taking points

       My favorite is the type that quotes 5 words at a time from lengthy posts and says shit like "you have no argument" but don't provide a counter* argument themselves. They just harass

       Perhaps, but I suspect the similarity of talking points may have some cause in sectors of the the Alt-Right.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I've listened to a couple episodes of "The Daily Shoa," and "Fash The Nation." On both shows there is frequent discussion about spreading their message and recruiting new members. The principle method is to create and share memes in places like 4chan until they go viral.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can see how a viral meme would result in similar talking points coming from the meme's hosts.

       I don't know about "take over." I think it was more of a mutual interest in Wikileaks leading to a little bit of merging. I found out about this sub from someone saying something like, "I saw this email in r/conspiracy" I liked what I saw and subbed

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       because of the podesta leaks. Personally, I like anti-trump ideas that go around this sub, they tend to be based on rational theories rather than spewing propaganda like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . This should be a sub where the power of an idea wins over the mud-slinging of either side...but you seem to be the mud-sling first, ask questions later type.

       Trump gained a surge of support for people like us who question the status quo, but his erratic nature, his contradictions, his lack of fact checking, his bigoted viewpoints -- he may believe in the validity of certain conspiracies, but he is NOT the ideal personification of them and there's now a slew of data linking those who support conspiracy theorists to Trump supporters, but this a sort of false flag; conspiracy extends beyond democrat and republican, and in fact many would argue the two parties are actually collaborating behind the scenes. He is ultimately talking head for the elite, and his conspiracy theories are rather under-developed and self-serving in the long run. It's well known on this subreddit the evils of Clinton, but I think too many people are seeing Trump as a sort of saving figure, a figure that will bring justice and expose truths in politics, but this simply isn't true. If you want true change, you won't find it in the corrupt two-party system. Both Trump and Clinton are pushing for their own self-centered agendas. Clinton was taken down largely due to the information of WikiLeaks, but once Trump is actually president, the hope is that more leaks will come revealing that he himself and his cabinet are not to be trusted either. You must find your own path, your own truths, you must research conspiracies without political affiliation and partisanship hindering you from seeing the larger picture, for this is an issue that extends beyond either candidate.

       He's not, it's a hoax, Clinton perpetuated lies, blah blah blah. Whatever I say to you, I'm guessing it won't reach you, but the answer has been blatantly staring at you in the face for awhile now.

       God, I can't even say I think Trump and Clinton are both horrible people without you guys immediately overlooking the fact I DON'T have any sympathy for Clinton, nor for Trump, nor even Sanders if you're going down that route. It's as if you just read only what you want to read instead of daring to challenge the system, challenge your beliefs, etc.

       No, I get what you're saying. I just feel like bigot is a buzzword people use that makes no sense against Trump. I just brought up Trump because you brought up Trump lol, it's all good in the hood. I always feel like the second you feel like you 100% believe something, is the second you become truly ignorant. You don't KNOW Trump is part of the corrupt system. I'm a big Trump supporter, but even I have to keep that 1% of my brain skeptical. So don't lose hope, maybe he'll surprise you ;)

       Trump himself has shown he IS part of the corrupt system and he has repeatedly stated that he used the power of financial influence over politicians. He has appointed all people from the financial industry who is the most corrupt part of our country. The biggotedness comes from things he says and has done. Most people have biggotted ideas or thoughts, but this man has no filter. He just spews whatever is on his mind to the masses, and then backtracks consistently.

       Until you guys admit that you got played big time, you will just keep getting taken advantage of. And that is what people who were here before

       came are saying. Reject the system and what you are told by the system. Don't just blindly put your faith behind a man that has not proven to you he will or is capable of doing any of the things he has promised. On what facts do you base your faith in Trump?

       I trust him because of his transparency. Truly evil people don't appear that way. They put on a mask, and "smile and wave". The fact that Trumps flaws show, is evidence that he is speaking and acting true to his heart. He's being genuine. If he were truly part of the corrupt system, why in the hell would he admit to paying off politicians? On paper, I can see how trump seems like a bad guy. But with a little CRITICAL THINKING, it becomes apparent that he is indeed a good guy that's on our side. Again, you always have to remain skeptical, but I still have my hopes

       It's just that Trump supporters are more likely to be Israel supporters because Trump's kids married Jews and his daughter converted.

       I don't think most Trump supporters had much to do with Trump as a person specifically. It's an anti-establishment movement, say what you will about the validity of that, that is what it's about.

       Fun while it lasted atleast. I too unsubbed. As i can't stress this enough: criticism of Israel doesn't mean your anti semetic, or a nazi. Settlers are working with the Israeli government to stage attacks to justify bombing areas in the west bank and justify expansion because terrorists. Meanwhile women and children are dying and people are displaced, meanwhile everyone involved gets rich. How is that okay in anyones view point? If that makes me a nazi, then this truely is fucking bizaro world.

       Maybe it was the Russians. Certainly Donnie acts like they bought him. But maybe they're scapegoats and it was the Israelis and Republicans. Certainly Obama is acting even more angry with the Israelis than normal. Think the Russians, Israelis and Republicans might have cooperated?

       because there's zero credible evidence that Trump went to pedo island, only one flight (a courtesy flight back up to NYC), and he broke ties once Epstein tried to recruit girls from Mar-a-Lago

       It clearly states that it is a Trump fanclub in the sidebar. It doesn't have to cater to other narratives. That said, the current Israeli blitz doesn't fit the fanclub narrative either, and it is telling that it isn't being treated as off-topic like similar things have been.

       Reince Priebus blatantly told us in the GOP "Christmas" message that we have a NEW KING that is on par with Jesus. Sounds like setting the stage for BOW DOWN or be killed to me. The Anti-Christ is here.

       Yeah. I posted there a bit during the end of the election and kind of expected it because it attracted such a weird mix. Partly the frat boy donald supporters, partly people like the posters here (general terms) that just opposed the media manipulation, clinton scandals, etc, and then of course the minority - people who actually supported Trump because they thought it was funny or really did have racist ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the election is over I would say most of the anti establishment/conspiracy crew has migrated out, and only the other groups are left.
