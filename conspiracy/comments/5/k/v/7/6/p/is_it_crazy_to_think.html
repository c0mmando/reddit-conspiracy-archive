        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You know how natural it is for we consumers to enjoy, peacefully, simulated reality &#39;games&#39; where we partake in war scenarios, often killing numerous in-game humans, while holding no attachment to our cognitive, in-game decisions? No remorse whatsoever? Is it that crazy to think that the most powerful people in the world view the common people, for whom they create the game of life, as nothing but in-game characters?</p>

<p>Is it crazy to think that the people making new military weapons are also the people who &#39;buy&#39; the weapons who are also the people who make the profit for selling the weapons, who also might be people who enjoy watching what they&#39;re insanely twisted weaponry can do to the innocent, brain washed soldiers and civilians &#39;in-game&#39;?</p>

<p>It&#39;s the 21st century. Yet we still think war is a natural thing? We still litter our planet, as if we aren&#39;t it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s as though we&#39;ve stopped evolving our conscience. We still put our individual lives and individual problems before the blatant fact that we are life itself. The earth is life itself. In life, there is no literal &#39;right and wrong&#39;, but rather, an understood state of peaceful being and acceptance of all life around us. But we allow such deep separation to distance us from what we think we know and what&#39;s actually true. </p>

<p>We still think we&#39;re white, or black, or gay, or straight, or rich, or poor, or fat, or skinny? We still refuse to acknowledge that each of us is consciousness, which is the same thing everywhere and in everyone? </p>

<p>We don&#39;t look within because we think it&#39;s silly. We don&#39;t ask ourselves what we really are because we fear doing it. We dare not question what consciousness actually is that runs the show we call &#39;my life&#39; because we&#39;d rather watch TV or vent about work. I&#39;m making plenty of generalities but am speaking from the heart after witnessing so much separation in public throughout the holiday season. I want my people to wake up. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think it seems that crazy that, collectively, we&#39;ll awaken. Rapidly.</p>

<p>Edit: when you start actually questioning what the feeling of &#39;me&#39; really is, you eventually recognize -- often at first intellectually, and next consciously -- that it is a complete illusion by way of cognitive attachment and pairing of experiences with particular emotions. Science can prove this. It is a long memory of what the world outside you has convinced you is you. Once that&#39;s understood and seen, your opinions, beliefs all disappear. You become the truth. You embrace being wrong, as it is a means of growth, not loss. I believe this truth can be applied to what we see manifested in politics, as what we see/feel on the inside is what becomes on the outside. Often takes some brutal and sheer honesty before you&#39;ll come to that conclusion. But this is all coming from me--meaning, I cannot prove what I know on the inside to anyone on the outside. Nor can anyone, ever. Only silence can: only truth.</p>

The gnostic christians were (likely) altering their mind state and they saw within the pleroma (universe) an invasive parasite attached to sophia (earth).

<p>So is a herd of Moose working on ego, when defending off against a pack of wolves? Are the wolves acting in ego, when hungry? Your logic is flawed, and severely naive of the world around..

<p>The form of life you and I maintain is capable of being aware that it is aware. I don&#39;t believe a moose is capable as such. Once consciousness becomes conscious of itself, the magnetic pull to partake in any kind of offensive combat dies. Why would life itself hurt itself in any scenario ever, unless defending a greater cause? Why would genuine neutrality ever fight against that which it knows is, deep down, genuinely neutral but flawed with a sick mind (ego)? Never would life consciously battle itself.

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree. I find battlefield 1 to be done rather well for instance as it doesn&#39;t feel trivial (compared to other war games)  when you die or kill others, it&#39;s impactful. Plus, we know fairly well how horrifying it must have been to be on any side during the first and second world War, so we don&#39;t glorify one side over the other. Empathy isn&#39;t necessarily sacrificed for the sake of competitiveness. </p>

<p>In most Call of Duty games though, especially ones that are set in a contemporary time, one side is always right and just, while the others are filthy terrorists we need to destroy. That, to me, is the most dangerous aspect, as it feeds into western and particularly US exceptionalism, while dehumanizing enemy forces to the point of fostering hatred and xenophobia. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think games like that make the act of killing a human any easier, unless they achieve the dehumanization of real world enemies. If you&#39;ve played enough CoD while also being susceptible to general news and film propaganda, the military might want to use you as a means to their goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think I&#39;m being narrow-minded to not work the idea of dimensions into my worldview? I&#39;m not completely opposed to the idea, but I just think of the universe as the 3D we know and sense, plus time. Within that spacetime framework, there are infinite <em>frequencies.</em> But no more <em>dimensions</em> (up/down, left/right, forward/backward, and that&#39;s it). The idea of more dimensions just makes no sense to me because it doesn&#39;t fit anywhere. It doesn&#39;t actually mean anything. There is no geometry that doesn&#39;t get super convoluted and seem like woo woo to me. And it doesn&#39;t seem necessary. But I know the more esoteric physics, like string theory, get into that stuff, but I&#39;m highly skeptical of the weird higher sciences.</p>

<p>&quot;Beings from higher dimensions&quot; to me just means beings that can essentially teleport, traveling in hyperspace, which is like a dimensionless pocket within 3D space. </p>

<p>I&#39;m open to the idea of the infinite spectrum of frequencies getting divided into &quot;dimensions&quot; though, I guess, much like the quanta the rest of the universe divided into. That makes sense on some level.</p>

<p>Do you think the ancients were a 5D civilization? Hence Earth&#39;s original 5D status, as you said. That&#39;s kind of an interesting idea.</p>

<p>The fourth dimension is time, and apparently fifth dimension is beyond time.</p>

<p>This is what&#39;s different between the dimensions as well.</p>

<p>Everything that has happened, will happen, or can happen, has already happened. But because we live in third dimensional reality we move a lot slower because we have &quot;time&quot;</p>

<p>I do believe a lot of ancients live within the 5th dimension.</p>

<p>Also think of it this way. In front of us is the third dimension.</p>

<p>But around that space is other dimensions within it. </p>

<p>Consciousness can be used for extreme cruelty or stupidity. Every suicide bomber, rapist, murderer, torturer and tyrant was and is just as conscious as their victims. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like a computer but programmable in a different way and it doesn&#39;t really have any intrinsic positive value, after being wrongly programmed it might have no or even negative value. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But a consciousness that&#39;s fully aware of itself is what I&#39;m referring to when I hint at a state of awareness that is anti-offensive. Why would life itself, the ultimate symbolism for neutrality and love, ever knowingly attack itself? Suicide bombers, rapists, etc. are certainly conscious beings and are certainly, at their essence, consciousness. But they&#39;re knowing of what they are is owned by the ego, driving them to commit psychopathic acts. I&#39;m theorizing here--totally open to criticism. </p>

<p>I think you need to take a long hard look at what life really is about. The symbolism of neutrality and love is just bolted on to support a pretty narrative, more often than not it&#39;s extreme competition for food and mates interleaved with suffering and disease. Many forms of life have a death rate exceeding 99.9% for their infants. From that point of view our current society is a sugary sweet rainbow colored utopia, even after you factor in a few thousand abusive psychopaths and serial killers.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Such a consciousness is an exceedingly rare thing. Even if you have it as some form of self stated goal it takes considerable time and dedication to achieve such a thing. Most will see no point in such a thing in the brief moment of self-reflection they have and then go back to whatever reality show is the current love of their life. </p>

<p>It may in fact be that many of those high and mighty people that have no remorse and use others as NPCs do so exactly because they have managed to rise their consciousness a notch above the masses, and to actually fulfill their dreams, ambitions and visions they see no other choice but to turn people into cogs in a giant machine. And that may actually be a good thing, because a cog is still a more advanced form of existence than a chunk of raw ore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Life itself is also the observer. That which suffers the suffering. That which applies and receives the pain/horror. Life, when conscious, knows not it&#39;s other. All is one, thus all is embraced and perfection is advised. Perfection=balance=utter neutrality</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent the past year unemployed, having graduated from a top university, after experiencing a sudden awakening experience while deeply depressed. Needless to say, my parents are disappointed. Regardless, I&#39;ve dedicated the past year to figuring out what the hell I really am and how on earth this world, which I was and am preparing to step out into, could be so dark and illogical before I even had a turn to make it what it was. It&#39;s consoling to know I&#39;m not alone with these personal knowings. Sending light your way</p>
