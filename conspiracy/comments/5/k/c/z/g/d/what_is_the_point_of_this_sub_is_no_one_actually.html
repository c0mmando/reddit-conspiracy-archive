        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So is this sub pretty much just about passively talking about the increasing levels of oppression and control and accepting it, while thinking &quot;meh nothing I can do anyways&quot; or &quot;this is the end zomg we&#39;re all fucked&quot; or &quot;this is fine, im okay with the events currently unfolding :]&quot;? </p>

<p>Or is this sub about trying to destroy the system of control, oppression, and domination and creating a better world? </p>

<p>Because almost every comment seems like the former in which case I pose the question: why does this sub even exist? What&#39;s the point? Why not just forget about all of this and focus on a mundane materialistic life? </p>

<p>All any of this does is make people feel like crap and more helpless than before. </p>

<p><strong>Or perhaps that <em>IS</em> what this sub is about but everyone seems to think that somehow getting angry and revolting can destroy an entire all-encompassing global system of control, oppression, and domination, even though they would use any instance of mass revolt/warfare as an excuse to make things even worse for everyone.</strong></p>

<p>Or maybe people seem to think lawsuits and the legal process will fix everything!... even though the elite, those who oppress, control, and dominate, literally control the entire legal process all the way through, including execution of laws and legislation of them.</p>

<p>Can you see how thinking those things will work is pointless? I&#39;ve posted about what can and will work on a few threads of my own and many comments so far but most people just downvote because it doesn&#39;t involve accepting our fate or <strong>doing something negative and pointless to try and fix things.</strong></p>

<p>I had the put those parts <sup><sup>^</sup></sup> in bold because people don&#39;t seem to understand that those things won&#39;t work. Negativity can only bring more negativity, and it has only <strong><em>ever</em></strong> brought more negativity. </p>

<p>The French Revolution was forged through negativity and ended up with negative outcomes: the reign of terror, the napoleonic empire, the other French empires, more colonialism and oppression, etc.</p>

<p>The Russian revolution was forged through negativity and ended up with negative outcomes: the Soviet union&#39;s oppression and a nuclear arms race that could have destroyed the world. </p>

<p>The American Revolution led to 2 centuries of slaughter of the native americans, a variety of different wars, oppression of African Americans through slavery and discrimination, creation of an international banking system that has now helped  foster even more massive inequality across the world, and so many other things.</p>

<p>The Indian revolution might have freed India from colonialism but it did not change the massive inequality of India and did not change its caste system which runs the majority of the country. It led to an insane amount of pollution and overpopulation and created more tension with its neighbor Pakistan that could very well blow up into war. </p>

<p>And now we are far beyond those kind of revolutions and ways to change things because the vested elite now have a global power structure that spans through the majority of, if not every country in the world, and even then those kinds revolutions have never proven to work to create a better world. </p>

<p>Need I go on? </p>

<p>In my posts I&#39;ve laid out the most effective way to both defeat the oppressors/elite and create a better world, but if no one wants to listen and just wants to keep thinking/believing/doing the same things, then that goal of destroying their system and making the world a far better place will take much longer. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t have to take longer than it needs to and if you really want to completely change the world for the better then read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">this post</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5k7k5i/atlantis_downvotes_this_sub_conditioning_and/">this post</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jtaj4/are_the_elites_hiding_giants_and_hybrids_in_the/dbjefio/">this post</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5k42dj/facebook_rolls_out_plans_to_push_gmos_by_labeling/dblyyex/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage">this post if you want to know why I write so much</a>.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to destroy their system and completely change the world for the better then it&#39;d be best to just get off this sub and try to enjoy your life without caring or thinking about any of this, because it&#39;ll only make you feel worse in every way.</p>

<p>This sub is <em>supposed</em> to be filled with open minded people who aren&#39;t fooled by the system! I almost want to write /s on that because it seems like the majority of this sub is fooled by the system in more ways than one, and its simply a lack of clear vision to see that&#39;s the case. </p>

<p>BE the open-minded people you think you are and read my posts and truly consider, without any pointless and harmful negativity, what I am saying. If you do that you&#39;ll realize that you CAN do something to destroy this system and make the world an infinitely better place. <strong>All it takes is to put your thinking caps on and use them to understand the connections between everything I say in those posts, the past we know about, and the world today.</strong></p>

<p>Conditioning of the mind is a...... (wait for it).....<strong><em>very real thing</em></strong>! And to think that you, since you are starting the question the oppressors&#39;/elite&#39;s narrative and system, are somehow magically cured of all conditioning that has been drilled into you since you were born is folly. It runs so very deep and has not only affected, but dominated humanity&#39;s thoughts, desires, attitudes, beliefs, feelings, and actions. </p>

<p>Now it may seem that I come off as a high and mighty &quot;elite freedom fighter&quot; but I can assure you that I simply am not. Equality is the key to true freedom and to argue otherwise would be to blind yourself to all of the evidence you see around you.</p>

<p>I am not better than any of you, I do not think of myself as above any of you. I only wish to help you realize that things truly are not the way they seem, and that you can do something to fix that while NOT creating more problems and have it backfire like every other effort to affect massive change.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a parable of humanity continually believing it&#39;s been waking up from the same nightmare over and over, except never truly waking up. Then one day someone does wake up from it and sees that humanity is still in the nightmare, even if they think they&#39;ve woken up hundreds or thousands of times before. Even now, when it seems so close to waking up on its own, the nightmare is getting worse and the desperation is setting in. </p>

<p>Now what does the man do? Does he just wait for humanity to do the same thing he did without offering any assistance due to his own experience? Or does he offer to help them no matter what, even if they think hes still in the nightmare just like the rest of them and doesnt know how to wake up just like them? </p>

<p>The obvious choice would be to help humanity in the way that he knows worked for him. He knows it&#39;s just a nightmare now and that it isn&#39;t real but to humanity it  still seems so very real and they are convinced it is. So the man starts to help humanity truly wake up from the nightmare, and knows exactly where to start. So he starts at the biggest place where people are closest to actually waking up. All he has to do is lay it out for them what he did and found out to wake up. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all there is to it.  Now of course many of the occupants of this place will balk at his plan and efforts to help them, because being in the nightmare, they think he thinks he knows more than them, and thus thinks he&#39;s better than them, and thus thinks of himself as holier than thou, when in reality it could be nothing further from the truth. </p>

<p>But how does the man let them know that&#39;s not the case? What can he do to show them that no, he doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s better than them and no he doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s holier than thou and that the only reason they think those things is because they are still in the nightmare and that is a part of the nightmare? </p>

<p>Quite simply he can explain to them using the true clarity he has found to hammer into them that they are still in the nightmare, that he has found the way to escape it, and that he does what he does in the way he does for specific reasons that are not part of being in the nightmare.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s what he does, and he knows that by continually doing that, people will start to truly, finally wake up like he did, and they will understand the same things he does and the way to wake others up. And they will all understand that domino effect is what will lead to humanity&#39;s ultimate , and long awaited, end to the nightmare, just as the man already understands.</p>

<p>Hopefully that parable will put things into perspective more than simply using real world examples will. Stories hit at the heart of humanity because humanity wants so desperately to know it&#39;s own story.</p>

<p>I believe in you <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, just believe in yourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have stated in other threads that I will not stop until this sub is completely changed and until people are constantly posting about the things they need to post about to actually destroy the oppressors/elite&#39;s system and create a massively better world , namely the topic I speak about in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">this post</a>.</p>

<p>The internet is the greatest tool in destroying the elite&#39;s system of oppression and control because it allows us to reach the most people and is the most instant form of communication other than talking. Talking in person comes into play most when people are discussing this topic with people like their friends and family, and meeting up in person is MOST important when it comes to getting involved with the topic (as in making expeditions to the caribbean/bahamas/azores, or helping those who already are).</p>

<p>The point of this thread is to highlight just how pointless most of this sub is if that isn&#39;t the goal, or to highlight just how pointless the way they want it to happen is if that is the goal. So in a sense it will force people to reconsider why they are on this sub and that will start the process of change that I and people like you want to see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer lies with the community of this sub itself, not just the mods. They haven&#39;t been deleting my posts [<strong>edit</strong> or any of the other posts related to this topic (like hollow earth, antarctica, e.t.&#39;s, etc.)],  so as far as I am concerned, (or any of you should be), the mods are not the problem, since they aren&#39;t the ones posting all of these pointless, defeating, angry, negative threads and comments. </p>

<p>The few should not dictate for the many, just as the elite should not dictate for the rest of the world. I explain how this simply couldn&#39;t have been the case long ago in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">my post</a>, and that&#39;s the point we want, more than anything in the world, to return to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry if my comment sounded so, I simply stated that because no one else is posting about the topic I am posting about <em>specifically</em>, and I have explained in my posts why its so very important. I edited it to encompass other relevant and important topics.</p>

<p>Now as to being ramblings, I&#39;m not sure you understand what a rambling would be. A rambling would be a disconnected, illogical, unorganized piece of speech or writing that goes on unnecessarily long. </p>

<p>My posts are none of those things. They are all connected (and all of the points within them are connected) to the larger picture, they all use simple, straightforward logic to arrive at accurate points across the entire post, they are highly organized with different subtopics within the posts leading the reader along an obvious and clear cut path using connectedness and logic, and they are just the necessary amount of writing because the topic(s) can&#39;t be accurately discussed in completion or be completely understood without making all of the connections needed to be made (and there are a lot of connections, therefore there is a lot of writing).</p>

<p>They make complete and perfect sense, using connections, logic, organization, and depth to create the post most efficient at helping the reader understand the subject matter. </p>

<p>They use language that both: gets points across that are simultaneously logical and emotional, and create a sense of urgency due to the incredibly massive need for the world to finally change, and they are not mindless, passive, brief posts since the content cannot be covered completely or efficiently with short, simplistic, unconnected posts.</p>

<p>So no they are not deranged and they are not overwrought in either of the commonly used ways of that word.</p>

<p>As to not being worth the time it would take to delete them, I&#39;d like to keep that perception among the mods if that&#39;s the case so none of them go and get any ideas. ;)</p>

<p>So that generalization about my posts, it doesn&#39;t apply. Simply saying &quot;no u&quot; in response to negativity doesnt work to expose the folly of it, one has to piece by piece deconstruct the negativity in order to do that, just like what i did here with this comment. </p>

<p>Now please read them again if you already haven&#39;t, <strong>without any pointless and harmful negativity</strong>, which is what your comment about my posts is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even going to get into what a rant would be because you still wouldn&#39;t listen would you? I could show you how it&#39;s not a rant but that wouldn&#39;t matter, no, because apparently I write like a 15 year old who doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re all here for the same reason because apparently some, or perhaps <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> of people (you surely wouldn&#39;t be included in this group) seem to think that posts that call out the pointlessness and negativity of what the people in this sub do are themselves pointless and negative. Quite funny and quite ironic, but why get into that? </p>

<p>I suggest you read my post again as I&#39;ve made a few edits, but since I know you&#39;re not in that group of people you certainly won&#39;t just react negatively again...</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m not going anywhere as I&#39;ve stated and eventually that group of people (which again, <em>certainly</em> doesn&#39;t include you) will start to actually realize what&#39;s really going on (hint: it has to do with negativity). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm let&#39;s see now... what word and variations of that word seem to continually pop up in my posts? It starts with the letter &quot;N&quot; and includes the parts &quot;egativity&quot; and &quot;egative&quot;. Do you know these words? What do these words mean? I suggest you use your English skills to search your mind for their meanings, or better yet, look through every dictionary you find and see what those words mean. Now how on earth could those words apply to you, I wonder? How could they apply to so much of this sub? </p>

<p>Surely you don&#39;t have (<em>insert word here</em>) thoughts towards me and my posts, or (<em>insert word here</em>) feelings about me and my posts, or (<em>insert word here</em>) beliefs about me or my posts. And certainly none of these things have made you take (<em>insert word here</em>) actions towards me or my posts, no. </p>

<p>Or....maybe you do and maybe you have? Maybe, due to that (<em>insert word here</em>) you can&#39;t even see all of that, and maybe, just maybe, that (<em>insert word here</em>) extends to other parts of your life, and one more thing: <strong>maybe</strong> the same thing happens to the majority of this sub too! And let&#39;s go even further: <strong><em>maybe</em></strong> the same thing happens to the majority of the planet too! </p>

<p>***<strong><em>maybe the majority of humanity can&#39;t see their own (</em>negativity<em>) in response to the exposure of their own (</em>negativity)!</strong>****</p>

<p><strong>Maaaayyyybbbeeeee</strong> once you/them start to see it, you/they will realize what has actually been happening! </p>

<p>And one final thing: <strong>MAYBE</strong> you/they will understand why that has been happening, and <em>just maybe</em>, you/they will understand what you/they can do about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah but are you aware that you have now responded negatively <em>twice</em> to the exposure of <em>your own negativity</em>? </p>

<p>Therein lies the crux of the point. Of course people can sometimes recognize when they&#39;re being negative. What <strong>so many people</strong> fail to recognize is that when that negativity is exposed for what it is - conditioning - they react even more negatively and are blind to the fact that they do so just about every single time. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>I suggest you read all of this if you <em>actually</em> want to know the whole point.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>That conditioning that leads them to be negative <em>in the first place</em> runs so incredibly deep that it <strong>cannot</strong> simply be <em>undone with more negativity</em>.  Negativity, that word I keep talking about, can only <strong><em>add</em></strong> to negativity, creating even more negativity. </p>

<p>It <em>cannot</em> make things more positive (even it seems like that is the case) and <em>never has</em>. That is why i made this post and so many others explaining how posting about <em>negative</em> things and advocating <em>negative</em> actions will <strong>never</strong> destroy the system of the elite, ever. </p>

<p>Negativity only ever adds to more negativity so by doing those things, people are not only helping to maintain the system of the elite (<em>that is based around negativity</em>), they are actually adding on to the existing negativity of the system and are in fact, <strong><em>making it stronger</em></strong>.</p>

<p>That in turn strengthens the level of <em>negative</em> Conditioning people are effected by which then further strengthens the system and it creates a negative loop that strengthens the elite in power and enables them to ruin the world and make things worse and worse</p>

<p>The conditioning can ONLY BE undone by not only the repeated exposure of the negative conditioning for what it is - negative conditioning -, but also exposing <strong>ALL</strong> of it.
Since the negative conditioning of the mind, attitude, desires, and beliefs manifests itself as <em>negative action</em>, that is where the focus needs to be on first.</p>

<p>Repeatedly exposing negative actions causes a negative response to the exposure of those actions, and repeatedly exposing those continued negative responses will force people to be able to see the externalization of their own conditioning(which is what <em>negative action</em> is).</p>

<p>Once they see how they have repeatedly externalized their own conditioning in response to the exposure of their own externalization of their negative conditioning, the one who exposed their negative action can then expose the internal negative conditioning, and that will enable them to make the connection between the internal conditioning and the externalization of that conditioning.</p>

<p>At that point they will finally realize, with the help of the one who exposed their conditioning, that all of this negativity has come from the system of oppression and control of the elite. </p>

<p>That is finally, at last, the point where they will be able to undo the negative conditioning and they will then be open to questioning every part of the narrative that the elite have forced upon everyone, and once they question every part of the narrative, they will inevitably reject the entire narrative and then will finally be able to understand that almost everything they&#39;ve been told about humanity and reality is a lie, and once that happens they will then be truly open to making the connections I continually talk about regarding Atlantis and everything else.</p>

<p>From there they will then realize that what I have been saying about Atlantis, the narrative of humanity and reality, the system of oppression and control, the elite, and changing the world isn&#39;t just &quot;the writing of a 15 year old who just discovered this stuff (and presumably doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about)&quot;.</p>

<p>Then, at that point, they will once and for all, start <em>actually</em> changing the world for the better.</p>

<p>That, my friend, is the point. </p>

<p><em>Now there is one additional point to make</em> and that is if a person is already open to accepting either/ or both Atlantis&#39;s true importance in regards to changing the world for the better, and/or the connections I have made between Atlantis, the narrative of humanity and reality, the system of oppression and control, and the elite, then they will be able to undo their condition far easier because they will already be very close to completely rejecting the entire narrative of humanity and reality, and they will then understand that they have been negatively affected by the system on a deep level.</p>

<p><strong><em>They will then be able to see the externalizations of their conditioning and will be able to see their internal conditioning with ease, due to already knowing it is there. From there undoing their conditioning will essentially be a piece of cake.</em></strong></p>

<p>Since the language in my previous comment didn&#39;t seem to help you, I&#39;ve laid it out as simply as I can. I know that you aren&#39;t illiterate and I know that you can understand English, so there&#39;s no doubt in my mind that if you read this, and <strong>re-read it</strong>, you&#39;ll  finally get what I am talking about.</p>

<p>Jesus christ, you just keep amazing me at how deep the well of stupidity flows. But it is quite entertaining. Do tell more about Atlantis.</p>

<p>But anyways, so what youre saying is that because Im being a douchebag on here, without any other further knowledge of who I am or what I believe or do when Im not making comments, that I am literally enabling the powers that be to continue to ruin the world and fill it with negativity? That even if I would directly save 1000 lives  a day, it would be cancelled out by my douchebaggery on a social media site?</p>

<p>Best way to fight this is to try to take your activism offline imo - get books and other forms of knowledge and find a way to spread truth in your real life.  And stick to smaller subs for better reddit content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well one thing this sub  does is spread information. I for one have learned a lot from this sub. Another thing is when this sub gets together we can move mountains for example finding the guy who deleted Hiliary Clinton  reddit and showing proof he did it. It even made national news if I remember correctly. If this sub could just put our differences behind and come together I bet we can do alot but people are afraid. They&#39;re afraid of starting a revolution because they don&#39;t want to lose their job and source of income when they have a family. They also don&#39;t want to die and leave their family behind. But that&#39;s sadly what it would take to actually make a change in this country a deadly revolution. People just aren&#39;t willing to die for what they believe in.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any resistance will not come from armed fighters trying to overcome evil political leaders who have the weight of armed forces and police supposedly at their side. Resistance will come, like terrorists of today, in small pockets, with damage aimed at delaying, eliminating or confusing the system. Small, armed locals will be quickly dispatched and buried. But each person wanting to resist will do so quietly in his own way while working in an government office, at a utility plant.... whatever. </p>

<p>The first round of resistance will come with gun confiscation. Many military and police disagree with this and will not cooperate or will do so poorly.  Martial law would be set up but soldiers at these roadblock checkpoints become easy targets for locals who know the area.  Like the British Redcoats, these soldiers holding a roadblock would be very uneasy while performing their duties. </p>

<p>Begin any resistance today by knowing your neighbor. Form bonds, learn new necessary skills, stock necessary items.  Even in times of peace and prosperity, it makes sense to be prepared. Waiting until political or social events demand you do so is folly.   The best resistance is a prepared populace.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the main  points of your post. From my brief visit to conspiracy it seems like there&#39;s a lot of information spreading and &quot;x is bad&quot;.  there&#39;s a lot of quality posts and a ton of shit posts. </p>

<p>But at the end of the day nothing gets done for a few reasons</p>

<ol>
<li><p>conspiracy is just as divided as everyone else and can&#39;t focus efforts, and probably isn&#39;t the right sub for that kind of thing.  it doesn&#39;t matter who or what are the bad guys,  we KNOW shits fucked already we don&#39;t need 1000 more examples. Anyone still asleep at this point is a lost cause</p></li>
<li><p>no resources, no unity, no power. A lot of a problems could be solved with crowd funded investigations.  Alternative societies and solutions require trial runs, planning and volunteers.  This cost money/time and I&#39;m guessing no one would be willing to donate. </p></li>
<li><p>A lack of SOLUTIONS, and the solutions we do have are either deeply flawed(divide/conquer, monetary based, aliens/other deus machina will save us)   or have not been planned out on paper by  community effort(time) , tested in any capacity to see if they actually work(money).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>long story short: we can&#39;t get past discussing our individual flavors of tptb and arguing &quot;No,  it&#39;s this group that&#39;s fucking us NOT that one&quot; (hint: it doesn&#39;t matter),  no one wants to donate time or money,  we have no thoughtout solutions with hard numbers and boots on the ground</p>
