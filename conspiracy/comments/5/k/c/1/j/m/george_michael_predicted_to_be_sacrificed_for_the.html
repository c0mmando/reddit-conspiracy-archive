       I messed up because I didn't think anything at the time and I didn't get a screenshot, but right after he died, I saw a post on twitter here:
       <a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreSouthpaw/status/813179602126381056">

       It's since been removed, but this band predicted that GM would die on Christmas day 2016 and I think the post was a facebook screenshot they posted back in 2015. I searched their facebook page back to 2014 and I don't see the post there, either.  You can see the upset fans chastising them here:

       Just went to see Sing with my kids. In consecutive order, these artists were played on the soundtrack-- George Michael, Leonard Cohen, and David Bowie. All this while a poster with alien spaceships and a fake film title We Are Not Alone was in the background. I mean WTF? Only Bowie might've been dead while movie made. That's a little different than predictive programming. Occult or telling people that our history that we're told is all made up. I would say it was a message for adults to pick up on. But wow.

       I've been waiting for a thread with some kind of Illuminati affiliation after hearing of George's passing this morning. It just seems too odd to be a coincidence at such a young age and date. RIP, it truly was his Last Christmas.

       Almost every one of them -- Bowie, Prince, George Michael -- could easily have been involved in the occult and/or the abuse of children for career advancement or perverse pleasure (or both). It could be they are getting whacked.

       have to agree, it's more than a coincidence. imo, no one "gets" rich &amp; famous with or without talent. have seen videos where wanna be (male) singers were expected to 'perform' in the back of limos, when they refused, no record deal was made.

       Bowie was 69 and (allegedly) had cancer, but Prince and George Michael were pretty young, though either could have had AIDS to hurry their exit. Moreover, Michael could've died three days (or more) ago and they sat on it until Christmas Day because....PR reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's all suspicious, even down to Leonard Cohen dying right after Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize (since a lot of people whisper--and not so carefully--that Cohen wrote a lot of Dylan's best stuff).

       idk if that's valid but it makes sense that Elton would "go along" with them. anyone can
       <em>
        say

       they agree with people they're fearful of, doesn't mean they agree with them.

       The guy on the YouTube video doesn't actually say George Michaels' name. Could have been uploaded in 2014 and then the title could have been changed as soon as he died. Next time someone else dies the uploader might just change the title again... Just a thought.

       It's being theorized that he died due to complications from HIV/AIDs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This stems from the fact that Michael dated a man who was HIV positive. In the 1990s, Michael engaged in a relationship with a dress designer named Anselmo Feleppa, who had HIV. A couple of years after meeting, Feleppa passed away from an AIDS-related disease.

       George Michael's death could be explained as covert murder. There is a device gov. has that causes a heart attack and can be used without detection (there are many more devices for control, including visual/auditory hallucinations, etc.) We are at the 11th hour of '84 :

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This could also explain the death of Carrie Fisher. Of course our government has many more devices they won't admit to, because they really want us all brainwashed with the use of these devices and
       <strong>
        their
       </strong>
       celebrities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book "Shadow Government" written by Grant R. Jeffrey (pub. 2009) does a great job with his research on how these devices are meant for world domination. Jeffrey is a minister, so the book does reference the Bible and how we are in that moment where we can still do something about it.

       “This suggests, in my view, a non-local intelligence guiding the affairs of the universe rather than conscious tomfoolery on the part of a human agencies such as conspiring Hollywood magickians. The embedding of symbolism is too well orchestrated, subtle and concise. The noisy plotting and scheming of the human mind doesn’t directly create the phenomena charted by synchromysticism. The patterns found emanate from the same force that organizes uncountable numbers of snowflakes into unique (all being appreciably different) but certainly not individual (all comprising six way geometry) forms. The same force that animates this very moment you read this sentence, the moment of present awareness that is inseparable from who you are.”

       Yeah I've noticed the same patterns.  There are a few explanations.  We're in an AI (with smells of a choose-your-own-adventure / autocomplete / finite state automata with narrative state), or we're in a matrix that's feeding us this data because it has control over our inputs.

       imo it doesn't really matter what the nature of reality is.  we're here in it.  what do we do while we're in it that's optimal for all of us? follow that line of thinking and the path leads to "looking within".  which is something we probably should all be doing, to figure out where We want to go.  this existence could be amazing and wonderful, or we could let the dualists destroy it like they're trying very hard to, right now.
