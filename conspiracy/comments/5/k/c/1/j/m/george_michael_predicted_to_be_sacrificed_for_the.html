<p>It&#39;s since been removed, but this band predicted that GM would die on Christmas day 2016 and I think the post was a facebook screenshot they posted back in 2015. I searched their facebook page back to 2014 and I don&#39;t see the post there, either.  You can see the upset fans chastising them here:  </p>

All this while a poster with alien spaceships and a fake film title We Are Not Alone was in the background. I mean WTF? Only Bowie might&#39;ve been dead while movie made. That&#39;s a little different than predictive programming. Occult or telling people that our history that we&#39;re told is all made up. I would say it was a message for adults to pick up on.

<p>have to agree, it&#39;s more than a coincidence. imo, no one &quot;gets&quot; rich &amp; famous with or without talent. have seen videos where wanna be (male) singers were expected to &#39;perform&#39; in the back of limos, when they refused, no record deal was made.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s all suspicious, even down to Leonard Cohen dying right after Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize (since a lot of people whisper--and not so carefully--that Cohen wrote a lot of Dylan&#39;s best stuff). </p>

<p>This stems from the fact that Michael dated a man who was HIV positive. In the 1990s, Michael engaged in a relationship with a dress designer named Anselmo Feleppa, who had HIV. A couple of years after meeting, Feleppa passed away from an AIDS-related disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>George Michael&#39;s death could be explained as covert murder. There is a device gov. has that causes a heart attack and can be used without detection (there are many more devices for control, including visual/auditory hallucinations, etc.) We are at the 11th hour of &#39;84 : <a href="http://www.jchristoff.com/the-governments-heart-attack-gun-2/">http://www.jchristoff.com/the-governments-heart-attack-gun-2/</a></p>

<p>This could also explain the death of Carrie Fisher. Of course our government has many more devices they won&#39;t admit to, because they really want us all brainwashed with the use of these devices and <strong>their</strong> celebrities. </p>

<p>The book &quot;Shadow Government&quot; written by Grant R. Jeffrey (pub. 2009) does a great job with his research on how these devices are meant for world domination. Jeffrey is a minister, so the book does reference the Bible and how we are in that moment where we can still do something about it.</p>

<p>“This suggests, in my view, a non-local intelligence guiding the affairs of the universe rather than conscious tomfoolery on the part of a human agencies such as conspiring Hollywood magickians. The embedding of symbolism is too well orchestrated, subtle and concise. The noisy plotting and scheming of the human mind doesn’t directly create the phenomena charted by synchromysticism. The patterns found emanate from the same force that organizes uncountable numbers of snowflakes into unique (all being appreciably different) but certainly not individual (all comprising six way geometry) forms. The same force that animates this very moment you read this sentence, the moment of present awareness that is inseparable from who you are.”</p>
