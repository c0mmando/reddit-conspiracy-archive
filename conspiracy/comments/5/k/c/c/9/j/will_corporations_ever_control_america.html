        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a question I often ponder. It is quite obvious that corporate power is increasing. While this rate might be slow, it is fast enough to have me worried. All it would take a few corporations controlling entire industries. This would allow then to blackmail the country into giving them political power in exchange for goods and services. Also, corporations could simply just buy everyone out in a government. One of the more concerning factors is ignorance of people. The path is so obvious it is a wonder to me why more people can&#39;t see it. What is your opinion on this dark subject?</p>

<p>Warning: I am only in high school, and I only have my observations on corporations as my source.</p>

<p>Tl:DR - Corporations could take over America. What is your opinion on this subject?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US Constitution is an amazing document protecting its people. That is the hurdle corporations have to jump over.
The founders saw oppression in ways unprecedented... a king 3000 miles away dictating rule. They wrote it to quell all potential oppressors.</p>

<p>Will that document get minimized due to neglect and financial obligation? It is an eventual absolute in my opinion.</p>

<p>Our goal should be to prevent it on every level we can. Whether it is via representation, force, or simply uniting and out producing the potential threat... our fate is our own.</p>

<p>Knowledge of any enemy&#39;s tactics is critical for survival. Scary people exist, scary corporations exist, scary governments exist... what we need to realize is how scared our enemies will be if we actually unite under the cause to stop their progress.</p>

The people are cattle we all know this by now,  well most of them that see through the msm and brainwashed bs they feed us.  Russia has nothing to do with it.

    <div class="md"><p>No man, its not your fault. I just went to world news and somehow all the top comments are pretty much that. Its mind blowing. I lean left, leaning left means you&#39;re about a quarter mile away from Clinton. The fact that they seem willing to start ww3 if it means they don&#39;t have to admit they fucked up by screwing bernie over. I was one of those 19 year olds who voted for Obama in Indiana that time a democrat won Indiana, was extremely disappointed.  Didn&#39;t vote the next time, he lost Indiana.  Then they give us a shittier candidate.  I saw all these 18-20 yr old kids hyped on bernie in this rural white town, but against clinton Trump won 76% or something crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to be watching the corporations and your government to get a better idea of what is going on. A good starting place for you would be to go to congress.gov and start searching the names on the post-employment records for the house and the senate. Some of those names will begin to popup in positions all across the corporate world, in &quot;lobbying&quot; type activities. Lobbying congress during the 1 year cool off period is illegal, but no one in the history of the United States has been charged with this crime. This is only one example of the corruption in government but its documented and easily verifiable. Showing influence over voting is difficult to provide evidence for, but the appearance of corruption alone was something the founding fathers were against. Our &quot;representation&quot; is bought, and its going to take a big effort to correct the mistakes most continue to ignore. </p>
