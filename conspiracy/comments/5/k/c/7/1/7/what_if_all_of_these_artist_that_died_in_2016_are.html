<p>DUDE</p>

<p>I JUST HAD THIS FUCKING THOUGHT [8]
What if it&#39;s the government taking care of them from Kurt Cobian to Michael Jackson and much earlier/later?
And all of them - Bowie, Prince, George they&#39;re all colluding against them so bye bye. Notice how they focused on saying George Michaels died in a &quot;tranquil state&quot; at 52? Idk. Seems weird.</p>

<p>Any thoughts? About to take another hit will update soon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They literally had one foot in the grave. Club Anubis?</p>

<p>Bowie did record &quot;Lazarus&quot;, right before he &quot;died&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lazarus of Bethany, also known as Saint Lazarus or Lazarus of the Four Days, is the subject of a prominent miracle of Jesus in the Gospel of John, in which Jesus restores him to life four days after his death.&quot;</p>

<p>Makes you wonder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Lazarus had very specific meaning, because Sir David knew his fate. He had been battling Cancer for 18 months, so he wrote and produced his Magnum Opus.

<p>As for Bowie. What makes you so sure you know what Bowie was up to. Here are a few short vids that might change your mind about Lazurus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that most living things can feel the end coming, call it the Morphogenetic feild, call it the Pond of time, or whatever you will. I think he knew he wasn&#39;t around after this work. And perhaps his work on this kept him longer than naturally allowed? Tangent. This man was intuitive, and i mean to a degree most can&#39;t get with. My only proof is his music. But i do believe he wrote this to say goodbye... to his fans(I was kinda, but appreciated more than admired). Hence the nostalgia. Like a rock opera autobigraphy. Anyway, also as interesting was all the other earth shaking musicians dying around the same time;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bowie was heavy into the occult, that I know for sure. The music Industry is quoted as saying rock and roll is the music of the devil. 
His Opus also included: Black Star</p>

<p>So it&#39;s easy to see the end coming when you manufacture it. Imagine you are bowie. Approaching this magic 69 number some of them fake their deaths at. </p>

<p>Him and Alan Rickman. Two Black Stars.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.who2.com/famous-people-died-at-age-69-years-old/">http://www.who2.com/famous-people-died-at-age-69-years-old/</a></p>

<p>Evel Knievel made the list. Huxley. Johnny Unitus at 69 on 9/11... for starters, pretty interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Other than playing Snape, what was Rickmans role in the grand scheme? Numbers seem to be very important to Satan related theories no doubt(Robert Plant &quot;Thanks for eleven years&quot; with a tear in his eye) but i guess im asking, whats the theory? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Symbolic representations like the Astrological sign Cancer, which Bowie died of is shown as a 69. A numeric symbol of the two claws of the crab.</p>

<p>Other numbers have significance according to their place on the tree of life. Thus Crowley wrote a book called 777 of all the gematria. Gematria is a reduction of numbers to correlate to both the tree of life and the values of the Hebrew alphabet to correspond to &#39; all manifestations real and imaginary&#39;, as he put it</p>

<p>This system of magick has a value to them. As each can be reduced to the type of magick they are doing. </p>

<p>The theory is that the music industry and Hollywood in general is a satanic cult. Bowie and Rickman both have gave it their all and retired their characters which had promoted the religion so well.</p>
