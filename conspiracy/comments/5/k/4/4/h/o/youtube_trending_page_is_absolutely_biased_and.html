       #19 Trending. There is also a video from a trans "woman"  that I've seen on trending many times. Despite usually only having ~140k views at the time it appears on trending. Then the views sky rocket and now it looks like it belongs.

       The thing is, YouTube Trending is kind of like the Front Page of YouTube. It can take a video with 100k views, and in a few days it has 2 million. I understand that they need to manage their own website. They're a private business. But there is definitely a 'trend' to their Trending page. And it's usually parallels the Left's agenda.

       They changed how videos spread. Videos with more "activity" rise above videos with likes or views. So basically videos get seen if they get the most comments and likes or dislikes. So if tons of people are disliking and calling you scum in comments it rises above videos with tons of views and likes that have very few people commenting.

       People woke up to the lies peddled by the media and they'll desert YouTube and its ilk just as rapidly once it hits tipping point
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube is there for the money. When it starts to hurt Youtube's revenue, YouTube will change its tune fast.  It's up to us to make that happen even faster in the same way we've crippled mainstream media and anything else that tries to insult our collective intelligence
      </p>
      <p>
       (((They))) have had their day and they enjoyed it while they were on top.  We're wise to them now and the new awareness is growing like weeds.  It has the charlatans running the agendas scared to death.  We outnumber them to a ridiculous degree and they're nowhere near as 'all knowing' and 'powerful' as they've tried to claim
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep on spreading awareness as you are, as we're all engaged in doing.  The fake wars from which they've always profited aren't as easy to stage now.  We're not going to be their cannon fodder.  We're not going to be conned into street fights.  We're wise to their endless divisiveness and see right through it.  We know what they're up to.  They're running scared now and are toppling like dominos
      </p>
      <p>
       They want us all at war with each other. That's the game they've played down through history. And they've backed all sides and profited all the way through.  We know that now.  So keep on reminding people that we're not each others' enemies and never were.  All the wars were orchestrated, along with the hate and their false justification for wars.  They claimed those wars were for 'our freedoms', but we see through those lies now
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube can continue going down the tubes, losing revenue all the way.  It's hosting child porn now apparently, the disgusting hypocrites, while pretending to create 'safe environment'
      </p>
      <p>
       We know who owns and controls all media, including porn and YouTube, Microsoft, etc. etc.  They are vermin.  Hit them where it hurts ... their pockets as always, those lovers of money
      </p>
      <p>
       Speak out, speak up, kill the enemy and THAT is 'our freedoms' and our children's future

       I'm pointing out the agenda I perceive behind YouTube's trending page. It's just my opinion. But there's definitely a trend to YouTube's "trending" page, besides the obviously paid-for slots for late night talk shows. Are they trying to make those relevant? They used to be hosted by older men, now it's younger millennials.

       Checking in months later, it's still overtly biased. It seems like a good mix stealth advertising and a predominately liberal narrative. Stephen Colbert's videos are on my trending tab on the daily it seems, and what night-show host bashes anything related to Trump or conservative values more than Stephen? The list has to be at least partially curated by a group at YouTube, but they'll never admit that. I've yet to see any alternative narrative videos make it to trending, aside from Philip Defranco.
