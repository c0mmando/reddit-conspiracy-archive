        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reading the latest news
«Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained Secret Service records through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request which revealed the agency spent $ 1.2 million on the trip. Adding that to previously-obtained expense records, the group found the total cost of the Obamas&#39; trip to Hawaii last December came in at over $ 4.8 million».</p>

<p>It turns out very interesting story. When Trump won, he said he will appoint his salary $1. At the same time, Obama&#39;s 2015 Hawaiian vacation costs taxpayers over $ 4.8mn. Obama is spending taxpayers&#39; money in a huge amount, but it was Trump for some reason called a liar, a puppet of Putin and Russian hackers. What the heck?</p>

<p>Therefore, I propose to proceed as follows. It is necessary to come up with an official statement that the exorbitant costs of Obama on his and his family&#39;s entertainment are also the result of the machinations of Putin and Russian hackers hacking. Then everything will fall into place and the most democratic democracy in the world will win again.</p>

<p>Joking aside, all this causes great resentment. We have already seen the hypocrisy of Clinton. We have repeatedly seen the hypocrisy of Obama, but here&#39;s another example. What should happen to the &quot;democrats&quot; has finally settled down and stopped publicly dissembling? Oh, I completely forgot. We must get rid of Putin and Russian hackers.</p>

<p>Every fucking president goes on vacation and it costs money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, knowing that Obama spent $4 MILLION on a vacation in HAWAII is very interesting to me. I&#39;d like to see the audit of that trip.</p>

<p>Dreaming of your hotdog stand in Hawaii indeed.... I&#39;d think people who enjoy pizza and hotdogs so much wouldn&#39;t wrack up such an expensive room service bill on vacation.</p>

<p>Seriously tho - even with all the security costs for travel which I know must be insane... $4 million dollars of gov&#39;t money to vacation ????? Wtf, I can&#39;t even deduct my vacation costs off my taxes :( and I definitely can&#39;t get my employer to reimburse me for that shit neither. Seriously a dick move, Brobama.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last December, CBS News reported that the number of vacation days President Obama has taken since the beginning of his presidency stood at 161 days. If you add the 28 days of vacation he has taken this year his total comes to 189 days. If you add his current vacation in Martha’s Vineyard to the mix that still puts him at under 200 days so far. Even if he took every day off the rest of his term in office that would only add an additional 153 days to his total – still placing him at less than half the vacation days of he predecessor.</p>

<p>However his predecessor, two-term President George W. Bush, took 879 days of vacation, including 77 trips to his Texas ranch according to a report by The Washington Post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you take the average round at 4 hours that&#39;s 24 hours of golf, of which there are 24 hours in a day. I&#39;ll concede that most people don&#39;t golf 24/7. However, my point still stands. If you golf 2 rounds in one day, you would count that as 2 days of vacation? Cuz you need to do the same for GWB, which would make that 879 days of vacation bigger as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s do some arithmetic! So according to you each round of golf should be counted as a day of vacation. I&#39;ll be generous and say those 300 rounds are <em>separate</em> from the vacation tally (which they aren&#39;t). So we have 189 days of vacation, plus 300 from golf, is 489. If Obama took everyday as vacation after that source we add another 153 to bring is to 642 days, still less than Bush&#39;s 879 <em>not including</em> the addition we should have done from <em>his</em> rounds of golf. </p>

<p>Presidential vacation days are measured as &quot;vacationed part or all of a day.&quot; Bush outstripped Obama by a good number. Get over it.  </p>

<p>As of September, Obama had vacationed 28 times for 217 days. Bush took 77 vacations to his ranch, for 490 days, and made 11 trips to his parents in Maine, for 43 days. 533 altogether. In fact, I&#39;ve even seen several site reporting the total number is 879, but I tend to use the lower number because I can&#39;t find the source of the discrepancy. The 533 is damming enough as it. </p>

<p>Clinton, interestingly, took 174 vacation days. Reagan took 335 vacation days. No modern president took less than Jimmy Carter, totalling in at 79.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine. I think there is <em>plenty</em> of ways to relax on the mainland US, but to each his own. Its not just a $4.8m Hawaii vacation though- what about the pizza or hot dogs he had flown in from Chicago for $65k? What about Trumps bullshit with New York? I havent even researched anything else Obama (or Bush or Clinton or or or) has done.</p>

<p>There is a systemic perversion of government blowing money everywhere- look at military industrial contracts where you see the US military getting <em>gouged</em> regularly by these companies. The insane waste, piles upon piles of departments, etc etc. </p>

<p>You can make a case that what they do in that way is fine- I guess it just seems excessive for someone to cost taxpayers so much when they&#39;ve (in Obama and Bush&#39;s case) destroyed civil liberties, waged wars/drone strikes, etc etc etc- I could go on for days (so could you) about all the terrible decisions made. </p>

<p>Why is it that any time I&#39;m critical of one, a person drops their downvote and comes in with their condescending shit (like &quot;....&quot;)? Do I seriously have to qualify every time that I hate Democrats and Republicans pretty much equally at this point?</p>

<p>Yes its stupid to not go to intelligence briefings. A $4.8mn is ridiculous, and frankly I&#39;d find another way to unwind- continental US has plenty of shit to do. If he has extended family that live there, fine- I&#39;m wrong and you&#39;re right.</p>
