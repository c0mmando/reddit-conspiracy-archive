<p>The technical stuff is beyond me, but I&#39;ve seen interesting speculations about Bitcoin&#39;s origins possibly being in the NSA. And the theory you&#39;re proposing used to float around on the Bitcointalk forums back in the day. It&#39;s an intriguing idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that most miners review the code they are running, in fact the way bitcoin gets updated is via code consensus. Meaning the majority of nodes decided to run a particular version of code, which would infer that they have looked at the code and decided that it is pretty good.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of silly to think that the same people capable operating in a vast network of giant super computers, aren&#39;t able to do a code audit. </p>

<p>Bitcoin is opensource, you can go look at all the code yourself.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure there are any legitimate sources for the global yearly transactions of bitcoin except to go to the blockchain.</p>

<p>Around 300,000BTC are being transacted daily - it fluctuates from 200K - 500K depending on the day (not including returned change) - so about $300 million worth of daily transactions. As to what % these are for goods, services, investments, etc... is unknown. That&#39;s just the average for how much circulates daily. Trying to figure out what % of that is going into exchanges is impossible.</p>

<p>Industry worth is measured in years not days. So we&#39;re looking at a $110 billion / yr industry. </p>

<p>Investments are essentially a time based discount on goods and services, so it makes little sense differentiating market value from transaction value when it comes to a currency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the only valid source - literally anything else is just based on the blockchain. This data is straight from the blockchain. If you don&#39;t understand that, then you don&#39;t grasp the very basic idea of how this all works. </p>

<p>Daily tx - 300,000BTC. Daily mining generation: ~1700BTC.</p>

<p>So we&#39;re talking about less that half a percent of daily transactions are newly generated coins. Insignificant. </p>

<p>The volume of all exchanges is freely available - but the majority of that is BTC that is not in circulation. The volume is pushed by daytraders and short term trades - so it&#39;s all kept in house, and not on the blockchain. Only when they transact <em>to and from</em> the exchanges is that data captured, but not while they trasact <em>within</em> the exchange. So exchange volume is not part of the daily bitcoin transaction.</p>

<p>I think you should really read up more on bitcoin before you start spreading your false conclusions.</p>

<p>r/BitcoinBeginners and r/Bitcoin are good places to start!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin is weird... Technically, if it can be traded for real money, holding bitcoin for 10 years will likely result in a huge huge huge return due to the fact there is not an infinite number of bitcoins... Imagine if you had 1 dollar 100 years ago and they didn&#39;t print more money, or printed money only based on population increase. Your 1 dollar would be the same as 1 million or so. Bitcoin is flawed as a concept due to this fact. By having superior technical abilities (mining effectively) you essentially are the owner of the market. Is it right that only IT minded people would own an expensive currency? Of course its not, thats why bitcoin will forever be just a niche not a mainstay. At some stage people will stop touching it because the price will be ludacris, and then it will crash to be worth nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just described the stock market. The brokers always make money, the investors have to be smart. You would be amazed at how much money you can make by buying 10 shares of stock for 40$ and then selling when it reaches 80$. That is the same as buying bitcoin at 400$ and selling at 800$.Of course there are few stocks that volatile but evidently bitcoin is. I know one day I bought some Tsla for 199$ and sold it the next for 217$. As always the secret to any market is buy low and sell high.</p>
