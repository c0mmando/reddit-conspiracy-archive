       Details are on voat and probably can't be posted here. It is a company started by a Podesta cousin with direct link to a residence of Tony Podesta. Funny name too - was Guccifer on to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like the brave investigators of pizzagate are getting very, very close to unraveling everything.

       Dont forget Kubrick died months vefore the film's release. Gave the studio plenty of time to delete some more explicit stuff. The thread is definitely there, tho. Especially the scenes with the costume shop.

       It was ahead of its time, and it kind of shows how in the dark we were. It is excellent. Both a type of prophecy and a disclosure simultaneously. A time capsule that when years later , when there is enough awareness it can be opened and understood. That was his genius was his ability to bury encoded information in a plot so that the movie was two movies in one. I understand some of it. Like in The Shining how he encodes his involvement in the Apollo mission to the moon. And how Eyes wide Shut is a dual meaning of the world being blind to how people are being blinded and programmed by their handlers. How the perception is being shaped by the elite through mediums like movies. So he is also in a sense shutting his eye, or his eye that is his cameras eye.  His movie then becomes within his minds eye, in his experience, autobiographical, like you would recall a memory. And  Autobiographical and prophetic also in that his eyes are wide Shut, meaning he is dead. Maybe he knew he would be killed for doing the film.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you are right, I am sure he had more in store for that film than the final edit showed.

       This guy (link below) does some really good analysis of Kubrick films and others as well, if you read some of his articles in detail you'll get a good sense for the priming techniques that Kubrick used and you'll be able to spot them when you watch his films and films by other directors who use those techniques, though I don't know of many others who were as meticulous as Kubrick was in interweaving plot and subplot with the imagery on screen.

       The Nazis are rolled up into the CIA part of the list... and then back to L Ron hubbard to touch on some undercover spying on Aleister Crowley and the whore of Babylon on behalf of US Naval Intelligence... bounce from naval scientology to Sea Org... From Crowley to CIA to Charles Manson back to Scientology to CIA and Charles Manson(program, deprogram, reprogram = nutcase)...

       I'd love to see it the Venn Diagram of what is going on... the variety of motivations are all over the spectrum... and different "good" or "evil" groups have differing opinions on what kind of timeline we should be working on.. and how much ends justify the means. No one will dig this deep into this topic to read this stuff... especially since we're not tunnel-visioned on Comet Ping Pong...

       The proof is out there. All there is now is circumstancial evidence. Hundreds of pieces of circumstantial facts pointing at the same thing, sure. But circumstantial none the less. There will be a loose thread somewhere out there that will make the whole thing unravel when you pull it. And the person who discovers it will be remembered for all eternity if the truth escapes.

       Because if you as a professional and established journalist starts to investigate and report on this without the water tight evidence to back you up, you're basically just going to land yourself a suicide open and shut case or possibly even a family accident.

       No one wants to be the first one to step out in the cold. This is why citizen journalism is so important here. They can't suicide us all.

       journalists arent going to start reporting on this because there is nothing to report but circumstantial evidence at best. There is no investigation to even legitimize a discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry but that is the reality. Sensationalist headlines  like Christmas Breakthrough like this arent going to win interest in a potentially very concerning case.

       They don't report on it because:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Many are paid to publish and censor on behalf of the gov.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Many are just as brainwashed as everyone else.
      </p>

       3) Some think there may be an element of truth but know it would be a career killer.

      <p>
       4) Few realize it is likely true but also realize it's "too big" and would result in suicide if seriously pursued.

      <p>
       5) Few know it is 100% congruent with the way TPTB really operate and their car exploded because they had a heart condition anyway.

       pizzagate is just an investigation into the possibility of a DC based pedophilia ring operating in DC... in a similar manner to other rings that have been busted in recent years... the circumstantial evidence is hard to dismiss when you recognize that the problem of government pedophilia  exists whether or not you think pizzagaters are crazy.

       You're creating a false narrative. The people dedicated to this investigation openly accept that dead ends and disinfo exists and try our best to discern between those things and productive truth.  This isn't a joke.

       It could be an office building, or it could be an address used by their registered agent for service of process (legal papers). The latter is incredibly common. Or it could be a virtual office used to receive mail. I don't know. That one of the 8 companies owns the other 7, or is even related to the others, is a leap or conclusion without any evidence, really.

       That has more to do with established business case law than taxes.

      <p>
       Some companies require that other companies doing business deals with them reside on paper in Delaware, so that the contracts have a predictable legal basis (because of the established case law).

       I posted it before because they use a lot of symbolism that can be found at various places, like CPP.  The Star and the Crescent, for example, is on their front sign, and it is also a symbol used by the Shriners.  The Shriners wear the fez and drive around in those miniature cars.  The Shriners are very well known for building and funding children's hospitals.

       It is interesting that there is a person wearing the fez (about 1:27) in the Unusual as Usual video that was filmed at CPP.

       Personally I think there's more to this than meets the Eye and the mods here actually do work for you all to keep this sub as open as possible, and will only be using mod actions when absolutely necessary.

       You want to take back the sub? Start tonight.

       This is serious.  I just looked up the business registration of Gusifer, LLC.
       <br/>
       Gusifer, LLC has more than 2 known addresses in Winchester VA.  The both look residential..
They're both in proximity to almost 30 pizza restaurants.  One of them is called 'Italian Touch'
The registering agent of  Gusifer  has over 2 decades of off shoring experience..  I suspect closely related to Haiti.  Not sure, I'm still digging.  Gonna deep dive through Frederick County records, trying to find an association.  Will report back.

       Gusifer?
      </p>
      <p>
       "The letter "G" figures prominently in Freemasonry.  In the lower degrees, the initiate is told that this letter stands for "God" and for "Geometry", which the Supreme Architect of the Universe used to design this wonderful Cosmos.  However, occultist, and 33rd Degree Mason, Arthur Waite, quotes Eliphas Levi [also 33rd Degree], telling us that the letter "G" stands for Venus, and that Venus' symbol is a lingam, a stylized phallis. [Masonic author, Arthur Edward Waite, The Mysteries of Magic: A Digest of the Writings of Eliphas Levi , Chicago, , DeLaurence, Scott, and Company, 1909, p. 217]
      </p>
      <p>
       The greatest Masonic author of all time, Albert Pike, agrees. He states [page 631-32 in Morals and Dogma ] that the Monad [#1] is male, and the Duad [#2] is female.  Their sexual union produces the Triad [#3], which is "represented by the letter 'G', the generative principle".  This term, "generative principle", is code for the sex act."
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare these two images:

        Pic of Nu And Set being separated from sex
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Egyptian myth of Nu and Set, were Nu(night) and Set(day) are locked in a sexual embrace. Their separation created a division between light and dark. A myth for how there is even a day and night, personified in man and natures symbiosis.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        This is also why you see a black and white checkerboard floor in some the images of the mason symbol. The light and dark principle.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       But the similarities are there. Only the masons use a compass to represent Nu, a square for Set, and a 'G' for the "generative principle/phallus/sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same myth hidden in plain site.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why it's Gusifer. Or Lucifer with a G.

       Yea, looking over your article I don't see your disagreement. We both know the occult has its basis in ancient myth. And the myth has been distorted towards the over emphasis on the evil. And I very well understand what's at stake my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as my post ,I started to make this connection today of the deeper meaning of the compass and square. The past couple of days I've been having quite a few revelations about Masonic symbols and their connections to ancient myths both good and evil.

       Conflate? I'm stripping it down. You can't deny the similarities between the Nu/Set myth and the symbolism of Masonic compass square and G. I wasn't even talking about Baal, specifically. Just how masonry is distorting this mythos.

      <p>
       Correlation does not imply causation. The symbolism of the Nu/Set myth is not part of the Judeo-Christian canon. Especially since the Egyptians gods were idol worship, and Judeo-Christianity is monotheism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Albert Pike, along with Arthur Waite, were postulating what "G" meant. Being a 33rd Degree mason is irrelevant - in this position, their motivation was to sell books. It was huge at the time to link Freemasonry with the Occult, it was a means of the public "understanding" things. The Taxil Hoax is a great example of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does "G" mean? "Geometry", most likely. Why? Because in addition to the Freemasons literally being the first trade union ever, numbers had a very special status in Egyptian mythology, Judeo-Christian beliefs, and New Age Occultism. Even today, people try to find relevance in the numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The top level of Freemasonry is Master Mason, 3rd Degree. If you want to be a Shriner or York/Scottish Rite, cool. But it doesn't make a difference in the official teachings.

       In this , using myth, correlation does imply causation because myth is from which other belief systems spring. So just like Christianity has its similarities to the osiris myth, so does freemasonry have its root in myths that came before. In this way you can trace them back.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything is conflated ,it is freemasonry itself.

       But look at it this way, we have millions of beliefs, but only very few belief systems. Only ten belief systems from which cause countless variations.

       Cool. So why are we disagreeing? I forgot.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Jews and Christians do worship idols though, don't they? Let's figure this out. Christ is idol worship. Jesuits worship the sun/son. The Romans actually switched the first day of the week from Saturday to Sunday; church is on Sunday, etc. The sun being another idol to worship which has been around of course in Egypt already prior, and prior to that it was worshipped, probably forever in some form. It's really nothing new, just the idols change personas.
      </p>
      <p>
       So does the significance. Saturn day becomes sort of a Sabbath switch. The Jews still hold their Sabbath on Saturn day. And then we know the idol they worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm on it it's interesting to note that 9/11 happened on a Tuesday. Which is Mars day. The God of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just in the beliefs about arbitrary days of the week are encoded meanings derived from ten core beliefs, particularly myth. And in magick those symbols are used in operations to reinforce the belief. It's really that simple. But in the grand scheme of things they mean nothing. Arbitrary ideas invented by man about his place in nature. They only have power and significance is one believes they do, as they hold no absolute knowledge about reality. So in a sense all of our current idols are false, but held as truth. That's how I look at.

       Really? You as much said it in your article. Saturn. Satan. Baal. Whatever, Moloch. Take your pick. It's not that hard to discern they actually idolize the symbol of Saturn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eliphas Levi, a Jewish Kabbalist, was the one who created the famous Baphomet, which you quoted myself in your article. Make this connection and you have it. I'm not an anti Semite, but Jews run Hollywood and music and it's how they worship their idol through that medium. Why do you think satanism is even a thing? Most Satanists themselves don't even know it's a Jewish propagation.

       Pretty much. It's an ageless battle spawned by belief systems. Duality, relationships, duplicity. I like that concept conflate you brought up, but our beliefs are all conflated. I don't think it can be avoided to mix beliefs together. But yea, since that is the pool from we draw from it boils down to which side you are on. It's very black and white, like the checkerboard floor of the masons. Or the Egyptian God holding up the dark from the light. Metaphorical light/dark dual symbolism. But it's us holding up the whole thing, not gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what about if the new age Idol is the self? We don't idolize ourselves enough as it is. We idolize others and God's and important religious icons both good and evil. Fuck all that shit. The knowledge of self is where it's at, and you don't get knowledge by believing in God's. So it amuses me, Satanism. How arbitrary and redundant and distorted it is. Once you figure it out its a cosmic joke.

       I wear fruit of the loom. Maybe I'm Adam because of that. And So many to choose from.... Past life attractions to Egypt, personally, and always a feeling I was a Viking. And Not only do I see idols in this life, but in others. Yet somehow they are all inside me, so there is no escape but to come home.

       Everybody has guidelines. And bring them everywhere they go. It's not cool to isolate one person when this is something we all seem to do. That's why i said confirmation bias is a trap. As soon as you target another, you are bringing out your own implicit bias and guidelines. It's typically how any conversation goes down.

       And if you are the one who gets to edit the bible, ...you must feel like a God. But I wonder how much of it is confirmation bias? What do we do with it now? Not like we could ever make much sense of it, flawed by its own implicit and absolute guidelines, obscured by its own conflation.

       It's only a matter of time until it is totally irrelevant, like a photo that fades to invisible. I'm very curious to what comes next, I don't think another God or crucifixion myth is probable in our timeline, do you see us shifting backwards to more dogma? I don't. But I can start to see a picture being formed of a type of revolution happening.

       Perfect example of the type of shit that triggers a revolution. It's like Dr. Evil thinks he can rule the world. It's comical to think it will work. I can't stop him from trying....

       The thing about energy is you can't force it. You can't put a square peg in a round hole... unless you are a master mason, then still you have to assimilate both into an amalgam.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world isn't ready for destabilization of the nationalism of each country. At least not for a hundred years most likely, and in a natural progression. Not a forced one like any new world order Soros Inc has in mind. When you force energy it naturally follows the laws of physics and produces an equal and opposite reaction. There is your revolution. Like I said I can't stop him, but he will fail because his intentions are personal and not collective. And as individuals will start to see, a choice will be made for what type of world we choose to create, already with the loss of Hillary the world moves in that direction of not letting oligarchs be dictators.

       Yes. See what happens. The elites are already starting to be revolted against. Elites and Authorities in general. See South Korea and Aleppo, Brexit,... And I already mentioned Hillary. Awareness of her corruption will be legendary. The whole pedo thing is really the proverbial nail in the coffin.  The underlying current is primed.  Trump will be walking egg shells.

       Do you practice reading probabilities and what direction the collective is moving? Helps with the fear to know there is nothing to be afraid of, and instead a great sense of liberation is probable.

       It usually is since it is the closest celestial body other than the moon. That is the main reason why it's used as the symbol of what separates day and night.

       For example, the sun is day, the moon(or stars) is night, in between is Venus.

       That is very good information.  I have been trying to decipher the Masonic symbolism for several months now.  Do you know anything about Amen or Ra or Amen Ra?  Amen and Ra are both sun gods, but I do not know if this is significant in Masonry.

       Must have been terrible for the victims when people kept doubting and covering for the priests. However after all these years its basically common knowledge and there's even a movie on it.

       This is what an investigaton looks like. An actual prosecution hopefully will take place if this info is true, possibly at any point after Jan. 20. 2017.

       Never too late to inform yourself. Notice the vows of silence. In several cases victims waited until they were adults before being able to confront abusers.

       The allegations were investigated and covered up in some cases for over 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       "In one, four Dublin archbishops were found to have in effect turned a blind eye to cases of abuse from 1975 to 2004.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fresh scandal erupted in March 2010 when it emerged the head of the Irish Catholic Church, Cardinal Sean Brady, was present at meetings in 1975 where children signed vows of silence over complaints against a paedophile priest, Fr Brendan Smyth. This prompted Pope Benedict XVI to apologise to Irish victims."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Reacting to the UN report in February, Barbara Blaine, the president of Snap (Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests), said it was clear that the Vatican had put the reputation of Church officials above protection of children.

       You'll find all the doxx details in that voat thread. Because voat doesn't censor, even when it encourages harassment. But I won't name someone who is clearly being witchhunted yet hasn't been officially charged with anything. Because I think that's wrong. And likely defamatory.

Wednesday's child is full of woe,
Thursday's child has far to go;
Friday's child is loving and giving,
Saturday's child works hard for its living;

       I was talking about Venus in this thread, but check this out, the etymology(origin) of the word Friday:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Old English Frīgedæg ‘day of Frigga,’ named after the Germanic goddess Frigga, wife of the supreme god Odin and goddess of married love; translation of late Latin Veneris dies ‘day of Venus,’ Frigga being equated with the Roman goddess of love, Venus. Compare with Dutch vrijdag and German Freitag"
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        But in this context it means either Child Love, Or Loving a Child. The only thing that makes it suspect is that instead of calling it one thing they hide it behind symbolism calling it 'Fridays Child'. So if their hiding the meaning they are hiding something else, imo.
       </li>

       It's from the poem,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday%27s_Child">
        <em>
         Monday's Child
        </em>
        .
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Monday's child is fair of face,
       </p>
       <p>
        Tuesday's child is full of grace,
       </p>
       <p>
        Wednesday's child is full of woe,
       </p>
       <p>
        Thursday's child has far to go,
       </p>
       <p>
        Friday's child is loving and giving,
       </p>
       <p>
        Saturday's child works hard for a living,
       </p>
       <p>
        But the child who is born on the Sabbath day
       </p>
       <p>
        Is bonnie and blithe and good and gay.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The poem and its respective days of the week are often used to refer to children. (e.g.
       <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/lawreview/vol40/iss1/7/">
        this text
       </a>
       refers to an embryo as a "Thursday's child [has far to go]")
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently, there has been some variation in the days of the week:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Despite modern versions in which "Wednesday's child is full of woe," an early incarnation of this rhyme appeared in a multi-part fictional story in a chapter appearing in Harper's Weekly on September 17, 1887, in which "Friday's child is full of woe", perhaps reflecting traditional superstitions associated with bad luck on Friday – as many Christians associated Friday with the Crucifixion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       An example of "Friday's child is full of woe" comes in the
       <em>
        Star Trek: The Original Series
       </em>
       episode simply titled,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday's_Child_(Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)">
        <em>
         Friday's Child
        </em>
        .
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Wednesday's child [is full of woe]" has been used by various adoption related organizations. A simple search for "Wednesday's child adoption" on your favorite search engine will yield multiple results.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the context, the most likely explanation is that they chose "Friday's Child" for the same reason other adoption organizations have chosen "Wednesday's Child".

       After pizzagate was shut down,  word got around about voat .  A lot of people from reddit went over and started using bots and multiple accounts to upvote and downvote posts to fit a liberal narrative.  So that's why it's invite only right now,  as far as I know.

       I apparently heard somewhere that the so called "underworld" is actually space.
      </p>
      <p>
       (seems like there is a hierarchy sort of 'government' system - in space /(etc?)?)
      </p>
      <p>
       could also mean underground bases as well.

       The underworld is actually the space beneath our feat. If you are an ancient person and look up and it seems endless, it only follows that when you look down you imagine the same. Since they perceived the world as flat, as far as I know. This is partly a synonym for 'as above, so below'

       It was ahead of its time, and it kind of shows how in the dark we were. It is excellent. Both a type of prophecy and a disclosure simultaneously. A time capsule that when years later , when there is enough awareness it can be opened and understood. That was his genius was his ability to bury encoded information in a plot so that the movie was two movies in one. I understand some of it. Like in The Shining how he encodes his involvement in the Apollo mission to the moon. And how Eyes wide Shut is a dual meaning of the world being blind to how people are being blinded and programmed by their handlers. How the perception is being shaped by the elite through mediums like movies. So he is also in a sense shutting his eye, or his eye that is his cameras eye.  His movie then becomes within his minds eye, in his experience, autobiographical, like you would recall a memory. And  Autobiographical and prophetic also in that his eyes are wide Shut, meaning he is dead. Maybe he knew he would be killed for doing the film.

       And you are right, I am sure he had more in store for that film than the final edit showed.

       You're creating a false narrative. The people dedicated to this investigation openly accept that dead ends and disinfo exists and try our best to discern between those things and productive truth.  This isn't a joke. If these accusations are true, children are being bought and sold every day.

       Really? You as much said it in your article. Saturn. Satan. Baal. Whatever, Moloch. Take your pick. It's not that hard to discern they actually idolize the symbol of Saturn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eliphas Levi, a Jewish Kabbalist, was the one who created the famous Baphomet, which you quoted myself in your article. Make this connection and you have it. I'm not an anti Semite, but Jews run Hollywood and music and it's how they worship their idol through that medium. Why do you think satanism is even a thing? Most Satanists themselves don't even know it's a Jewish propagation.

       You might want to rethink confirmation bias as it's a trap. I'm not even disagreeing with you. Cognitive dissonance. Choose a belief man, I really don't mind.
