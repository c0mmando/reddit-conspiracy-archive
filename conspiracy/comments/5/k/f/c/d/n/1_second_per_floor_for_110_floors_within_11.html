<p>Actually I did respond directly to that point a couple days ago. You had no reply for me in that thread (<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jqrlb/1_second_per_floor_for_110_floors_within_11/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jqrlb/1_second_per_floor_for_110_floors_within_11/</a>), but here you are creating a brand new thread with the exact same flawed argument and declaring victory. Here, I&#39;ll post the same reply I did in your previous post. </p>

<p><em>As far as your &quot;equal and opposite&quot; argument, explain how it applies to the tower collapses. I&#39;ll help you along.</em></p>

<p><em>The energy required for the falling section to collapse a single floor of the tower acts in an &quot;equal and opposite&quot; direction on the falling section by slowing it down slightly. Once that floor breaks free, it joins the falling section, making it even heavier. The falling section also gains even more energy and velocity than it had when it falls through the open areas between floors. Remember, the volume of the buildings were nearly 90 percent air, offering nothing at all to slow the falling sections down.</em></p>

<p><em>By the time the collapse has progressed through the first 10 intact floors, it has gained 25 thousand tons of extra mass and is moving faster than it was when it started. If the first intact floor couldn&#39;t stop 72 thousand tons moving at 19mph, what chance chance does the tenth intact floor have at stopping 100 thousand tons moving at 40 or 50mph? What chance does the 20th intact floor have at stopping 125 thousand tons moving at 60mph?</em></p>

<p><em>If the first floor can&#39;t stop the falling mass, none of the ones below can either.</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so...lets just run through the math for a second. Carbon steel (the stuff used to make skyscrapers) loses up to 90% of its structural integrity at only 50% of its melting point. That would mean that the steel would need to be 755 degrees F (1510/2) in order to bend and  collapse. Standard US jet fuel burns at a minimum of 800 degrees F, meaning it could very well cause the steel to become malleable. Also, <strong>the building was hit by a fucking plane</strong>, which puts more stress on the few remaining in tact beams. </p>

<p>In regards to newtons 3rd law, yes it was met with an equal and opposite reaction force, meaning the stationary floor exerted the same amount of force on the falling floor as the falling floor did on the stationary. Though this may be true, that does not mean that the supports were able to withstand this extreme force being pushed down upon them. The weight of the falling mass easily overcame the force being exerted and then crumpled as it exceeded the amount of newtons of force it could handle. Remember, F=MA, though the mass stays the same, the force which is exerted is multiplied by 10. Couple that with weak steel due to the compromise due to heat, you get a collapsed building. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, and it can be easily asserted that when heating steel to like 800 degrees F it vaporizes into tiny bits too. It then also proceeds to heat itself up to 2800 degrees F and stay like this for days/weeks. Oh and gets V-cuts as well....case closed.......sigh....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it collapsed several floors at once with the crumbling happening internally of which you didn&#39;t even see until it was already working inwards. The collapsing also speeds up as it gains more weight which lowers more resistance. That speed slows back down again near the bottom due to the rubble acting as a brake/cushion.</p>
