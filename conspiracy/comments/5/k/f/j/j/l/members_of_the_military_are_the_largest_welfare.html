    <div class="md"><p>We defend ourselves from invasion every single day by simply having a military. It&#39;s called deterrence. Do you think that if we didn&#39;t have a military, other nations would just let us be? That didn&#39;t work out so good for the Indians, and they had a &quot;military&quot; (kind of). </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that I agreed with every application of military force. These concerns should be directed at the people in charge of giving the orders though, not the members themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard this silly argument before.  These people put their lives at risk, earn less than minimum wage when you take their 24/7 schedule into consideration.  Yes they get pensions if in for 20 years but again, lots of sacrifice following the country&#39;s orders.  Has to be some reward.</p>

<p>As said earlier by smut, welfare usually infers get something for nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to try really hard here to not get very very angry. (Or break rule #4/#10)</p>

<p>If you would rather deploy to a third world country, spend months if not years away from your family, see atrocities that you cannot even fathom for a paycheck instead of whatever you do now, then you go right ahead. But don&#39;t you <strong>dare</strong> confuse service men/women with welfare abusers. </p>

<p>There are people giving their lives (literally) to defend <strong>your</strong> right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. They don&#39;t always get to share in that themselves.</p>

<p>Until you have spent a day in the life of a soldier, sailor, airman, or marine, you have absolutely <strong>no grounds</strong> to pretend that you have any idea what their lives are like. Calling members of the military welfare abusers is literally about the most liberal nonsense bullshit suggestion I have ever seen on this forum.</p>

<p>So I say to you instead, &quot;You&#39;re welcome&quot;. Let me know if you ever want to switch careers...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mercenary:  a professional soldier hired to work in a foreign army</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a mercenary. I have skin in the game. If we lose a war and my country is taken over, I lose everything...  Mercenaries just go home when the war is done. Take their money, and split. </p>

<p>I guess it could be argued that in some capacities we are &quot;mercenaries&quot;. For instance, if our leadership has given us an order to invade a foreign land that we didn&#39;t agree with. At that point though, it&#39;s a moral obligation to chose the right side. If you chose to ignore your moral compass at this point, I suppose you would be a mercenary.</p>

<p>I will agree with you there are some &quot;mercenary&quot; like individuals in the military, but from my own experience, they are few and far between. Most are profoundly patriotic, and only want to be a part of something bigger than themselves. They want to be proud of their country.</p>

<p>This is the polar opposite of a welfare abuser however. They sit on the couch and don&#39;t give a damn about anyone but themselves. Collecting on the labors of the people around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re working for the Corporation that is the United States. You may have swore to defend the constitution but you&#39;re a mercenary to a chartered corporation through the tri-sovereign states. APAIC owns congress. You aren&#39;t defending shit homie. You&#39;re killing people for $. Just because you&#39;re ignorant you&#39;re on the wrong side, doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re defending rather than invading. You should have done your research on the US gov before signing up and if you were a real patriot joined a militia instead.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a welfare abuser. </p>

<p>The state owns the rights to your name in capitals. It&#39;s makes millions of dollars per individual through humanitarian funding through the IMF. We are the beneficiary of that money that has been squandered and pissed up the wall by politicians and their corporate cronies for decades. If they want to abstain from the rat race for their poverty stipend then so be it. Don&#39;t believe the politician&#39;s rhetoric that they&#39;re a drain on the economy meanwhile they whisk away trillions into black budget ops and crony capitalism. There&#39;s more than enough for everyone.</p>
