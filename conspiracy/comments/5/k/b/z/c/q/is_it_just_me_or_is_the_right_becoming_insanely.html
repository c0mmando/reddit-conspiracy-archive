       Since this whole UN vote, the outpouring from the American right in support of Israel has been overwhelming. They truly want to see more and more settlements.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the advent of Trump, he brought in some of the more anti-Israel voices on the right, even though Trump himself has claimed that he will be the best friend Israel has ever had.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't leading anywhere good. There may be some serious NWO ushering in the next few years and Israel will certainly by a flashpoint with all of it's occult and religious significance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure this post will go over well here, seems like this sub is kind of dominated by those who identify with the right these days, but I'm sad to say that most of you are being fooled the same way you think those on the left are. Two wings, one bird.

       It's bc the Christians think God will release his wrath upon nations who divide Israel. So they are protecting Israel so America doesn't get cursed.

       This is absolutely correct. Support of Israel is very common among dispensationalists (John Hagee, for example) for this very reason.
      </p>

       They just don't realize that the Israel of the book of Revelation is not necessarily the same as the current state of Israel.

       I don't want to fuck the citizens of Israel any more than I would any other country. With that being said:

       I work for a tv-evangelist watching, Bill Oreilly book buying, Texan Right-wing Crusader and she has been a huge Zionism supporter for years. A big part of her religious-influenced political beliefs center around end-time prophecy, so in her mind Israel and the Jews are Gods chosen people to wage the holy war for their rightful land/temple/etc. It's so fucking scary - it is literally the same mindset that leads Islamists towards Jihad.

       They keep trying to foist Israel propaganda over on t_d. It surprisingly doesn't get very far usually.

       That said, the religious right is traditionally pants down or on knees mouth open for anything Israel peddles. So, current events aren't super surprising.

       Question for understanding, not to be a jerk: Who cares about Israel and why? IMO the average American on the street couldn't name two cities in Israel, or probably even point it out on a map (assuming they don't attend church). What is the endgame here? That's what I want to know. What is the purpose of Zionism?

       The end game is to turn a bunch of Christian idiots into ground troops to do Israel's bidding. Zionism as a blanket term simply means the right of Israel to exist. The funny part is, it shouldn't. They lost and because mean old Hitler fucked the Jews over, the rest of the world owed it to the Jewish people to resettle modern day Israel.

       Israel was supposed to be rebuilt by God(according to Judaic scripture), not by backroom dealings like the 1933 Transfer Agreement and the Balfour Declaration.

       t_d is weird in this regard, they seem very pro-Israel which doesn't fit with how that sub is for the most part. Israel has done huge harm to the US over the years, seems odd for a sub like t_d that is America first is also pro one of the biggest parasites on America.

       This is refreshing. In the last year or so I have gotten less ignorant and learned the true difference between a Jew and actual Zionism. Zionists are the elite and control the highest political and financial institutions which is a fact.(easy for people to call it a conspiracy though because they are idiots) In no way, shape or form is Zionism our friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do NOT need Israel because they are a great geopolitical friend in the middle East for us. How the fuck have we benefited? As Ron Paul points out it has actually hurt us because we are only involved in the middle easy because we have powerful Zionists in this country who make that decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah sure I guess we benefit slightly as Israel is seen as a beacon of democracy in the Middle East. How exactly does that help spread democracy to other countries around them? It's laughable for these Zion lovers who argue that we such Israeli cock because they are our great ally in the ME and help us so much strategically!

       I think the idea with Trump is that radical Islam presents an existential threat to Western society, and values. Many of his supporters feel that way, and cite evidence of what's happening in Europe as an example. I personally am on the fence since the issue is new to me, but I have seen some very scary things that the US media just doesn't cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is a militaristically and economically powerful force in the region, a location that acts as a bulwark against extremism. Yes, Israel is itself rather extremist. But, since the perception is that radical Islam is an existential threat, we need them as allies in this secret war. Secret only because it isn't covered fully in the media.

       I'm no fan of Israel at all, but this logic train makes sense. Establishment Republicans (McConnell, Romney, etc.) like Israel for religious reasons, I think. But Trump isn't religious. He just wants to protect the world from real underground terrorism like we see in Berlin, et al. Russia is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the enemy, though we're told it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, there's way more to this, and I don't know how much I agree with yet, because I need to do more research. But this is the general idea.

       However what you are saying is that people can't hold two ideas at the same time.

       I do not like what is happening in Europe, the immigration issue is very real and very worrying. Merkel has a lot to answer for, the only positive is that issue might break up the EU.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I do not like Israel and how they conduct themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       These issues are not related as closely as some wish to make out. The answer to mass Muslim immigration causing huge problems for Europe is not genocide of the Palestinians and forming greater Israel. Only the Israeli shills try and conflate the two.

       I agree with you that it's quite difficult for most people to hold two ideas in their heads at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing what I do of Israel (and for whom I am definitely not a shill) the terms of their friendship seem to be free reign to do what they want with Palestine. I have no fucking idea why and I think it's terrible. I've written about it publicly, in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       But given the current Israeli leadership, that's what they want, for reasons that are only clear to them. The line of almost all American presidents seems to be turn a blind eye to Palestine if you want an alliance with Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, we agree. Especially because so much of the violence against Palestine fuels Muslim hatred of the US and Europe. But I think it's a hard sell for the Chief Bureaucrat of the Military Industrial Complex to really care enough to break the alliance over a small patch of land that our #1 customer demands authority over.

       Palestinian terrorists are not committing terrorist acts in the name of Radical Islam, they are resisting an occupying force and just happen to be Muslim at the same time. They are not trying to justify their actions using Islam. The pro-Israel lobby and shills have been trying to conflate Palestinian terror attacks with radical Islam for a while now, and have clearly been succeeding. The_Donald was the perfect place to cement the connection in the minds of people. There is a huge difference between the two though.

       Oh I know that. I'm not talking about Radical Islam in Palestine. I'm talking about ISIS and other homegrown groups, etc. Although yes, I think in most Americans' minds ISIS and HAMAS are pretty close to the same thing. I don't personally recall propaganda to that fact, but I'm sure it's there.

       I'm happy to see that you know there is a difference. But basically, you believe that we should leave Israel alone, turn a blind eye, and let them be extremists to the Palestinians, let them continue doing what they do, all because we need them in the secret war against Radical Islam. Trump just wants to protect the world, except for those Palestinians, he doesn't need to protect them. Am I getting that right?

       Whoa there, I said in my original post I'm not sure how I feel about this situation. I don't have enough info to have formed an opinion on anything beyond my already publicly-stated views that the Israeli treatment of Palestinians is unacceptable. I'm merely articulating what I understand as Trump and his supporters' position on Israel. So point them guns somewhere else!
      </p>
      <p>
       But one correction, Trump is primarily trying to save the
       <em>
        Western
       </em>
       world, as in Europe and the United States. Not the whole world. If you asked him and his supporters if they felt ok with Palestine being the sacrifice to push back on the spread of Radical Islam through the West, I'm quite sure he and they wouldn't have a problem with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's a more important question for you: if you discovered conclusively that Radical Islam is a real and present existential threat to the West, and that Israel is an indispensable ally to stopping it, and Israel says Palestine is what they want in exchange, and knowing that making decisions in war requires sacrifice, what would YOU do?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea. But, the job of a president is to protect his (or her) people first and foremost. Not anyone else's. So I can understand the logic. And that's why I'm glad I'm not president. And nor did I vote for Trump.

       I was raised Southern Baptist. It was branded in our brain how important a literal state of Israel is.
I think I can confidently say that most "church-going" Christians are preached a similar importance.
most of said Christians have mainly aligned with the right since the Earl Warren Warren Burger Activism rulings(roe v wade, prayer in schools, etc) in the 60s-70s.

       Saw this coming years ago, these developments are merely the proof of that. Remember the fake ISIS training camp in Mexico BS and the related fake ISIS threat video at the same time? hint hint hint....

       Remember the now entirely flushed Bush video admitting that they focus on people that you can fool all the time?

      <p>
       I've told several times already that most of the "alt" media will never be flushed from the web or be censored in any way (even if they claim they are being attacked by the governments) because their audiences are so very easily co-opted. Why on Earth would they throw these spoils of war in the bin?

       The Republicans have been hardcore pro-Israel for decades. Their support for Israel has been downplayed in the media over the last eight years because of the Obama White House, but it never went away. I can understand why people new to politics or new to the right might be confused by the sudden loud pro-Israel support, though.

       Sadly the thing is the people who live there are used as pieces on a chessboard. America and it's owners are funding and arming radical jihadis to stir up shit while at the same time arming the israelis. It's all business to them and it makes sense since the american dollar is backed only by the military industrial complex at this point.

       What, you thought that Donald Trump supporters are immune to being used as pawns to promote an agenda? Why do you think a candidate preaching the mass exportation of traditional Palestinians won the US election? It wasn't just meme magic.

       Just who do you think
       <em>
        IS
       </em>
       the New World Order?  I will say, it is highly unusual that the US would abstain from that vote.  It doesn't make any sense, but then again, nothing that's been going on lately makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two factions of elites battling it out.  The ones behind Trump and Putin have basically taken off the gloves with all this talk of nuclear knife sharpening.  The abstention is a big FU to them and Israel, and I am sure the ones behind Obama/Clinton, et. al. are freaking out.  The nuclear powers are doing a lot of saber rattling, but they all have to know such talk is destabilizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the "fake news" story that prompted a twitter feud between Israel and Pakistan.  Not to mention Trump using Twitter to conduct our own nuclear policy.  WW3 is going to get started with a tweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some next level shit going on with the string pullers of our little world.  Unfortunately for the rest of us, it is going to lead to interesting and bloody times ahead.  And you thought 2016 sucked...

       Neoliberals and NWO are one and the same, they just finally revealed themselves.  The most powerful nationalists in many places, which includes Zionists, have finally had enough and so are in rebellion from the global order.  Now the globalists are reacting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that Saudis are in bed with Clintons, and neolibs tried to blow up Syria to control that pipeline plan...These were likely the original perps of 9/11.  Clinton is a Rockefeller lackey and WTC was a Rockefeller building...
      </p>
      <p>
       So Clintons and Bushes were both the outward NWO perps/cover agents of 9/11...

       It's called hedging your bet. I believe the pro israel stuff comes mainly from those who read the bible(ive read but cant join the camp) It's the definition of religion shaping the world. I DO believe that little spit of property is holy, but land does not control or manipulate masses. People do. But the "faithful" have a hard time separating the two. Like cheering for the Browns after thier 47th straight loss. Tangent. Biblical Israel in not Geopolitical 31.0461° N, 34.8516° E Isreal. The two haven't spoken in a long time. Have faith, not politics fellas.

       The religious Christian right has almost always been pro-Israel. Not sure why you think that this is something new.
      </p>
      <p>
       The old school secular right, even if not religious, is often pro-Israel in that they see Israel as a bulwark against Islamic shenanigans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you get into a lot of variation with so-called "alt-right" and libertarians, many of whom believe that Israel is up to no good, to varying degrees, and they may disagree on what sort of shady stuff Israel is up to.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are just noticing all of this because Israel is attempting to ally itself with the Trump administration after basically 8 years of being shunned by the Obama administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm torn on Israel myself. I'm not religious so I don't believe that they are the chosen people or that they are entitled to their promise land.  On the other hand I don't like radical Islamists taking over the ME and I am pretty much okay with whatever Israel is going to do to cause them trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said Israel is a successful first-world country and I see no reason at all why the US should be giving them billions of dollars in "aid" annually.

       RElig. Christian right &amp; pro-Israel: those numbers are dwindling. Christians are figuring out that a state made up of citizens that deny Jesus Christ as the Messiah, the individuals who watch televangelist-style TV are about the only ones who buy into the lie that the Israelis are "God's chosen". I like to ask them where in Scripture does it state that those who deny the Christ are given salvation.. ? But, I think I know where the OP is going, and I disagree with the whole idea that "Israel is running the US" because they're not. It's more of the other way round. If Israel had it's way, do you think we'd have thousands of Muslim refugees coming in?? Not counting the one or two rabbis who are pro-refugee.

       I'm a moderate whose been redpilled into a centipede of late. My heart goes out to the Palestinian people. Building settlements is not okay. I've seen the Bet'selem videos on the situation in Palestinian cities like Hebron, and it breaks my heart for the people who try to live there. There's no way I can be okay with that.

       Well everyone that plays the old partisan politics game has to pick one side to be on... It's either pro-Israel or pro-Palestine... gotta choose one. Israel is an easier sell...

       LOL that's funny, fyi they were moved to the Occupied Territories and given more Palestinian lands.  Note that only Palestinians are placed in refugee camps, while only Jews are given govt-subsidised land belonging to the Palestinians. We have a phrase for that: ethnic cleansing. The Israelis prefer "transfer".

       Not even the most moderate Palestinian leader would have accepted a long-term arrangement in which Israel withdrew its settlers from Gaza while maintaining control of the Strip’s borders and deepening Israeli control of the West Bank. (Even in the 2005, the year Sharon withdrew from Gaza, the overall settler population rose, in part because some Gazan settlers relocated to the West Bank).

       I think your problem is, not that they are Israeli citizens, but the fact they are Jewish. This is the real issue. Your hypocrisy is outstanding. Thanks for proving you are a bigot and a racist.

       FYI the settlers are Jewish. That's not my fault. I don't think all Jews -- or even the majority of Jews -- agree with any of Israel's policies and frankly they resent Israel or Netanyahu trying to speak for them.

       Gaza has a population density matching Hong Kong, and out of the 1.8 million people there 1.5 million are Palestinian refugees who lost their lands and homes to Israel.

       However what you are saying is that people can't hold two ideas at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not like what is happening in Europe, the immigration issue is very real and very worrying. Merkel has a lot to answer for, the only positive is that issue might break up the EU.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I do not like Israel and how they conduct themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       These issues are not related as closely as some wish to make out. The answer to mass Muslim immigration causing huge problems for Europe is not genocide of the Palestinians and forming greater Israel. Only the Israeli shills try and conflate the two.

       Palestinian terrorists are not committing terrorist acts in the name of Radical Islam, they are resisting an occupying force and just happen to be Muslim at the same time. They are not trying to justify their actions using Islam. The pro-Israel lobby and shills have been trying to conflate Palestinian terror attacks with radical Islam for a while now, and have clearly been succeeding. The_Donald was the perfect place to cement the connection in the minds of people. There is a huge difference between the two though.
