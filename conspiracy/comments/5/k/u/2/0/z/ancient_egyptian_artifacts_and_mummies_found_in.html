       Something that might corroborate this apparent finding, includes the discovery of residues of continental American plant products on Egyptian mummies (specifically, cocaine and tobacco). See:

       So, was pre-Colombus oceanic crossing a thing, and if so, is the Smithsonian Institute guilty of covering up this and other 'difficult to explain' parts of our history?

       There is also a theory the Nazca lines were for hot air balloons. But what came first, the balloon, or the the miles long lines and images?

       Some things in our world don't really fit. That is because they don't come from here. Crop circles are images that appear from nowhere. The real ones, and you can tell the real ones. The complex other worldly symbols, with the crops perfectly snapped at the base. Almost imprinted onto the surface of the Earth.

       Not all crop circles are the same. Some have had soil and plant samples taken to a lab and analyzed and show evidence of high intensity heat that causes the plants to lay over on their sides as opposed to bent, the nodules on the stems are blown out and the plants themselves have been changed from the energy used. The soil has tiny micro-spheres of Iron.
      </p>
      <p>
       The circles themselves have high levels of magnetic energy that drains batteries and fucks with meters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely the majority of the circles are man made but there are some with scientific evidence to support them.

       Here's an article on a few studies published. This one hypothesized that balls of light created the circles but that's just a theory to support the scientific evidence. In actuality, they can't explain their findings.

       if he did then why? Or what is it a Symbol of? Many of these crop circles are not symbols found in mans religions or sacred geometries. They are different. The meaning is just as important as how they appear.

       I'm guessing that is a symbol for magnetism or perhaps a soundwave although I've seen others that aren't as intricate. I just recently got into Sacred Geometry and I'm sure if you sent this to someone like Randall Carlson, he could give you more info on it.

       I have something for you, I was over in another thread about Antarctica and I think I figured out the whole pyramid energy grid connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       It first started when the op had noticed geometric structures in Antarctica and posted them, another person mentioned another video Tellinger did about the ancient geometrical ruins dotted all over Africa. In that presentation by tellinger he did magnetic resonance tests at the structures and found that inside the structure there was no reading and outside there was.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then it hit me, about something Seth, as channeled by Jane Roberts back in the 60's had once said. He described coordination points all over our world that were both energetic producers and amplifiers, and that the major ones were dimensional portals. And he said that you can tell you had found one, because the gravity will be different from the surrounding areas!
      </p>
      <p>
       So holy shit, do you want to see something right up your alley man? Since you are getting into sacred Geometry..check this out:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then come back and tell me what you think about the pyramids and their purpose, and even how they were built.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how crop circles can just appear in these amazing geometrical patterns.

       Well I wouldn't be so sure about crop circles. According to the only guy ever convicted of making them, they are all man made. Matthew Williams points out the fingerprints (or footprints) of man in almost everyone. And the more people insist they are not the more he laughs. Hoaxing is what they like to do. He has used torches and lighters to make the "heat signatures" and left bits of illuminated clocks to trigger Geiger counters.

       Yes they have all the reason in the world to cover stuff like this up.  If anything else gets leaked it wont be long till everyone puts 2 and 2 together regarding advanced ancient tech.  The fact that we dont have the means to recreate structures like the pyramids found all over the globe should be evidence enough.

       How people fail to see this simple explanation is beyond me.

       They are clearly symbols of authority and power. Why they also have to be mythical gold producing particle energy machines is beyond me. Arenât they already spectacular enough, lol.

       Its not so much that people haven't heard this explanation, rather there seems to be more going on in the pyramid than just it acting as a symbol. Besides the incredible precision required to build (The ratio of its circumference to its original height is equal to the value of pi, its base is at I:43,200 which is a mathematical representation of the northern hemisphere), there are all sorts chambers (2 were just recently discovered) that point towards specific constellations like Orion's belt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't claim to know exactly what purposes these chambers served (though reading about the possibilities is pretty interesting if you ever  have the curiosity) but I do definitely think it's worth continued investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you say, they are already spectacular enough, but that doesn't mean they can't be even more spectacular.

       i Agree the pyramids &lt; there is more going on there as just a simple temple.
       <br/>
       Or at least they did some strange shit in there.
       <br/>
       I was more talking about it in general * not specific *
       <br/>
       If the pyramids where more then just a temple i then do not think it was the Egyptians that made it.
       <br/>
       I am almost 100% sure there was a advanced civilisation way way in the past.
       <br/>
       That almost  got wiped out ( or was wiped out ).
       <br/>
       Reason for this is strange old tech way to advanced for its time / knowledge  keeps popping up randomly all over the place.

       Source? Let me start by saying I love all pyramids, big ones, tiny ones, new and old. I love the mystery, the history, the aesthetic beauty of them etc, so when I see a comment that might have some sweet new info on these badasses I'd like to know more!
      </p>
      <p>
       But... I'm calling bullshit on your statement... We don't need more people spreading misinformation, especially on a sub that is largely about finding the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets start with the fact that culturally they are very different and due to this were not designed for the same purposes at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       -American Pyramids usually have a temple on top (there are some that were not ment to be climbed) used like most cultures for some sun worshiping, or other gods they want to be closer with, so having a temple at the top would help get you there).
      </p>
      <p>
       -The Egyptian Pyramids were mainly used as a tombs (big afterlife culture). These Served vastly different purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The American pyramids were built with dirt and stone.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        American pyramids were generally built of earth and then faced with stone, typically in a stepped, or layered, shape topped by a platform or temple structure.
You can find similar pyramids to these (construction, cultural design) all around the world!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -Due to the wildly different landscapes (there is lots of sand in Egypt) means the Egyptians couldn't have used the same dirt piling, rock laying techniques as the American Pyramids. So instead they used huge Limestone blocks, (we're talking like 50 ton rocks) that were moved using a little know, big ass river called the Nile. (They liked to use the river for everything).
      </p>
      <p>
       -One of the leading/best theories on how they got the rocks (stones/chunks/boulders?) up the pyramids was by transporting the stones by  strapping floatation devices (logs) to them, and using damns to float the stones up into place.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more, like the arguably more advanced ones (Egyptian) were build thousands of years before the North American ones. Or how they had different tools, different stone gathering technique and different transportation modes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any ways... That is my rant. I 100% don't beleive your statement that "The pyramids in North America were built the same way as the Great Pyramids."
      </p>
      <p>
       You could say The North American Pyramids were built the same way as many others around the world. But as soon as you clump the GREAT Pyramids of Egypt into that statement you become very wrong.

       Basic design as in a triangle? Then yes. But they were designed differently in many ways. One has hidden chambers and is mostly solid (Egypt).
      </p>
      <p>
       The others (Mexico, Indonesia etc) have temples ontop, more hollower out and even areas for people to come together and pray.

       As for the Pyramids in Egypt's size, they are the largest. The tallest is the pyramid of Khufu it was 146.7 m (481.4 ft) high when completed around 4,500 years ago, but erosion and vandalism have reduced its height to 137.5 m (451.4 ft) high today.
       <a href="http://www.touropia.com/largest-pyramids-in-the-world/">
        It also has the largest volume

       This is according to the

       Thanks, was going to say the same. And the floating blocks thing? How do you get the stones above the flood plain? Or to the Nile from the quarry? Some of the stones used in Egypt were bigger and heavier than one of their ships could handle... And specifically those giant black boxes with lids that weigh over a ton which were found underground. So how do you damn up the Nile to make the pyramids when underground there is stuff also? There are many underground man-made tunnels all around the pyramids. And you would be flooding the sphinx, all the people homes around the Nile. And there is really no physical evidence to support this damn and float idea.

       These are ALL GREAT!  For me personally, one of the things that is really perplexing, if it were JUST a tomb... why were all the different types of blocks (sourced from hundreds of miles away), used to build the walls/inner sarcafagi, instead of using the same block?   (When i say sarcafagi, it wasn't even that, because it had no lid, and had no mummy inside it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Resonant frequency tests have been done and they come up with successful resonating tones.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramids had WAY TO MUCH precision put IN TO them, for just tombs. We can't even match it today!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, isn't it a mysterious fact that the egyptians made notes/written records of everything they set out to do / accomplished, and yet, no notes/sketches/mentions were found of the pyramids being built?
      </p>
      <p>
       Layers/levels of salt residue doesn't match the inside residue found on the walls/ceiling of some of the lower rooms, though salt residue and water erosion was found on the outside of the pyramids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay on your path :)

       Thanks, do you have any impressions on what that block with the chip in it was used for?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am pretty much starting to think they have no writing because they predate our type of symbolic language. In other words the pyramid itself is The Language. If they had the ability to manipulate these huge stones then they probably would use them as the building blocks of an alphabet, sort of like how we manipulate a keyboard to make words.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a language of geometry and energy we have to decipher. So many things to understand but the box in the kings chamber is puzzling and seems so key to understanding the first letter of that alphabet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though let's strip it of its labels. It's not a kings chamber. Or queens chamber, or subterranean path to the underworld in the basement. Let's remove those labels and maybe it will make more sense...let's think outside the box about before written laungauge and kings and queens. And instead energy and shape.

       Some think it was purposefully done, others think it was the result of some type explosion. There was an interesting theory the pyramid worked as a hydraulic pump that created a charge. And that box was somehow just a function of that process. I tend to lean towards that.

       Ok, I can see the pump thing. But, what was it pumping? Chemicals, which were creating electricity? Or water, and it was a generator?
      </p>
      <p>
       i can't imagine moving parts within that pyramid. everything was made to last centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       one idea is that the pyramids were built BEFORE the asteroid hit the earth and changed the axis tilt. before the tilt was changed, these pyramids were using the resonant frequency/natural earth vibration, to create electricity (with chemical help, which created the black residue).  once the asteroid hit, it "destroyed paradise", and these pyramids were shook out of sync, as the resonating frequency changed, and power stopped running.
      </p>
      <p>
       a theory that rests on this one, is the leigh lines / power lines / power grid that criss crossed earth, and helped provide power to all parts of the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       regardless of what the theory is that ends up being correct, it is really great people exist that have an open mind. thats for sure.

       Thanks for the kind words.

       It's funny, the thing about gold... it's like humans in any part of the world are DRAWN to it... you notice that to right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I read the evidence/stories, of the annunaki making humans in to living tools/slaves, to mine the gold that they supposedly used to fix their home planets atmosphere...
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposedly, geologists that do surveys concerning a planet and its percentage of minerals/rare metals/etc have come up with the weird 'fact' that earth is missing a substantial amount of gold...  strange huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramid DID used to have a gold cap stone right? that's missing now... it may have been the key to the pyramid working properly.

       Starting to, more and more I am seeing synch's with what we are discussing. Think of all the movies and shows with energy portals they are trying to open or close. How many of them even use ancient symbolism. It's like the elephant in the room of the motion picture companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been talking to a lot of people the last few days so I'm getting a lot of other feedback on that. One cool one was the Ghostbusters. The top of the building being the portal where this evil energy is coming through and growing in the form of a stay-puft marshmallow man. Comedy, but embedded in that is this sub conscious knowledge about energy portals and the energy grid and how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm sure I can just flip through the channels and find at least one show with ancient knowledge transformed into a plot line or scene, only we just completely don't make the connection, it's still myth to us.

       So the theory I believe in, at the moment, as no other theory has as much physical proof, is the theory that the pyramids were power plants, the 2 smaller ones vibrated at a frequency that would kick start the largest one.
      </p>
      <p>
       the largest one has multiple chambers with residue on the walls/ceiling, that is similar residue to what we find today, in a power plant that has a chemical reaction happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       look in to the Giza Powerplant.
      </p>
      <p>
       It explains why specific stones were sourced and used, as they have the appropriate resonating frequency, that took the vibrations of the earth, and transmitted them into the blocks, and through the chemical process, created electricity.
      </p>
      <p>
       theres even one pyramid that contains 2 odd, thick, copper cables, that come out of the pyramid, like two power lines!

       Yea I like where you are going. To think like main stream archaeology that they had no knowledge of electricity would be a waste of time for us. Most the tombs show no sign of burns from torches. Think about how deep and enclosed these spaces are and no signs of fire being used and they have this superb knowledge of rock.

       Another thing, have you seen vids of people hooking up a speaker to a wire which is connected to a metal cylinder? Depending on the frequency the cylinder will cut through the densest rock. Leaving a perfect hole like you see in some of the ancient stone.  They could cut them with softer metals because they vibrated them somehow at a very high speed for a long time slowly etching out the rock.

       To be clear, I love Pyramid talk! Love learning new things about them. Since you didn't really give a reason as to why you think they were not used a tombs, I'll assume you are going with the grainery theory.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        None of the Egyptian pyramids were ever used as tombs... Are you spreading disinfo?  No mummy found in a pyramid.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh the grain theory! Altho not as mysterious as tombs, it is a bit popular (I've never understood why), but sadly its wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       -According to evidence and archaeologists the Pyramids were used as tombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Archaeologists have found funerary text inscriptionsÂ inside chambers, which serve the sole purpose of instructing the dead Pharaoh's soul how to cross over to the afterworld.
      </p>
      <p>
       -We've found burial equipment, such as sarcophagi, jewellery, and writings. (Most were robbed, or in a few cases the burial chambers are below the water table destroying evidence... Damn river).
      </p>
      <p>
       -The Egyptians already had graineries, they were dome structures that were hollow (so they could hold more grains).
      </p>
      <p>
       -Pyramids are not hollow. They have passages and rooms, but they are very solid objects.
      </p>
      <p>
       -All Egyptian pyramids were built on the west bank of the Nile, which, as the site of the setting sun, was associated with the realm of the dead in Egyptian mythology.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Pyramids were mainly built during the middle kingdom and old kingdom of Egypt. (That's long ago).
      </p>
      <p>
       -The mummies we have discovered of have been found in the Valley of Kings, (some tombs on that valley have over 100+ rooms!). These tombs were constructed during the New Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, Pyramids have been standing for thousands of years. The Old KingdomÂ in the 27th century BC, the beginning of the Middle KingdomÂ in the 21st century BC and the beginning of the New KingdomÂ in the mid-16th century BC. We are in the 21st century AD. That's a long ass time in-between us and a buried mummy.
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is 1 Indiana Jones, 1 robbery, 1 jealous Pharaoh, 1 bandit, 1 invading army, 1 water table rising up and the ancient evidence is destroyed. Its actually widely believed that at one point in their lives, each pyramid has been gutted/robbed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know they were used for Pharos burial rituals. Some think they were "resurrection" machines, some say they were intended to shoot the Pharaoh's soul off to the stars/gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't really know the full answers. But we do know "why" and that's for the dead Pharaoh's.

       if anything I think it proves that the pyramids are alot older than we think.

       I'm working on a theory the pyramids are at least 20000 years old. And that the pyramid builders left the planet. What comes after they leave, this is when all of our myths and legends begin. Thousands of years later after the builders leave then the Egyptians begin.
 They are a culture that began after the structures were there. Some of the pyramid builders stayed though. And spoke the remembrance to the new culture. That was Thoth. The Egyptians ancient God of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our history though goes back not in years but in epochs. There have been civilisations long forgotten, they fade out they are so old. But some fade, others advance enough to leave the planet. We are getting to that point. But prior ancient civilisations could of also done the same.

       The pyramids were not a sole venture. And mummies aren't either.
      </p>
      <p>
       They still unearth mummies in the sand, perfectly preserved, but not just in Egypt, but in the Americas. And the mummies are mummified in their own traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in our past, all over the world, not just Egypt , pyramids start popping up everywhere. We now know that .. even in Antarctica, in the states, in Russia, in Japan, more and more of them are still being discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what we are seeing here is a collective. In our past, man's collective contained some remembrance of how to manipulate weight. And they also knew the geometry of the pyramid was a powerful energy reservoir. For what ever reason. This is what we don't know. But we do know now the pyramids were a worldwide event.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are most likely a temple, but temples to what? The cosmos? Do they go through all of that just to line up to stars? Probably yes and no. We know they line up to an energy grid of the Earth. They are in specific locations. I have no doubt Egyptians, Mayans, Africans,European, Oriental, all the pyramid builders interacted between their cultures under a common goal at one point in our past. But they had a technology we just can't quite grasp in our time, so long forgotten, before there was even a language to describe it.

        The pyramids in North America were built the same way as the Great Pyramids.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Source? Let me start by saying I love all pyramids, big ones, tiny ones, new and old. I love the mystery, the history, the aesthetic beauty of them etc, so when I see a comment that might have some sweet new info on these badasses I'd like to know more!
      </p>
      <p>
       But... I'm calling bullshit on your statement... We don't need more people spreading misinformation, especially on a sub that is largely about finding the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets start with the fact that culturally they are very different and due to this were not designed for the same purposes at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       -American Pyramids usually have a temple on top (there are some that were not ment to be climbed) used like most cultures for some sun worshiping, or other gods they want to be closer with, so having a temple at the top would help get you there).
      </p>
      <p>
       -The Egyptian Pyramids were mainly used as a tombs (big afterlife culture). These Served vastly different purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       -The American pyramids were built with dirt and stone.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        American pyramids were generally built of earth and then faced with stone, typically in a stepped, or layered, shape topped by a platform or temple structure.
You can find similar pyramids to these (construction, cultural design) all around the world!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -Due to the wildly different landscapes (there is lots of sand in Egypt) means the Egyptians couldn't have used the same dirt piling, rock laying techniques as the American Pyramids. So instead they used huge Limestone blocks, (we're talking like 50 ton rocks) that were moved using a little know, big ass river called the Nile. (They liked to use the river for everything).
      </p>
      <p>
       -One of the leading/best theories on how they got the rocks (stones/chunks/boulders?) up the pyramids was by transporting the stones by  strapping floatation devices (logs) to them, and using damns to float the stones up into place.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more, like the arguably more advanced ones (Egyptian) were build thousands of years before the North American ones. Or how they had different tools, different stone gathering technique and different transportation modes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any ways... That is my rant. I 100% don't beleive your statement that "The pyramids in North America were built the same way as the Great Pyramids."
      </p>
      <p>
       You could say The North American Pyramids were built the same way as many others around the world. But as soon as you clump the GREAT Pyramids of Egypt into that statement you become very wrong.

       Ok, I can see the pump thing. But, what was it pumping? Chemicals, which were creating electricity? Or water, and it was a generator?
      </p>
      <p>
       i can't imagine moving parts within that pyramid. everything was made to last centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       one idea is that the pyramids were built BEFORE the asteroid hit the earth and changed the axis tilt. before the tilt was changed, these pyramids were using the resonant frequency/natural earth vibration, to create electricity (with chemical help, which created the black residue).  once the asteroid hit, it "destroyed paradise", and these pyramids were shook out of sync, as the resonating frequency changed, and power stopped running.
      </p>
      <p>
       a theory that rests on this one, is the leigh lines / power lines / power grid that criss crossed earth, and helped provide power to all parts of the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       regardless of what the theory is that ends up being correct, it is really great people exist that have an open mind. thats for sure.
