        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now the headlines there are attacking freedom of speech, utilizing sexism to blame sexism for Clintons loss, and generally resorting to pathetic (and outright insane) tactics to delude subscribers into not only believing Clinton  did no wrong, but that those who didn&#39;t vote for her are enemies of intelligence and civil rights.</p>

<p>This no longer &quot;looks&quot; like fascism. This is now fascism.</p>

<p>Speak up on the sub and they uniformly mock, down vote and ban. A Room 101 for the 21st century.</p>

<p>How is this allowed to continue and what can be done to counter this type of hostile takeover of other subs? </p>

<p>Just something to think about because this is the most terrifying lesson of this election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right to a certain extent. But the &quot;experience&quot; of r/politics is convincing them on its own. Like the Socratic method shows, people need to either be LED to their own conclusions--not preached at/to--or grow into these conclusions through their own experience.</p>

<p>r/politics is such a transparent propaganda spot that many are seeing for themselves. Combined with the drip-drip-drip of revelations about so much else, it&#39;s pushing people out and away. </p>

<p>Even the HRC fans are seeing thru the BS by now... only the bots persist... and that &quot;only 1 post every ten minutes&quot; thing is working against them now that they lost their AIs... and only have the upvote sliding left... and even that falters... they used to pull down an easy 25k-30k on the whole top 20... now it is just a couple important ones that get close to that many. </p>

<p>Thank YOU! I have kept my mouth shut the entire time CTR shilled the hell out of that subreddit and personally started speaking out again some of the Clinton shills that troll the articles. </p>

<p>I personally think the sexism card is the most comical out of everything.

    <div class="md"><p>I consider myself a political Liberal/Progressive. I actually just went over to r/politics because I have an honest political question that I&#39;d like to discuss and get input on. But it immediately seemed to me that every single thread title was obviously in favor of the Liberal position. It caused me to immediately doubt that I&#39;d be able to have an honest discussion over there. </p>

<p>I know that in certain subreddits I can count on certain slants, but I had honestly expected that I&#39;d find a diverse range of views on r/politics which, based on its name, would seem to me to be open to a wide range of views and discussion/healthy disagreement. </p>

<p>I have already left the Democrats because of their ideology trumping their integrity. It&#39;s not so hard for me to picture a day when I can&#39;t, in good faith, align myself with any &quot;Progressive&quot; group if that group is as ensconced in groupthink, propaganda, and censorship as the most cartoonish version of &quot;Conservatism&quot; is alleged to be. </p>

<p>To be honest, I think that I am quickly finding myself without a political home as I see each and every group fall prey to hypocrisy and double standards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like Reddit followed the standard StartUp pathway, but cashed out too soon.<br/>
Reddit built a huge following, and basically <em>monetized</em> it during the election this year. They are openly allowing bot posts/upvotes in here (increasing their traffic/value) by not using standard &quot;I am not a bot&quot; tests that can be found everywhere on the internet.  </p>

<p>In order to stop bot upvoting, you first make it <em>difficult</em>, then move towards <em>stopping</em> them entirely ... Sadly, reddit admins/ownership have still done nothing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt that any Reddit employees would have met with anyone related to the Dem campaign. It&#39;s too big a risk when you already have members of the DNC acting as moles to expose their under-handed dealings.  </p>

<p>Much like when the unofficial companies (Super Pac&#39;s with DNC ties) accused Assange of stealing $1million, the shady dealings are handled in person and <em>off the record</em>.  </p>

<p>Based on an <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/52278">old 2008 Podesta email attachment</a> where the attached word file assigns a monetary value to 10 separate news reports about their &quot;McSame press clips&quot; ... I&#39;d guess that if you reworked those metrics on &quot;Est. Households/Views&quot; and &quot;Est. Publicity Value&quot; and adapted them for this site, you&#39;d get a new &quot;Clip Total: $value&quot;.<br/>
And although there is NO PROOF, I would assume that money would end up being <em>transferred</em> to whoever did the service for the DNC. That&#39;s my guess - but you&#39;d probably need to arrange some kind of <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/17/wikileaks-journalists-clinton-staff-homes-before-hillarys-campaign-launch/">&quot;off-the-record&quot; gathering of Journalists and TV news anchors at someone&#39;s home</a> to make it work!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was banned about 9 years ago from that sub for mentioning that Michelle Obama was on the board of directors of the Chicago CFR, and also BofD of Treehouse Foods, Walmart&#39;s biggest supplier of food. I knew then and there that Obama would be president. Was treated like an annoyiance, then banned. I had to abandon that user name. People were calling me a right wing Nazi for proving that Michelle had and still has to this day, a job serving the Rockefellers, and all other major banking concerns, as well as the US&#39;s major farming moguls, as the Chicago CFR is middle America&#39;s group of the wealthiest Americans, conspiring to gain more wealth.  Michelle works for the fascist Nazis, but they were calling ME the fascist anti Dem Nazi for mentioning it. I was a skin head racist for finding information and sharing it, that the Obamas were just CFR shills, working for the bankers. I am assuming things have gotten no better in the last 9 years.</p>

<p>Believe what you want to believe, I saw it firsthand, and it took me awhile to even process it: I never subscribed to the subreddit for Trump, so it was all the weirder for me. </p>

<p>People on the conspiracy subreddit can typically agree that this site has a number of shills, hijackings of posts, all sorts of shady shit going on. But when I dare to mention a bizarre instance, somehow, nah, there&#39;s just no way it could have happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing, I&#39;m not blaming r/politics -- it just seemed like the subreddit had been hacked or in control of someone else temporarily.

It came right around the time of some of the biggest media frenzies regarding Trump and Clinton, so it just felt like I was suddenly in the Twilight Zone. It just to me, confirms the idea that Reddit is a site that is capable of being hijacked for political purposes, possibly.</p>
