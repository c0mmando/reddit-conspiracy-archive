        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So If any of you listened to me; like <a href="/u/Khuddle2310">/u/Khuddle2310</a> Had done you would factually have made 733 - 977; or a profit of 230+usd. </p>

<p>All you had to do was listen to me. So This is an official I told you so. </p>

<p>If you buy in today I&#39;d advice that every profitable endeavor has the consequence of risks because all good things come to an end. </p>

<p>In mid January, near the 20th market trends will likely re level the latest price increase; Meaning that the estimated 1200 price flux will begin to lower again; Leading to a firm 1000 usd holding. From Mid january to june expect drops as low as 950 which will stearily climb up to near 2000 by june 2017. </p>

<p>This will start a new boom in june that will increase until december at the 3300 price estimate for 2017; With potential for a 4500 price increase at that time. </p>

<p>So You are warned; Yet again; GET IT while you still can; Because I don&#39;t like saying I told you so; I am trying to help you all believe it or not; </p>

<p>Again feel free to use my site <a href="http://www.investbitcoin.webs.com">http://www.investbitcoin.webs.com</a>. </p>

<p>You have to press send repeatedly because I am too broke to add bandwidth to the website; You are more than welcome to help me make it more accessible. Bitcoin holders you know what to do with 
this to make that happen; </p>

<p>So to all you that have been listening to me. Congratulations on becoming 240+ richer in the last two weeks. Consider selling a 1/3 your shares in late january to maintain your profits while it peaks and restabilizes. You are warned that near the term of trumps presedential inaugoration that it may decline in price (temporarily, so to maximize profits simply counter it by taking a light step back to combat known market trends. </p>

<p>Again. This has the potential to reach near 4500 by this coming years christmas; With a peak of upwards a million per coin by 2021. I have no doubts about it growing unless current legislaters attack it with law making it illegal to hold. So basically watch the legislation and thus protecting your investments will counter that in its entirety. </p>

<p>So here are the past updates; and when I told you to get in; All on record. Feel free to screen shot them. Nothing has changed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly but the point is to watch the legislaters. Notably trump isn&#39;t going to care. He is all about civic growth. The main thing to watch out for is the laws in india. If bantor says to criminalize it. Dump ahead of the pens in hand. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No your not paying attention. The chatter is flowing in india. They are a huge nation. 1.2 billion; Essentially their current currency dumped. Users there started to take on BTC (because it holds to the usd) this led them to making small profits; So they talked it up.</p>

<p>What we are seeing here is a reflection of their word of mouth. The more the message spreads, the more the currency will hyper inflate. Many will come and go as day traders, but those that stay will certainly be the market leaders and those that stand to make the hugest profits you can imagine...</p>

<p>Essentially:We are watching BTC go from multimillion dollar platfrom to multi billion. Thats why I am posting this in conspiracy; Because essentially. BTC people know this. But they are trying to tell you not to get in on the action. Once india is plugged. A single coin will be worth upto a million dollars. NO JOKESIES</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... I don&#39;t play those kinds of games... I don&#39;t care about chatter from India... I like what you have to say about the intelligence agencies and such... but I don&#39;t like these kinds of posts... Maybe it is cause if one bitcoin is worth a million dollars it is because the USD has been insanely devalued as a result... </p>

<p>Sounds like hyperinflation to me... destabilization of the global money markets... those are Soros games... I don&#39;t need to be rich... I just need to be happy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its more like stock in microsoft. Your being rather brute about what is simply a new world market. Bitcoin was designed to be a trading tool. Its not a currency. Its just a digital rock you place value in, like any other item. Because other nations currencies are failing, its become a tool for people to rely on; that isn&#39;t capitalized on by the bankers. 
So in that extent its anything but a soros grab. Techinally its quite the opposite; which to me makes it an amazing thing...</p>

<p>Eitherway, I just study data, and try to give my best professional advice of the data I am seeing as it changes. </p>

<p>Just a lonely journalist, and humanitarian. (Disaster mitigation). 
I have a knack for physics, and mathematics. I choose to be humble, and share my intellect to allow others to benefit from what I am seeing as beneficial elements in a situation. So take me and my advice for what you will. But it has proven to be helpful so far. So I think if anything people can at least say for the most part; I&#39;ve been nothing but honest and helpful. 
I think that is all you will ever hear about me really :)
(Mainly because what better title is there to strive for)?</p>

<p>So if this isn&#39;t for you; I truly respect that. Many wont consider this; But for those that did; They have already made some progress simply taking my advice. So Good for them. and happy to help:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look I really can just verify the data; Its a solid investment for now; </p>

<p>Moore&#39;s law basically backs it; So most have nothing to lose in that extent. The main argument it people are using it and that gives it worth. Feel free to check out <a href="/r/btc">/r/btc</a> and <a href="/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> for more info, and <a href="/r/bitcoinbeginners">/r/bitcoinbeginners</a> for Questions. </p>

<p>Imo I just do data, and the data shows a sharp hyper inflation around the corner. (I already made people money off this data). 
So the rest you need to look into, and if you have questions from there there are roughly 50 - 100 forums on the site I built with thousands of users speaking very highly about it present date...</p>

<p>So food for thought ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... none of that makes sense to me... but I think stocks are fake too... it&#39;s just lottery tickets for rich people. </p>

<p>If I had any desire to be rich I&#39;d probably get suckered into little schemes like this... but when almost 50% of the &quot;currency&quot; is produced by Chinese serverfarms I don&#39;t wanna know what happens when they pull well past 50% of the mining. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t suggest buying into mining at this point. You don&#39;t understand the protection that aes 256 offers bitcoins users. This isn&#39;t a stock. Its a commodity based on security, and its ability to secure its users themselves. Either way I didn&#39;t make the post to necessarily change anyones minds. I simply infer data trends because its helpful to others so if makes me feel good about myself :)</p>

<p>Again; Its truly up to the users to make their investment decisions. 
I simply see a sharp curve ahead due to the current markets in india sinking their teeth into it :)</p>

<p>If that were different I wouldn&#39;t be posting. But because that is the reality of the situation I can&#39;t refute the data I am a witness too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes and no. </p>

<p>Think if your spam folder had something of value in it; Like information which was of high value; </p>

<p>Essentially your right; it has low to 0 value. But that goes the same for gold. (exceptions via its digital properties), but the fundamental worth is nill. The value is determined by those that carry it; There isn&#39;t enough to go around for everyone (much like gold), which means that it can always be traded and cut into smaller patricians, and sold for higher rates. (just like gold). </p>

<p>Its a beautiful line of coding, encryption; Near impenetrable; Which gives users the protection they need to vet it. Because they offer items in exchange for it; we see a value in the market. </p>

<p>my main impression is that india&#39;s buy in will lead to amazon hopping on board. In that extent we will see a direct boom in its worth; because it will virtually be trade worthy with all things. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just like the usd but even more secure because its encrypted by the chain itself; Its technically better than the usd print more ruling; Because there is a cap that was preset in the market worth. </p>

<p>So I assume it has a couple years of use (if not a decade) based on this alone; Essentially its just as valuable as a 100 bill usd. </p>

<p>Just a piece of paper that represents x amount of goods, or work agreed upon by the market. nothing more; and nothing less. </p>

<p>I assume for these reasons alone, with the ruling of moores law, and the stability of current day world currencies. It has a lasting place here; For generations to come; So long as the laws themselves not regulate it; And for those reasons alone; I personally can&#39;t knock making a quick buck off it in the mean time. </p>

<p>So i mean your right; and technically all money is a scam; But we as humans don&#39;t trade goods for goods anymore; (That is why we created currency&#39;s in the first place). So until we see some indication of any potential dooming in its future. I say shoot. 
Might as well accept it in (in the mean time).</p>

<p>Note also I am no spokesman; If it tanks I will likely have a post up a week ahead to say; Yo - looks like x factors are showing yz results. bail out; But again; This is cause I like to be the helpful data guy. So Ya. Maybe not for everyone; But I think most that got in; are doing just fine; So? Why think anything different as of now?</p>

<p>Note: KK I gotta eat dinner; But I will happily be back soon; can&#39;t say I don&#39;t agree with your thoughts on a fundamental level; But I mean you can either work within the system or ignore it all together. I am trying to work off what I see; Because unfortunately its where the world has lead us too at this time :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... still not buying it... The US is still struggling to get chip and pin off the ground... ain&#39;t no way bitcoin will take over. My spam is exactly the same as bitcoins... maybe even more valuable because it contains information that is useful outside of a currency...  </p>

<p>Once China controls more than 50% of the miners it will all go to shit... and that will happen any day now... if it hasn&#39;t happened already... they are just waiting to make their moves for maximum impact... they love to gamble... especially when they can rig the whole fucking thing... what does all your research tell you about China achieving a majority of the output? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again. This is data to me. </p>

<p>Its just a chart that follows moore&#39;s law; Its a simple inference of the data that shows proven market stability and profits for x amount of time; I don&#39;t care if its russian, chinese, or hispanic. This has no context to an analyst? I just look at the chart study the growth, compare it to the past market trends, adjusting for world events, then go on to make updates. 
So the rest is jargon; I am not worried about china- 
I am reporting a curve within moores law; that is all- </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I notice trends too... patterns... and deviations from patterns... and one thing i notice people being worried about is China owning more than 50% of the miners and uniting them as one cohesive unit... I don&#39;t know what it means... but my gut tells me it means they can achieve goals that no normal group could... Something bad about the protocols being under the control of a majority. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why but I fixate on things. Essentially I am a really weird hobbyist; I love journalism, and physics. So instead of having a favorite football team, I have a favorite element on the periodic table. </p>

<p>I really am into futures reports and the way of a trend; Market curves etc. Mainly because they challenge me to be a stronger intellectual entity. I will check into it, and let you know what I think based off the data provided though. As I can&#39;t say i&#39;ve really heard about it (in some respects from a data perspective). </p>

<p>Give me a couple days, and I will totes let you know about my feelings :)
Fair enough?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely, as someone who is interested in physics also, I&#39;ve enjoyed your analysis posts, from your EQ predictions to cryptocurrency. (which happens to be another of my favorite topics) And, I must say, your analysis tends to be pretty accurate, your Bitcoin analysis is similar to fractal analysis which I&#39;ve been looking into, and falls within the same ballpark as my thoughts on the price ($2-$4K next year)</p>

<p>Feel free to check out the website I made :) I tried to make it an epic directory of all things bitcoin ;) <a href="http://www.investbitcoin.webs.com">www.investbitcoin.webs.com</a> </p>

<p>So naturally I think I did my best under the one man team aspect. </p>

<p>(Note) press load a bunch and she will fire right up. So far I am slightly on a slump. But I will improve it as that changes :)</p>

<p>I am off to scout some dinner atm; but feel free to friend me; I will always be happy to help as best as I can :)
(I mean that too. Until the day I die :( :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I am a trader in rigged currencies/gold/futures. </p>

<p>I enjoyed your post, mostly because you are trying to predict entire market patterns before they actually happen. </p>

<p>With bitcoin, it is pretty much a fear/greed sentiment market. During the periods in which things in the world are calm the movement is minimal, however, during periods such as those we have now it increases its volatility. To suggest any particular price will cause pullbacks etc, is a pure guess. There is not enough historic data to properly calculate values of importance. It is in essence the greatest free market of our time (it doesn&#39;t have riggers yet although I hear they are coming). But guessing bitcoin will go up right now is pretty obvious, i mean, look at the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moore&#39;s law is a hell of a way to project the rise over the next few years. I would say by 2026 there will be a fallout in the market (as this basically is the market cap). Also you have to take trends into account, plus additions which replace the past systems in use. 
My main points are get in now, and ride the wave; Its really shown its place in the market. Overstock.com now openly accepts it, and my guess is 30% of india will begin utelizing it as a standard currency in the next 1-2 years. This means having a share now, will likely be worth near 1 million. I haven&#39;t had dinner and am on low batteries atm; But as far as I can tell; India will be the harbinger for a huge inflation of its current market price. Its when their own currency stabilizes or whether laws impact its growth in the nation; that will truly dictate its future in its fullest integrity. </p>

<p>IMO You have a good 2 years to ride the wave in full comfort until its either a risk or at risk. So if its worth it until then... Why not? </p>
