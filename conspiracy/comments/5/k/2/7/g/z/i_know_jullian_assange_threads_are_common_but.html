    <div class="md"><p>Fully agree. My guess is the ddos was an attempt to use the bulk of computing power of the united states to crack the aes 256 encryption. Notice that wikileaks immedieatly chanted. Come get the file guys! well after the initial situation took place. Honestly I think its rather suspiscios they didn&#39;t include the typical Use VPN, Don&#39;t do this from home message. As is they were intentionally attempting to put users I.P&#39;s At risk. As we all well know that those files are being actively monitored. My guess is since they can&#39;t crack it; This is a time grab while they are scratching their heads. </p>

<p>A little more on aes 256 and why this coincides with a major network outage:</p>

<p><strong>From first article to give you an idea:</strong></p>

<p>A 256bit encryption is the mathematical equivalent of 22<sup>56</sup> key possibilities. To put that into perspective, 232 is about 4.3 billion, and it keeps growing exponentially after that. What does this mean though? Well simply put, let’s say hypothetically all the super computers in the world (the ultimate brute force attack) decided to group up and tasked themselves to decrypt your AES-256 key so they could access your data. Assume they could look at 2<sup>50</sup> keys per second (which is approximately one quadrillion keys/second – a very generous assumption). A year is approximately 31,557,600 seconds. This means that by using the one billion super computers required to do this, they could check about 2<sup>75</sup> keys per year. At this rate it would take these computers 2<sup>34</sup> years (the age of our universe) to look at less than .01% of the entire key possibilities. The bottom line? No one will be breaking your encrypted data at Canadian Cloud Backup.</p>

I had forgotten about that internet outage. This post sparks my interest more than anything on this sub before. Also, is there anything I can do to prevent my internet from being used by government. As I typed that last sentence, I realized that windows 10 could very easily be the insecurity. Remember how they forced it so hard. I don&#39;t know enough, but could that be possible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO there are vpn&#39;s but they are all just &quot;flags&quot; that make you more watched. Nothing we do with digital communications isn&#39;t seen by the nsa. When your trying to hide, that essentially makes you more a target. Basically hide in plain sight; Also maybe consider a legal lifestyle. In light of digital comms. There is no off the record and they have been created to literally monitor us. So we cant do anything about it; In terms of hiding. But you can easily google search US security camera networks, and their UK surveillance. As there are hundreds of results to choose from :)</p>

<p>What&#39;s your point? They&#39;re probably just using a cloud service or moving around their machines. Additionally, do you think some law enforcement agency already had access to their servers and then moved them to ones they control for some reason? They already controlled the originals so why cause any discrepancies that people will definitely notice? If you saw different machine identifiers (MAC) for the servers, that is explained by virtualization/different hardware/obfuscation. If you saw IP changes that is explained by moving servers, swapping some cables, messing with your config options or any of a number of other possible reasons related to networking. Just because you&#39;re not saying that your retarded theory is fact doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s any less retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did an audio analysis of the Assange and Hannity interview and posted it in the most top rated thread devoted to the subject. I ended up getting the most upvotes in that thread.</p>

<p>I could have done that interview in 4 to 8 hours as long as I had enough material to comp from. If I had VoCo, which has not been released to the market yet, then that interview would be a one hour job.
So no, my 16 years of audio engineering at a pro level tells me to not take the interview as pol. Also, it should be noted that I don&#39;t give a shit about Assange, Wikileaks, Hannity, Trump, Clintons, etc so I have no horse in this race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likely they were his closest of contacts; Hence them all disappearing one by one. (multiple members died coincidentally), So; The staging of taking over the official wikileaks account was more likely than not (and still is) a honeypot. Hence Their subversion tactic to call on users to continue business as usual. </p>

<p>We have no idea how many key holders could have readily been implicated behind the scenes. As a government utility scours through the hard drives back tracking the infrequent networks that Julian was embedded too. </p>

<p>For all we know they are all calling home asking &quot;Julian You ok&quot;. </p>

<p>It makes perfect sense why they would attempt to continue business as norm; While also explaining why there was a direct shift in the wikileaks general personality during the heist. </p>

<p>I mean we are talking about imperfect people attempting to clone a personality; having no actual past experience on doing this. Sure they are getting better at it. But after having had a few months I&#39;d imagine the thrill of being at the wheel and learning how to drive the car itself would start to come to you naturally. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve gestured their detest on multiple occasions</p>

<p>To have their skeletons shown and told to the nation</p>

<p>Everyone means me and you...</p>

<p>Everyone means me and you...</p>

<p>Now give me your ears and I&#39;ll lend you a secret</p>

<p>I&#39;ve channel the proofs that you&#39;ll need to explain it</p>

<p>To bite at their heels its our turn to brandish</p>

<p>The power we have should we not wish to be famished</p>

<p>So shout out these words do not attempt less</p>

<p>These murders are had so we give it our best</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a joke, We have an obligation </p>

<p>To pass on this word to everyone in our nation</p>

<p>Everyone means me and you</p>

<p>Everyone means me and you</p>

<p>I am sick of these ticks that suck from our pockets</p>

<p>Openly commuting crimes and laughing among us</p>

<p>Destruction of evidence and wiping the record</p>

<p>The nazi&#39;s were worse but at least they took credit</p>

<p>For all the things that they do</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you realize this was done to you?</p>

<p>So give me your word that you&#39;ll pass this on</p>

<p>They started this war and welcomed assange</p>

<p>Abusing our freedoms and demanding we abide</p>

<p>Now it is our turn to make them comply</p>

<p>To the same prisons as me and you</p>

<p>We cant let this be true. </p>

<p>So question me not your voices can win this</p>

<p>The transparency ends when we&#39;ve fucking said it</p>

<p>Give them no break in their breaking of trust</p>

<p>It is time to allign and demand &quot;Lock her UP&quot;</p>

<p>TAKE THEM TO THE SAME PLACE AS YOU!</p>

<p>You would be locked up if it were you...</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve HAD ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re bringing too many points for anyone to bring a real conversation about them. But regardless, the modlog of whereisassange is public so to say it&#39;s being censored is quite a statement to make. It is infiltrated by a lot of disinfo, enough that mods are being churned out constantly from the burnout of sorts. With this said, it boils down to these simple 2 statements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone agrees a lot of suspicious things happened, hence the reason for creating r/whereisassange to begin with.</li>
<li>Whether or not strong POL was given, whether Assange is alive or in the embassy or not, apparently his internet just got restored recently (in the embassy).</li>
<li>Assuming the Internet back news is true rather than yet more disinfo, we should know very soon if Assange is well and alive. The best part? If the info was fake and his internet is not back, then that is also verifiable and we will know how deep the disinfo goes (considering who said that his internet is back). In either case we will have proof of either massive conspiracy or the man himself will give pol/explain the past months.</li>

<p>And I already answered yours earlier in the thread. The mods may not be compromised; Yet, the world itself is. There is almost a policy to take those with their opinion&#39;s and shuttle them into a corner; Labeling them; and then challenging others to ostracizing them based on their beliefs; I feel that is the most relevant point; Push users aside; Quell the rumors; Displace their community efforts. I myself have had great posts redacted for the simplest reasons.. Too much bold! That is a sensational title. But any users that leave a &quot;look an interview! He is alive&quot; narrative; (sensational title) get&#39;s a free pass; Now I myself am not saying that is forced opposition; But I question it; And your presence here; </p>

<p>Tell us why Ixlyth you push against this &quot;assange is missing&quot; narrative nearly 24/7 hours a day; Well knowing that everyone on the forum thinks otherwise? You have a job don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>Do you really expect users to believe that you are there wasting your life 24/7 to fight against an official narrative? Because you don&#39;t have motivation&#39;s too...?</p>

But I do have my own thoughts; And your either one that truly likes to waste your own time; Or more simply put; The very subject of question that likely makes users like me; Post, Posts like these in the first place...</p>

<p>So here is my thoughts on the russian narrative. How would Julian Assange. An Australian citizen that didn&#39;t speak a lick of russian. Somehow manage to make an outside phone call. From the heavily monitored phones there. To somehow get to a top clearance conference with their military intelligence in russia (the gru). With full permission from putin. To simply leave an embassy. With an active surveillance van that was present. (and just suddenly went missing in october). To somehow; Mannage to walk across town. Meeting with unknown russian agents, as the most popular man in the area to a boat / flight; Which requires boarding or a passport. To travel to an international airport completely trusting strangers; of unknown present contact?
Seriously anyone that even considers that is off their rocker; Or completely trying to lead you off the trail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the help of Ecuador. And a Russian interpreter, I suppose. He managed (through Harrison) to help Snowden get there, why assume he&#39;s incapable of negotiating with Russia?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve raised all sorts of valid points, frankly far too many for me to have time to address individually. I think your logic is sound in most cases, but it is still speculation. Solid, thought-provoking speculation. But when you start slipping into calling people crazy because they don&#39;t accept your logic, though... come on, man.</p>

<p>I&#39;m intimately familiar with the details of this story, and have watched it unfold from the beginning. There is absolutely nothing in your post that factually precludes him potentially escaping to Russia. Again, you raise many solid questions about how that might have gone down, but you haven&#39;t disqualified it as an option if you consider that Ecuador might have been compliant with/actively facilitated an escape.</p>

<p>Not to mention that my family has some contact&#39;s I am not willing to sell out; But I am dangerously close to telling the whole world the full extent of this lie prior to allowing a forced opinion and a false one at that be weighed in on the situation itself. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t tell the family member of an intelligence member working closely with the abc entities what they don&#39;t and do know about the situation / lie with a Russian connection. Factually It isn&#39;t true. It is an attempt to hide Hillarys poor judgments. As she was personally warned by the fbi not to have an insecure system in the first place. Well before the hack. As well as the fact that those servers were in no way legal. Which she also refuses to admit to have lied about. (to the entire planet); greatly embarrassing this nation, and its intelligence services. Lock her up-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My longshot hope is that everything you said is pretty much true... except we all know there has to be an ongoing coup behind the scenes at the intelligence agencies... not just in the US, but a few other places as well... I&#39;d like to imagine they knew what kind of nasty tricks HRC was up to... cause it looks like they know everything else she has had planned... maybe because of nonstop surveillance from a splinter of the NSA? Anyways... they saw that her people had a very solid plan to kill him off... and decided to intervene ahead of time in a manner that left the perpetrators in the assassination thinking the plan succeeded. The white knights of trusted personnel worldwide conspired to get him out of the place and to somewhere safe. </p>

<p>They needed to create a &quot;Schrodinger&#39;s Assange&quot; if everyone knows he&#39;s dead a lot of people would be outraged... and a lot of nations would hold the US responsible... if everyone knows he&#39;s alive then HRC&#39;s posse knows their comms were compromised and would need to switch to more secure channels of communication... or deviate from the plans they already had in place that the white knights had stolen a copy of. </p>

<p>I think that interview with Hannity was real... but scripted and maybe not even &quot;designed&quot; for Hannity specifically. (Hence the supposedly recycled Sean mention) If it was faked by HRC JA would have been blaming Russia for the leaks. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to think JA is alive and well and is now &quot;controlled opposition&quot; he will not be releasing the really damaging files because he is in protective custody... and has been assured that justice will be served to all the badguys everywhere worldwide. To release the files wouldn&#39;t help his cause... at this point it would only cause hate and anger and civil unrest in a time when the world is already very volatile. </p>

<p>He will make a very public appearance and everyone will be certain he is alive... but only once all the baddies have been rounded up. FBI2 will parade him out in front of the public to help restore their tarnished image and at the same time introduce their whistleblowing posterboy to help usher in a new age of transparency and oversight... instant street cred. </p>

<p>Everyone needs to consider that the intelligence agencies aren&#39;t cohesive teams with the same goal that all play nice together... they aren&#39;t like a football team... they are made up of people... people that each have very different goal and joined the &quot;teams&quot; to pursue very different goals. </p>

<p>TLDR - JA is kicking back in a secret bunker with FBI 2.0 halfheartedly pretending to be alive... He traded the most disgusting of insurance files for his life, his freedom and to deal a huge blow to corruption around the globe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For anyone interested in the evidence on the matter of Where Is Assange, I can help:</p>

<p>The best compiled list of the currently available is <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5ixzxx/embassy_evidence_megathread_10/">this evidence megathread</a>!  Check it out and decide for youself.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<p>There is a long list of first-hand, in-person witnesses: Craig Murray (close friend and human rights activist), Yanis Varoufakis (another friend and activist), John Pilger (friend and journalist), Jennifer Robinson (his Australian attorney), Per Samuelson (his Swedish attorney), and the Swedish prosecutors.</p>

<p>He&#39;s also had a phone call with his mom, and she reports he is alive and in the embassy.  Lauri Love also met with him in-person and states that no electronic devices are allowed inside per embassy orders.</p>

<p>We also have a video interview from John Pilger, an audio appearance at the FCM conference in Beirut, and the Sean Hannity audio interview.</p>

I don&#39;t think this is meant to be disinfo though. These are well-meaning people. One of the long-standing issues of the conspiracy crowd is that the paranoia can be all encompassing. You can lose yourself in it and start to see conspiracy in everything. In my opinion, these people have just taken the conspiracy too far.

    <div class="md"><p>Simple. Rubber hose cryptography. </p>

<p>Named after the fact that I can torture you password out of you if I beat you long enough with a rubber hose. </p>

<p>Now, the real question is, why should we trust anyone? </p>

<p>Least of all the american intelligence agencies?</p>

<p>And this is the part that gets me going. </p>

<p>It is a nice modell in game theory. OOh, Assange reappears. Assange does not use his PGP key. Assange talks about trusting him again. </p>

<p>Leaks stop coming, mission archieved. </p>

<p>The much simpler question is, what do we know about the americans? </p>

<p>We have seen what they do under the cover of the war on terror to human rights. </p>

<p>We have seen what happens in CIA blacksites. </p>

<p>We have seen that american soldiers are committing crimes against humanity, and no body says a single word. </p>

<p>We know that they are not above redirecting and unlawfully searching diplomatic flights. </p>

<p>We know that they are not above &quot;disappearing people&quot;. </p>

<p>We know that a lot of people around Hillary, to just name an example, had a lot of &quot;accidents&quot; and &quot;deaths from natural causes&quot;. </p>

<p>We know that the last PGP keys were not matching. </p>

<p>And we know that a lot of people, a fuckton of people, were genuinely impressed with the world service Assange has done. </p>

<p>So, theoretically, we have 2 possibilities. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Assange is dead. In which case, as a thanks to him, I will continue to hunt for the key, because if they killed to keep what is hidden in there a secret, it is time sensitive, and must be released. Jaque de Molay, you are avenged style. No matter if the entirety of the US burns to the ground due to it. </p></li>
<li><p>Assange is alive, but under duress. Maybe they attacked dills to his kneecaps. Maybe they just showed him a live feed of a sniper rifle trained on his children. Told him if he would release one detail, his kids would be gone. And the murderer would have diplomatic immunity. So now he sits there, knowing if he does just an other keystroke on an unmonitored machine, his kids could be dead. In which case, I continue the fight for assange, because, quite honestly, if my family was under hreat of people that were even half as capable as america in crimes against humanity and warcrimes, I would want someone to continue the fight. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The truth is very simple. </p>

<p>If Assange wants us to stop, he has the power. He can use a PGP signed message. he can invite multiple people in the embassy to film him. His choice. he knows what problems we face. </p>

<p>But with the cutting of the internet, the message was clear. They wanted to silence him. And by the looks of it, they have. </p>

<p>We are Assanges Deadmans switch. And we are very, very loyal. </p>

<p>Assange has brought a generation into the light that starts to question shit. Does not take the word of the authorities for granted. Thinks before they act. </p>

<p>The least I can do for him is fight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>respectfully disagree, I cant think of a reason to fight for him like that nor does he have a reason to prove anything to unfamiliar people. If you really needed proof you could come up with a logical plan to fund plane trips or whatever it takes and go find his family or friends, or contact an anon nearby. I cant help reminding myself when someone posts yet another PGP / compromised thread, we&#39;re on reddit and not publishing WikiLeaks. </p>

<p>When you consider that an existing video of julian to date likely is worth over 1,000,000.00 usd.

<p>So what I would consider is that I actually read this in full; Which I had; Which led me to writing this very post. As had you done your own research (reading my comments). I actually did in fact comment these points on other articles well before creating this anti update. Mainly due to the opposition attempts. So As ineducable as it is to begrudgingly say different. It basically boils down to the fundamental argument. Pics or it didn&#39;t happen-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think HRC or BHO give much thought to JA WL following much less fear a backlash from us. We are a smudge when you look at the country as a whole. There should be thousands of us outside that embassy everyday demanding to see him, or coordinating marches etc, but were quiet in the grand scheme of things. The only reason they wouldnt want the public to know they killed him (even by accident) is bc noone will believe its an accident, and it will really make it clear they were guilty all along. However, if they took him alive, I think BHO would love to parade him around and make an example out of him. Im still split overall on where he may be/and his current state.</p>

<p>Essentially that is why I myself vote accidental death. And Yes, How accidental was it... Essentially HRC was campaigning... I doubt she would have been happily welcomed by masses of people at her campaign events should that news have broken in the relevant time frame. The worst part is that this means that they intentionally are covering it up; Which makes it look no better if it were an accident.</p>

<p>So should his files launch after that admission; Were truly looking at a nationally outraging situation. Hence the time grab. So people will just calm down. I believe that is their strategy. To sooth it with time. Which is exactly why I am making a stink of it...</p>

<p>HRC is a criminal; And I am tired of paying 100.00 To fix a lightbulb on my car. While she openly destroys evidence in a federal hearing; And has the audacity to run for president; Laughing in our faces. Greatly embarrassing the entirety of our nation.

Assange has done live video (Philger), audio (Spanish group) and interviewed with Swedish law enforcement. His family aren&#39;t worried about him...you know he has one right? His colleagues at Wikileaks aren&#39;t worried about him either. The Ecuadorian embassy isn&#39;t saying he left which would end a real huge problem for them either.</p>

<p>It&#39;s YOU that has to show Assange is dead or somewhere else than where HE HIMSELF said he is (Spanish audio interview, stated he was still in Embassy).</p>

Prediction: He will appear live on video by the end of next month and people will continue to speculate that he is either dead or psychologically reprogrammed because his eyelids were blinking in fucking morse code or something.  Meanwhile, in reality he&#39;s either busy working on an escape plan to gain political assylum in Russia or he will be in British jail by the end of the year.</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused.  Are you saying that you will not accept any video evidence of him as proof of life?  If/when he does make an appearance it will obviously be transmitted through video to the rest of the world.  It&#39;s not as if you can just invite him over for a cup of tea and fondle his testicles to confirm he&#39;s not a hologram.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A press conference would be a valid proof of life then?  I agree.  Unfortunately his mental state has clearly been deteriorating due to the constant international pressures, isolation inside the embassy, and paranoia about being assassinated.  Whether his suspicions are justified or not, he&#39;s become an unstable recluse who genuinely fears for his own safety.  The press conference is, in my opinion, a pipe dream.</p>

<p>I believe he was shot and killed in a heated panicked moment by the officers who were operating in a very very high tense situation; And that the very context of admitting that; was a direct threat to the Clinton campaign; Which was in enough shambles as it was. So That would have created public outrage; Hence the not mentioning it. Because if you think about it; Fox news already mentioned the impending arrest; So its not like the raid itself was a secret. So the real truth; The embarrassing truth. Is that it didn&#39;t go as planned. That is why I state more than likely dead.
