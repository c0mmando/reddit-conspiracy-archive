Mine was probably late, comparatively speaking, but at 19 reading the poem &quot;Howl&quot; by Ginsburg. Link to a good dramatized reading by James Franco <a href="https://youtu.be/Nonab6djMAA">https://youtu.be/Nonab6djMAA</a></p>

<p>I mean I was 11 when 9/11 happened so yeah.. But I learned about Iran/contra and drug war fuckery right after loving Howl and Leaves of Grass and Frank O&#39;Hara...you do the math lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome! Because I came at it from (what seems like) the opposite angle. I remember trying to tell my friends when I was 12 that money only means as much as the meaning given to it, and got made fun of a lot lol. But I didn&#39;t realize how much bullshit was involved until I watched zeitgeist addendum. Any other YouTube documentaries you&#39;d recommend on the subject?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched &quot;Money as Debt&quot; and later on &quot;Money as Debt 2&quot;. For the most part, these are great videos for beginners who want to learn the truth about fractional reserve banking. Keep this in mind: fiat money backed by debt is not &quot;worthless&quot;. It is backed by &quot;debt&quot;, which has to be paid back with the labor of you and I. In the United States, when the U.S. government cannot any longer pay the interest rate on the national debt, FDR gave the Federal Reserve System the power by Executive Order to force American citizens to pay back the debt by imprisoning them in labor camps.</p>

They are the merchants of doubt, the great masons who built the greatest brick building (masonry) structure on the planet we still marvel at that is on the back of our dollar bill. Built with slaves, slaves who believed themselves slaves until someone came along and showed them the Pharaoh&#39;s power is imaginary - let my people go. Are you aware of the first false flag - it started with the words: Titanic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well many things. A quote that has always shook me to my soul.
<em>the devils greatest lie, was convincing the world he does not exist.</em></p>

<p>Look around at conspiracies and it&#39;s very, very apparent. We are at war for our minds and our very own individual Souls.</p>

<p>Blackvault.com had helped me figure out truths and see light in shadows and things which were meant to be hidden from us.</p>

<p>We are born free on this Earth. This is ours, given to us and made beautiful for us. There is poison and propaganda vying for your soul. Are you smart? Read between the lines  why do a lot of conspiracy get snuffed quicker than most. Why the downplay and disinformation/misinformation. </p>

<p>Read between the lines and look for patterns to conspiracies. See a recurring few?? (Flat earth, firmament, otherworldly beings, to name a few) </p>

<p>Seek knowledge and find the truth.
God bless and God help us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My high school and the public school system in general, as well as the horrendous and inhumane treatment of those in Special Education programs, first opened my eyes to the abuse of power and the evils of bureaucracy.  Ever since then I&#39;ve had a decided lack of faith in power structures and their ability or even purported motivations to assist individuals they should be helping.  I&#39;m a big believer that America quite possibly has one of the worst education systems, if not the worst, in the world.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been interested in the sort of behind the scenes politics that goes into world events.  As a history buff I rarely find the common narrative to be all that convincing, as more often than not histrorians will simplify things to fit a certain agenda.  So from history being revised it&#39;s only a short jump to think other events could be rewritten as well.</p>

<p>Anyways at some point while studying WWII came across Project MKULTRA which is when things got real for me.  The fact that it was so heavily sourced and that so few people even seemed to know about it threw a lot of red flags up.  This led me to a while analysis of the Cold War and WWII which has led me to possess very different views on many historical events than most people.</p>

<p>While I was doing my bachelor in economics, I stumbled on the mises insitute. I found out everything I was learning was pretty much false/on false premises. I started researching American history and why Austrian economics are not taught in universities. </p>

<p>There the rabbit hole began for me.</p>
