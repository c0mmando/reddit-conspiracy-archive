<p>Indeed, food for thought. </p>

<p>Why are we seeing so much propaganda and forced coercion in to war?? I do not wish to go to war, do YOU? Who is pushing for this tyrannical bullshit. We must come together or we&#39;re all doomed.</p>

<p>Post your address here and we will ask if your neighbor wants to have a fight. Now how about that on a larger scale. Does that sound stupid and ignorant? Because it is. </p>

<p>It&#39;s time we start creating ways to unite. The internet is ours, this is a good start, they are fighting for control and censorship of it. Our collective knowledge is destroying MSM. </p>

<p>We will all wake up and realize we should be doing something more. But what? Think of something you&#39;d like to see in the world and think about it often. What if you could invent something cool to help the world along? You never know until you think of it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently thinking of ways to devour landfills. Devour and recycle. </p>

<p>Unite where you can. Stand up for each other. We&#39;re all in this world together RIGHT NOW and this is all really happening before your eyes.</p>

<p>We are being bombarded with shills and bots on r/conspiracy right now. They seek to discourage you. Gather your own thoughts and information. Never stop seeking truth.</p>

<p>God bless and good luck to us all, no matter if you believe or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are slaves. </p>

<p>I was a poor kid growing, I never saw more than 10k a year until this year, where I started making just over 100k at a nice job after graduating from college. I was really excited, I thought I could save for my future and my family.</p>

<p>The government takes over 1/3 of my money in taxes. The cost of living is high, food is expensive where I am. I have thousands in debt. In the end, I am just as broke as I was before I was making all this money, and I work ALL THE TIME. When I was poor, I had free time to do what I want. I miss it.</p>

<p>But where it really killed me, is I realized by the time I have paid off my dept, I will once more go into debt to buy a house for my wife and kids. Small houses where I live range from 800k to 1.5 million. It will take me the most of the remainder of my life to pay it off. And then there&#39;s childcare expenses because I work all the time. And then there is college expenses for my children... It&#39;s just... depressing. I don&#39;t want to play this rat race game. I just want to live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aren&#39;t landfills recycled all the time? I&#39;ve used many parks and been to schools made on landfills.  They plant grass on them and look like low hills with flat tops...And sometimes they are so large you don&#39;t even notice the hill part and it just seems like a flat, grassy area with smaller trees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a pretty good video. It will go nowhere.</p>

<p>The very same people/institutions which are the subject of the video have managed to discredit and undignify Anonymous, whittling away and disparaging their credibility over the last 10 years.</p>

<p>There is so much information and then  intentional counter dis-information going on, nobody knows what to think and who to believe.</p>

<p>Thanks for the post.</p>

<p>And you do realize it&#39;s a bit silly to talk about a (questionably decent trilogy) like a religion, right? At least the force in Star Wars had some footing in telekinetic and telepathic ideas of the time..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of truth in art, some stories of fantasy/fiction hold inspiration that have driven minds to greatness in reality. The Matrix holds a lot and is probably why so many people enjoyed it, the ending may not be great for the hero but his story inspires people to higher feelings and thoughts which affects reality.</p>

<p>We know Cyrus regrets taking the red pill he wants to live in ignorance and be a celebrity - rich with fame. We learn Cyrus will kill for this selfish desire yet Neo will sacrifice his life to save the people he cares for. Does a child wish to be like Cinderella or the Stepmother? It&#39;s the story of time, hero&#39;s are all around us. Paying for a families meal behind you in the drive thru may make you a hero in their minds for days afterwords and inspire them to greater actions. They may not even know you or see you but your actions may cause them to stop and pick you up when your cars broke down and you need a ride. What goes around comes around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When we people talk about following your dreams and taking chances I think they are people who got lucky and through some self deception think their hard work is responsible. Most jobs that I have had come with a pre determined yearly raise regardless of how you work. Promotions are based on length of employment. It is impossible to save to lets say open a business without some luck or someone helping you. My perspective is that the whole system is built to empower those with money. If you choose to not work, you starve and die. We lack real survival skills and really there is no choice but to work. What amazes me is the one&#39;s who will defend this system as if it is the only way and &quot;suck it up&quot; or &quot;be a man&quot;. If anyone believes we have figured out the perfect system, capitalism and oligarchy then they must be slaves.</p>
