If you don&#39;t have Tor, and you want to get all of the information, please install Tor so you can access the .onion links. Keep in mind this effort is ongoing, so some things on threads may be outdated/compromised, and I am writing this as some of the information is coming in the threads. If you download <a href="https://endchan.xyz/.media/e2053fcb310e62147128c40ca0c23264-imagepng.png">Docs.png</a>, put it on your desktop, open command prompt, &quot;cd desktop&quot;, &quot;unzip docs.png&quot;, you will have <a href="https://endchan.xyz/.media/00457e832492e1ee640da6cfd9c4fe59-imagejpeg.jpg">all of the threads related to this subject from the last three months</a>.

<p>Now, obviously there is a lot of information here. I have a really hard time believing this is a LARP. Honestly, I&#39;ve only scratched the surface on this and it took me just a couple hours. In order to truly understand this, you must put some time into it. Carefully read the important posts in the threads. Ctrl-F keywords to search for information in the threads. Unfortunately, I have to do some work now, so I won&#39;t be very active for a few hours and that&#39;s why I haven&#39;t compiled a more organized set of instructions yet. But, like I said, this is an ongoing process and it&#39;s up to everyone to contribute. I&#39;ll do my best to answer questions, but I will be more available later tonight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an intensity on this subject I find really interesting. There are those who fervently support the idea of blockchain keys and those fervently opposed to it.</p>

<p>Those in favor of the idea are typically warning users to practice extreme security, and decoding offline on computers with 0 internet access. They go so far as to warn people <em>not</em> to attempt to share findings and to stay away unless they can be sure of their net security. They warn of suspected suiciding, or missing anons, or worse.</p>

<p>On the flip side, those opposed to the idea warn of malware, system hijacking and so forth. They espouse the idea of total avoidance. </p>

<p>My view is this... Buyer beware. If you decide to pursue the blockchain investigation and both sides warn of total system compromise, you should expect the absolute worst case scenario. If you feel your ability to deal with any potential compromise isn&#39;t up to the task but you still decide to move forward you will harvest what you sow.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why I&#39;m not going near it. I&#39;ll watch from the sidelines but I can barely type a grammatically decent sentance on my ipad, so how the fuck can I be confident enough in my tech skills to deal with a full blown compromise from the super secret NWO super computers or whateverchan bitcoin miners?</p>

<p>I think we need to wait it out and let dudes who know wtf they are talking about figure this out in peace and quiet. Whatever the situation is, most of us posting on reddit either don&#39;t have the skills or resources ti figure it out. If we did we wouldn&#39;t spend our time whining at each other in reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those in favor of the idea have used evidence to back their arguments for the validity of the situation, and have expressed that folks use caution when going through this process. </p>

<p>Those opposed have made outlying and baseless claims that are specifically designed to deter people. They create confusion and uncertainty enough to deter anyone from going near it. Ninja has spouted so much bullshit that doesn&#39;t even relate to anything in this topic. Until I see evidence that Assange is alive and he tells folks to stop looking in the blockchain, or that there is proof of malicious software being distributed, I don&#39;t think this should stop.</p>

<p>You need Linux and a decent bit of technical knowledge to perform this stuff, so if you don&#39;t have that, the best you can do is learn about the situation and have the insurance files ready.</p>

<p>The dudes who know what they&#39;re doing have been working for months to no avail. I don&#39;t want their work to go unnoticed among the public, and I want anyone who can and is willing, to help. We are on the brink of something massive. Whatever you think of this subject, just please never stop asking <strong>where is Julian?</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The problem here is that many of us simply don&#39;t have the resources or technical skill to pull this off. Setting up a Linux machine is going to require a second machine (probably) and the know-how to install Linux. 80% of the people following this can barely manage Windows so a Linux install is already beyond what they know. Then from the Linux instal they need to learn the rudimentary process of manipulating python scripts. Then from that, they need to learn assembling and applying the hash keys.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;ve been following and reading the developments with the blockchain stuff since early November and I <em>still</em> have no idea about 1/2 of the stuff being discussed. </p>

<p>In addition to all the scripting and stuff, the same people need to practice some pretty advanced security protecols. Bear in mind we are talking about the same people that have difficulty doing this with Windows.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not confident in my own abilities to run the scripts or figure out enough security with this. There is reports of people getting vanned or suicided, which is probably bullshit, but with even the remote 0.01% chance it isn&#39;t bullshit I&#39;m not skilled enough to potentially risk endagering my friends and family.</p>

<p>Having said all that I&#39;m watching from the sidelines because if something does make it through I will be ready to help distribute any way I can. I can&#39;t provide technical skills but I can add manpower to any effort that needs it. </p>

<p>As for Assange, I&#39;m assuming he is out of the picture until someone sees him standing at a window with a Kitty cat in his hands or WL start signing off with verifyable pgp keys. There was recently the report his internet being returned but WL hasn&#39;t confirmed nor has there been any verifyable digital confirmation. I think the DMS insurance file is a go no matter what at this point. WL has never said anything to the contrary even though they probably know 100% what people are onto with the blockchain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the problem for most people, man lol, but I&#39;m just giving this to anyone who may be in a different situation as you and may feel it is worth it to pursue this.</p>

<p>I think it is important to know, while folks should use caution and practice good opsec, that the CIA/NSA whatever, use fear to control the masses. They use war, nondisclosure contracts, and terrorism to frighten the public into submission. It&#39;s time for that to come to an end. We must stop being afraid of them. The moment we all stop being afraid of them, they become afraid of us.</p>

<p>Having technical skills and abilities and equipment to perform this is one thing, but being motivated enough by truth and justice while letting go of fear is another. I think it&#39;s safe to say Assange is either dead, or he miraculously got out and is hiding until the insurance info is public. Either way, his absence creates the real urgency of the situation. This is it. Thank you for admitting that you may not have what it takes to perform this, but allowing others who may have more knowledge and equipment to decide for themselves what should be pursued. </p>

They claimed he got his internet back, and he has still not signed his PGP? Wikileaks has been acting strange for the last three months with inconsistencies on their website and Twitter.

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re instructions for how to find the decryption keys in the blockchain. Assange has been missing (at best) for nearly three months, and it is likely that the keys to the insurance files have been stored in the blockchain, but are unable to be shared publicly because they get taken down instantly. These are instructions to find the keys yourself because that&#39;s the only way to obtain them right now.</p>

<p>Edit: Don&#39;t pay any attention to Ninja, he has repeatedly tried to deter and distract from anything productive. He provides no evidence that this is fake and just spams every thread with bullshit if you look at his history. Judge for yourself and take a look at all of the evidence provided, you don&#39;t have to believe it if you don&#39;t want to. But no one has reported any &quot;fucking up PCs&quot; with any of this stuff... except Ninja. Ignore and downvote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your bullshit claims about downloading malicious firmware from this are deleted now. You probably should have at least expected someone to ask for evidence, man. It&#39;s pretty pathetic to make false claims and replying with &quot;fuck off&quot; the moment you&#39;re asked to support your bullshit claims. Can I ask you why you did that? Why are you purposefully lying in order to scare people out of checking this out? Why are you spreading disinformation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude if you were smart, you&#39;d figure it out. I have checked loads of devices and it&#39;s hijacking people&#39;s devices to synchronize them to compute. I&#39;m guessing the money manipulators are terrified of block chains and their inability to manipulate them so they are trying a new approach. CIA uses everyone to mine transactions to fund black ops while blaiming Russia. I deleted my posts bc it was unfair to accuse you. You have no idea it&#39;s going on.  Believe me or not, but it&#39;s real. They have just got a huge boost in computability. </p>

You&#39;re saying CIA is hacking into our devices to mine bitcoins to fund black ops? Why not just print more and lose it like they normally do? Explain it in a way that people can understand. And if it was really happening, why wouldn&#39;t you try to let people know in a better way than accusing me instead of deleting the comments all together? Or will you admit you&#39;re just full of shit? You can read the code for all of this shit. If you have a problem with one, point to where the problem is.

    <div class="md"><p>Also guys if you havn&#39;t realized it by now Ninjakick is a bot in my opinion. Just start replying to it with off topic off the wall shit and it just starts going along with it.</p>

<p>I proved this in the mega thread by calling it a man in earlier replies then flirted with it claiming it was a woman. And both times it went along and spouts about the same 4 generic replies.</p>

<p>It seems the algorithm it uses takes words you use and has prebuilt counter arguments ready to go.. So if you ask about proof of life then you get replies about how he is probably fine.</p>

<p>Maybe not totally a bot could be used by a real person sometimes but It was on autobot all night last night, literally replied to every single comment I made for 7+ hours, and somehow was still posting that morning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The outages have been pretty advanced and directed. My opinion on this is that there was a specific target in mind when the attacks were launched, but who knows what the target was?</p>

<p>I think someone designing a DMS could probably anticipate targeted attacks and hopefully distribute release well enough to avoid them. You&#39;re definitely right saying a complete shutdown is an option. And now that you&#39;ve pointed it out, there has been a few warnings in the past couple of months about complete internet outages caused by solar flares.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create the information (solar flare). 2.Create public awareness of the information (press releases). 3. Act (shut down internet). 4. Avoid mass widespread panic (&quot;oh we were warned about this... No need to loot WalMart I guess...&quot;)</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if we can&#39;t make copies of your bike then this whole analogy was a waste of time. The insurance files are out there all over the world they just can&#39;t be read. Intelligence agencies around the world are scraping data from the blockchain so if the keys are there they likely already have them, they can&#39;t delete them however so it makes sense people would continue to look for them.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay to get up and running with python is very easy and actually pretty quick.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/</a></p>

<p>Install python 2.x (I did 2.7) you can install 3.x just not above 3.5 because something the scripts need called pycurl doesn&#39;t work with 3.6? weird but yea. Also if you use 3.x you need to edit the scripts a tiny bit because they are written in python 2 syntax ( adding parenthesis around the print command is the error for jean.py) </p>

<p>after installing python open command prompt and type</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pip install pycurl
(will not work with 3.6 version)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this will download pycurl for you and install it. Thus enabling you to use script Jean.py to look at the output of a transaction number.</p>

<p>If you try without pycurl it will throw an error and say it is unable to load pycurl and not return the data you want.</p>

<p>Now to use Jean.py go to command prompt and point to the directory it is installed in. cd is the change directory command in windows. ALSO make sure you run command prompt as admin. (right click it and run as administrator)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cd c:\path\to\scripts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>now that you are there you are ready to do what tutorials tell you to do.</p>

<p>For example, take a look at this transaction: </p>

<p><a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/08654f9dc9d673b3527b48ad06ab1b199ad47b61fd54033af30c2ee975c588bd">https://blockchain.info/tx/08654f9dc9d673b3527b48ad06ab1b199ad47b61fd54033af30c2ee975c588bd</a></p>

<p>If you do</p>

<p>python jean.py 08654f9dc9d673b3527b48ad06ab1b199ad47b61fd54033af30c2ee975c588bd</p>

<p>You will get a key that was leaked. along with a bunch of hex data. Now this is a basic introduction but there is more to this than that. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5e55p3/a_simple_blockchain_decoding_tutorial/">https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5e55p3/a_simple_blockchain_decoding_tutorial/</a></p>

<p>this will get you up and running. But as for actually searching the blockchain for useful transactions to look into there are more steps required to set that up. But for now you can look at transactions output data. There is more info in the tutorial about reading hex numbers to see if a certain filetype is associated with transactions.</p>

<p>Jean2 basically pieces a file together from multiple transactions and the above guide shows you an easy way to do that using cablegate as an example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, hombre. I thought about that, actually. I&#39;m afraid of a massive brigade of bullshit if we try getting those guys involved. You can try, man feel free, but honestly that would probably be a mess. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve spent much time on r/bitcoin, but I&#39;ve lurked there enough to see how much of a shitshow of confusion it already is, and I don&#39;t really want to bring that to this discussion. I was thinking r/technology or a tech sub more fitted for this subject would maybe help, but I haven&#39;t seen enough support for this to justify doing it myself.</p>

<p>And, yeah this was more of a thrown together collection of instructions I&#39;ve been seeing. I will try to further consolidate it into a step by step thing. I wish someone who has actually done it would post a step by step, but I know that if I were actually doing it, the last thing I would be doing is posting it publicly due to the reported consequences. But since I am not deep end, I figure that I have some sort of plausible deniability and am able to try to compile this stuff without the consequences that have been reported.</p>

<p>What holds people back  I think is they don&#39;t completely understand what the block chain is and what these programs do and the basic outline of the procedure to collect data from transactions. </p>

<p>I&#39;m working on it but I&#39;m still learning bitcoin myself. But I think using the c# will be a lot easier for folks as it works with windows and that is what most people use.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to install linux to use it. You just need to install python on windows. Then it will recognize .py files, then you can load CMD prompt and execute the script from there. But a windows based program with GUI will probably make a lot more people try to help.</p>

<p>edit: I meant to say Python itself doesn&#39;t require linux to run. You can just install it on windows and then run python scripts with CMD prompt.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing to see here guys, remember that 500GB that was too dangerous to release when Assange was public? Yeah forget that! The FBI and friends got this! Trust them and just wait a couple months, don&#39;t worry&quot;</p>

<p>Here is some more proof that Wikileaks has used Bitcoin if that&#39;s your point.
&quot;We prove that we have published stuff at a particular time by stuffing it in Bitcoin, in the blockchain, and then, if someone were to come and try to modify the material that we have published, to take a particular part, that would be detectable.&quot;</p>

Not saying its true at all but thats what this board is.  Now i understand your concern..i aint fucking touching any of that shit but others may fair enough.. guess my point is as someone who has been getting updates on this topic from more then just here on r/conspiracy ...it doesnt feel nefarious, it appears &quot;decent&quot; individuals are truely trying to find and progress towards truth .  Where there is more detailed discussion on progress there are no claims of devices getting hijacked, viruses etc just many tips on how to stay anonymous  ... it would have to be one of the top 3 larps of chan/reddit history   </p>
