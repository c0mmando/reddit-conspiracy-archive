<p>From <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Stratfor#Personnel_and_relevant_emails_by_hierarchy">http://pizzagate.wiki/Stratfor#Personnel_and_relevant_emails_by_hierarchy</a> :</p>

<p>George Friedman, founder and CEO</p>

<p>Fred Burton is Vice President for Intelligence, and sent most of the information on &quot;OBL&quot;</p>

<p>I made a timeframe of Fred Burton&#39;s communications for those who seem unsure of his confidence in the situation:</p>

<p>2011-05-02 05:26:15 Fred Burton: &quot;Reportedly, we took the body with us. Thank goodness.&quot;</p>

<p>2011-05-02 05:33:15 Fred Burton: &quot;We told the Pakis after we killed him. But, will praise GOP publicly. All spin and bullshit.&quot;</p>

<p>2011-05-02 05:47:25 Fred Burton: &quot;Raymond Davis operation was related to the case. CIA unilateral source in Paki worked without the Pakis knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p>2011-05-02 05:51:12 Fred Burton: &quot;Than onward to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Bethesda.&quot;</p>

<p>2011-05-02 13:36:41 Fred Burton: &quot;Body is Dover bound, should be here by now. &quot;</p>

<p>I should mention that Osama bin Laden was &quot;officially&quot; killed around 0100 PKT on May 2, which would have been 1400 on May 1 in Austin (where Stratfor is based). These timestamps suggest this chain of emails uses PKT (Pakistan Standard Time) or some nearby timezone, possibly hinting at where Stratfor was operating that day as the emails were sent from BlackBerry phones.</p>

<p>Could be multiple reasons for this, or why general details about his body are secret. If it&#39;s not the right guy, the U.S. definitely would look stupid. Stuck between a rock, a hard place, and a sea of lies.</p>

<p>He was basically in house arrest in Pakistan, not so easy to make videos and get them out.</p>

<p>what about being under &quot;house arrest&quot; would stop him from making a video? </p>

<p>and what is so difficult about handing it to someone to take with them when they leave?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Instead of ranting, learn, go read Sy Hersh&#39;s book: The Killing of Osama Bin Laden.</p>

<p>Great book and Seymour Hersh is credible, after all he broke the the My Lai Massacre. </p>

<p>This sub is weird, there are some informed people here and then there are those that I feel sorry for as they will not research or bother to read. Take this thread, everyone knew the story about burial at sea was a complete fabrication at the time, it&#39;s laughable but it&#39;s a huge revelation when some Strategic Forecasting people speculate  about it.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t even need to read the book, there are multiple interviews with Sy Hersh around, his story and his sources make a lot of sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard his story as well as read all the criticism about it as well. Of course criticism is not always correct though. You are taking this guy&#39;s story as fact and telling everyone they need to learn from that. This is one person&#39;s theory.</p>

<p>I personally believe it would be even easier to find Osama Bin Laden if he was just staying under Pakistani house arrest as you call it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already laid out all my points in this thread on how ridiculous I think it is for anyone to think OBL died in 2011 and not earlier.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure he stayed perfectly healthy while under house arrest and received his weekly kidney dyalisis that was keeping him alive. The US government&#39;s billions upon billions dollars to find him never would have led us to him within a decade.</p>

<p>I pointed out that US citizens can&#39;t even stay on the run for a few months or even weeks if they are lucky.  If we are speaking facts then Osama was actually on the run for MUCH longer than 10 years. Pre 9/11 we would have still been trying to make sure we knew exactly where he was at all times. So basically we couldn&#39;t find a guy who needed a cane to walk for at least 13 years. We can also ignore the fact that many estimated OBL only had 3 years left to live in 2001. </p>

<p>I respect your opinion though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not buy all of Hersh&#39;s story but at least with Hersh we have a real journalist and some of what he states does fit the record. </p>

<p>There was also certainly a raid on a compound in Abbottabad by navy seals, we have witnesses in Pakistan to that. </p>

<p>I used to be a subscriber of the OBL already dead theory, I was a big reader of whatreallyhappened.com back in the day also,  Mike made a great argument for it. I am also in the camp that the government is almost always lying so when the government is claiming OBL is a huge threat, the chances are he was already dead. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, we just do not know and we lack evidence fro all sides, but will know more in a few decades perhaps. </p>

<p>OBL didn&#39;t matter and very clearly that raid or the faking of it was meant to help Obama&#39;s reelection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. We honestly do not know and can just make educated guesses.</p>

<p>Here is a video of some of the Pakistani&#39;s saying it wasn&#39;t OBL. I know we have to take that with a grain of salt though. I figured I&#39;d just post it for you. I absolutely agree there was a raid. No doubt about it. Nice talking to you as well. Hopefully we find the truth out one day.</p>

<p>I mean we can take it for what it is worth but in this BBC video the Pakistanis are not denying there was a raid. They are simply stating that was not Bin Laden.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/vYYKaOIh9aw">https://youtu.be/vYYKaOIh9aw</a></p>

<p>I just will refuse to believe that a man who needed dialysis and only had a maximum of 3 years to live by many estimates somehow eluded the greatest military on Earth spending billions upon billions to find him.</p>

<p>99% of the time people in the United States can&#39;t hide when they break out of prison for more than like 2 weeks. These are perfectly healthy people remaining off the grid and hiding at different houses but somehow LE finds them with 1/10000 of the resource dedicated to finding Osama.</p>

<p>We are expected to believe that every dedicated resource can&#39;t find a dying old man? We found Sadam under the fucking ground!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah thanks for your contribution absolutely. That&#39;s what we&#39;re all here for. </p>

<p>We were told by the MSM media that OBL had body doubles so it certainly is not out of the realm of possibility that the SEALS had no idea at all. I never thought they were lying or were part of some conspiracy. Of course there is a chance the official narrative is correct. I&#39;m just giving my 2 cents on the matter. </p>

<p>But yeah he is one heck of a trickster. He somehow wobbled away on his cane for 13 years. But Tyrone who escapes from the local prison and has 30 cops looking for him is caught by dinner time on the same day he breaks out of county. Sounds about right.</p>

Islamic law suggest that one has to be burried as soon as possible (as they did, within 24H), but in the ground not water. So if you say to the US gov: &quot;You lied&quot;. They will say: &quot;No we did not lie, we burried him ASAP as his religion asked. It is your fault for misinterpreting it and think that islam ask people to be burried into the sea&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I havent seen that, thanks for posting it, this is all relatively new to me, Im one of those people that HLI talks about that feels theres something wrong with the system but doesnt know how to fix it</p>

<p>My breaking point was the Trump, Psy Op.  After the election, I felt like I had been gas-lighted by a girlfriend where she convinced me that the breakup was my fault even though she was cheating on me.  I dont have any problem with Trump and prefer him over Hillary but I felt played because of it.  And HLI&#39;s post on terrorism combined with Jill Stein and Tulsi (cant remember her last name) coming out on twitter and saying we created and are funding ISIS and Trump announcing we need to destroy ISIS proves my feeling of the psy op and we are being played</p>

<p>EDIT: Holy shit,  I just read that post.... HLI talks about agency against the government and that posts confirms it but agency with nukes, WOW... </p>

<p>Im more interested in his posts about consciousness than anything else, his knowledge and explanation of the symbology of religion makes perfect sense to me, I dont really care about the fact checkers saying hes wrong about a few incidents</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most important take-away from his posts is that nothing will change until people see a brighter future and a better option. There are a lot of people out there who feel like they just want to tear it all down (hence Trump winning) but have no idea what should or could or would be done differently. Plato&#39;s allegory of the cave couldn&#39;t be a more fitting analogy. People are getting very tired of the shadows on the wall but they haven&#39;t found the door behind them yet. </p>

<p>I spent a lot of time during the campaign thinking about how we need a new Federalist Papers type action to invigorate real change (even started re reading them) so the fact that he literally claims to be producing that right now really added icing to the cake for me. </p>

<p>Be careful with this. He is certainly right about the symbology in most religions. But he is misled about Christianity.</p>

<p>He thinks the texts were written by certain people. But they were not. We have manuscripts from before the subversion attempts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of talk about Christianity but I think it mostly boils down to : Jesus was a real person and his teachings were correct but through control of his message (by the church etc.) his teachings have been twisted from something that would inspire humanity to reach its full potential, to something that has resulted in people just waiting to die to realize God&#39;s promise. He says that understanding the theroy of consciousness explained in &quot;Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot; is basically the first step    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree that the church has subverted the teachings of Christianity. Most large churches are teaching all sorts of perversions, complete with pagan religious symbols and holidays.</p>

<p>But, that happened WELL after the Bible was written. We have fragments from within the 1st century, and  whole manuscripts by 250 AD, while the church was still being viciously persecuted. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to read the actual Bible, instead of relying on doctrines that powerful people have put out to control the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Hersh account rings true to me. The tl;dr is </p>

<ol>
<li><p>OBL captured by Pakistanis in 2006</p></li>
<li><p>Pakistanis kept him (he was an invalid) at the Abbotabad compound while Saudis paid to keep it quiet from the US</p></li>
<li><p>A &quot;walk-in&quot; at the US embassy tells the US in 2010 in exchange for the 25 mil reward</p></li>
<li><p>Pakistanis fess up when confronted and threatened and allow US Seal team to fly in and perform the hit</p></li>
<li><p>There was probably no opposition and OBL was assassinated</p></li>
<li><p>Obama had told Spec. Ops he would use a story but instead went public immediately</p></li>
<li><p>Body was probably torn apart by Spec Ops guys, but hard to know--burial at sea story created cover this screw up</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s certainly the most believable account I&#39;ve heard. Sy Hersh, the author, makes it a little problematic. He may just be using his long history and sources to break the story, or it could be limited hangout to create the idea of a &quot;real story.&quot; Considering the Seal Team people who&#39;ve written books that generally agree with his account, my guess is that this is the former and not just limited hangout, but there is really no way to know for sure.</p>

<p>Had read this previously, but always good to post high quality info like this.</p>

<p>I should mention that Osama bin Laden was &quot;officially&quot; killed around 0100 PKT on May 2, which would have been 1400 on May 1 in Austin (where Stratfor is based). These timestamps suggest this chain of emails uses PKT (Pakistan Standard Time) or some nearby timezone, possibly hinting at where Stratfor was operating that day as the emails were sent from BlackBerry phones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who&#39;d have thunk they could be so progressive? Chris Farnham, Stratfor employee, had an additional comment in these emails I thought was fairly telling, however, and obviously looked over:</p>

<p>&quot;Bogus pics and bogus news stories of burials at sea.</p>

<p>Makes the US look dodgy and encourages distrust that the whole thing is
real...., conspiracy, CIA, Illuminati, etc.&quot;</p>

<p>And this comment by Fred Burton has been greatly overlooked when it shows he had intimate knowledge of how this was to be manipulated:</p>

<p>&quot;We told the Pakis after we killed him. But, will praise GOP publicly. All spin and bullshit.&quot;</p>

<p>On top of that, the Fox article says Fred Burton, &quot;believes the body was bound for Dover&quot;, when he doesn&#39;t state any &quot;belief&quot;. Burton is rather matter-of-fact, and as VP of Intelligence I would imagine he needs to have his facts straight before sending off massive amounts of emails (which he did for this subject). He used the high-priority/high-clearance [alpha] list at Stratfor for these messages as well. <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=alpha%40stratfor.com">https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=alpha%40stratfor.com</a></p>

No sense in logging any of your info at Wikileaks if you don&#39;t have to, plus an archive gives you immediate access to whether or not the file changed over time.

    <div class="md"><p>Instead of ranting, learn, go read Sy Hersh&#39;s book: The Killing of Osama Bin Laden.</p>

<p>Great book and Seymour Hersh is credible, after all he broke the the My Lai Massacre. </p>

<p>This sub is weird, there are some informed people here and then there are those that I feel sorry for as they will not research or bother to read. Take this thread, everyone knew the story about burial at sea was a complete fabrication at the time, it&#39;s laughable but it&#39;s a huge revelation when some Strategic Forecasting people speculate  about it.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t even need to read the book, there are multiple interviews with Sy Hersh around, his story and his sources make a lot of sense. </p>
