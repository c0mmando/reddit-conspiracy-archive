    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s tough to participate with the way things currently are... I can work around the spamming and sliding... but the mods not enforcing  the rules of the sub undermines everything. I used to think we had the best mods... now it is obvious some fuckery is afoot... and the mods are complacent. This isn&#39;t gray areas in moderation... this is Memes making it to the frontpage... a clear rule violation. They need to change the rules in the sidebar if they are incapable of enforcing them... I don&#39;t know if it is too much work for them or what... but hiding a topic from someone&#39;s account after they &quot;anonymously&quot; report it does instill trust or transparency... and it doesn&#39;t properly address the issue. </p>

<p>It&#39;s more disappointing than anything... and I used to think they&#39;d never let us get banned like <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> did... but I have my doubt now. If they can&#39;t properly enforce sub rules... then they most likely are incapable of enforcing redditwide rules. </p>

<p>In the new year, we will need to look at this. It&#39;s partly an issue of definition - what exactly constitutes a meme, and partly an issue of not removing posts which already have a high sub approval rating. And there&#39;s the rub, because even though we get complaints about memes, they also get massively upvoted. And...a good meme reaches redditors who wouldn&#39;t normally click on a conspiracy-related post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking about reddit not this sub... Don&#39;t you need to have someone mark that for you to remove it? Or can you just one stop shop to censor whatever you see fit? You can remove that post under some vague catch-all rule... But I hope you know that this is a precedent others might hold you to in the future... There are a few thousand posts more inflammatory than mine... so unless this is just a vendetta you all better be prepared to remove the rest of them when they are marked. </p>

<p>Interesting that you have the ability to remove my posts and have them stay intact on my account... seems like an easy ability to abuse... I&#39;d never know that was removed unless you told me. </p>

Am I also breaking Rule 2 by mentioning it? Are the mods expected to follow the rules of this sub as well? I&#39;m just curious... as I&#39;ve always tried to follow the rules and never ran into a moderation that I felt was unfair... until this one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The SSL certificate for the modlog has been updated in the last couple of days. </p>

<p>You will see that the mods receive hundreds of reports every day, all of which require some sort of response (allow/remove etc). </p>

<p>This sub has been under extreme pressure for the last few weeks. New subscribers are joining at about 500 per day, and that creates friction, some of it ironically from regulars complaining about the disruption (and blaming the mods) because there&#39;s &quot;too much&quot; overflow from Trump supporters, Pizzagate etc. </p>

I don&#39;t complain about the signal to noise ratio here very often... I can work around it, but I&#39;d like to see some consistency between the printed rules and the removed posts... I know it can all be overwhelming but y&#39;all should try to get a handle on it... even if it means removing the rules you cannot enforce any longer.  </p>

<p>Rules 2 and 10 are there to prevent vigilantism, name-calling and other accusations by users against each other. </p>

<p>You, as a mod, should not allow yourself to be used like that also.</p>

<p>I agree I shouldn&#39;t, and I don&#39;t. However, the mods do follow up on complaints and reported comments, and where we believe the rules have been broken, we act.</p>
