       First off - happy holidays to you sadists who still lurk and post here. I know you're a lot more spread out now (you should be) as there are few subs here and there on this site still
       <em>
        fighting the good fight
       </em>
       and receptive to rebuilding.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do have to look, though. But maybe we can change that a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This forum was a great place for me years ago and I have dedicated far more time than I ever imagined here and am grateful for it.

       It's tough to participate with the way things currently are... I can work around the spamming and sliding... but the mods not enforcing  the rules of the sub undermines everything. I used to think we had the best mods... now it is obvious some fuckery is afoot... and the mods are complacent. This isn't gray areas in moderation... this is Memes making it to the frontpage... a clear rule violation. They need to change the rules in the sidebar if they are incapable of enforcing them... I don't know if it is too much work for them or what... but hiding a topic from someone's account after they "anonymously" report it does instill trust or transparency... and it doesn't properly address the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more disappointing than anything... and I used to think they'd never let us get banned like
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate
       </a>
       did... but I have my doubt now. If they can't properly enforce sub rules... then they most likely are incapable of enforcing redditwide rules.

       In the new year, we will need to look at this. It's partly an issue of definition - what exactly constitutes a meme, and partly an issue of not removing posts which already have a high sub approval rating. And there's the rub, because even though we get complaints about memes, they also get massively upvoted. And...a good meme reaches redditors who wouldn't normally click on a conspiracy-related post.

       Just delete all the rules on the sidebar if mods are incapable or unwilling to enforce them... It's hypocritical to let obvious violations of the rules slide, just because the mod on duty at the time happens to think it is a funny or popular meme... Like thers is literally a sub specifically for conspiracy memes.

       I don't know if that's possible... Sabremesh was giving me shit today saying that my posts are clogging up the moderation queue and I better knock it off even though I'm not breaking any rules... and to not worry about other people breaking the rules... just to watch out for myself. Played the bad cop on me... not impartial. Very unprofessional... wasn't even in a private message... was calling me out in a topic.

       You have no clue what you are talking about... Who cares what other people think about my motives when I didn't break any rules? You don't even seem to understand the rules if you think one of them says being a shill is illegal. It's sad...

       I was talking about reddit not this sub... Don't you need to have someone mark that for you to remove it? Or can you just one stop shop to censor whatever you see fit? You can remove that post under some vague catch-all rule... But I hope you know that this is a precedent others might hold you to in the future... There are a few thousand posts more inflammatory than mine... so unless this is just a vendetta you all better be prepared to remove the rest of them when they are marked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting that you have the ability to remove my posts and have them stay intact on my account... seems like an easy ability to abuse... I'd never know that was removed unless you told me.

       I think it is a little heavy handed to remove my post because I said reddit was a "shitshow" with so many blatant rule violations being allowed to slide, you shouldn't take it upon yourself to even bother with ones that fall firmly in the gray area... it just comes across as biased when people are already leery of the mods here. You should do more to promote understanding of the rules... not to manipulate them to suit your agenda... especially if you personally don't have the time to dedicate to keeping your finger on the pulse of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've posted here thousands of times and I take care not to violate the rules...  I've suggested many times how to improve this sub... more consistent enforcement of the rules is the biggest problem right now... and it doesn't help when you take it upon yourself to warn me for disagreeing with you... and not for a blatantly egregious offense.

       As long as you assure me that other similar offenses will be removed in a timely fashion like mine was I will be satisfied... it's a very very grey area between "attacking" and "criticizing" it's all very technical.... but if you want to get technical aren't you breaking Rule 2 right now? Am I also breaking Rule 2 by mentioning it? Are the mods expected to follow the rules of this sub as well? I'm just curious... as I've always tried to follow the rules and never ran into a moderation that I felt was unfair... until this one.

       The SSL certificate for the modlog has been updated in the last couple of days.

       You will see that the mods receive hundreds of reports every day, all of which require some sort of response (allow/remove etc).

       This sub has been under extreme pressure for the last few weeks. New subscribers are joining at about 500 per day, and that creates friction, some of it ironically from regulars complaining about the disruption (and blaming the mods) because there's "too much" overflow from Trump supporters, Pizzagate etc.

       I appreciate you posting about the new Modlog... I hadn't bothered with it since it expired... so it must have been updated in the past couple of days... I don't complain about the signal to noise ratio here very often... I can work around it, but I'd like to see some consistency between the printed rules and the removed posts... I know it can all be overwhelming but y'all should try to get a handle on it... even if it means removing the rules you cannot enforce any longer.

        I think those people who questioned Ninjakick666's motives need to just do so openly so she can address anyone's possible concerns or accusations and not use the mods to do their dirty work for them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rules 2 and 10 are there to prevent vigilantism, name-calling and other accusations by users against each other.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You, as a mod, should not allow yourself to be used like that also.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I agree I shouldn't, and I don't. However, the mods do follow up on complaints and reported comments, and where we believe the rules have been broken, we act.

       Careful... technically what you said is in violation of Rule 10 according to one of the mods...
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing they can do to stop the sliding... only admins have the ability to investigate vote brigading... but at least they could remove the topics that are slid that
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       violate the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never had any problems with Rule 10 being used against me as a catch all censorship method... until today.

       I haven't touched the modlog since Oct 19th specifically because of the expired certificate, but I'll be glad to check it out if it has been renewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is a little heavy handed to remove my post because I said reddit was a "shitshow" with so many blatant rule violations being allowed to slide, you shouldn't take it upon yourself to even bother with ones that fall firmly in the gray area... it just comes across as biased when people are already leery of the mods here. You should do more to promote understanding of the rules... not to manipulate them to suit your agenda... especially if you personally don't have the time to dedicate to keeping your finger on the pulse of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've posted here thousands of times and I take care not to violate the rules...  I've suggested many times how to improve this sub... more consistent enforcement of the rules is the biggest problem right now... and it doesn't help when you take it upon yourself to warn me for disagreeing with you... and not for a blatantly egregious offense.
