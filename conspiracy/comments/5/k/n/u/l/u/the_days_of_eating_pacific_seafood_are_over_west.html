<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/28-signs-that-the-west-coast-is-being-absolutely-fried-with-nuclear-radiation-from-fukushima/5355280">http://www.globalresearch.ca/28-signs-that-the-west-coast-is-being-absolutely-fried-with-nuclear-radiation-from-fukushima/5355280</a></p>

<p>1) Polar bears, seals and walruses along the Alaska coastline are suffering from fur loss and open sores…</p>

<pre><code>Wildlife experts are studying whether fur loss and open sores detected in nine polar bears in recent weeks is widespread and related to similar incidents among seals and walruses.

The bears were among 33 spotted near Barrow, Alaska, during routine survey work along the Arctic coastline. Tests showed they had “alopecia, or loss of fur, and other skin lesions,” the U.S. Geological Survey said in a statement.
</code></pre>

<p>2) There is an epidemic of sea lion deaths along the California coastline…</p>

<pre><code>At island rookeries off the Southern California coast, 45 percent of the pups born in June have died, said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist for the National Marine Fisheries Service based in Seattle. Normally, less than one-third of the pups would die.   It’s gotten so bad in the past two weeks that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared an “unusual mortality event.”
</code></pre>

<p>3) Along the Pacific coast of Canada and the Alaska coastline, the population of sockeye salmon is at a historic low.  Many are blaming Fukushima.</p>

<p>4) Something is causing fish all along the west coast of Canada to bleed from their gills, bellies and eyeballs.</p>

<p>5) A vast field of radioactive debris from Fukushima that is approximately the size of California has crossed the Pacific Ocean and is starting to collide with the west coast.</p>

<p>6) It is being projected that the radioactivity of coastal waters off the U.S. west coast could double over the next five to six years.</p>

<p>7) Experts have found very high levels of cesium-137 in plankton living in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and the west coast.</p>

<p>8) One test in California found that 15 out of 15 bluefin tuna were contaminated with radiation from Fukushima.</p>

<p>9) Back in 2012, the Vancouver Sun reported that cesium-137 was being found in a very high percentage of the fish that Japan was selling to Canada…</p>

<p>• 73 percent of mackerel tested</p>

<p>• 91 percent of the halibut</p>

<p>• 92 percent of the sardines</p>

<p>• 93 percent of the tuna and eel</p>

<p>• 94 percent of the cod and anchovies</p>

<p>• 100 percent of the carp, seaweed, shark and monkfish</p>

<p>10) Canadian authorities are finding extremely high levels of nuclear radiation in certain fish samples…</p>

<pre><code>Some fish samples tested to date have had very high levels of radiation: one sea bass sample collected in July, for example, had 1,000 becquerels per kilogram of cesium.
</code></pre>

<p>11) Some experts believe that we could see very high levels of cancer along the west coast just from people eating contaminated fish…</p>

<pre><code>“Look at what’s going on now: They’re dumping huge amounts of radioactivity into the ocean — no one expected that in 2011,” Daniel Hirsch, a nuclear policy lecturer at the University of California-Santa Cruz, told Global Security Newswire. “We could have large numbers of cancer from ingestion of fish.”
</code></pre>

<p>12) BBC News recently reported that radiation levels around Fukushima are “18 times higher” than previously believed.</p>

<p>13) An EU-funded study concluded that Fukushima released up to 210 quadrillion becquerels of cesium-137 into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>14) Atmospheric radiation from Fukushima reached the west coast of the United States within a few days back in 2011.</p>

<p>15) At this point, 300 tons of contaminated water is pouring into the Pacific Ocean from Fukushima every single day.</p>

<p>16) A senior researcher of marine chemistry at the Japan Meteorological Agency’s Meteorological Research Institute says that “30 billion becquerels of radioactive cesium and 30 billion becquerels of radioactive strontium” are being released into the Pacific Ocean from Fukushima every single day.</p>

<p>17) According to Tepco, a total of somewhere between 20 trillion and 40 trillion becquerels of radioactive tritium have gotten into the Pacific Ocean since the Fukushima disaster first began.</p>

<p>18) According to a professor at Tokyo University, 3 gigabecquerels of cesium-137 are flowing into the port at Fukushima Daiichi every single day.</p>

<p>19) It has been estimated that up to 100 times as much nuclear radiation has been released into the ocean from Fukushima than was released during the entire Chernobyl disaster.</p>

<p>20) One recent study concluded that a very large plume of cesium-137 from the Fukushima disaster will start flowing into U.S. coastal waters early next year…</p>

<p>Ocean simulations showed that the plume of radioactive cesium-137 released by the Fukushima disaster in 2011 could begin flowing into U.S. coastal waters starting in early 2014 and peak in 2016.</p>

<p>21) It is being projected that significant levels of cesium-137 will reach every corner of the Pacific Ocean by the year 2020.</p>

<p>22) It is being projected that the entire Pacific Ocean will soon “have cesium levels 5 to 10 times higher” than what we witnessed during the era of heavy atomic bomb testing in the Pacific many decades ago.</p>

<p>23) The immense amounts of nuclear radiation getting into the water in the Pacific Ocean has caused environmental activist Joe Martino to issue the following warning…</p>

<pre><code>“Your days of eating Pacific Ocean fish are over.”
</code></pre>

<p>24) The Iodine-131, Cesium-137 and Strontium-90 that are constantly coming from Fukushima are going to affect the health of those living the the northern hemisphere for a very, very long time.  Just consider what Harvey Wasserman had to say about this…</p>

<p>Iodine-131, for example, can be ingested into the thyroid, where it emits beta particles (electrons) that damage tissue. A plague of damaged thyroids has already been reported among as many as 40 percent of the children in the Fukushima area. That percentage can only go higher. In developing youngsters, it can stunt both physical and mental growth. Among adults it causes a very wide range of ancillary ailments, including cancer.</p>

<p>Cesium-137 from Fukushima has been found in fish caught as far away as California. It spreads throughout the body, but tends to accumulate in the muscles.</p>

<p>Strontium-90’s half-life is around 29 years. It mimics calcium and goes to our bones.</p>

<p>25) According to a recent Planet Infowars report, the California coastline is being transformed into “a dead zone”…</p>

<p>The California coastline is becoming like a dead zone.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been to a California beach lately, you probably don’t know that the rocks are unnaturally CLEAN – there’s hardly any kelp, barnacles, sea urchins, etc. anymore and the tide pools are similarly eerily devoid of crabs, snails and other scurrying signs of life… and especially as compared to 10 – 15 years ago when one was wise to wear tennis shoes on a trip to the beach in order to avoid cutting one’s feet on all the STUFF of life – broken shells, bones, glass, driftwood, etc.</p>

<p>There are also days when I am hard-pressed to find even a half dozen seagulls and/or terns on the county beach.</p>

<p>You can still find a few gulls trolling the picnic areas and some of the restaurants (with outdoor seating areas) for food, of course, but, when I think back to 10 – 15 years ago, the skies and ALL the beaches were literally filled with seagulls and the haunting sound of their cries both day and night…</p>

<p>NOW it’s unnaturally quiet.</p>

<p>26) A study conducted last year came to the conclusion that radiation from the Fukushima nuclear disaster could negatively affect human life along the west coast of North America from Mexico to Alaska “for decades”.</p>

<p>27) According to the Wall Street Journal, it is being projected that the cleanup of Fukushima could take up to 40 years to complete.</p>

<p>28) Yale Professor Charles Perrow is warning that if the cleanup of Fukushima is not handled with 100% precision that humanity could be threatened “for thousands of years“…</p>

<pre><code>“Conditions in the unit 4 pool, 100 feet from the ground, are perilous, and if any two of the rods touch it could cause a nuclear reaction that would be uncontrollable. The radiation emitted from all these rods, if they are not continually cool and kept separate, would require the evacuation of surrounding areas including Tokyo. Because of the radiation at the site the 6,375 rods in the common storage pool could not be continuously cooled; they would fission and all of humanity will be threatened, for thousands of years.”
</code></pre>

<p>Are you starting to understand why so many people are so deeply concerned about what is going on at Fukushima?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure about that bud? Read up on those GMO crops and talk to some actual farmers. Ask them how their yields are doing after 4 years of GMO. Crop rotation is standard practice in organic and has been for thousands of years. Ask a farmer if they can rotate crops into that tainted soil. Organic isn&#39;t some new thing, it&#39;s just the way it was done before the &quot;green revolution&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That really depends what type of GMO you are talking about - the suicide crops are totally fucked up, yeah.</p>

<p>But the overall yields from GMO&#39;s are the reason that they hold the majority of the market and are the food supply upon which we rely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually not true. Real farmers will tell you the yields are not better with GMO&#39;s. That&#39;s actually a myth. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/02/do-gmo-crops-have-lower-yields">http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/02/do-gmo-crops-have-lower-yields</a></p>

<p>And in a new paper (PDF) funded by the US Department of Agriculture, University of Wisconsin researchers have essentially negated the &quot;more food&quot; argument as well. The researchers looked at data from UW test plots that compared crop yields from various varieties of hybrid corn, some genetically modified and some not, between 1990 and 2010. While some GM varieties delivered small yield gains, others did not. Several even showed lower yields than non-GM counterparts. With the exception of one commonly used trait—a Bt type designed to kill the European corn borer—the authors conclude, &quot;we were surprised not to find strongly positive transgenic yield effects.&quot; Both the glyphosate-tolerant (Roundup Ready) and the Bt trait for corn rootworm caused yields to drop.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the question of so-called &quot;stacked-trait&quot; crops—that is, say, corn engineered to contain multiple added genes—for example, Monsanto&#39;s &quot;Smart Stax&quot; product, which contains both herbicide-tolerant and pesticide-expressing genes. The authors detected what they call &quot;gene interaction&quot; in these crops—genes inserted into them interact with each other in ways that affect yield, often negatively. If multiple genes added to a variety didn&#39;t interact, &quot;the [yield] effect of stacked genes would be equal to the sum of the corresponding single gene effects,&quot; the authors write. Instead, the stacked-trait crops were all over the map. &quot;We found strong evidence of gene interactions among transgenic traits when they are stacked,&quot; they write. Most of those effects were negative—i.e., yield was reduced.</p>

<p>Overall, the report uncovers evidence of what is known as &quot;yield drag&quot;—the idea that manipulating the genome of a plant variety causes unintended changes in the way it grows, causing it to be less productive.</p>

<p>Not true, don&#39;t believe the agit-prop spewed by Bayer/Monsanto, I and many other grow organically and have no problems producing yields that meet or surpass expectations based upon the need.

    <div class="md"><p>It is also too close to China and to Korea for them to have wanted it to happen. The most likely folks to have wanted it to happen, in my opinion, were the British and the Israelis. </p>

<p>Who had access to HAARP? I think the Israelis did. They also used the Stuxnet computer virus previously on the Iranians in order to damage their nuclear program.  It would take a certain kind of person to want to cause that much global destruction, sort of like when the folks at BP DELIBERATELY blew up an oil well in the Gulf of Mexico on 4/20. </p>

<p>I see it as &#39;secret&#39; (in your face) biological warfare. Our president is in on it, IMO. Obama showed himself to be a traitor to the US by the way he let the BP oil attack on the American food supply go completely unanswered. </p>

<p>I would have considered it an act of war; he catered to them instead and acted like it was not even important. He demonstrated he was more supportive of the global banking cartel then he was in the food security of his own nation. I think that is treason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could not agree with you more.  HAARP is def a strange technology, it just would be nice to know when they are powering it up to correlate the usage to events.  Like CERN.  So, if what you surmise is true, then it must also be that the elites that are causing this also have a way to cleanse their bodies from these isotopes.  Not only that, they must also have a way of cleaning the earth of them as well.  I just have this feeling that we are like flies to some other species that lives here too.  Our life spans are probably a few days to them so they have no problem planning all of this stuff out centuries in advance.  Way too easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guarantee you it&#39;s much more about cost than about knowing what to do. They could break apart everything there, mix it with a heavy amount of Boron, and drop it into barrels. They could then safety date the barrels with expected unsafe until date markings, and ship them out to cat island or bury them ultradeep.</p>

<p>The tech to do all this requires enormous outlays of capital because of the robotics, and protective gear and life insurance payouts to people working it. However, once it&#39;s finally done, then they have a company which could have a record doing this. Unfortunately, the market for fixing nuclear disasters is not that high. Maybe if a reactor went off in a really well to do area, they would pay for that. Otherwise, no.</p>

The truth is, it&#39;s about money and the fact that they don&#39;t want to admit what they did and didn&#39;t do. They cut corners in the construction and stupidly built it on a site vulnerable to possible earthquake and Tsunami damage.

</blockquote>

<p>Removing fuel rods that weigh a few <em>tons</em> isn&#39;t a fast process when everything&#39;s going fine! (Uranium is heavier than lead!)</p>

<p>Now, the fuel rods are damaged as it the computer controlled cranes that once lifted them in and out and moved them around are broken, how do you do it?.</p>

<p>So the problem is both to get a device in there <em>capable of</em> removing the damaged fuel rods and putting them in &#39;barrels&#39; as you suggest.</p>

<p>In fact they are stored in groups of 6 or 8 in special containers full of water. IIRC The fuel rods are roughly 12&quot; in a squarish <em>but complex and somewhat fragile</em> shape, (nobody expected them to be treated badly by an earthquake)  and they&#39;re about 10&#39; long and weigh over a ton each.</p>

<p>Basically it&#39;s a ridiculously fucking hard job to do and nobodies got the equipment to do it! So Tepco, the mob who run the place are just doing what they can to &quot;contain&quot; this radiative &#39;leakage&#39; whilst scienfists of all sorts come up with methods to access and remove these damaged rods.</p>

<p>Unsolved Big Problems: These control rods burst into fire If exposed to air, so it ALL has to be done underwater in a very radioactively &#39;hot&#39; area using robots which are still being developed!</p>

<p>We were fucked as soon as it happened, this contamination was inevitable once these facts were known.</p>

<p>I just watched the first half of an Australin (SBS TV IIRC) 2016 documentary about Fukishima, and the whole situation&#39;s completely FUBAR! We <em>need</em> some help from some alien friends, <em>badly</em>!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A secret you may not know. </p>

<p>The answer for where is the plutonium...</p>

<p>Plutonium is an actinide. As nuclear fuel decay&#39;s it produces bi products, such as cesium, iodine, iodide, californium, americium, strontium, polonium, iron, lead, etc...</p>

<p>There are 2000+ bi products associated with a meltdown scenario; 
Some biproducts are unknown completely; These are technically called &quot;strangelets&quot;. </p>

<p>So you ask yourself where is all the plutonium?</p>

<p>The cesium is the plutonium; The iodide is the plutonium...</p>

<p>These atoms represent it, and carry it in nano structures; All that you have been eating, drinking, and breathing was the plutonium itself; </p>

<p>Hence where is it?</p>

<p>It is everywhere-</p>

<p>Food for thought;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is Bs., not only the Japanese actually looked for all Actinides but it is so minuscule,
you get access via scholar.google.com for the right Information,
you just need to look for it.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For soil samples collected in Mito, Chiba, and Kamagaya Cities, although 137Cs activities were significantly higher than the activity level before the accident (Table 1), for example, the Kamagaya soil sample 2 (0–2 cm) collected on the grounds of a Japanese shrine, near the drain pipes from a building roof, had a 137Cs activity of 11429±88 mBq/g, the 239+240Pu activities and 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios were the typical values of the global fallout and no 241Pu could be detected. We concluded this Pu was consistent with global fallout origin. If any, the Fukushima source contribution to the total Pu activity was negligible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are making an off topic point. </p>

<p>Plutonium is the radioactive decay. Which is true;</p>

<p>For instance. You have a candle. You light the candle. The carbon released contains a fractional amount of parafin. </p>

<p>Thus the carbon is the parafin. most the candles (decay) is literally vaporized by the flame; However you smell the parafin (because at an atomic scale) small traces of parafin are atomically denatured and renatured along with the carbon molecules themselves. </p>

<p>So it isn&#39;t b.s. The cesium products are there because the plutonium and uranium actinides have decayed. Hence nuclear decay. This is just a general explanation. You don&#39;t have to get all technical with the mathematics principals of the contamination itself in this argument. I didn&#39;t state specific levels of contamination. Only that the contamination &quot;itself&quot; are the melted actinides. sheesh</p>

<p>The Ombudsman opened an inquiry to obtain precise information on the maximum permitted levels before and after the Fukushima accident. In its opinion, the Commission explained that immediately after the accident, the EU activated the emergency mechanisms it had adopted in the wake of the Chernobyl accident. These included maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination for foodstuffs, such as baby food or dairy products, as well as for feed. These levels were higher than the Japanese levels. In April 2011, therefore, <strong>the Commission decreased the maximum permitted levels to bring them into line with the Japanese levels.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually they lied/lie much less than People who provide Clickbait like this Article, also this Results and Measurements are Cross-checked and Peer-Reviewed &quot;and more important&quot; they are in Line with our own Measurements!</p>

<p>The People in Japan own more than 350.000 Geiger Counter,
we own real scientific Instruments and it would be nearly impossible
to manipulate our Results.</p>

<p>For us: &quot;Radiation is nothing you can hide&quot; because we know how, where and why we do this!</p>

<p>But People like you can come forward and provide us ca. 20.000.000 Test Results and the personal Data of more than 350.000 People,
in a case you can&#39;t do this your Critique is invalid, pooof!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe that this article has many inaccuracies and very old information.  While a lot of the radiation may be subsiding due to weather and breakdown, there is still a ton of fuel covering many areas.  Let&#39;s be honest, the core is still melted into the ground below which mixes with sea water with the ebb and flow of the tides.  This is also mixing with local aquifers and making its way into drinking water.  Nobody has technology to fix this.  What you point out is a distraction to the bigger problem of clean-up to stop the main problem of the continued pollution, storage of tons of soil in plastic bags right next to the ocean and tons of radioactive water that seemingly cannot be cleaned out.  Please go to fukuleaks.org for some really great information that is drawn from excellent sources.  I also like Iori on fukushima-diary.com</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your Information is wrong, yes- the Cores are still broken but solid and inside of the Containments. They are not in Contact with the Ocean or the Groundwater.</p>

<p>The Cooling Water that passed through this Reactor are stable on 30c.</p>

<p>All the Water in the Tanks got and get filtered permanently,
the only remaing Problem is Tritium.</p>

<p>The Soil of the Decontamination is already under 10.000 Bq/ Kg
and is not a environmental Problem per se, this was and is a Problem because of the Storage Facilities. Now we (People in Japan) opened up a huge one and this Stuff get cleaned up and stored until we find a good Place for it.</p>

<p>We can wash this Soil because Caesium-134/-137 is very Water solvable (it us a kind of Salt/ Alkali)
Washing Soil is a old Process and easy, of course it need Treatment.</p>

<p>I know Fukuleaks, as well as Fukushima Diary, both are disqualified and deeply biased. They are not free of a Interest.</p>

<p>When. you really want to know what is going on you need a &quot;free Access&quot; to <a href="https://scholar.google.co.jp">scholar.google.com</a>  research from there and ask People who know for the Stuff you don&#39;t understand!</p>

<p>We (my Family) was deeply in Panic after the Accident, even evacuated from Japan but returned when our biggest Nightmare didn&#39;t occurred (lost of Containments) we participated in a few different Projects with different Backgrounds (Environmental, Engineering, Sociology nad Politics) and bought our own Instruments.</p>

<p>We changed from being Anti-Nuclear to Pro-Nuclear because we realized how many Lies and wrong Information we consumed in the past, the Lies of A. Gundersen, C. Busby and H. Caldicott done a good work for this process, their Lies opened our Minds!</p>

<p>We still do not want to see this old Reactors (i would close every Plant which is older than 25 Years)  and we don&#39;t want to see this Plants in the Hands of privately owned Cooperations!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no proof that the corium is either inside or outside the building.  They may have said it is, but I do not personally believe it.  Here is an excerpt from extremetech.com</p>

<p>&quot;After first denying that a melt-through had occurred, TEPCO later changed its tune and said that it most likely had, at least at Reactor #1. This means that molten corium flowed completely through the RPV and into the PCV before being stopped by the several meters of concrete within the base. This wasn’t an entirely settled question, however, since radiation measurements and water testing have not found the isotope levels that would be expected if the majority of the corium were in direct contact with the concrete layer beneath the PCV.&quot;</p>

<p>What is to be done with the tritium Mr. Pro Nuclear?  I live in California and just above us in the state of Washington is a site where Nuclear Waste has been stored.  It is leaking into the rivers and groundwater.  Where is a good place to store all of this dangerous fuel for future generations?  Wishful thinking that someone will invent a way to reuse it or recycle it?  That technology actually does exist I believe it is &quot;closed loop&quot;, yet it is not used much.  </p>

<p>I feel for your family and hope for your sake that you are right. I still think nuclear is much too dangerous and costly for such a small amount of power/potential damage it creates. There are so many other ways to create free power, the patents have all been bought and hidden.  The technology exists to run the planet on very little, but we are all fools, we do not demand this technology for all generations, we continue to let the bad people make the poor choices.  </p>

<p>Actually none of the Corium had enough Energy to melt- through the Primary-Containment, this is confirmed through Gas Analysise, Temperature, Water Levels, as well as all Simulation Programs.</p>

<p>See MELCOR (for example)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind the Tritium and think they should release it asap in a controlled Way, the Pacific in front of F1 is not a Bathtube but a massive Ocean with a very powerfull Sea Current!</p>

<p>All in all: they should do this not that often but it is not harming the Earth in that Way that we all die!</p>
