    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of posts like this and here is what annoys me. I don&#39;t believe this sub is pro-government or pro right-wing. I think this sub is just interested in unmasking conspiracies. Trump&#39;s cabinet is fully open information that the media is talking about daily, everyone is talking about how shitty and slimy his picks were. It&#39;s not like anyone is trying to hide the information. So...where&#39;s the conspiracy?</p>

<p>It just so happens that right now, a lot of the hidden information, a lot of the media cover-ups, come from left-wing organizations trying to make sure their agenda is pushed and not harmed.  It&#39;s just where the political climate is at right now, if this subreddit was around in 2004 it would probably seem very left-leaning. </p>

<p>So many sheep! Trump says he will drain the swamp, and promptly staffs the WH with the establishment - former Bush appointees, long-standing Washington Republican leadership, and his top donors. </p>

<p>He says he will prosecute Hillary, then he says never mind. </p>

<p>If these winds change and the media is suddenly silenced, or changes to be supportive of their leader, I would fully expect the types of stories you&#39;re talking about to gain more traction here.</p>

<p>I spent a year observing lie after lie, 24/7, unsubstantiated hit pieces on Trump.  Forgive me if I continue to ignore them when they say Trump is a Russian puppet.  Even if that turned out to be true, I don&#39;t need to come to r/conspiracy to read about it.</p>

<p>And, for the record, I don&#39;t believe there is a Trump-Putin scheme going on, but I don&#39;t understand how pizza-gate is feasible and the Russian influence isn&#39;t.

<p>What conspiracy?</p>

<p>What would the conspiracy be? These are things that President-elect do. And of course HRC would. She took <del>bribes</del> speaking fees from them all the time.</p>

<p>Perhaps you don&#39;t know what the word <em>conspiracy</em> actually means. Check out the sidebar.  It should still be there.</p>

I&#39;d also like to see a breakthrough of evidence for pizzagate. I&#39;ve looked at the emails and all that jazz but no one is going to get prosecuted based purely on what we have now. Victims need to come forward. If this shit is really going on (and I&#39;m almost certain it is) we need testimonies to back it up. Because right now 90% of the population associates &quot;pizzagate&quot; with &quot;fake news&quot; so no one is going to take it seriously. Once again the big wheels win.

    <div class="md"><p>People are certainly allowed to. Simply submit content and members of the community will upvote or downvote. If it&#39;s compelling content then it will certainly be pushed to the sub&#39;s front page.  </p>

<p>The fact that you state there &quot;should&quot; be Trump articles on the front page everyday, regardless of news or insightful content being created, is concerning. The only way for that to happen (besides the organic way mentioned above) is through either vote manipulation or stickies, both of which would be taking measures to control the narrative, as we see with legacy media. </p>

<p>The democratic nature of Reddit is the biggest criticism of the site as a whole. If you&#39;re against that and see it as too great a barrier to free discussion, there are alternatives. The chans, while infamous in the mainstream, have a structure far more allowing to free thought.</p>

<p>My opinion: a lot of the articles against trump are from outlets and writers indoctrinated into the current power structure and propaganda model, so they don&#39;t gain the same traction here as in other subs. </p>

<p>But for now I think before he actually takes office it&#39;s appropriate to surface a lot of the insider stuff that exists that no one wanted to talk about. </p>

<p>And I agree with the above comment that most, if not all, of Trump&#39;s dirtiest existing laundry has already been aired by the media. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that Clinton &amp; Co. are part of military-industrial grade corruption. Trump is many things, but he&#39;s not that. He&#39;s a real estate developer and casino owner. For sure corruption there, but the soccer metaphor I use is that if Clinton is World Cup / FIFA level corruption, by comparison Trump is American Major League Soccer. </p>

<p>Of course, once he takes office that&#39;ll all change. And my hope is that his supporters will hold him and his administration to the same standards they&#39;ve held other administrations. </p>

<p>Note: I did not vote for Trump. :) </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually wondering who Trump supporters wanted to be in those spots.</p>

<p>&quot;Drain the swamp&quot; was so popular. &quot;Let&#39;s get rid of these guys&quot;. </p>

<p>But then Trump appoints Bush people, a wife of arguably the most powerful Republican, the RNC chair lol, top donors, billionaires. </p>

<p>Me, I knew it would be this way, which is why it irked me that &quot;drain the swamp&quot; got any traction. Hell, it practically got him elected. </p>

<p>What alternatives? An actual small business owner at SBA instead of a billionaire top donor. A rust-belt worker or business owner at Sec of Labor instead of the billionaire owner. A sec of state that we know anything about other than that his business stands to gain from offing the Russia embargo, and that he&#39;s friends with Putin. An Attorney General that has actually been practicing law for the last few years instead of being a career politician. A Chief of Staff that is outside the beltway. A Secretary of Energy that knew anything about nuclear physics. This could go on and on. </p>

<p>Trump voters wanted to drain the swamp, but now are realizing the temperature is nice there, apparently. </p>

<p>Who did Trump voters want in these spots? Beltway sheep? Washington norms? Billionaires? Top Donors? I hope so, because that is what they got. </p>

<p>Not at all. There is a pattern to the rise of demagogues. He made empty promises, I&#39;m not surprised at all that people believed them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not trying to put words in your mouth, that is genuinely the sentiment that comes across from many people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I see that as well. I come from a Red state, most of my family and friends are Republican and many voted for Trump. They are smart, compassionate people, many of whom I would trust with my life. </p>

<p>But there is clearly an information problem. A majority of Trump voters actually believe he won the popular vote - which is very clearly false. 65 percent think Obama is a Muslim (this one is bizarre to me). Almost 60 percent still don&#39;t believe Obama was born in the US. 24 percent think Scalia was murdered. </p>

<p><a href="http://crooksandliars.com/2016/12/cnn-hosts-mind-blown-over-pro-trumpers">This video</a> sums it up to me to some extent. Trump made a ridiculous claim backed with absolutely no evidence. It was reported on as exactly that. Yet some Trump supporters - a very good portion judging by the stat above - just believed it because Trump tweeted it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s also not in office yet, and I think it&#39;s best to judge people based on their actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have a lifetime of his actions to think about. We also have his actions since he was elected - appointing swamp-monsters to his Cabinet, threatening to ramp up a nuclear arms race not at the advice of his team of experts, but just by tweeting his thoughts at the moment, rolling back on his campaign promise - one of his most popular - to prosecute Clinton, etc etc etc. </p>

As if there&#39;s something inherently wrong about questioning the narrative &lt;- And <strong>that&#39;s</strong> the culture that has been created.</p>

<p>Your anti-Trump sentiment has blinded you to reality. Your arguments are just simply no good. We&#39;re going to have four to eight years of Trump, and those emotions will get in the way of you discussing his (inevitable!) true corruptions, and lies.</p>

It&#39;s not possible to have a sustained country that&#39;s aware of everything, and that&#39;s why catchphrases, timed media releases and propaganda works.  And on the other side of the table, an honest and educated politician doesn&#39;t have time to explain everything to everyone and still campaign or do their job.</p>

<p>She will probably be fine, she&#39;s given $50,000 or so to Republican congressfolks - although that&#39;s on the low end of Trump appointees. Also way more than I - or most folks - could give away for a political campaign. </p>

<p>Good for her I guess. $50,000 is a big investment for me, but probably nothing for billionaires</p>

<p>The problem is not the people you&#39;re voting for in this election, it&#39;s the system itself that has grown out of 100+ years of corruption and cronyism -- stacking the deck in favor of a certain small group of elite individuals, to the detriment of the common individual. No candidate, even if they whole-heartedly believe they can bring &quot;change we can believe in&quot; or they can &quot;make America great again&quot; can actually do it, because the person or people <em>who really control the American government</em> and policy are not the President, his cabinet or Congress -- it&#39;s the wealthy elite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m neither a republican, democrat or libertarian and I don&#39;t even vote.</p>

<p>And one thing about Regan.  He wasn&#39;t even supposed to be the Republican candidate for presidency.  George Bush Sr. was supposed to be the candidate but since Regan was such a popular guy, he got all the votes.  And then some dude named John Hinkley Jr. tried to assassinate Regan so Bush Sr. could take over as POTUS.  </p>

<p><a href="http://whowhatwhy.org/2016/08/16/bush-angle-reagan-shooting-still-unresolved-hinckley-walks/">http://whowhatwhy.org/2016/08/16/bush-angle-reagan-shooting-still-unresolved-hinckley-walks/</a></p>

<p>From article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine my fascination, then, to learn that John Hinckley Jr., the man who shot and nearly killed President Ronald Reagan in 1981 — an attempt which, if successful, would have resulted in then-Vice President George H.W. Bush moving up to the top spot — was none other than a friend of the Bush family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then recently, they released Hinkley Jr. from prison.  This is a guy who tried to assassinate a world leader and do you think they would have let him out if Regan was still alive and didn&#39;t have Alzheimers? </p>

<p>That&#39;s not true. It goes through cycles, we have data for around 400000 years back and it usually goes through a consistent cycle. However, over the last ~100 years it has spiked to a high that we have no record of it ever being. Denying climate change is literally saying that our actions have no impact/consequences. </p>

<p>So let me get this straight, you care more about the former candidate&#39;s foreign interests than the actual President-elect? That is so bizarre to me. At least Clinton released her tax returns.

<p>First, I&#39;m sorry to break this to you, but at least 6 of his major appointees so far are donors. A third of people who have met with him since his election were donors, giving him millions. Second, what pay to play scheme are you referring to, if not Trump&#39;s? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Clinton&#39;s email was never hacked. Meanwhile, Trump tweets about classified briefings and makes calls to world leaders on an unsecured line, and people don&#39;t seem bothered by it. </p>

<p>No, I care about S.o.S Clinton&#39;s mishandling of classified info, possible obstruction of justice by deleting massive amounts emails, destroying devices etc., evidence of pay-to-play scheme and the <strong>years</strong> long investigation into the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>Not to say I don&#39;t care about possible conflicts of interest on the part of Trump.

If there&#39;s an investigation or even a certain well reputed publisher of leak government info, I will totally take a look at it.</p>

<p>Which bank was it that sent over the list to the DNC on who they thought should be in Obama&#39;s cabinet? How many of those names did in fact end up in his cabinet?

<p>Yes. They were. One word: Guccifer. The DNC and Podesta emails were not hacked. Assange hinted at an insider. Could it be the DNC staff person in charge of updating voter registrations for the DNC who was murdered on the street by a supposed thug who didn&#39;t even bother to take his watch, phone, or wallet. Geezus, get your story straight.</p>

<p>Trump tweets that he <em>has/had</em> classified briefings. But I don&#39;t see him tweeting about the content of said briefings.</p>

<p>Though, I&#39;m pretty sure that as the President, he&#39;ll be able to pretty much say whatever the fuck he wants. Personally I hope he tells us what really happened on the Grassy Knoll.</p>

<p>I&#39;m about in tears right now. This is literally you right now:</p>

<p>&quot;Trump might be corrupt, but I don&#39;t have any solid proof. But don&#39;t point fingers at Hillary because she already lost and all that mumbo jumbo about emails and whatnot was just politics.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just politics, friendo. This is about one of the most corrupt individuals who almost got the WH, and thus almost got away with it plus much much more.</p>

<p>Oh my god dude. Democrats dug their own grave. They allied themselves with banks and big business at the expense of the People. They pushed to pass trade deals that threatened to destroy what&#39;s left of the middle class, and wouldn&#39;t even let the average joe look at them. They continued 2 wars from the previous administration after campaigning to end them, and took it a step further by starting up many more (Libya, Yemen, Syria to name a few).</p>

<p>I&#39;ll question the Trump admin just like I questioned the Obama and Bush admins before him (too young to vote for Clinton 1).</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly concerned about Trump&#39;s stance on Israel. Some of his appointments have my eyebrows raised, but he&#39;s pulled a few &#39;ta-das&#39; out of his sleeve, so I&#39;m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt for now. When I voted for Obama in 08, there were a lot of promises, and shit went south real fast. Shits not going south quite as fast, so I&#39;m going to wait a bit before I pass premature judgement. Besides, the girls don&#39;t like a man who is premature ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair question. I can only speak from my point of view.</p>

<p>Clinton broke the law as the Secretary of State. That&#39;s not like &quot;manager of a DMV&quot; position. That&#39;s one of the most powerful E. Branch positions.</p>

<p>She also didn&#39;t just jaywalk. She broke Statutes under the Espionage Act. At best, she did so ignorantly, but did not report the mistep immediately. At worst, she knowingly removed classified info or directed others to do so. Both carry similar penalties.</p>

<p>So Why does this matter now? She was a former S.o.S. We cannot let her off the hook for what she did. It would set a terrible precedent (if not already set).</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just the emails. As Trey Gowdy replied, whether she considered Clinton Foundation emails to be work related is &quot;not the million dollar question, that&#39;s the 100 million dollar question.&quot; I must remind you, that there is an ongoing, multi-year long investigation going on into the CF.</p>

<p>Sure, Trump didn&#39;t release his taxes. I honestly would love to see what&#39;s in there. But that&#39;s pure speculation. When evidence comes out from credible sources (Wikileaks would be great), I&#39;ll happily take a look at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what? She already lost. Nobody mentioned her, we attacked Trump for good reasons and you mentioned Hillary as if she had something to do, as if there existed a binary when that when someone says anything bad about Trump, then they must support Hillary.</p>

<p>Let it go. People are not trying to put away any scandal by mentioning things against Trump, they can think about more than one thing at a time. Anyway, Clinton doesn&#39;t hold power anymore; Trump does. His choices and his shortcoming are more important than Hillary&#39;s</p>

<p>Edit: There are people who broke the Espionage act under Trump&#39;s gabinet. She has been investigated more than once, let it go. She had a private server out of ignorance, she knows how dumb that was now. It&#39;s not the most terrible crime as would be ties with the mafia, for example. We are talking about Trump now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A perfect storm: a huge market collapse (Dow at 20,000? Why? That&#39;s way overvalued given we are a nation of unemployed college debtors, retirees, bartenders, or unemployed leeches) or maybe societal collapse brought by a false flag attack (EMP?). Couple that with worldwide skirmishes (China/Taiwan, India/Pakistan, more Middle East business as usual, European civil war, and increased proxy battle between Russia and the US, all burgeoning to large-scale war. Throw in a pandemic and survival rates will drop  to a manageable 10% of what it is now, just as the prescient Georgia Guidestones call for.

    <div class="md"><p>Something is 100% going to happen but what and exactly when is totally up in the air, likely a combination of so many different possibilities.   My personal immediate worry is the police. It&#39;s clear the majority of them have been totally brainwashed, are completely hyped up and it will only get worse as resistance to the system continues to grow.  We know exactly what humans in their specific position can do.  I&#39;m not anti-police in theory but no one can afford to be stupid about this one.  They are armed and militarized agents of the state trained to be afraid for their lives, protect the elite&#39;s property and infrastructure and have an us vs. them mentality.   </p>

<p>My hope is that people will be ready to build communities with each other  and help each other by sharing knowledge, skills and resources because that is the only way forward.  There are other ways we can live that are comfortable, responsible and sensible. The time to start manifesting all those good ideas we all have about how we&#39;d like to be living is RIGHT NOW.  That &quot;be the change&quot; thing is no joke. It&#39;s all possible even if we have to give up some things that don&#39;t serve us and do some work.</p>

<p>The good news is that no matter what kind of failure Trump will be, he is NOT hillary clinton and we surely bought ourselves some time and a last chance.  Clinton would have been game over. </p>

<p>That is of course optimistic but I think it&#39;s very important to be focused on optimistic (yet not delusional) outcomes.  </p>

<p>I also recommend everyone work on themselves physically, getting as healthy as possible including getting your immune system going.  At least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the entire point of this sub:  <em>skepticism</em>. Being skeptical about a sub devoted to being skeptical is kind of an oxymoron: you&#39;re being skeptical about being skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>alright, well we&#39;re made up of little particles of energy that combine into atoms whose speed and proximity to other atoms creates larger forms, some of which are capable of autonomy and communication. </p>

<p>they can move, talk, and consume and create, and even have their own information banks that help dictate how to use this autonomy. </p>

<p>some of these forms have abnormally large information banks and also have appendages that allow easier manipulation of their surroundings, and as such have developed technologies and social structures to ensure survival under most scenarios. </p>

<p>these forms are good at thinking up every possibility to prepare for anything. </p>

<p>but the problem is that there is more information in the world than can be grasped, so these forms have to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; often when it comes to making a complete grasp of their world. </p>

<p>because of this, it is often that they often rely on paranoia to survive. this is okay sometimes, like when avoiding immediate danger, but is very risky when acting on assumptions that haven&#39;t been properly analyzed and proven. </p>

<p>as such, there have been techniques that have been developed to attain the best understanding of our universe, such as the scientific method, mathematical proofs, and logical reasoning. </p>

<p>when exploring what is or isn&#39;t possible about our universe as well as our current state of being, it&#39;s best to use the tools at our disposal to come best to a conclusion before acting on it. </p>

<p>So is this sub going to be pro-government for the next 4 years? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the government gets its shit together and does what it&#39;s supposed to do?  Sure.  Why not?</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t an anti/against the government sub.  This sub is a sub designed to draw out, expose, critically examine, and attempt to stop the corruption going on in the world.</p>

<p>It just so happens that there&#39;s a LOT of corruption in the government, so naturally a lot of awake people are necessarily very critical of the government.  That&#39;s not because it&#39;s the government <em>in principle</em>.  No.  That would be silly and make no sense to criticize a government or group simply because they ARE THAT GROUP.  You criticize and work against a group if that group has proven itself to be nefarious and NOT working toward the greater good.</p>

<p>Government currently works against the greater good - so it should rightly and absolutely be criticized.  If it turns its shit around and does right, then it should absolutely be supported.</p>

<p>So you have it all wrong, OP.  It&#39;s not about supporting or not supporting the government.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about supporting what is <em>right</em> and fighting against what is wrong.  The government is to a great extent wrong, so a lot of people here are (again, rightly) critical of it.  If it gets its shit straight, then it <em>should</em> be supported.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t think TPTB or the government will get its shit straight, but that&#39;s actually kind of beside the greater point here.</p>

You&#39;re not getting down voted solely bc of people thinking trump can do no wrong, but also because this is a long winded version of saying &quot;DAE THINK TRUMP IS DOING BAD THING&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton is still at the center of an international conspiracy that has taken down nations in the name of profits. Exposing her and that conspiracy will hopefully take down a lot of people still in government here in the US and around the globe. Possibly even some of the people with the incoming administration.</p>

<p>Clinton is really, really dirty. And she was megalomanical and narcissistic enough to think that her dirtiness wouldn&#39;t matter for her 2nd run at the Presidency.</p>

<p>Trump is frankly doing what anyone would expect Trump to have done. None of his actions are surprising in light of the radical Republicans and his own personal corruption. When Trump starts wars with countries and lets the oligarchs roll and the pedos who serve with him order pizza every day, well then . . . .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For fuck sakes, I hope not, and I gladly voted for Trump and am cautiously hopeful to see what he does. Notice I say hopeful, but not optimistic.</p>

<p>The reason we quickly go over Hillary&#39;s crimes is because there are miles and miles of material that is now public record to criticize, before you even need to take a scratch at the speculative horror stuff.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s dirt to present isn&#39;t really all that bad. Compared to what I would call his peers, he is practically a saint. One of the most compelling arguments for his relative cleanliness, is we know Hillary moved vast and powerful resources with the sole purpose of digging up dirt on him. And we didn&#39;t even get a sex tape. We got an old horny rich guy talking about grabbing pussy, and some vaporware rape cases.</p>

<p>We will have plenty of material to criticise soon enough once Trump actually is in a place to do something. Right now all we can do is speculate on what he <em>might</em> do. Hillary and Bill have actually done more than their fare share. I hope you see the difference.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, we can start with what we have. He has appointed Bush appointees, wives of Republican leadership, billionaires and top donors, and establishment (i.e., long-term Washington Republican insiders) to his top team. </p>

<p>I have a feel for what this guy will do. He will be an establishment President, and this sub will apparently talk about pizza for four years without questioning the President&#39;s foreign business interests. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been saying it a long time and anyone who knows me from the interwebs knows that I&#39;ve said -- conspiracy theories, in general, are a result of the right wing propaganda machine. </p>

<p>Now that they have their man in power, they are flooding conspiracy sites with pro trump, pro white propaganda. This has been the plan all along. </p>

<p>It all started with the Libertarian party of old, which morphed into the modern day Tea Party. We are talking, before, LaRouche and Koch brothers, namely. They created these anti government narratives which people clung to cause hey, who wouldn&#39;t? It was and is sexy. </p>

<p>Basically what I am trying to say is that conspiracy theory has gone mainstream by way of design and that is exactly what &quot;they&quot; have wanted, not some shady cabal of sorcerrers, but rather the people who have money, and want to keep it that way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump hasn&#39;t actually assumed power yet. From my experience, it takes about four to six months before much real implementation of policy(e.g., the Bush tax cuts) unless it&#39;s a reversal or continuation of the previous administrations&#39; policies(e.g. 2008/9 fiscal crisis legislation). All Trump&#39;s done is assigned some cabinet positions and the Senate still has to have hearings.</p>

<p>This is a sub that hates the amoral/immoral exercise of power. So far Trump hasn&#39;t done much except tweet some more bullshit. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll get into higher gear as actual policy gets put forward.</p>
