    <div class="md"><p>All I ever hear about pizzagate is that there is no actual evidence, just a lot of circumstantial shit that doesn&#39;t amount to anything.  While this may be true, if you look at everything that has come out in the last couple months objectively it looks really really fucking strange.  Shit like this just adds to the already enormous amount of circumstantial evidence that screams something is going on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me that &quot;evidence&quot; doesn&#39;t matter to them. We would literally need to see video footage in HD porn style camera work and the faces of the Clintons in the video to even start making this a real investigation. Even then I doubt they or others involved would ever stand trial because of how many powerful people are involved. Evidence seems to matter less and less depending on who is indicated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it should be investigated, but by those with the authority to subpoena documents and bring them to trial. Surely this amount of circumstantial evidence is enough to open a formal investigation to find some hard evidence (or not), but it does not seem to be so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I see, you&#39;ve given incredibly specific rules by which any evidence could possibly contribute to the pizzagate story.

    <div class="md"><p>Incredibly specific rules? Give me a fucking break. if you&#39;re making specific allegations, then, yes, you provide evidence about <em>those</em> allegations.</p>

<p>Bringing up Cathy O&#39;Brien is twisted, shitty logic. It&#39;s like me saying that Ibespwn is a chronic drunk driver, and when asked for proof pointing to <a href="http://cbs6albany.com/news/local/repeat-drunk-driver-sentenced-for-role-in-crash">this guy</a>.</p>

<p>See, because chronic drunk drivers exist, therefore that&#39;s evidence that <em>you</em> are a chronic drunk driver.</p>

<p>So once again, show us an actual victim or witness or person claiming they or someone they know was abused there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something is going on but it most likely has nothing to do with pizzagate and it most likely has been going on for some time now, and we already know how powerful some of these rings are, I mean look at how long Jimmy Savale was able to operate in England, and there were victims coming out and accusing people that were ranked pretty high in the government over there. Then look at the case surrounding Penn St. or the accusations that have been made every few years about Hollywood. There are definitely rings that include some well placed people all across the world.</p>

<p>As for Pizzagate, the bad thing about pizzagate was all of the amateur investigations that were being sourced on the web but most of the investigators were only seeking to confirm their biases by establishing connections to Clinton, this clouded the investigation and forced people to make connection that were tedious at best and non-existing at the worst, and we obviously had some crazy dude run up in one of the locations looking to find evidence and shoot people, that&#39;s never a good thing, and even worse they were going after people and places with death threats that probably never had anything to do with anything other than they made pizza for one DNC event or another, as pizza is the cheapest and easiest thing to purchase for any large gathering. </p>

<p>But there is a silver lining that shines from pizzagate, we&#39;ve upped the public awareness that there are real actual pedo rings happening, and honestly if anybody pays any attention to the local news we bust the non-protected rings on nearly a weekly basis but the protected rings we can&#39;t because they have law enforcement in their back pocket, they have politicians that are either involved or they have leverage over, they have wealthy cohorts that can shield them using their security, lawyers, and friends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Let&#39;s now acknowledge that many historic  &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; about paedophile rings were probably correct.<br/>
But let&#39;s also totally avoid the possibility that the same sort of child abuse rings are still happening.<br/>
Specifically, anything Pizza Comet,<br/>
James Alefantis, a fictitious deed-poll name change.<br/>
James Alefantis, anagram for J&#39;aime Les Enfants. 
French to English translation:<br/>
J&#39;aime Les Enfants  = I Love Kids<br/>
Let&#39;s ignore his Instagram posts. And those of his followers. Especially those with financial connections to Pizza Comet.         </p>

I&#39;m looking at reality and tangible proof yet you still want to circlejerk to pizzagate, and that&#39;s fine I guess, but isn&#39;t this just taking your eye off the ball to chase cars?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It must be a pretty narrow world you live in when anyone with even a slightly different opinion than yours is trying to undermine you. </p>

<p>How about taking the olive branch that myself and others like me who are seeing the same consistencies and want to see justice served, but no why build a bridge and find allies when you can have your pathetic righteous indignation and pointlessly jab at one of your peers rather than one of the enemy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah because pizzagate still has legs right? The MSM is against it, every day it seems like more and more people are realizing that there is no evidence and pizzagate was just a biased red herring, yet I have some cause that&#39;s lost, sure, because the majority of people believe in conspiracies right? I think you might be a tad delusional.</p>

<p>Let me know when you and like minded others want to actually go after real pedo rings rather than circlejerking to your own importance, pizzagate is the lost cause, but these rings are really happening and needs to be dragged out into the light. </p>

<p>You have to face the truth.</p>

<p>There wasn&#39;t any investigation and there still isn&#39;t any investigation into Pizzagate except by the &quot;amateurs&quot;.</p>

<p>But I find some of these &quot;amateur&quot; videos pretty informative and I&#39;d rather have seen them than not seeing them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and that&#39;s fine, if amateur is all we&#39;re going to get that&#39;s all we can do, for now, but amateur hour shit is what happens when it&#39;s only amateurs, like the idiot running into the pizza place looking for enslaved kids. </p>

<p>Regardless of whatever, the authorities need to stop bullshitting around and actually investigate this thing so that we can have professionally gathered evidence. But the thing about that is even if we do gain professionally gathered evidence and it&#39;s not enough or it starts looking like pizzagate really is a hoax. </p>

<p>However even if that happens we&#39;ll just move the goalposts and keep on beating the drum for Hillary and Bill&#39;s heads because that&#39;s what happens when you&#39;re biased against something, eventually you get to the point where you just want to be right, you just want to win, and you just want those people you perceive are enemies to be brought low before you, whether they are actually guilty or not, because that&#39;s how bias works, and that&#39;s how pizzagate came into fruition, by milking that anti-Hillary bias, and biased people don&#39;t care about justice they just want vindication and vengeance.</p>

<p>You want a great example of bias just read or watch the Green Mile, they put John Coffee away for the rape and murder of two white girls without even a second thought, why? Because he&#39;s black, and they were biased against a black man, just like it&#39;s happened over and over again in the South during the early to mid 1900&#39;s. Different scenario but when people like you or like the other guy that commented back to me talk that&#39;s the same feeling I get, people are ready for a good lynching but this time they want it to be the Clinton&#39;s in the noose.</p>

<p>Not with that attitude they&#39;re not. Listen we have to push for it, and the people that believe pizzagate, like yourself obviously, and the people that I&#39;m probably grouped into, those who want to know, those who just want to see justice served, and those who just want to see the authorities find nothing, need to all group together and work together to push to get a real investigation to happen. </p>

<p>I mean you can&#39;t get anything done by giving up and you can&#39;t get anything done when your group is on it&#39;s own, so work with the rest of us that want to see something done about this and lets figure out how to at least get an investigation into it going, that&#39;s at least a start and more than you pizzagaters have now. From there you can move the goalposts however you like but bear in mind every time a goalpost is moved you lose credibility and so does your cause.</p>

<p>Pedophilia by the rich and elite didn&#39;t just start happening, it&#39;s been going on for a very long time and there hasn&#39;t been any real investigations because the investigations usually get squashed before it gets too far.  </p>

<p>As amateur as Pizzagate is, it&#39;s been the closest thing that the public has gotten to a real investigation into pedophilia by the rich and famous.  I mean look at how all the MSM outlets are attacking Pizzagate in which none of those assholes investigated.  </p>

<p>Actually I think I get it far better than you do, I get that most anything caves with pressure, I get that the MSM is one source but once any kind of real evidence comes out it&#39;s going to be like a flood. </p>

<p>Also I get the historical significance of pedo rings, I mean shit didn&#39;t the Spartans get assigned their own boy to fuck and train? And the Romans would pretty much stick their dicks into anything, including a boy that was forced to dress like a girl, that I believe it was Caligula or another batshit crazy Roman emperor, there are so many to choose from. I&#39;m sure the kings did it, the lords, and so on and so forth, so I get the historical significance both in ancient and modern times, so don&#39;t act like I&#39;m some stupid git that doesn&#39;t understand what we&#39;re up against, that shit is so condescending.</p>

<p>I mean look at how all the MSM outlets are attacking Pizzagate in which none of those assholes investigated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to stop bitching about the MSM stuff though, it&#39;s like a crutch, the problem is getting the authorities to investigate, the MSM will begrudgingly be dragged along, they have no choice, plus the ratings will force them to go along, because at the end of the day the only thing they really care about since ratings = profits, and coverage of this will be big. </p>

<p>So I say all of that with this, focus on getting the authorities to investigate or shut the fuck up, stop bitching about the MSM, stop bitching about people who don&#39;t believe in it, because there is no solid proof so far to believe in so bitching about it is retarded. Also without the authorities getting involved, being pressured to get involved and all of that there is nothing right now. So stop whining about the MSM, stop whining about the powerful figures protecting them and focus on what we can do about finding out if this is actually a hoax or not, because that is what really matters to those of us interested in this topic, is it a hoax or is it true, nothing else matters about this topic except for answering those questions right now. </p>

<p>Once those questions are answered then we can save the kids and bring the pieces of shit involved to justice, or maybe just a good lynching, but I&#39;d definitely prefer justice.</p>

<p>Like I said you&#39;re now being a condescending prick, and I fully realize the DC police aren&#39;t investigating, that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying that they need their feet held to the fire and we need to utilize things like the MSM to force the issue with them. Anything is a resource once you learn how to use it, the MSM included, but more importantly the local news stations, they go after the smaller stuff and sometimes they unravel something bigger, but they are always hunting for stories.</p>

<p>Dude I was a Marine, wtf have you volunteered to do for this country? Once again being a condescending prick again. I honor and defend the constitution, and with my freedom of speech I told you that you should stfu if you&#39;re not going to be useful and try to help get a real investigation started, it&#39;s my opinion not an order dumbass. You don&#39;t have to listen to me but I also don&#39;t have to pretend that you&#39;re not dumb for not listening.</p>

<p>Sure you can keep fruitlessly bitching about the MSM because that&#39;s been useful so far right? You need proof first, which pizzagate does not have, otherwise no media outlet is even going to be interested for fear of having to submit a retraction, which is like a big black mark on people&#39;s careers when that happens, maybe that&#39;s why only investigative reporters are even sniffing this. But I&#39;m sure this is also pressure from someone at the top of the food chains. </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is focus on making the investigation happen, anything else is circlejerking because no moves are going to be made until real evidence is gathered by someone who either finds overwhelming hard evidence, or a professional gathering evidence in a professional manner. But honestly at this point I don&#39;t care, you&#39;re going to do what you want to do, you&#39;ll continue throwing tantrums and gaining no ground and I&#39;ll just find someone who will be amicable to listening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Authority is rooted in the word &quot;Author&quot; or in case of a morally and legally corrupt to the bone government, authors. Authors, who basically dictate the story and the narrative. That&#39;s why they are afraid of what they suddenly call fake news, when back then when it was stories that didn&#39;t seem to rock the boat like pedogate/pizzagate does, they would call hoaxes and be done with it in a 48 hour news circle, maybe 72.</p>

<p>Since the US government, well, Congress of all bodies of government, the one with a single digit approval percentage, legalized what used to be illegal before that, propaganda abroad was &quot;fine&quot;, voice of america even though even some cnn talking head will admit is biased, a law banning propaganda towards Americans was struck out by a bill from congress in 2012, effectively legalizing propaganda. So right now they finally decide what reality is and if you against the narrative and it rocks the boat too much, they had a weapon waiting for that, although I can&#39;t say it&#39;s working much, it ensures nobody will be indicted, no life prison terms or firing squads. They&#39;ve protected themselves this way because they started feeling threatened that the Internet (the collective mind of the english speaking people in our case, no matter where they are, although those in the 5 eyes + a few other countries mostly are in that group which is in the crosshairs of insane psychotic bitches like say Theresa May) when people would find out that every strange things occuring before 2012 was studied and usually debunked by the public...a good example is the Bin Laden raid where they had about 6 scenarios until they gave up trying to give you (I&#39;m not American) a scenario that makes any sense of that psyop.</p>

<p>They&#39;re authoring what&#39;s real and what&#39;s not, that&#39;s something that&#39;s gonna be hard to be break for you guys. It&#39;s not as bad as say in the UK (I live in a 5 eye country where the rapidly passed patriot act-like bill is being deconstructed slowly, we only had 2 very lame and tiny incidents, the second (they always happen in clusters of 2 did you notice?) </p>

<p>Those SCADS (state crimes against democracy) as Prof. Laurence de Haven of University of Tallahassee calls em in the book he wrote in his surprisingly published &quot;Conspiracy Theory in America&quot; where about a hundred conspiracies committed by the US government are analyzed, there was supposed to be more, but, for instant, he couldn&#39;t get Fred Hampton&#39;s murder when the FBI decided to start killing any would-be replacement of MLK, didn&#39;t get the peer review support to have that one in for example. I think I&#39;m in the only country in the 5 eyes without a patriot act-like bill, well there is one installed by the previous government, right now the slightly left Liberal party is cancelling the most egregious sections....slowly as hell, but it&#39;s better than nothing. </p>

<p>I actually can&#39;t believe our friends the Kiwis have something like that ont he books that doesn&#39;t have major pushback from the population.</p>

<p>Depends on the situation but typically some sort of primary source or a collection of primary/secondary sources that can be cited to build a case. They can be anonymous to an extent if the case built is compelling.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Depends on the situation. I spent several days looking into pizzagate even though it appeared to be BS simply because the cost/benefit ratio... potential harm to children is a big enough deal most anything should be considered.</p>

<p>I would say that - if Podesta consistently uses those words in very odd contexts in bi-lateral communication with his &quot;circle&quot; (people close enough to him to have his email / get an email response from him) - surely that is sufficient to establish that these words may be routinely used by Podesta as code for something other than their dictionary meaning (food).</p>

<p>If Podesta is using code words in his emails to multiple individuals close to him (this is the literal definition of &quot;conspiracy&quot; - multiple individuals within a group working together) - Surely that is enough to warrant further investigation.</p>

<p>Do you disagree?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have not established that Podesta has consistently used these words as code. Stating does not make it true. You cited a single email which you think has some unusual phrasing(the email to Herb). For my part, I think it&#39;s an innocuous email from an elderly man to his friend. </p>

<p>You also assert that there are many other consistent references to food in Podesta&#39;s emails that cause you to believe they are code. You haven&#39;t provided any such evidence of these emails. Maybe you can show me the exact emails where Podesta &quot;is using code words in his emails to multiple individuals close to him.&quot; Which emails written by Podesta? What are the code words? Simple questions. </p>

<p>&quot;a pizza related map on a black-and-white square cloth handkerchief&quot;</p>

<p>What the fuck does <em>THAT</em> mean - consider it is in context of a conversation between multiple people that all used or referred to the <em>CONFUSING</em> term - AND that podesta admitted it was his - AND that it was something the realtor found (meaning it was likely left in an EMPTY house).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, this is not an email from Podesta. You claim he was consistently using code words and these are not even his words. </p>

<p>Ignoring that, this email is not evidence for code word usage. It&#39;s infinitely more likely that they were talking about a literal handkerchief that he left behind, perhaps with an picture of pizza on it. There are many other alternative explanations that are much more likely. I suspect &quot;map&quot; was a typo. </p>

<p>But even if I accept your assertion that two unrelated instances of referring to food constitute a  consistent usage(which I think is laughable), it is a huge logical jump to claim that they are using code. Two emails out of thousands have references to food that you find confusing. That&#39;s not very impressive evidence. </p>

<p>And even if I accept that this is code because there are two slightly odd-phrased emails(again, laughable), there is absolutely no evidence that they are referring to child sexual exploitation. The logical jumps never end.</p>

<p>Let me summarize your argument. There are two emails that refer to food which some people find confusing. Therefore, this constitutes a consistent usage which indicates the usage of code. The code is probably related to pedophilia because ????. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said anything about Pedophilia. You brought that up. </p>

<p>I also never made any claims other than I feel it is suspicious and worthy of further investigation. There are 4chan threads with much more specific details - &quot;pizza&quot; has been directly referenced in multiple emails (both from DNC and Podesta) - I referenced two. My source refrerenced two as well. However, there are definitely more. Pizza has been tied to defense contractors, has been tied to multiple locations internationally, has been tied to Epstein and his plane/island, has been tied to Podesta.</p>

<p>Regardless of what it means it is strange that they are talking in code - and it is strange that the code seems to be more widely used than say, just podesta and one individual. I believe that, especially given the criminal reputation of the Clintons and the corruption in the DNC, that this is suspicious and worthy of further investigation. </p>

<p>That was my claim. That this is fishy as hell and worth further investigation. Hell, &quot;pizza&quot; could mean something financial for all we know. Still worth looking into.</p>

They basically have a running feed of AP stories on the site that editors rarely pay attention to and are cycled out without being archived. When an AP article on The Times has “aponline” in the URL(like it does in the Norway piece), it is not archived on their websites.</p>

<p>ABC News and The Washington Post have not returned a request for comment by publication time, but they most likely have similar unsexy answers to the deletion.&quot;</p>

<p>that&#39;s better than being &#39;disappeared&#39; ... as <em>so many</em> people who have publicised this stuff have discovered!</p>

<p>Let alone &#39;gone MIA&#39; e.g. where&#39;s Julian Assange? In fact, where&#39;s Trump?! Or Hillary, Or the Clinto Foundation&#39;s director etc etc although &quot;dying&quot; is a great way to be &#39;reborn&#39; as &quot;someone else, some<em>where</em> else&quot;! Nobody looks for deadmen</p>

<p>And doesn&#39;t anyone think this is quite strange the President Elect is keeping such a low profile at the moment?</p>

<p>EDIT: WHY, on a consiracy sub, do people <em>downvote</em> a comment questioning the obvious?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satanic based &quot;ritual child abuse&quot; is (sadly) as old as the church! </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video with footage from a Aussie 60 Minutes program in the 80&#39;s, before the MSM stopped covering this stuff! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLgNm_ay4Sk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLgNm_ay4Sk</a></p>

<p>At the moment the behaviour of the MSM with this and the &#39;fake news&#39; (LOL) that it&#39;s almost like some twisted comedy that has had the MSM quite confused what to cover ... </p>

<p>so I was a tad surprised when the news of this Norwegian based pedo ring appeared in them ... and now it doesn&#39;t and I&#39;m no longer a tad confused.</p>

<p>You see, I <em>fully</em> comprehend &#39;why&#39; they want this information removed from <em>their</em> records as right now. They know too much! <em>Far</em> too much and certain people more than others! They <em>need</em> &quot;plausible deniability&quot; in the times ahead, and with this, they&#39;re kinda hoping not too many people will notice and if they &#39;disappear it&#39; with some clever misdirection at the same time, chances are good that <em>it just might</em> fade away as their customers forget and are distracted by some new fluff. </p>

<p>Although I also wonder if <em>these media outlets</em> weren&#39;t threatened with &#39;telling fake news&#39; that affects the govt and so they <em>must</em> remove it or face prosecution. And they&#39;re Not going to admit this to their customers! Fuck, these new &#39;laws&#39; could be used on <em>any</em> media outlet without anyone outside that group <em>ever hearing about these laws being used in the first place!</em> They&#39;re like the Ultimate Gag Orders that &quot;fit all sizes&quot;! Fuck! <em>now that&#39;s scary!</em></p>

<p>And as you&#39;d know, a Lot of the  &quot;people in the know about <em>this</em> knowledge&quot; have been disappearing at a remarkable rate recently!</p>

<p>I think anyone who was closely  involved with Shillary are quietly shitting themselves as she silently rages whilst looking for scapegoats .. like the press, who <em>are well aware of</em> all the &#39;pedophiles and funny business&#39; that&#39;s been going on forever! </p>

<p>Ever since Rupert Murdoch became an American citizen <em>just so he could expand his empire</em> (the cunt &#39;abandoned&#39; the country that got him where he was in the first place! pah!) <em>his</em> &quot;News Corp&quot; journalists <em>worldwide</em> know they&#39;re just <em>not supposed to</em> discuss such diabolical issues under Rupie&#39;s supervision. Somebody got their arse kicked Big time over this.</p>

It&#39;s made its way up to being mentioned in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/locc">List of Confirmed Conspiracies</a> on the sidebar, and you should probably stop writing it off as just some Trumpets&#39; delusions- especially considering the US and other countries are using it as an excuse to pass propaganda laws that let their governments censor alternative media the state does not approve of.</p>

<p>But yeah, my complaint here is all the basic memes, 3-year old stories, and clickbait titles being pushed to the top. Imho, we could use more dot-connecting content that tackles specific angles of suspicious events, current or historical.</p>

<p>Even Iran Contra posts are getting down voted. If there was any conspiracy theory that was proven, it was that the CIA sold U.S. weapons to the Contras for cocaine, smuggled it into the U.S., and sold it to Americans. What was it, something like 20 people who were allegedly involved who all died mysteriously during the investigation? Some right before trial, and at least two plane crashes, within a day of each other? There are hundreds of hours of investigative reporting documentaries on this. But it&#39;s being downvoted in a conspiracy sub. Amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, this is not an email from Podesta. You claim he was consistently using code words and these are not even his words. </p>

<p>Ignoring that, this email is not evidence for code word usage. It&#39;s infinitely more likely that they were talking about a literal handkerchief that he left behind, perhaps with an picture of pizza on it. There are many other alternative explanations that are much more likely. I suspect &quot;map&quot; was a typo. </p>

<p>But even if I accept your assertion that two unrelated instances of referring to food constitute a  consistent usage(which I think is laughable), it is a huge logical jump to claim that they are using code. Two emails out of thousands have references to food that you find confusing. That&#39;s not very impressive evidence. </p>

<p>And even if I accept that this is code because there are two slightly odd-phrased emails(again, laughable), there is absolutely no evidence that they are referring to child sexual exploitation. The logical jumps never end.</p>

<p>Let me summarize your argument. There are two emails that refer to food which some people find confusing. Therefore, this constitutes a consistent usage which indicates the usage of code. The code is probably related to pedophilia because ????. </p>
