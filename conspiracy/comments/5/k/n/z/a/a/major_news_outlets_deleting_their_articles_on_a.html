       All I ever hear about pizzagate is that there is no actual evidence, just a lot of circumstantial shit that doesn't amount to anything.  While this may be true, if you look at everything that has come out in the last couple months objectively it looks really really fucking strange.  Shit like this just adds to the already enormous amount of circumstantial evidence that screams something is going on

       It seems to me that "evidence" doesn't matter to them. We would literally need to see video footage in HD porn style camera work and the faces of the Clintons in the video to even start making this a real investigation. Even then I doubt they or others involved would ever stand trial because of how many powerful people are involved. Evidence seems to matter less and less depending on who is indicated.

       You would need HD footage because that's "evidence."  Not speculation or conjecture.  That's just how our justice system works.  Don't blame people for asking for what's necessary.  It should still be researched, just don't start killing ppl or burning down businesses.

       Yes it should be investigated, but by those with the authority to subpoena documents and bring them to trial. Surely this amount of circumstantial evidence is enough to open a formal investigation to find some hard evidence (or not), but it does not seem to be so.

       You need to learn the definition of "evidence." "Evidence" can be direct (your smoking gun/dead body) or circumstantial. People are convicted and sent to prison based on circumstantial evidence on a daily basis.

       Ah, I see, you've given incredibly specific rules by which any evidence could possibly contribute to the pizzagate story.  The allegations by Kathy O'Brien specifically point towards the possibility of pedophilia in the highest levels of government but doesn't specifically mention CPP so it's obviously wrong.

       Incredibly specific rules? Give me a fucking break. if you're making specific allegations, then, yes, you provide evidence about
       <em>
        those
       </em>
       allegations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bringing up Cathy O'Brien is twisted, shitty logic. It's like me saying that Ibespwn is a chronic drunk driver, and when asked for proof pointing to
       <a href="http://cbs6albany.com/news/local/repeat-drunk-driver-sentenced-for-role-in-crash">
        this guy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       See, because chronic drunk drivers exist, therefore that's evidence that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are a chronic drunk driver.
      </p>
      <p>
       So once again, show us an actual victim or witness or person claiming they or someone they know was abused there.

       Something is going on but it most likely has nothing to do with pizzagate and it most likely has been going on for some time now, and we already know how powerful some of these rings are, I mean look at how long Jimmy Savale was able to operate in England, and there were victims coming out and accusing people that were ranked pretty high in the government over there. Then look at the case surrounding Penn St. or the accusations that have been made every few years about Hollywood. There are definitely rings that include some well placed people all across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Pizzagate, the bad thing about pizzagate was all of the amateur investigations that were being sourced on the web but most of the investigators were only seeking to confirm their biases by establishing connections to Clinton, this clouded the investigation and forced people to make connection that were tedious at best and non-existing at the worst, and we obviously had some crazy dude run up in one of the locations looking to find evidence and shoot people, that's never a good thing, and even worse they were going after people and places with death threats that probably never had anything to do with anything other than they made pizza for one DNC event or another, as pizza is the cheapest and easiest thing to purchase for any large gathering.

       But there is a silver lining that shines from pizzagate, we've upped the public awareness that there are real actual pedo rings happening, and honestly if anybody pays any attention to the local news we bust the non-protected rings on nearly a weekly basis but the protected rings we can't because they have law enforcement in their back pocket, they have politicians that are either involved or they have leverage over, they have wealthy cohorts that can shield them using their security, lawyers, and friends.

       Sure. Let's now acknowledge that many historic  'conspiracy theories' about paedophile rings were probably correct.
       <br/>
       But let's also totally avoid the possibility that the same sort of child abuse rings are still happening.

       James Alefantis, a fictitious deed-poll name change.

       James Alefantis, anagram for J'aime Les Enfants. 
French to English translation:
       <br/>
       J'aime Les Enfants  = I Love Kids
       <br/>
       Let's ignore his Instagram posts. And those of his followers. Especially those with financial connections to Pizza Comet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing to hide, nothing to fear etc.
       <br/>
       It's all been said before.

       But seriously though, pathetic attempt to divert discussion about blame.

       Dude we can make as many imaginary anagrams as we want, but an anagram isn't proof, where is the real proof? I'm looking at reality and tangible proof yet you still want to circlejerk to pizzagate, and that's fine I guess, but isn't this just taking your eye off the ball to chase cars?

       Yeah because pizzagate still has legs right? The MSM is against it, every day it seems like more and more people are realizing that there is no evidence and pizzagate was just a biased red herring, yet I have some cause that's lost, sure, because the majority of people believe in conspiracies right? I think you might be a tad delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know when you and like minded others want to actually go after real pedo rings rather than circlejerking to your own importance, pizzagate is the lost cause, but these rings are really happening and needs to be dragged out into the light.

       I agree and that's fine, if amateur is all we're going to get that's all we can do, for now, but amateur hour shit is what happens when it's only amateurs, like the idiot running into the pizza place looking for enslaved kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whatever, the authorities need to stop bullshitting around and actually investigate this thing so that we can have professionally gathered evidence. But the thing about that is even if we do gain professionally gathered evidence and it's not enough or it starts looking like pizzagate really is a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       However even if that happens we'll just move the goalposts and keep on beating the drum for Hillary and Bill's heads because that's what happens when you're biased against something, eventually you get to the point where you just want to be right, you just want to win, and you just want those people you perceive are enemies to be brought low before you, whether they are actually guilty or not, because that's how bias works, and that's how pizzagate came into fruition, by milking that anti-Hillary bias, and biased people don't care about justice they just want vindication and vengeance.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want a great example of bias just read or watch the Green Mile, they put John Coffee away for the rape and murder of two white girls without even a second thought, why? Because he's black, and they were biased against a black man, just like it's happened over and over again in the South during the early to mid 1900's. Different scenario but when people like you or like the other guy that commented back to me talk that's the same feeling I get, people are ready for a good lynching but this time they want it to be the Clinton's in the noose.

       Not with that attitude they're not. Listen we have to push for it, and the people that believe pizzagate, like yourself obviously, and the people that I'm probably grouped into, those who want to know, those who just want to see justice served, and those who just want to see the authorities find nothing, need to all group together and work together to push to get a real investigation to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean you can't get anything done by giving up and you can't get anything done when your group is on it's own, so work with the rest of us that want to see something done about this and lets figure out how to at least get an investigation into it going, that's at least a start and more than you pizzagaters have now. From there you can move the goalposts however you like but bear in mind every time a goalpost is moved you lose credibility and so does your cause.

       Pedophilia by the rich and elite didn't just start happening, it's been going on for a very long time and there hasn't been any real investigations because the investigations usually get squashed before it gets too far.
      </p>
      <p>
       As amateur as Pizzagate is, it's been the closest thing that the public has gotten to a real investigation into pedophilia by the rich and famous.  I mean look at how all the MSM outlets are attacking Pizzagate in which none of those assholes investigated.

       Also I get the historical significance of pedo rings, I mean shit didn't the Spartans get assigned their own boy to fuck and train? And the Romans would pretty much stick their dicks into anything, including a boy that was forced to dress like a girl, that I believe it was Caligula or another batshit crazy Roman emperor, there are so many to choose from. I'm sure the kings did it, the lords, and so on and so forth, so I get the historical significance both in ancient and modern times, so don't act like I'm some stupid git that doesn't understand what we're up against, that shit is so condescending.

       You have to stop bitching about the MSM stuff though, it's like a crutch, the problem is getting the authorities to investigate, the MSM will begrudgingly be dragged along, they have no choice, plus the ratings will force them to go along, because at the end of the day the only thing they really care about since ratings = profits, and coverage of this will be big.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I say all of that with this, focus on getting the authorities to investigate or shut the fuck up, stop bitching about the MSM, stop bitching about people who don't believe in it, because there is no solid proof so far to believe in so bitching about it is retarded. Also without the authorities getting involved, being pressured to get involved and all of that there is nothing right now. So stop whining about the MSM, stop whining about the powerful figures protecting them and focus on what we can do about finding out if this is actually a hoax or not, because that is what really matters to those of us interested in this topic, is it a hoax or is it true, nothing else matters about this topic except for answering those questions right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once those questions are answered then we can save the kids and bring the pieces of shit involved to justice, or maybe just a good lynching, but I'd definitely prefer justice.

       Like I said you're now being a condescending prick, and I fully realize the DC police aren't investigating, that's why I'm saying that they need their feet held to the fire and we need to utilize things like the MSM to force the issue with them. Anything is a resource once you learn how to use it, the MSM included, but more importantly the local news stations, they go after the smaller stuff and sometimes they unravel something bigger, but they are always hunting for stories.

You don't have to listen to me but I also don't have to pretend that you're not dumb for not listening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure you can keep fruitlessly bitching about the MSM because that's been useful so far right? You need proof first, which pizzagate does not have, otherwise no media outlet is even going to be interested for fear of having to submit a retraction, which is like a big black mark on people's careers when that happens, maybe that's why only investigative reporters are even sniffing this. But I'm sure this is also pressure from someone at the top of the food chains.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is focus on making the investigation happen, anything else is circlejerking because no moves are going to be made until real evidence is gathered by someone who either finds overwhelming hard evidence, or a professional gathering evidence in a professional manner. But honestly at this point I don't care, you're going to do what you want to do, you'll continue throwing tantrums and gaining no ground and I'll just find someone who will be amicable to listening.

       Hell, now I understand why the creepy "art" the police chief in Resident Evil 2 loved so much. It's as sick as John Podesta's cannibalism drawing in his office. And if you read his secretary's logbook and also the Chief Irons when you have the possibility to do so....even, as you leave the STARS office if you play as Claire for the first scenario, if you try to exit through the door, a fax machine will be zoomed in and it's the results of a background check her brother STARS member Chris Redfield had done on him by a friend of his in the NSA and it mentions how he was accused of rape of 2 fellow college girls when he was a student. Kinda got there late as the city is totally being infested by the T-Virus turning the whole city in that nightmare. It's just a game, but the Japanese when they make serious games, they seem to like to take jabs at what they seem to know of the underbelly of American power.

       Authority is rooted in the word "Author" or in case of a morally and legally corrupt to the bone government, authors. Authors, who basically dictate the story and the narrative. That's why they are afraid of what they suddenly call fake news, when back then when it was stories that didn't seem to rock the boat like pedogate/pizzagate does, they would call hoaxes and be done with it in a 48 hour news circle, maybe 72.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the US government, well, Congress of all bodies of government, the one with a single digit approval percentage, legalized what used to be illegal before that, propaganda abroad was "fine", voice of america even though even some cnn talking head will admit is biased, a law banning propaganda towards Americans was struck out by a bill from congress in 2012, effectively legalizing propaganda. So right now they finally decide what reality is and if you against the narrative and it rocks the boat too much, they had a weapon waiting for that, although I can't say it's working much, it ensures nobody will be indicted, no life prison terms or firing squads. They've protected themselves this way because they started feeling threatened that the Internet (the collective mind of the english speaking people in our case, no matter where they are, although those in the 5 eyes + a few other countries mostly are in that group which is in the crosshairs of insane psychotic bitches like say Theresa May) when people would find out that every strange things occuring before 2012 was studied and usually debunked by the public...a good example is the Bin Laden raid where they had about 6 scenarios until they gave up trying to give you (I'm not American) a scenario that makes any sense of that psyop.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're authoring what's real and what's not, that's something that's gonna be hard to be break for you guys. It's not as bad as say in the UK (I live in a 5 eye country where the rapidly passed patriot act-like bill is being deconstructed slowly, we only had 2 very lame and tiny incidents, the second (they always happen in clusters of 2 did you notice?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Those SCADS (state crimes against democracy) as Prof. Laurence de Haven of University of Tallahassee calls em in the book he wrote in his surprisingly published "Conspiracy Theory in America" where about a hundred conspiracies committed by the US government are analyzed, there was supposed to be more, but, for instant, he couldn't get Fred Hampton's murder when the FBI decided to start killing any would-be replacement of MLK, didn't get the peer review support to have that one in for example. I think I'm in the only country in the 5 eyes without a patriot act-like bill, well there is one installed by the previous government, right now the slightly left Liberal party is cancelling the most egregious sections....slowly as hell, but it's better than nothing.

       Wait?  You mean to tell me your favorite artists' work isn't defined by pedophilia?  And you haven't excavated an underground chamber for God knows what in your backyard?  Get with the times, man.  This is all just coincidence.

       There isn't even much circumstantial evidence. Once you start digging into it for sources the circumstantial evidence usually disappears.

       I've worked through that post before and most of it is pure bullshit. Is there a specific claim you find particularly compelling? I'm not going to work through it line by line but try to prove some of its claims yourself and you'll see what I mean. A lot of them are totally irrelevant as well.

      <p>
       If you have any specific claims I'd be happy to look at the evidence.

       Depends on the situation but typically some sort of primary source or a collection of primary/secondary sources that can be cited to build a case. They can be anonymous to an extent if the case built is compelling.

       Depends on the situation. I spent several days looking into pizzagate even though it appeared to be BS simply because the cost/benefit ratio... potential harm to children is a big enough deal most anything should be considered.

       And the source for this claim is a "cypher" published on 4chan. You can do the same thing with any set of work emails if you a priori decide the conclusion you want to prove and work from there. It's a form of begging the question.

       The source is the podesta emails, 4chan merely reviewed the evidence from the emails. Don't make it seem like 4chan created this evidence. They are doing the same shit we're doing right now. Talking about evidence from another platform.

       But 4chan did make up the evidence. They pulled that list of pedophile code words out of thin air. Without the assumption that they are talking in code, they have absolutely nothing. Just an 86 year old guy taking about playing dominoes.

       I agree that the "list" was determined on-the-fly. That is how covert communications must be deciphered. It is also the exact way we determine what a "word that we don't know the definition for" means. You ad-hoc a meaning for it, based on its use in context - and then revise your ad-hoc definition based on further observation. This revision/evolution of meaning usually happens slowly over a lifetime - but in this case we have historical emails - so our "lifetime" time-frame is significantly shortened as regards to these emails.

       Yes. They are talking about food. There's no evidence that they were taking about exploiting children.

      <p>
       That phrase- playing dominoes on cheese or pasta- simply means "do you think I'd play dominoes better while eating pasta or cheese?" It's a play on words. They don't literally mean on top of the food.

       The fact that you think these folks actually have the time and the desire to play dominoes, and moreover, care enough about their domino-playing to speculate via email how their food consumed just prior to playing dominoes would affect their gameplay, tells me that you are not being honest with yourself.

       You don't think a retired 86 year old widower has time to play dominoes with his grandchildren? You don't think people ever talk about mundane things in casual emails to friends?

      <p>
       You have to be kidding me. To summarize: your argument is that an elderly single man would never have the time to write an email about playing dominoes because he is too busy. But not too busy to arrange sex with a child.

       There were multiple emails where pizza and pasta and cheese were used in very odd contexts in conversations between the same people. This leads to a larger picture in which specific refutations on an email-by-email basis become untenable when taken as a whole.

       I would say that - if Podesta consistently uses those words in very odd contexts in bi-lateral communication with his "circle" (people close enough to him to have his email / get an email response from him) - surely that is sufficient to establish that these words may be routinely used by Podesta as code for something other than their dictionary meaning (food).
      </p>
      <p>
       If Podesta is using code words in his emails to multiple individuals close to him (this is the literal definition of "conspiracy" - multiple individuals within a group working together) - Surely that is enough to warrant further investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you disagree?

       You have not established that Podesta has consistently used these words as code. Stating does not make it true. You cited a single email which you think has some unusual phrasing(the email to Herb). For my part, I think it's an innocuous email from an elderly man to his friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also assert that there are many other consistent references to food in Podesta's emails that cause you to believe they are code. You haven't provided any such evidence of these emails. Maybe you can show me the exact emails where Podesta "is using code words in his emails to multiple individuals close to him." Which emails written by Podesta? What are the code words? Simple questions.

       First of all, this is not an email from Podesta. You claim he was consistently using code words and these are not even his words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignoring that, this email is not evidence for code word usage. It's infinitely more likely that they were talking about a literal handkerchief that he left behind, perhaps with an picture of pizza on it. There are many other alternative explanations that are much more likely. I suspect "map" was a typo.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if I accept your assertion that two unrelated instances of referring to food constitute a  consistent usage(which I think is laughable), it is a huge logical jump to claim that they are using code. Two emails out of thousands have references to food that you find confusing. That's not very impressive evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if I accept that this is code because there are two slightly odd-phrased emails(again, laughable), there is absolutely no evidence that they are referring to child sexual exploitation. The logical jumps never end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me summarize your argument. There are two emails that refer to food which some people find confusing. Therefore, this constitutes a consistent usage which indicates the usage of code. The code is probably related to pedophilia because ????.

       I never said anything about Pedophilia. You brought that up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also never made any claims other than I feel it is suspicious and worthy of further investigation. There are 4chan threads with much more specific details - "pizza" has been directly referenced in multiple emails (both from DNC and Podesta) - I referenced two. My source refrerenced two as well. However, there are definitely more. Pizza has been tied to defense contractors, has been tied to multiple locations internationally, has been tied to Epstein and his plane/island, has been tied to Podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of what it means it is strange that they are talking in code - and it is strange that the code seems to be more widely used than say, just podesta and one individual. I believe that, especially given the criminal reputation of the Clintons and the corruption in the DNC, that this is suspicious and worthy of further investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was my claim. That this is fishy as hell and worth further investigation. Hell, "pizza" could mean something financial for all we know. Still worth looking into.

       Suspicious?! For fuck's sake man! You don't even know what general category of crime you are suspicious of. That's fucking unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a step back and think about how insane that is. You have no hard evidence of any crime being committed. No witnesses. No victims. You don't even know what kind of crime might have been committed. Mail fraud? Dog fighting? Jaywalking?

       A few slightly odd emails and some avant-grade art and you've got yourself a conspiracy theory. About something. Very fishy. Let's make wild speculations first and figure the crime out later. Easier that way.

       They were AP articles. You have to pay to display them. Various news networks have different deals for how long they display AP articles.

       "According to the senior editor of standards at The New York Times, some AP wire stories are only live on their site for 24 hours. They basically have a running feed of AP stories on the site that editors rarely pay attention to and are cycled out without being archived. When an AP article on The Times has “aponline” in the URL(like it does in the Norway piece), it is not archived on their websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       ABC News and The Washington Post have not returned a request for comment by publication time, but they most likely have similar unsexy answers to the deletion."

       was speculating specifically about these articles, or if he knew of proof that existed of why they were taken down. If I'm reading correctly, the article you shared is speculating as to the reasons as well.

       The article you linked didn't specify why the NYT pedo article was taken down. It simply says "some articles" no indication that the NYT had been contacted about this article specifically, or that they had commented specifically about the article in question.

       Newspapers have different agreements with Associated Press. Nytimes always show articles for 24 hours, that's what they pay for. Those articles also had several factual errors (talking about arrested lawyers,if which there were none) so there were other reasons to take them down too.

       I was sourcing a NYT article about James Clapper denying Wikileaks involvement with Russia that was published 17/11/16. I used it well into December. It is down now. I wonder if it is a new policy?

       that's better than being 'disappeared' ... as
       <em>
        so many
       </em>
       people who have publicised this stuff have discovered!
      </p>
      <p>
       Let alone 'gone MIA' e.g. where's Julian Assange? In fact, where's Trump?! Or Hillary, Or the Clinto Foundation's director etc etc although "dying" is a great way to be 'reborn' as "someone else, some
       <em>
        where
       </em>
       else"! Nobody looks for deadmen
      </p>
      <p>
       And doesn't anyone think this is quite strange the President Elect is keeping such a low profile at the moment?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: WHY, on a consiracy sub, do people
       <em>
        downvote
       </em>
       a comment questioning the obvious?

       Satanic based "ritual child abuse" is (sadly) as old as the church!
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a video with footage from a Aussie 60 Minutes program in the 80's, before the MSM stopped covering this stuff!
      </p>
      <p>

       At the moment the behaviour of the MSM with this and the 'fake news' (LOL) that it's almost like some twisted comedy that has had the MSM quite confused what to cover ...
      </p>
      <p>
       so I was a tad surprised when the news of this Norwegian based pedo ring appeared in them ... and now it doesn't and I'm no longer a tad confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, I
       <em>
        fully
       </em>
       comprehend 'why' they want this information removed from
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       records as right now. They know too much!
       <em>
        Far
       </em>
       too much and certain people more than others! They
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       "plausible deniability" in the times ahead, and with this, they're kinda hoping not too many people will notice and if they 'disappear it' with some clever misdirection at the same time, chances are good that
       <em>
        it just might
       </em>
       fade away as their customers forget and are distracted by some new fluff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I also wonder if
       <em>
        these media outlets
       </em>
       weren't threatened with 'telling fake news' that affects the govt and so they
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       remove it or face prosecution. And they're Not going to admit this to their customers! Fuck, these new 'laws' could be used on
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       media outlet without anyone outside that group
       <em>
        ever hearing about these laws being used in the first place!
       </em>
       They're like the Ultimate Gag Orders that "fit all sizes"! Fuck!
       <em>
        now that's scary!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And as you'd know, a Lot of the  "people in the know about
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       knowledge" have been disappearing at a remarkable rate recently!
      </p>
      <p>
       I think anyone who was closely  involved with Shillary are quietly shitting themselves as she silently rages whilst looking for scapegoats .. like the press, who
       <em>
        are well aware of
       </em>
       all the 'pedophiles and funny business' that's been going on forever!
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since Rupert Murdoch became an American citizen
       <em>
        just so he could expand his empire
       </em>
       (the cunt 'abandoned' the country that got him where he was in the first place! pah!)
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       "News Corp" journalists
       <em>
        worldwide
       </em>
       know they're just
       <em>
        not supposed to
       </em>
       discuss such diabolical issues under Rupie's supervision. Somebody got their arse kicked Big time over this.

       All of these sources took the story from AP, which still has the story: This is the right answer. It's still up on the AP website itself:

        For the millionth time: the reason these articles disappear is because the websites that licensed the original article from the AP only have permission to re-post the article for a few days, after which it is deleted!

       Pizzagate is a bipartisan scandal, and one for which the legitimate evidence has required many to seriously reevaluate their worldview. It's made its way up to being mentioned in the
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/locc">
        List of Confirmed Conspiracies
       </a>
       on the sidebar, and you should probably stop writing it off as just some Trumpets' delusions- especially considering the US and other countries are using it as an excuse to pass propaganda laws that let their governments censor alternative media the state does not approve of.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, my complaint here is all the basic memes, 3-year old stories, and clickbait titles being pushed to the top. Imho, we could use more dot-connecting content that tackles specific angles of suspicious events, current or historical.

       Even Iran Contra posts are getting down voted. If there was any conspiracy theory that was proven, it was that the CIA sold U.S. weapons to the Contras for cocaine, smuggled it into the U.S., and sold it to Americans. What was it, something like 20 people who were allegedly involved who all died mysteriously during the investigation? Some right before trial, and at least two plane crashes, within a day of each other? There are hundreds of hours of investigative reporting documentaries on this. But it's being downvoted in a conspiracy sub. Amazing.

       First of all, this is not an email from Podesta. You claim he was consistently using code words and these are not even his words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignoring that, this email is not evidence for code word usage. It's infinitely more likely that they were talking about a literal handkerchief that he left behind, perhaps with an picture of pizza on it. There are many other alternative explanations that are much more likely. I suspect "map" was a typo.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if I accept your assertion that two unrelated instances of referring to food constitute a  consistent usage(which I think is laughable), it is a huge logical jump to claim that they are using code. Two emails out of thousands have references to food that you find confusing. That's not very impressive evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if I accept that this is code because there are two slightly odd-phrased emails(again, laughable), there is absolutely no evidence that they are referring to child sexual exploitation. The logical jumps never end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me summarize your argument. There are two emails that refer to food which some people find confusing. Therefore, this constitutes a consistent usage which indicates the usage of code. The code is probably related to pedophilia because ????.
