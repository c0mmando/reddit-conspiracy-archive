       "Scientists say" "science says" "experts say" should be eliminated from the vernacular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are these scientists and experts?  Do they live up on the mountain with the rest of the gods, sending down their wisdom to the unwashed  masses?
      </p>
      <p>
       To use the phrasing "scientists say" creates an image in the mind of a sort of monolithic wizard of oz like character.  Faceless and all knowing, free from all the influences, errors, and temptations of mere mortals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality of what is behind the curtain is a ragtag group of people with widely varying skill levels and motivations.  But when we say "scientists say" or "experts say", we homogonize all these people.  It's nonsensicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Johnny so and so did an experiment.  He may or may not have made technical mistakes while conducting the experiment.  His paycheck may or may not come from someone with a financial interest in the outcome of the experiment.  His interpretation of the data is run thru the filter of his political, social, and religious agendas and/or those of his superiors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that many people, because they find thinking to be exhausting and uncomfortable, just outsource it.  They may outsource it to religion but it is now socially acceptable to outsource it to the secular religion of scientism.  What is scientism?  It is an ironic rebranding in which the suspension of the scientific method is called Science, with a capital s.  Scientism takes some popular theories and declares them final and no longer debatable.  What you would call "faith" in other religious denominations.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to avoid what amounts to religious dogmatism usurping the scientific method, when describing research we should say something along the lines of "johnny so and so has been doing experiments with x and think that it means y" instead of "scientists say".
      </p>
      <p>
       This type of phrasing does not lend to the conflating of all research and researchers into one easily worshiped demigod.

       Totally agree, much like when they use the empty terms "Informed Sources", "Authorities have confirmed" or the equally generic "Experts agree" it's all mind-fuck PSYOP games to manipulate people into trusting the line of rubbish they're running out. These are nothing more than counterfeit stamps of approval to sell you their nonsense. Using them, they never have to reveal to you the actual evidence or parties concerned in the real story. In this manner they can stifle any dissent and obfuscate inconvenient facts.

       I recently apologized to a couple of anti-vaxxers in my life because I always smugly cited "Science" and thought they were some sort of pagan idiots to reject the claims of "Science".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm doubtful that vaccines are totally safe... I used to cling to "Science"... now I use my gut instinct a lot more... and my spidey sense tells me vaccines are marginally unsafe at best and absolutely nefarious at worst.

       I'd say that's more than simply being a scientist.  That's being a critical thinker - which I think is even better still.

       I'm not sure if this sub will make one think more than
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       other place on the internet (internet's pretty big, after all) but I will say that it's definitely helped me understand things a lot more than might have otherwise been the case without it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I'm growing more and more critical of the censorship I've heard and read about being enacted on Reddit in general by the site administrators, etc.  As such, even though I give this place a lot of credit for helping me find things that I might not have otherwise found, I'll jump ship in a heartbeat and go to another place (Voat, for example, where I already have an account set up) if this place gets worse on the censorship end of things.

       Edward Bernays, the nephew of Sigmund Freud, invented Propaganda. He figured out that people would believe the statements attributed to 'experts' without ever verifying or questioning  what was being said.  Want the public to rabidly defend bullshit? Just have the bullshit message of your choice repeated in public by your hired  or coerced 'experts' and no matter how unsupported or unbelievable your message is, it's never questioned by Joe Normal because it's "Settled Science" so he doesn't need to bother his own little head about it's content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any statement attributed to 'scientists', science or any source of authority, such as legacy media reporters  is taken at face value by the public without question.

       They know what to think based on who it was that told them what to think. In my opinion that's the height of ignorance.

       Sure, but if injecting 49 doses of 14 vaccines, all containing aluminum and mercury, into a child before age 6 doesn't sound safe to you, you are a heretic to that religion right now.

       What about the preponderance of evidence that aluminum and mercury are bad to inject into your blood lol?
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, H202 doesn't sound safe. I don't know what it is. Believe it or not, concluding that injecting mercury and aluminum "doesn't sound safe." is quite reasonable and is nothing like making conclusions about random molecules I know nothing about. I know Mercury and Aluminum are bad and that they bio accumulate. Which leads to the question, how bad are vaccines? Only slightly? I already know they will have some harmful effects by just looking at those two ingredients. It's just logic... Your science religion has you dismissing the harmful qualities of those ingredients completely off hand because their studies say there aren't harmful effects. Talk about religious. Pharma has vax to sell you, kid.

       "Mad as a hatter" is an expression that comes from the observation that people who used to make hats for a living went crazy.  They used mercury as part of the trade, which they sometimes put in their mouths.  We have reason to believe that injecting mercury into the bloodstream could be harmful.

       A common source of mercury nowadays is dental amalgams. They give off mercury vapor at the rate of about 10-25 ng per day, much of which is absorbed into the body through the lungs and travels to the brain. I have like 8 dental amalgams lol. I'm mad as a hatter! But seriously, I wonder sometimes if I would think clearer and be
       <strong>
        even more
       </strong>
       intelligent if I didn't have fillings lol. It brings me to my point that I would never want to hurt the development of a child by over zealously vaccinating, but same with under vaccinating I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also had my whole left side, including face, paralyzed by vaccines when I was 4 or 5. It's kind of why I'm so unabashed in my anti-vax stance. I think they called it a "booster" and it was one of the times I got a large amount of vaccines all at once. I had to slide my left foot around on a paperback book I was so paralyzed lol.

       Toxicity is in the interaction of the material and your body.  Heavy metals interfere with basic cellular processes in the body.  There is not a magical dosage level at which lead goes from being "safe" to all of the sudden harmful. There is just an acute dose range at which the damage is extensive enough that even a casual observer will notice that something is wrong.

       You can drive on a tire that has a slow leak, but for how long.

       You do eat all the aformentioned metals in food.  In the early 1900s, lead arsenate was sprayed in large quantities on fruit fields to deal with moths and other pests. It remains in the soil and water.

      <p>
       That's false. In the scientific community you are encouraged to disprove theories. Many of my studies include geology, which as I'm sure you know has Plate Tectonics as the dominant theory. Do you know how long it's been around? To give you an idea, one of my professors learned what's called "Isostasy", a completely different theory. When he was in grad school is when plate tectonics was developed. He's actually been published quite a bit with regards to it, and he had to learn it all as it was being developed.

       People need to get it out of their heads that science is this institution that is dark and nefarious. Science is a method. Period. End of story. You don't need
       <strong>
        ANYONE
       </strong>
       besides yourself to do science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to know what science is? Ask a question. Test it. Interpret your results with as little bias as possible. Rinse and repeat. That's it. All you need are tools, an open mind, and a desire for knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're encouraged to disprove current theories. How do you think people win Nobel prizes in scientific fields? They correct or expand upon our current knowledge of the universe. Science is constantly changing.

       I think your premise is presisely what he is arguing. You are misinterpreting his definition of Scientism.
      </p>
      <p>
       His idea of the "religion" of Scientism is basically anyone who treats a "scientific consensus" as infalliblibly true NOT someone in the scientific community.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example someone who in an argument says that Evolution due to natural selection is a fact because the scientists say so. He is pointing out the dangers of this kind of thinking and how it is very similar to saying things like the earth was made in 7 days because the Bible says so.

       That makes more sense, but to out the whole scientific community as a whole is a grand generalization that will close him and others off to new ideas presented by the community.

       I think you illustrated some of the beliefs that I am attempting to point out.  The "scientific community" implies a monolithic group.  But it's just a two word version of "scientists".  There is no scientific community because as you said science is a only a method and anyone can do it. There is a linguistic confusion in popular culture between a method and a group of people that leads to the religion of science.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a large public facing creation called "Science" by its members.  But I refer to it as scientism.  It claims the scientific method as its basic principle.  But it limits it's practice.  Only popularly held theories are allowed.  It is similar to how the birth of an antimaterialist man on Christmas is celebrated by mass consumption by Christians with a capital c.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interpretation of raw scientific data is strictly personal opinion of a flesh and blood flawed human being.  My main point is that we are quick to forget this fact in the presentation of science to the public.  The phrasing that is used makes the opinion of men appear as the wisdom of faceless gods.

       How do we determine who is dedicated enough to science to be called part of the scientific community?
      </p>
      <p>
       And we're going to survey all "white" people to get a concensus opinion on if they are ashy.  How will we do it?  How much "black" can they have in their ancestry and still qualify as "white"?  What classifies as "black" and not "brown"?  Are hispanics, native americans, chinese, indians, are they white, black, brown, yellow, or what?

       I've worked in science related fields all my life and while you're mostly right, it kinda depends. I have been in completely unbiased and ethical labs where funding and equipment come pouring in and folks start nodding along to the pitch pretty quick.

      <p>
       Not out of any sense of greed or willful disrespect of the scientific method at all. But when you got some polished scientific salesmen that are paid to be good at convincing others to buy what they are selling, it can shape the direction of inquiry.

       All a sudden no one is worrying about the car payment, and little Jimmy can get those braces. And I'm not saying I ever saw anything consciously faked to yield desirable data. But data can be, ya know, encouraged in certain directions.

       This is again akin to religious faith.  We assume that decisions are made in scientific research exclusively based on data.  You aren't taking into account the negative social and financial results that having a unpopular opinion can bring upon a person doing research.

       Not only this but most research is bullshit in the medical/psychological/pharmaceutical industries. Researchers and doctors have been half-assing their findings for a long time and it's finally coming back to get them. Only publishing research results that correspond and validate the hypothesis is published while the rest is put in the file cabinet. It's a very big and dangerous problem. The field of parapsychology has done a lot to try and get science and research to be held accountable. Of course profit and funding always wins.
