<p>I stumbled upon this document which was originally found accidentally like 40 years ago. It details how the ruling elite manipulate cultures and individual behaviors with what they call their silent weapon. They discovered that the principles that govern electicity can be applied to economics and therefore could control society itself. Money supply is controlled, media divides us and obfuscates real information, family and community structures are weakened, our behavior is monitored and data-mined, and individuals become unwitting debt-laden energy sources. Super interesting read and it shows just how deep societal control really is. </p>

<p>Quote from the document - </p>

<p>&quot;What Mr. Rothschild had discovered was the basic principle of power, influence, and control over people as applied to economics. That principle is &quot;when you assume the appearance of power, people soon give it to you.&quot;
Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency or deposit loan accounts had the required appearance of power that could be used to induce people (inductance, with people corresponding to a magnetic field) into surrendering their real wealth in exchange for a promise of greater wealth (instead of real compensation). They would put up real collateral in exchange for a loan of promissory notes. Mr. Rothschild found that he could issue more notes than he had backing for, so long as he had someone&#39;s stock of gold as a persuader to show his customers.</p>

<p>Mr. Rothschild loaned his promissory notes to individual and to governments. These would create overconfidence. Then he would make money scarce, tighten control of the system, and collect the collateral through the obligation of contracts. The cycle was then repeated. These pressures could be used to ignite a war. Then he would control the availability of currency to determine who would win the war. That government which agreed to give him control of its economic system got his support.&quot;</p>
