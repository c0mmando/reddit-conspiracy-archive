       I can easily see the "honor Carrie" marketing push getting Ep8 an extra $100 million. The share price of one of the world's largest corporations depends upon it being a success.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the mixed reception of Rogue One, or maybe production issues, got Disney worried?

       So, the mountains of coke that she did in the late 70's and the 80's had nothing to do with shortening her life span?

       You're reaching for this one, OP.

      <p>
       Her passing actually causes a bit of a problem for Disney, as Leia was to be more of a featured character in the

       Taking away one of your great nods to nostalgia that helps draw in old fans before your series is done sure would be a stupid move for a company supposedly nefarious enough to murder someone for a little extra profit.

       What do you mean "not more". You mean to say there is not a single person that would be more likely to see it now? Killing her costs nothing. I'm pretty sure that after seeing her in 7, R1, and 8, nobody would have gone to 9 just to see her.

       Nope. Star Wars is already one of the biggest juggernauts in cinema history. Almost nothing compares to it. The death of an actor isn't going to suddenly make it even bigger than it is, because it would be difficult to
       <em>
        get
       </em>
       any bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, the next movie is still
       <em>
        an entire year away
       </em>
       . Killing Carrier Fisher a year in advance to boost ticket sales makes absolutely no sense, given today's short attention span pop culture. We'll have moved on to mourning some other celebrity by then.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Rogue One, it's already past its crucial period. The movie is already a blockbuster and is now on cruise control. The time to strategically kill someone would have been just
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       it came out.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Killing her costs nothing.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Actually, yes, it does. Even aside from the actual cost of doing it, and more importantly, covering it up - that's no small thing, considering getting caught would end the company - it means they don't have that big draw for older fans when the final installment of their trilogy comes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it means killing one of their investments. That makes absolutely no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, no on would have gone
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       to see her, but the fact that the classic characters are in these movies has been a HUGE part of the draw.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also costs them money in production costs, since Episode 9 is already in pre-production. Unless they had already killed her in Episode 8, they'll have to do rewrites and change what is already in progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another horrible hole in this absurd premise:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What if the mixed reception of Rogue One
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's been exceedingly well reviewed, and is in fact behind only the first two originals and The Force Awakens on Rotten Tomatoes. It's also been a huge moneymaker, raking in truckloads of cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have no idea what you are talking about.

       They won't

       people are going to talk about it.

       The woman was 60 years old, had a long history of drug and alcohol abuse, and was not in any way healthy. Considering how she lived, she did a good job even

       Already people posting other places "NO" to CGI. But Disney will do what it wants and it won't matter. IMHO re-casting is the best of all possible bad options.

       true. but I bet they just do some reshoots for episode 8 where she dies offscreen and then in episode 9 it will be like how heath ledger wasn't in the dark knight rises, awkwardly not mentioned.

       Did we need the Joker in TDKR? Nobody ever mentioned the Joker again in the Tim Burton/Joel Pedomacher films. Not seeing this as the same thing--Leia's been threaded through the Star Wars series from the beginning.

       didn't need, was still a good movie, but would have been great IMO with heath, and it did hurt the movie to just awkwardly not mention the joker at all. Due to respect to heath ok, I get it, it's greedy of me to care more about the quality of a film than a person dying, his loved ones wouldn't want to see this post. I get it. But again, I'd prefer that heath ledger strategy to CGI Carrie.

       It would have been cool for them to mention him, I agree. Honestly, I don't even get the "respect to Heath" rationale for not doing it--I think it would have been more of a compliment to give a nod in his direction. Hollywood is so fucked up in how it thinks.

       CGI Carrie is the worst possible option. Recasting is best.
