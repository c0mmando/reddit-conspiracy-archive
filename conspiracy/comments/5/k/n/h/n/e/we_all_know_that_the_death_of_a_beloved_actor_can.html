<p>No, probably not.</p>

<p>And now she can&#39;t be in Episode 9, the final installment of their new trilogy.</p>

<p>Taking away one of your great nods to nostalgia that helps draw in old fans before your series is done sure would be a stupid move for a company supposedly nefarious enough to murder someone for a little extra profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You mean to say there is not a single person that would be more likely to see it now? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Star Wars is already one of the biggest juggernauts in cinema history. Almost nothing compares to it. The death of an actor isn&#39;t going to suddenly make it even bigger than it is, because it would be difficult to <em>get</em> any bigger.</p>

<p>Plus, the next movie is still <em>an entire year away</em>. Killing Carrier Fisher a year in advance to boost ticket sales makes absolutely no sense, given today&#39;s short attention span pop culture. We&#39;ll have moved on to mourning some other celebrity by then.</p>

<p>As for Rogue One, it&#39;s already past its crucial period. The movie is already a blockbuster and is now on cruise control. The time to strategically kill someone would have been just <em>before</em> it came out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Killing her costs nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, yes, it does. Even aside from the actual cost of doing it, and more importantly, covering it up - that&#39;s no small thing, considering getting caught would end the company - it means they don&#39;t have that big draw for older fans when the final installment of their trilogy comes up.</p>

<p>Basically, it means killing one of their investments. That makes absolutely no sense.</p>

<p>No, no on would have gone <em>just</em> to see her, but the fact that the classic characters are in these movies has been a HUGE part of the draw.</p>

<p>It also costs them money in production costs, since Episode 9 is already in pre-production. Unless they had already killed her in Episode 8, they&#39;ll have to do rewrites and change what is already in progress.</p>

<p>Another horrible hole in this absurd premise:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if the mixed reception of Rogue One</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s been exceedingly well reviewed, and is in fact behind only the first two originals and The Force Awakens on Rotten Tomatoes. It&#39;s also been a huge moneymaker, raking in truckloads of cash.</p>

<p>So I have no idea what you are talking about.</p>

<p>The woman was 60 years old, had a long history of drug and alcohol abuse, and was not in any way healthy. Considering how she lived, she did a good job even <em>getting</em> to 60.</p>
