    <div class="md"><p>I smelled something fishy about the simulation theory when Bank of America started pushing it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a note to clients out Tuesday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said there&#39;s a 20%-50% chance that we&#39;re living in the matrix — meaning that the world we experience as &quot;real&quot; is actually just a simulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-wonders-about-the-matrix-2016-9">Source</a>)</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/11/simulated-world-elon-musk-the-matrix">Elon Musk has been telling the mainstream media</a> for a year now that he believes we&#39;re living in a simulation.</p>

<p>Anything approved by the bankers, billionaires, and mainstream media should set off everyone&#39;s bullshit detector.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm. Was just thinking - what a great way to get people to shut up about global warming. It&#39;s scientifically proven so it&#39;s tough to argue, but if you can get people to believe the world&#39;s an illusion, then why would they care about something that&#39;s fake in the first place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t even need to limit it to global warming. Why care about the <em>status quo</em> if it all doesn&#39;t really matter anyways?</p>

<p>TPTB controlled the masses for centuries via organized religion by telling them to stop caring about worldly matters and concern themselves instead with thoughts of the afterlife. With organized religion on the decline, TPTB needed a new demoralization tactic to keep the masses apathetic. Enter simulation theory. It&#39;s the same &quot;life here doesn&#39;t matter&quot; idea with a little science and pop culture thrown in to make it palatable to people who would otherwise eschew religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I followed this logic as far down as my imagination would let me, and I concluded that the end result was no different than believing in an uncaring god – a creator that allows randomness and human or artificial intelligence to direct certain variables. Given the evidence around us and our ability to navigate our environment, the assertion becomes moot.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I came to discount the theory based on the idea of &quot;author intent&quot;: Why would any evolved entity program a simulated reality that would include physical/mental pain and suffering in our experience, be it material or virtual? I can&#39;t believe in a &quot;higher consciousness&quot; that would lack such empathy, be it some &quot;god&quot; or some &quot;programmer.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously? How do you think we got so smart and have such amazing innovAtions in science and medicine. Live vivisections, animal and human experimentation. We don&#39;t have a lot of empathy as a race. Obama gets on tv and cries during a press conference about a few kids getting shot to death in a classroom... aaaand orders &quot;surgical strikes&quot; with drones in which the collateral damage is scores of kids getting exploded.  The creator could be so
Advanced that they don&#39;t think of us as actual people. Like AI In videogames.

    <div class="md"><p>You have hit every point the programer so called want and needs this to be as real as possible choice pain happy religon just happened the way the sun and stars fall into place this is very close to a program. Only thing is we are not here long enough to see everything. So seems normal just think how in our time how crazy technology has become In thirty years if tech continues to grow at even a tenth of what it is I VERY doubt it will but we will not need actors for movies mechanics for cars in thirty more years what are we going to be doing? Its a weird thought and everyone is still caught up in nonsence in my mind. People are too lazy to send letters some do but not enough people have to have a facecrap to talk or plan events.

    <div class="md"><p>There is a good chance.  If you think about how technology advances so rapidly eventually we will create an artificial intelligence and that intelligence will keep advancing.  It will reach a point where it will be able to create a virtual world indistinguishable from the real world.  So we have either already reached that point or will reach it in the future.  We are now either that worlds inhabitants or will be its creators.  50/50</p>

<p>Simply play gta for a month straight like a normal person and no cheats.</p>

<p>Then play for a month with cheats killing everyone and taking whatever you want. </p>

<p>Then play the game and what do you enjoy more.</p>

<p>Fuck it you will understand in twenty minutes how boring it is to watch normal just steal the apachie and if that blows up do the cheat were you get the rpgs and do that as nany times before the army shows up and use armor and health code.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly possible. And the scientific evidence (double slit experiments etc) increasingly suggests that our reality is an illusion that only appears to &quot;exist&quot; whilst it is being observed - like a scene in a computer game.</p>

<p>It raises fascinating questions, though. The beings that created us occupy a different dimension that we can&#39;t see, but do they also inhabit a simulated universe? Who or what occupies the original reality? </p>

<p>Were we made in our creators&#39; likeness? How many other simulations does our creator-civilization have running? </p>

<p>It is hard to imagine that our simulation is conducted in real time (from their perspective), and presumably our world operates on a much faster timescale than theirs. Maybe our year is a day for them, or a minute, or maybe it varies (but always feels the same to us)?</p>

<p>Has our simulation been reset in the past? Does this cut-off point coincide with the origins of civilization as we know it (about 10,000 years ago)? Perhaps our current simulation is bolted-on to a fixed &quot;4 billion year old Earth&quot; narrative which doesn&#39;t change, so when our simulation expires, it resets to the same fixed point that we started off at.</p>
