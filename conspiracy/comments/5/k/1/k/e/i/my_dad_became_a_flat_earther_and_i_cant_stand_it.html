       If the Earth was flat wouldn't all the water just either flow off the sides, or soak through the bottom and drip away? What makes the tides move in time with the moon? What stops anyone with a plane from just flying off the side into space?

       I was a software engineer for map quest,  none of my algorithms would work if the world was flat.   Every formula was based on an elliptical value. Tell your dad I am a conspiracy theorist but this isn't one of them.

       south poll / ice wall. it might initially sound silly yet think where do scientists thing the edge of space is? what would you expect an edge of the earth to look like?

       there is people living inside the earth too maybe!

       Where's the edge of the universe?
       <br/>
       We have no problem accepting 'infinity' because it's conventional wisdom. Even though no one can truly grasp the concept.
       <br/>
       Similarly, we accept that the universe originated from a 'big bang'. But we have no concept of what existed before this, how it occurred or it's origins.
       <br/>
       Failure to provide explanations for the flat earth model are equally missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can only make observations and record data.

       was the youtube video: 'Is Earth Actually Flat?' with 12 million views. The video is more of a 'debunking'' or discussion video,  as opposed to attemping to proof FE, so is not bias in that respect and is probable accurate

       Dude, it does not matter one bit how many views your YouTube video has, it's completely irrelevant. And citing a YouTube video about a calculation that you cannot perform yourself to criticise completely accepted science is just foolish. The flat earth theory is a non starter and a complete waste of time and thought.

The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still

And he never gives an answer

       Slandering science?
       <br/>
       Science isn't an opinion.
       <br/>
       We make observations and record data.
       <br/>
       Out of which we attempt to understand reality as we experience it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is not a concrete, unchanging mantra.
       <br/>
       It is an ever-changing representation of what humanity is able to verify to a satisfactory degree.
       <br/>
       Even the most solid of scientific laws are just foundations built upon what we've observed so far.
       <br/>
       No thing can ever be known to be true. It can only be observed to be consistent for as long as it has been recorded.

       Smaller and Closer... and still a spherical Earth. Yes you could do these calculations on other spheres. Did you pass 5th grade math? When you figured out how to find the area of triangles and squares and whatnot? And how it worked regardless of how big the shapes were as long as you used the same formula?

       are you just being a general troll or can you argue this claim is incorrect

       again, the source of this claim was more a 'debunking' analysis rather than a flat earth one, are you very good at maths/

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        he source of my comment :
"Eratosthenes' Calculation of Earth's Circumference maths based on the shadow analysis would also work out identical if they sun were SMALLER AND CLOSER"
was the youtube video: 'Is Earth Actually Flat?' with 12 million views. The video is more of a 'debunking'' or discussion video, as opposed to attemping to proof FE, so is not bias in that respect and is probable accurate

       I have a very hard time making sense of this too.
       <br/>
       Everything I've ever been taught reinforces that we live on a globe. But I've never once been shown an experiment that proves this.
       <br/>
       I stumbled onto this insanity thinking it was just that. But there seems to be much more experimental evidence to support this theory than what we've grew up with as 'fact'.
       <br/>
       I have no idea what to think now.
       <br/>
       But the deeper I look, and more evidence I uncover, the more unsure I am of everything I thought I knew.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found this to be a common sense approach.

       Wait how? If flat earth is a thing? I can watch Jupiter almost every night. And it will change its position through out the years. I have a telescope. And I watch the Galileo moons (?) orbit around Jupiter nightly, sometimes hourly. I can
       <a href="https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/">
        track the space station
       </a>
       and it's really freaking amazing to see( I dare you to track it and watch it for yourself in real life). It looks like a UFO, and predict when it will come around again all based on orbital predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply because the earth is a massive land in comparison to us. Does not mean it is a perfect sphere. On this matter of mass in the shape of a sphere orbiting other spheres does not mean it is a perfect sphere down to miles of distance being completely accurate and areas that are not sphereical that exist. Just study any rocky planet besides the obvious gas giants to realize this fact. There is no evidence the earth is flat.

       You should look into the concave earth theory and bendy light. Wildheretic.com has a bunch of good info on it. Also look up the rectilineator experiment. It was an experiment done in the late 1800s that concluded the earth actually curves up concavely instead of convexly. Scientism refuses to reproduce this experiment, why?

       The chart on that link says:

      <p>
       "curvature 1 mile = 8 inches"

      <p>
       "curvature 2 miles =

        32 inches

      </p>
      <p>
       "curvature 3 miles = 64 inches" ..... Of course, IF 2 miles = 32" ... BUT how come 1 mile is
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       8 inches?

       I am not a flat earther by any means. However, I can admit some of the evidence is intriguing and worth a look at the very least.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a couple pics I took that I can share. I took these at 12:30pm a couple weeks ago, in the first is the moon, in the second is the sun. I stood in the same place and faced the same direction to take the pics. The extent of my movement was turning my head from the right, to the left. Meaning the sun and moon were both visible and on the same side of earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is; how can the moon have a shadow when the sun isn't behind the earth to cast the shadow? I'm genuinely curious and welcome any explanations. Also, the moon finally disappeared from the sky around 1pm, but was back in the sky a mere 5 hours later. How does that work?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a video as well to show that the photos aren't faked and that all I did was pan right to left but I can't get it to upload. I will keep trying and will edit this comment if I get it to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am not a flat earther, but I'm definitely a little puzzled and welcome any opinion from those smarter than I on the topic.

       Try the ancient Greek method of ships on the horizon. It's relies on easy common sense. The flat earth wiki has some nonsense about angular limits of perception. But if you actually observe a ship on the horizon as it is coming towards you, you can see it gradually appearing over the horizon over the curvature.

       I can't believe you need help, there is literally so much information debunking this retarded bullshit. The most interesting thing is there are experiments normal people can do to mathematically prove the Earth is not flat, like Eratosthenes of Cyrene did.

Lots of a pictures of bigfoot and foot prints etc etc... still its a never ending battle of belief until you both are standing in front of big foot. Who is right and who is wrong?

       Next time you and your dad discuss this. Make sure you track the next time you can see the space station where you live.

       That's the website. It will tell you where you can see the space station fly over you. It's really cool to watch looks like a ufo. You can see it a few times a day I think. And when your dad sees this UFO thing that flies across the sky you can ask him what it is, and how you would know where it would be.  And when you see it fly over the second time you can say how would this object orbit a flat earth. Or more so, simply asking him what it is

       If some Aliens are getting ready to pounce or our Global Leaders are cooking up some serious shit to unleash at some future date, it might be more logical that Antarctica is the outer band and
       <strong>
        it

       Even better yet to twist your mind go watch iss earth viewing experiment and click on the live tracker option.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then go to setting on your computer and change the time day or whatever and see how it moves it should not move at all from where it was but it does can anyone explain how a live stream can change location because you changed the time on your computer.  There is something wrong here.

      <p>
       The website is ustream.tv has live streams from all over the planet iss is the only one supossedly off planet.

       Tell your father about polar nights.
      </p>
      <p>
       A polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles.The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. "Night" is understood as the center of the Sun being below a free horizon. Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun. The polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at the latitude of approximately 66.5 degrees. In the most northern city of Sweden, Kiruna, at 67°51'N, the polar night lasts for around 28 twenty-four-hour periods, while the midnight sun lasts around 50 twenty-four-hour periods.

       Space station and all flight paths make more sence if you look at a flat earth map or the united nations logo pretty wierd stuff even though airlines say they fky nonstop that flight never happens do some research of your own like i am i am looking for a calm lake were i can see 80 or 100 miles across set up posts on both sides and see what happens i have to see and do the math to disprove this myself i dont believe everything i read. I have to see it.
