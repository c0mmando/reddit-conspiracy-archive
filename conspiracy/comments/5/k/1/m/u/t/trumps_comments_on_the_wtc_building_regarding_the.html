       In light of the new developments with the Justice-in-Focus crew and the
       <a href="http://www.wtc7evaluation.org/">

       </a>
       findings, I wonder what Donald Trump thinks about 9/11 now?  I really am going to be interested when he takes office Jan 20th what he will do about this issue.  Here's what he's said in the past, which might provide some insight.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        September 11, 2001, Donald Trump interview by anchorman Rolland Smith on WWOR/Channel 9 (Youtube): "[Rollins Smith:] There's a great deal of question whether or not the damage and the ultimate destruction of the buildings was caused by the airplanes, architectural defects, or possibly by bombs or aftershocks. Do you have any thoughts on that?
       </p>
       <p>
        [Donald Trump:] It wasn't architectural defect. The World Trade Center was always known as a very, very strong building. Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement [in 1993]. Now, the basement is the most vulnerable place because that's your foundation and it withstood that. And I got to see that area about three or four days after it took place, because one of my structural engineers actually took me for a tour because he did the building. And I said, "I can't believe it". The the building was standing solid and half of the columns were blown out. This was an unbelievably powerful building. If you don't know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside. The steel, the reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows is that in between all the windows you had the steel on the outside. You see the steel on the outside of the building?
That's why when I first looked â€“ and you had these big heavy I-beams. When I first looked at it, I couldn't believe it, because there was a hole in the steel. And this is steel that was -- you remember the width of the windows of the World Trade Center folks. I think you know if you were ever up there, they were quite narrow and in between was this heavy steel. I said, "How could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or 747 or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through this steel?" I happen to think that they had not only a plane but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously, because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall. Most buildings are built with the steel on the inside around the elevator shaft. This one was built from the outside which is the strongest structure you can have and it was almost just like a can of soup.
       </p>
       <p>
        [Rolland Smith:] You know, Donald we were looking at pictures all morning long of that plane coming into building number two and when you see that approach the far side and all of a sudden within a matter of milliseconds the explosion pops out the other side.
       </p>
       <p>
        [Donald Trump:] Right. I just think that there was a plane with more than just fuel. I think, obviously, they were very big planes; they were going very rapidly. Because, I was also watching where the plane seemed to be not only going fast, it seems to be coming down into the building, so it's getting the speed from going down hill so to speak. It just seemed to me that to do that kind of destruction is even more than a big plane, because you're talking about taking out steel, the heaviest caliber steel that was used on the building. And these buildings were rock-solid and you know it's just an amazing, amazing thing. This country is different today and it's going to be different than it ever was for many years to come."
       </p>
       <p>
        Apparently a later September 11, 2001 interview of Donald Trump, this time by German TV reporter Stephan Bachenheimer (Youtube): "Tremendous amounts of fuel that were dumped on the building and 1,600 degrees temperatures, I guess that's more than anything can take, no matter what."
