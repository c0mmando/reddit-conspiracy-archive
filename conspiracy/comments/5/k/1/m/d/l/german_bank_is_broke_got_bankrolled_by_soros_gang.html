<p>Soros, on the other hand, did what Soros does: he shorted the shit out of Deutsche Banks shares hoping they would tank after Brexit. <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/soros-in-huge-bet-against-deutsche-bank/a-19361989">http://www.dw.com/en/soros-in-huge-bet-against-deutsche-bank/a-19361989</a></p>

<p>Deutsche Bank stocks have been in the shitter, but they&#39;re not insolvent yet.  Plenty of speculation from sites like zerohedge.com that a bail-out or bail-in might be needed.</p>

<p>Qatar is not the only stake holder. Goldman, JP morgan, BoFA, Berkshire, and many other American entities have significant combined stake. </p>

<p>If DB has bad stock prices <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-15/deutsche-bank-nomura-begin-trial-in-monte-paschi-collusion-case">whose fault is it</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we agree more than we disagree.  The OP got it wrong with the Soros claim, and there is no direct, objectively provable link between Qatari investments and immigration.  </p>

<p>DB colluding with Monte dei Paschi (who was just bailed-out by the Italian people) to cover bad investments/loans isn&#39;t a good look.  DB wants to claim they&#39;re stable and the future looks bright, but it&#39;s clear they&#39;re probably next in line for bail-out.</p>

<p>It is a little odd that Qatar wanted to dump their DB assets, but abruptly changed course and said they&#39;d keep current stocks and likely buy more- even though they&#39;ve lost $1.5 billion on current DB investment.</p>

<p>Who says he won’t? Trump wants the Fed destroyed and would likely be supportive of BRICS’ (under a non-commie China) efforts to detach from the WTO. If he plays his cards right (and when has he ever not), he could be singlehandedly responsible for the collapse of the communist regime in China within his 8 years as president.</p>

My issue is that Trump has bankers in his cabinet.</p>

<p>Imagine all of the 3rd worlders having their debt wiped out along with Americans.</p>

<p>Many people would go right back into debt but most won&#39;t especially those who went into debt such as of medical reasons,and being in debt sucks.</p>

<p>I want the debt wiped out and not have the pensions &amp; other savings wiped,I want land &amp; home owners to keep their stuff.</p>

<p>With all of that debt wiped  the US government could use the money that it was paying as interest to rebuild the infrastructure.</p>

<p>These arent outlandish statements ive made. Photos of trumpmshaking hands with politicians have been available  for years. He is not an outsider.

<p>Not an argument.</p>

<p>You’ve posted no fact. You have no logic. You have no citations.</p>

<p>Citation needed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because you are one.</p>

<p>Thanks for admitting I am correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the least she&#39;s just another vassal of the globalists who does what she&#39;s told, at worst she&#39;s part of the 5th column(tribe,illuminist,whatever).</p>

<p>To this day I&#39;m still wondering where she actually came from when Helmut Kohl just simply &quot;introduced&quot; her in the early 90s and made her an extremely young minister with no visible background.</p>

<p>For a long time I thought she was a compromise between the BRD elites and the DDR deep state establishment to merge but now? Either a nurtured Manchurian candidate from an Illuminist cell strangely connected to the evangelical church(like the current <em>horrible</em> german president Joachim Gauck) or a crypto jew agent due her mother&#39;s background.</p>
