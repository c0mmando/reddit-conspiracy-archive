       Serious post. How do they explain dinosaur bones and the fact evolution occurring over millions of years had previous beings living in the earth? We can verify this by dinosaur bones. Have they been on a flat earth too?

       I'm not a flat earther but they told me that we have never found a complete dinosaur and they also say that the lack of intermediate fossils proves that evolution is false and that the earth isn't that old.

       Indeed! Stands for social justice warrior. Do yourself the humerous favor of youtubing SJW pronoun. a Caveat, don't spend too much time there, you'll go insane, 9 out of 10 doctors say so.

       Yeah but only ten percent of dead animals die in a way their whole body can be preserved. And of those ten percent here is less than a one percent probability hat the bones will be persevered. How many times do people come across bear bones??? Very rarely because typically dead animals and their bones decompose entirely.

       As far as I know (and anyone feel free to correct because I'm working from memory) the dark ages happened around the rise of Christianity and the burning of libraries most notably the library of Alexandria in Egypt that housed ancient (ancient in respect to those living around 200 BC) knowledge of astronomy, alchemy, magic, mythology, etc.. And then certain texts (most attribute it to Aristotle) came back into European circulation from the Middle East which set the stage for the enlightenment

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Margaret J. Helder continues to explain: "Under what circumstances did whole organisms remain intact long enough to be fossilized? In most cases it seems, these victims were rapidly buried in great loads of sediment, which quickly hardened into rock. Not only did these situations require catastrophic burial but also the sediment involved had to be very fine grained in order for such exquisite preservation of detail to come about. Geologists generally interpret silt beds as the result of fine particles settling gradually out of still water. If that had happened in these instances, the corpses would have decayed long before burial and lithification (turning to rock) could occur."
The replacement process is supposed to involve calcium in skeletal material being replaced, atom by atom, by silica, calcite, pyrite, dolomite, etc., over a long period of time. This goes against the natural law of increasing disorder, entropy. How are all these dead atoms intelligent enough to know what to do and where to go to produce the finished fossil?

       Dude, as limited as my knowledge is, that question just disregards rationality in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all you use the phrase "dead atoms" which I've nevereverfuckingever encountered in my life. Really. Have no idea where you came up with dead atoms. Or live atoms Jesus anyway.So until that term is elucidated, everything is a cow's opinion (moooooot)
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point of fossils as elementary school me understood it was that there are only special conditions in which fossils form, hence our limited sample size.

       I - used a quote from someone who used this term. I assume she meant atoms part of an organism that is now dead.

       Again. You use the pronoun she without referring to an actual fucking subject. English, motherfucker. Do you speak it?

       Did you read what I just said? ATOMS PART OF AN ORGANISM THAT IS NOW DEAD that's what I believe she was referring to when she said "Dead atoms". YES ORGANISMS DIE THEY CONTAIN ATOMS --- WE ALL HERE ARE AWARE OF WHAT AN ATOM IS

       First off it was a quote from pulp fiction lol, thought that was popular enough.. Obviously I was mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I was asking was what is the distinction between an atom in a living organism and one in a dead one. Because as far as I know atoms aren't ever "alive" as the word is currently defined.

       Obviously they are real. So how can dinosaurs have survived on a flat earth for millions of years leading to evolutionary changes into humans where the sun is obviously setting and rising and orbiting in space. Does the flat earth have the sun orbiting around it?

       Because I look up. In the sky. I track planets. The sun can't be spawned each day because there are seasons and differences of the sun setting and rising per place. You can contact people you know across the USA and ask them if the sun is out and talk about how dark and light it is out. If the earth were actually flat, a light as bright as the sun would be hard not to see at the same time

       OKAY and that's your argument against the flat earth theory, here is your proof for saying its false. What you just said is good - solid observations of your reality. Although nowhere did you mention dinosaur bones. For the record I don't subscribe to the belief the earth is flat, my question for you is above - What do dinosaur bones have to do with disproving it.

       Since dinosaurs are around, it proves the earth has been around to sustain the dinosaurs. If the earth is a living eco system, how can it be flat? I would assume the edges would be found, or the connections of the flat earth (if there is 'no edge') would have altered the very obvious navigating tools such as a sexton. We wouldn't have made the latitude and longitude measurements had there not been this tool.

       Your not arguing with someone who subscribes to the flat earth theory. Your post is how do flat-earth theorists explain dinosaurs - I said "what do Dinosaurs have to do with disproving flat earth theory?" What you just said is more relevant debatable thoughts that next time - you should start the post with.

       First off the dinosaurs prove the earth has been around for a very long time. Second off since the earth has been around for a long time the sexton is a device which sailors have used for centuries to navigate the seas by longitude and latitude

       If what you mean to say is : dinosaurs prove earth has existed for some time and if the earth has existed for some time then why do we have nav tools / haven't found edge/ etc.

       Well see now we are debating something entirely different - which is: has the earth existed for as long as we believe? How do you know for certainty that right as you were born this reality was started as a holographic simulation of a fictional story you were meant to exist inside?

      <p>
       Latitude and longitude can be measured by you. And since it can be measured the stars and the planets orbit around eachother in space that's how that tool works. If they orbit around each other in space .  THIS IS DIRECTLY PROVING THAT EARH HAS BEEN AROUND A VERY LONG TIME AND THE DINOSAURS LIVED ON THE SAME PLANET ORBITING THE SUN(confirmed). If we orbit the sun and other planets orbit the sun, is it just our flat earth in the solar system? And other planets are spherical? NO. Gravity for one would have to be explained mathematically in a completely different way... . And you are stupid for arguing a point you don't even believe. You are arguing for the fun of it.. I started this thread to get answers from serious people who believe it. You don't, you are a troll.

       NO!! I wanted serious people to explain their thoughts maybe how we are living in a matrix and everything is holographed and dinosaur bones are fake. Or the flat earth is a perception that all humans exp life as a flat plane there for this form of creative consciousness might manifest itself to be flat! Anything something smart . But instead you fucking troll me and say, how do dinosaurs disprove it. Which I explain. And you offer nothing serious to this conversation, just stupid arguing For a point you don't even fucking believe. Stfu and stop trolling this question. If you think the world is a hologram and we are all computer simulations TELL ME THAT! I want to hear SERIOUS stuff. You are not. You are trolling me wanting to argue a stupid fucking point you don't even believe.

       You live on a flat plane of ground its not that big. Its about the size of where you have actually physically travelled to in the past 24 hours cause that's how old the earth is - i mean not the earth your existence in reality. All the history books, memories you have, the bones in the ground, the shit you see in the sky, the videos online and on tv that come to you through digital means (meaning its all 1s and 0s) - its all a holographic illusion of something that once existed in some realm and your experiencing it inside a body of a human being named robaloie who once existed in some realm.

       Plus this 'small part of space on earth I've travelled' I have been able to call people from different areas of the earth and talk to them about how the sun is out where they are and it is set where I am. Are these people fake too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe my whole life was a computer simulation. But does that mean the earth is actually based off of a 'real earth' that they now replicate for us to live in the fake holographic earth?

       Maybe your existence inside the simulation is a rendering of a time so long ago on a planet long gone in another dimension where time existed that you experience is just to see what it was like and maybe that's why you question stupid things humans do like me the troll.

       That's not true, I actually respect you more if what you said is true about your life. I am not telling you what the truth is.. I can't do that all I am trying to tell you is neither of us KNOW THE TRUTH for all we know what I just said above really is true? For after all you cannot disprove it? And I cannot prove it.

       You can't sit here and explain to me how it is gravity physically holds my body to the ground as it does because science hasn't even witnessed why. They have a good idea why of course, but have yet to witness it.

       This whole thing started honestly cause you said "Dinosaurs Disprove Flat Earth" and to me it just seemed like an ignorant statement. But I can see now your actually intelligent and maybe the post wasn't an ignorant one but to eventually checkmate a flat-earther with your previous statements of longitude/orbits/etc. Either way its all good - you can be right and I can be wrong - in the end we'll see

       What? Scientist haven't found a unifying theory on how gravity and the other forces were at one point all one Super force.  Because of that scientists are unsure of what Super gravity was mathematically.  It's not that we can't witness gravity,,,,,  the moon tugs on the oceans and creates the tides.  That's witness right there if you have ever been to the ocean.

       It's not that I'm trying to check mate flat earthers as it is to get them to think about the theory they are letting out. Has it been thought out all the way thru? Does flat earth orbit the sun? Is it an explanation of computer simulation?!?! And the most annoying shit is the only people to ever comment on my serious posts are people who don't even believe it and say oh well at the end.

       Let me get you to where I am now.
You seem intelligent so I am going to ask you are you aware of the double slit experiment and the conclusion to which it came? If you are (which I believe you are) then to get a grasp on what I believe is this: the conclusion of that experiment isn't the particle behaving as it should under observation it is behaving as the observer BELIEVES it should behave.

       Yes, I love that experiment . So much possibilities after the comprehension of YOUR power with manifestation of reality. I like to apply it to the observable universe. I read an astronomy paper once theorizing observing space and the universe could change simply by observing space ( the idea being the slit experiment on the large scale ). Blew my mind

       SO Did the story of Jesus walking on water really happen? Could Jesus walk on water because he was "special" or because he was "supernatural" or "different than you or me"? Well the story also told of his disciple walking on water with him (a common man) but began to sink when he seen the waves of the water because fear brings doubt - the opposite of belief or faith. For the disciple to achieve the impossible he had to believe he could which probably came from seeing Jesus doing it because for some - seeing is believing. Faith is believing without seeing. Do you think you could walk on water? I do. I think you could but only if you believed it. Society, Science, and the entire World says you cannot that it is physically impossible. If you go out to the lake now and try to walk on the water if you fail it will be because you doubt it more than you believe it. Hard to overcome the walls of belief built around our minds since birth that some things are impossible - it builds a mass prison for minds living in a place ruled over by others who are aware of the truth.

       YES that is a problem but you must understand what that problem is. Their belief/doubt only is a problem because it can influence your mind - and in turn influence your belief. INFLUENCE - They can tell you with words, with charts, with books, with demonstrations, and eventually they can convince your mind to believe that walking on the water of a lake is impossible - therefore for you to actually do it would lead to failure because your mind believes more that you cannot.

       The story is one example of countless ones in history where one person achieves a goal or outcome in reality that a majority of the minds of people around them believed to be an impossibility. This is especially so when the person who achieves the impossible outcome does so by believing it will be so - believing it so blindly (faith) usually due to a burning intention of helping others.

       No you would be walking on frozen water which would be different - different in the fact that the entire planet believes this to be possible and therefore me and you believe it as well, there is little doubt to combat our belief of this possibility.

       What I meant is they claim there are tiny tiny particles called gravitons that are bombarding your physical body in a gravitational wave to keep you held down. We have yet to observe these particles but yes we can see the effects of what we call "gravity". Its also odd how gravity/time/space can be altered like if I were near a black hole for 20 minutes and you were here for 20 years. We still have much to learn.

       Yeah so what I meant was we have yet to witness eyeball gravity's hand. I mean we can see an electron but we can't see the rope that pulls the tides from the moon or the blanket that pushes you down when you try to jump. The physical particles of gravity itself which seems odd to me - maybe given time it will be seen or perhaps it is something else.

Everything you use to argue with is just information fed to you with words or ones and zeros.

       For what purpose are you testing me on reddit?
I am not an astronaut but I am an amateur astronomer.
And a psychonaut. I do not have a unifying theory of quantum mechanics, but if you don't believe in scientific reality or whatever you said, what do you believe. I'm tired of you saying I'm wrong without bringing ANYTHING RELEVANT to the conversation outside of arguing. You say dinosaurs don't prove the earth is flat, but i explained how they did with the orbiting of the stars. And you keep arguing it doesn't, well tell me how it doesn't. Tell me they aren't real!!! tell me something besides mindless argumentative BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the record I think the law of thermodynamics specifically the part about free energy not being able to exist is BS.  I've worked on a free energy device before. Learned all about hydrogen. So no, I don't believe 'status quo' science

       Every time God gets sick of his creation he flops down a new layer of Earth, electing an alleged child rapist president and pizzagate are the last straw for the human layer so say your goodbyes. Dinosaurs were the last layer but on the water parts allowed crocodiles and shit to escape. That's where atlantis comes from coincidentally, the first layer of cake is the most ancient civ.

       pfft Amateur, Atlanteans were all furries, they genetically engineered Dinosaurs as the ideal sex partner. It was consensual, but the dinos were too hardy due to having rock hard bods and surviving without the atlanteans.

       I've always felt like flat earth was equivalent to bible speak.. Could very well be the narrative I was told, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kinda think flat earth is ridiculous although admittedly I have no research one way or the other. The thought I have that allows me to continue without cognitive dissonance is "who would profit from a lie that the earth is round when in reality, it is flat". Because the answer is no one outside of intelligence agencies looking to discredit other things by association. Just my payment to the boatman

       Wait how? If flat earth is a thing? At what point is the earth decayed? How can millions of years of evolution and orbiting around the sun and planets all of a sudden be false? I can watch Jupiter almost every night. And it will change its position through out the years. I have a telescope. And I watch the Galileo moons (?) orbit around it daily, sometimes hourly. I can track the space station, and predict when it will come around again all based on orbit predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply because the earth is a massive land in comparison to us. Does not mean it is a perfect sphere. On this critical mass of matter in the shape of a sphere does not mean it is a perfect sphere. Just study any planet besides the gas giants to realize this fact. There is no evidence the earth is flat.

       . Ummm, how do we know dinosaurs existed millions of years ago and not only thousands?  If fossils are preserved via events such as volcanic eruptions and floods, couldn't dinosaurs be totally real but misplaced in time?  Aren't there artifacts with dinosaurs on them from China and South America?  Maybe (global flood) cataclysm + hunting to extinction is what actually killed the dinosaurs.

       Maybe they're fake.  Who knows.  I don't really give a shit.
