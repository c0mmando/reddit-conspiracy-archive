<p>What does this mean? Where are you getting that he was in DC?</p>

<p>Is this an example of a disinformation campaign in action? Just state a random &quot;question&quot; in a tangentially related post to muddy the discussion? A question with a completely unsubstantiated implication?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried to objectively look at everything presented to me about Pizzagate. Every single piece of evidence in favor of this theory has either been patently false, misleading, or easily explainable.</p>

<p>This post is no exception.</p>

<p>The person who created the image with the screenshots clearly chose an article that used the words &quot;chilling&quot; and &quot;snuff film&quot; (???) to describe the mentioned videos in a clear effort to make it look like Frank Winston was referring to something relating to pizzagate.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The text referenced from &quot;WashingtonCityPaper.com&quot; mentions a &quot;chillingly subtitled youtube video&quot;. It also calls it a &quot;snuff film&quot; in the first pane of the image. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHXBrEXmowo">Here&#39;s the video.</a> It is a video of 2 people playing ping pong in front of Comet Ping Pong. Frank Winstead was complaining that it wasn&#39;t safe. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjStW6eLz0">Here&#39;s the second &quot;chilling&quot; video mentioned.</a> It&#39;s about UPS drivers parking wherever they want. Frank Winstead was complaining that it wasn&#39;t safe.</p></li>
<li><p>This weak link is further reinforced by the quoting of &quot;murders and rapes&quot;. However, if you <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2008/06/dc_official_outdoor_seats_at_p.html">read what actually happened,</a> it&#39;s clear that the person who created the image took the quote out of context:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A supporter of Comet addressed the commission, which was considering owner James Alefantis&#39;s application to extend his opening hours deeper into the evening, provide musical entertainment inside his restaurant, and add a patio for outdoor seating out front. The woman asked the commissioners why they would want to restrict Comet and other local businesses so that she has to travel 25 blocks away to find a late-night place for food and drink. &quot;Why am I denied the privilege and the pleasure of a venue less than a block and a half away?&quot; the resident asked.</p>

<p>Winstead, who has taken it upon himself to act as the guardian of clear and quiet streets in his section of Northwest Washington, replied: &quot;Safety. James is trying to turn this into Adams Morgan, with the murders, the rapes....&quot; At this point, the crowd&#39;s roar overwhelmed the commissioner&#39;s remarks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frank Winstead&#39;s implication is clearly that late opening hours will encourage crime. This is not even close to relating to child molestation, Satan worshiping, cannibalism, or any other pizzagate allegation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The rest is just bad reasoning. There are possibly thousands of people who are actively &quot;investigating&quot; pizzagate. One of them even went there with his rifle to see for himself. It&#39;s a matter probabilities that one of the pizzagate wackos is going to die after throwing out a wild accusation. The guy didn&#39;t even have anything. He was just asking questions. He had less than most pizzagate believers. Killing him doesn&#39;t even tie that loose end. It leaves it wide open for anyone else to ask the exact same question.</p>

<p>This is not proof of a conspiracy. This is called looking for evidence that supports a conclusion you&#39;ve already reached. It&#39;s confirmation bias. Some people are so intent on seeing Clinton &amp; Co. behind bars they&#39;ve thrown all ability to reason out the window. Every single piece of evidence pizzagate peddlers have presented has been as misleading, or easily explained as this shitpost.</p>

<p>A mountain of bullshit is still bullshit. So far, Pizzagate proponents have nothing.</p>

<p>Edit: After re-reading the articles on &quot;WashingtonCityPaper.com&quot; (to try to figure out why they called it a &quot;snuff film&quot;), it became pretty clear to me that they were talking about the &quot;chilling&quot; and &quot;snuff&quot; video with a tongue in cheek. The author of OP&#39;s image and/or OP are clearly misrepresenting facts and taking quotes out of context to push their narrative.</p>

<p>Second Edit: Instead of debating my argument on its own merit, pizzagate proponents have chosen instead to accuse me of being a shill or stupid. This level of discourse is expected when they don&#39;t have actual real-life evidence that supports their claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>paid by the word</p>

<p>No one can be that stupid after really looking at all the evidence and findings behind PizzaGate</p>

<p>This is actually my second sentence. I was reiterating that I&#39;ve tried to go through every piece of evidence presented to me and, so far, none of it has been anything more than innuendo. Many times, it&#39;s completely fabricated. This is a crucial part of my argument. I don&#39;t see how I switched tracks.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll apologize for this. I certainly don&#39;t mean any disrespect to Michael Blevin or his family. We&#39;re discussing what everyone agrees to be serious allegations and I can get worked up a bit.</p>

<p>Naturally, when I read your posts, I am intrigued because your mindset runs counter to the usual milieu of comment on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, or on reddit in general.</p>

<p>Would you be opposed to a little turing test of sorts, in order to get a better idea of where you are coming from?</p>

<p>The question is simple: Are there any conspiracy theories that you do believe in?</p>

<p>I have never asked you to accuse anyone. As a human being, though, it is pretty obvious that something suspicious is going on. So, if I were to write a message to you on a website, I would expect that you would have some kind of intelligent reaction to what I post.

<p>No it&#39;s not. Just because people keep repeating it, doesn&#39;t make it any more true. In fact, as a rational human being, the more I look into the evidence objectively, the more obvious it is that nothing suspicious is going on. At least not with pizza. This post we&#39;re responding to is a perfect example of how misleading and non-suspicious pizzagate &quot;evidence&quot; is.</p>

<p>Again, no. Only if you read the emails with a preconceived notion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Every single one of them either makes perfect sense to an average reader or can easily be explainable.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>When you look at it in context (instead of taking the sentence completely <em>out</em> of context), it makes perfect sense. They were sent an assortment of cheeses instead of a usual gift of pasta. They reference playing dominos, and the author asks rhetorically if he&#39;ll do better &quot;on&quot; cheeses this year, as opposed to pasta. The wording isn&#39;t even that strange. It&#39;s like saying, &quot;Do you think I&#39;d perform better on whey protein?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does it make sense to you that someone would have a pizza related map on a handkerchief? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s suspicious about a handkerchief with a design on it? If you look at this piece of evidence without first assuming some kind of guilt, there&#39;s nothing suspicious about it. Someone did a quick little write-up that I&#39;ll reference: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Monday, the day before they left, a bunch of them piled into the car of Kate, the realtor. They drove around the island looking at rental properties for their next visit. They had fun gossiping.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, they had to go home. Kate the realtor went to check on the house the Sandlers had rented. She found a &quot;a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zaqGYB4.png">on the kitchen island.</a>&quot; She wrote Susan Sandler an email asking her if they wanted her to mail the handkerchief to them. She also asked about some pillows that Susan had bought. Susan must have called her, because she forwarded the email to John (and his assistant) with more description: &quot;I think it has a map that seems pizza-related.&quot; Maybe it looks like a bit like <a href="https://imgur.com/MTifP6x.jpg">this one</a>. Maybe it was a promotional item made by a pizza restaurant chain. Or maybe his brother Tony, who has a pizza oven in his back yard and loves to throw pizza parties, had some handkerchiefs printed up with maps to prizes in his back yard! There are so many possibilities. But we&#39;ll probably never know, because this is John Podesta&#39;s private life and we&#39;re creepy voyeurs rummaging through his private email.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far every piece of &quot;evidence&quot; has been like this. Having a mountain of extremely poor quality &quot;evidence&quot; doesn&#39;t make it strong evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take it you&#39;re referring to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4uuMMdp.png">these paintings.</a> The only reason these pictures are brought up by pizzagate proponents is because Tony Podesta mentions that he has art from Biljana Djurdjevic. However, if you look at <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/06/05/inside-homes-private-viewing/">the actual article referenced</a> and scroll to the bottom of the page (where pictures of his home are included) it&#39;s clear that he has <em>other</em> paintings from that artist. Namely, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DZ5XWux.png"><em>Synchronized Swimming</em></a> and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0vekdCZ.png"><em>Garden</em></a>.</p>

<p>In other words, he does not have that &quot;child porn&quot; art in his home, and most likely doesn&#39;t own it at all. This &quot;evidence&quot; is just another example of how pizzagate proponents are willing to misrepresent facts in order to push their narrative.</p>

<p>On a side note, even if he <em>did</em> have those paintings, they would be only a part of his overall collection. I think we can all agree that what one person considers &quot;art&quot;, another person may consider tasteless. There&#39;s another post somewhere on this sub pointing out Family Guy&#39;s references to pedophilia. South Park has also made jokes about Mr Garrison <em>wanting</em> to have been molested by his father. My point is, we first have to look at every piece of evidence in context. Complete context. Someone can own a season of South Park, think that their pedo jokes are funny, and <em>not</em> be a pedophile. This is moot point, however. Seeing as there is no evidence he actually owns those paintings (as I explained above).</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just curious how your world view is so different than mine. Like, you legitimately think this shit is normal? Ignoring pizzagate or whatever, you legitimately don&#39;t find the Podesta brothers creepy as fuck? If you went to your friends house or his brothers house and saw these fucking statues and &quot;art&quot; you wouldn&#39;t be a <em>little</em> creeped the fuck out? This is not normal, and it scares me how you&#39;re trying to normalize it and makes me wonder if other people legitimately think this way. If you can&#39;t even admit this is creepy as fuck, of course you wouldn&#39;t be able to admit that they are involved in something deeper. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to point out that I don&#39;t 100% believe everything about pizzagate, but there is so much (circumstantial) evidence that points to something really fucking weird about some of these people. A lot of the things they are doing/are involved in are not normal, yet people are pretending like it is. It&#39;s crazy to me.</p>

<p><strong>For the sake of argument</strong>, I conceded if it is related to Jeffery Dahmer, it wouldn&#39;t be related to &quot;child porn&quot;, which is what these allegations are all about.</p>

<p>Not really. They&#39;re art snobs, maybe. I don&#39;t know them personally, so I can&#39;t really make that judgement based on a couple pieces of art. I&#39;ve seen more &quot;disturbing&quot; pieces of art on CD covers.</p>

<p>But again, for the sake of argument, how does a statue that relates to a homosexual serial killer support evidence that the Podesta&#39;s are child molesters?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh... I&#39;m running out of time. I need to do xmas things. Comments like this are just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. AKA, the &quot;shotgun argument&quot; approach.</p>

<p>This girl&#39;s an &quot;artist&quot; and possible edgelord. I&#39;m not sure what the this &quot;evidence&quot; is supposed to tell us. One of the pictures is just a picture of a handkerchief. That&#39;s not evidence. That&#39;s innuendo on behalf of the dude taking these out-of-context screencaps. From what I gather, her only connection to pizzagate is that she used to work at Comet Pizza a few years ago.</p>

<p>The only thing creepy here is that someone was going through hundreds of posts on this young girl&#39;s facebook page looking for odd references to pasta/food (finally finding something in 2012). Once we look at these posts, even if we were to substitute that unsourced &quot;code word&quot; list from the original pizzagate allegations, the posts wouldn&#39;t make any more sense. It&#39;s clearly either an inside joke, or she&#39;s being &quot;artistic&quot; or something. Edit: Or she&#39;s talking about what she says she&#39;s talking about (i.e. candy and chocolates).</p>

<p>In other words, no code word or explanation would make these posts look like they have anything to do with child molestation/trafficking/cannibalism/etc. Do you have any evidence that these posts <em>do</em> imply any of these pizzagate allegations? Or are you just &quot;asking questions&quot;? The burden of proof is on the accuser. What pizzagate proponents do is simply make wild <strong>speculations</strong> and &quot;ask questions&quot;, then pass that off as &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly what you&#39;re talking about. It&#39;s as weak as any &quot;evidence&quot; pizzagate proponents have. If you show the email (<strong>the entire email, not just the postscript</strong>) and context to a rational human being, they would easily be able to explain what this means. I&#39;ve explained in <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5k6jre/man_dies_suddenly_after_contacting_2008_accuser/dbm5o2k/">another post</a>, so I&#39;ll just reference the relevant parts (sorry, I gotta go do xmas stuff and can&#39;t keep rewriting what I&#39;m saying):</p>

<hr/>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe that the podesta emails make sense as English sentences, or do you believe that code words are being used? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every single one of them either makes perfect sense to an average reader or can easily be explainable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, does it make sense to you that someone would play dominos on pasta and cheese?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you look at it in context (instead of taking the sentence completely <em>out</em> of context), it makes perfect sense. They were sent an assortment of cheeses instead of a usual gift of pasta. They reference playing dominos, and the author asks rhetorically if he&#39;ll do better &quot;on&quot; cheeses this year, as opposed to pasta. The wording isn&#39;t even that strange. It&#39;s like saying, &quot;Do you think I&#39;d perform better on whey protein?&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;ll also add what <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5hgyuk/debunkers_use_any_photo_of_pedostas_art_as_your/db0jbsw/">someone else said</a>, since I feel they helped show how ridiculous this claim is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s an 83-year-old man and his 60-somthing female friend... <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34860">getting the shit beat out of them by his own grown daughter</a> during kinky BDSM sex play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no context leading up to the phrase. This is an exact copy from the email we are talking about: </p>

<p>Ps. Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</p>

<p>You are looking into this phrase way too much. Read it for what it is. Dominoes. Cheese. Pasta. Two of those words have been deemed code words by known pedos. Deemed not by some random person but the FBI. </p>

<p>Obvious shill. You are trying to hard to explain something that is right there in your face. Your argument about how you  have to read the email in context holds no ground. This part of the email is apart from the rest of the email and is in its own context. Also, if you don&#39;t like that, here is another email that I have copied: </p>

<p>Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours? They can send it if you want. I know you’re busy, so feel free not to respond if it’s not yours or you don’t want it.</p>

<p>Please tell me the correct context here. Pizza again is another code word used by pedos. What does a handkerchief have to do with pizza? Please tell me this is out of context. </p>

<p>Again, you are a shill. </p>

<p>Edit: also, I reread the original email we were talking about, and there is no other context. The beginning of the email talks about how she would have liked to have known they changed their strategy. Who talks about gift giving in this context?? There is obviously another narrative here that they are trying to hide through the use of code words. Please tell me I am wrong because I will copy the entire email for you and we can discuss further.</p>

<p>Mary and John</p>

<p>I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them.
Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.
I miss you both
Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

    <div class="md"><p>I have the actual audio recording of the meeting where Winstead spoke out against CPP... you are correct. He doesn&#39;t claim anything insane is happening at CPP aside from permit violations and attracting a &quot;sordid lot&quot; to that area of town... People are taking it out of context... FW knew a lot of fuckery was about but he never claimed that there were rapes or murders or anything going on inside of CPP aside from permit shenanigans and a bunch of weirdos hanging out. </p>

<p>Stuff like the kid &#39;screaming for help&#39; outside CPP on that video when it was blatantly the kid walking past with its parents. The latest one is that &#39;webcam video&#39; search on YouTube which gets reposted every hour despite it being found to be nothing.

<p>Except a month ago before somebody posted a fake code list on 4chan it didn&#39;t. It meant either someone who really likes to eat chicken, or somebody who fucks them, like from the south park episode. </p>

<p>And this connects to pedophilia how? </p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>No but if I did I wouldn&#39;t immediately think &quot;I bet he&#39;s fucking that kid&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing though, it doesn&#39;t. You got that from a fake list of codewords created by 4chan and spread by Trump supporters trying to smear Podesta and anybody who has ever associated with him. The definition you got is from after this all started, like I already said. It&#39;s not a gay slang term, it&#39;s a made up pedophile code word. And it&#39;s not even a young boy in the picture, it&#39;s a toddler. </p>

<p>I&#39;m here because this is a witch hunt designed to smear democratic donors, use Internet lynch mobs to dig up dirt on political opponents while searching for &quot;evidence&quot; of pizza gate, and distract attention from the fact that massive conflicts in interest in Trumps proposed cabinet, like his secretary of state set to make billions using the power of the federal government to push Exonns interests. Pizzagate is all nonsense, without the fake code words there is literally nothing linking this to pedophilia at all. </p>

<p>The guy exaggerates. That was the point of <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/city-desk/blog/13055232/confronting-frank-winstead">the article</a>. Notice how they call their video, &quot;Frank Winstead Gives Us The Bird.&quot;</p>

<p>Additionally, if you read <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2008/06/dc_official_outdoor_seats_at_p.html">the context of the quote itself,</a> it should be pretty clear he was referring to the late opening hours causing &quot;rapes and murders&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A supporter of Comet addressed the commission, which was considering owner James Alefantis&#39;s application to extend his opening hours deeper into the evening, provide musical entertainment inside his restaurant, and add a patio for outdoor seating out front. The woman asked the commissioners why they would want to restrict Comet and other local businesses so that she has to travel 25 blocks away to find a late-night place for food and drink. &quot;Why am I denied the privilege and the pleasure of a venue less than a block and a half away?&quot; the resident asked.</p>

<p>Winstead, who has taken it upon himself to act as the guardian of clear and quiet streets in his section of Northwest Washington, replied: &quot;Safety. James is trying to turn this into Adams Morgan, with the murders, the rapes....&quot; At this point, the crowd&#39;s roar overwhelmed the commissioner&#39;s remarks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn&#39;t sound like someone implying child molestation, Satan worshiping, cannibalism, or any other Pizzagate related allegation.</p>
