<p>I know there is a segment among many &quot;end of days&quot; Christian types who are raising the alarm (I&#39;ve watched few youtube videos), but there are even some concerns among respected scientists on what they&#39;re doing (I think even Stephen Hawking expressed grave concern with them opening up a black hole and whatnot). I haven&#39;t read too much into it, and much of it is guarded in secrecy, but I get a bad vibe. There are some inexplicable weather and ominous looking clouds that form in the area (some have even claimed they&#39;re portals) and just other strange occurrences.</p>

<p>Also, what was up with that occult ritual and mock sacrifice at the CERN facility last summer? Was that real or just a hoax?</p>

<p>Have they made contact with a parallel universe? Is anyone uneasy with them playing around with &quot;antimatter&quot; and the interdimensional realms? I fear some sort of God complex they&#39;re developing.  Why isn&#39;t anyone putting a magnifying glass on their activities? I think there might be more than just &quot;science&quot; that is going on there.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s very possible. ET&#39;s, imo are not extraterrestrial but terrestrial inter-dimensional beings. They&#39;ve been here with us for many, many, many years, and humans have been around for hundreds of thousands if not millions of years before &quot;evolution&quot;. There was no evolution, imo. Meaning, humans did not evolve from primates, like Darwin says. Darwin was an evil gatekeeper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. You&#39;ve asked some questions that I can answer, or have stated some things that are misinformed (easy to do when there seems to be a lucrative blogging/vlogging industry of making stuff up about CERN)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but there are even some concerns among respected scientists on what they&#39;re doing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you link to any? I&#39;ve only seen crackpots saying stuff like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(I think even Stephen Hawking expressed grave concern with them opening up a black hole and whatnot).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He didn&#39;t. He was grossly misquoted. Hawking wrote the foreword to some book, in which he mentioned the idea of the False Vacuum. This is a mainstream idea that has been around since the 1970s. Because it has something to do with the Higgs field, various blogs and such twisted it into a &quot;warning&quot; about the machine which discovered the Higgs boson.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>much of it is guarded in secrecy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you got that idea. CERN is very open. Other than standard personal privacy, the only things which are temporarily kept secret are unfinished results so 1) everyone whose name goes on the paper is satisfied that the analysis is done correctly before it goes public and 2) to avoid biasing the work of theorists or people doing the same analysis on comparable experiments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are some inexplicable weather and ominous looking clouds that form in the area</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Geneva gets some fantastic thunderstorms during the summer, but so do many places at the foot of the Alps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, what was up with that occult ritual and mock sacrifice at the CERN facility last summer? Was that real or just a hoax?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Drunken hoax by PhD students who wanted to see the reaction from the conspiracy theory part of the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have they made contact with a parallel universe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is anyone uneasy with them playing around with &quot;antimatter&quot; and the interdimensional realms?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very strange that you put the actual real thing in quotes and not the science fiction thing. I don&#39;t think any scientist are uneasy about experiments with antimatter. The worst it can do (like any accelerator experiment) is give someone a dose of radiation of they violate safety protocol and get too close.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why isn&#39;t anyone putting a magnifying glass on their activities?</p>

<p>Particle theorists are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a real conspiracy - of sorts - regarding military research of antimatter and containment to develop nuclear weapons triggers. CERN has been at the forefront of researching generation and storage. It would take only a microgram to half a microgram (still a considerable amount to store) to function as a D-T weapons trigger. Though there are rumors the storage problem has been resolved using arrays of micron sized magnetic bottles. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good paper on the subject:</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0510071.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0510071.pdf</a></p>

<p>None of this has anything to do with demons coming out of portals from other dimensions and altering the past through high energy collision - or any of that utter bullshit. 4th gen nukes are real science. With real military application. </p>

<p>Admittedly, I only recalled seeing the headlines &quot;STEPHEN HAWKING THINKS THE LHC IS GOING TO DESTROY THE UNIVERSE&quot; a few years ago but didn&#39;t think much of it until I watched a few paranoid CERN videos the other night, so really the OP stemmed from that.</p>

<p>From a cnet article: </p>

<p>&quot;However, in a preface to a new book called &quot;Starmus&quot; -- a collection of lectures given by famous scientists and astronomers -- Hawking worried that the Higgs Boson might become unstable.</p>

<p>He wrote: &quot;The Higgs potential has the worrisome feature that it might become metastable at energies above 100bn gigaelectronvolts (GeV).&quot;</p>

<p>What might this lead to? Hawkins explained: &quot;This could mean that the universe could undergo catastrophic vacuum decay, with a bubble of the true vacuum expanding at the speed of light. This could happen at any time and we wouldn&#39;t see it coming.&quot;</p>

<p>but..the article added this:</p>

<p>&quot;Before you prepare your loved ones for an evacuation to some distant star, Hawking did offer some hope with, it seems, a wry smile: &quot;A particle accelerator that reaches 100bn GeV would be larger than Earth, and is unlikely to be funded in the present economic climate.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>I figured that was likely, I know a lot of celebrities like to troll the conspiracy theorists who think they&#39;re Illuminati members or whatever, but there is a lot of weird and occultist like behavior in a lot of these organizations. Some of it is just playful fun, but some of it is genuinely creepy and scary. I know next to nothing about CERN, however.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you got that idea. CERN is very open. </p>

<p>That&#39;s reassuring. I take it you are intimately familiar or involved with them? Is there any kind of hierarchical order like there are in every other organization, government, and institution?</p>

<p>You have to admit though, some of those photos that were taken were so visually awesome that it just added fuel to the conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>I tend to use quotes a lot, sorry. I realize antimatter is a real thing, I am just curious how an organization conducting all types of experimentation centered around the origins of the universe using high energy and neutral terms like &quot;god particle&quot; is a completely safe thing and nothing catastrophic could happen.  Can you understand how they can make some (the uneducated masses which I&#39;m apart of) frightened or at least a bit skeptical? Experimentation being the key word here.

<p>Here&#39;s how the personnel are categorised: <a href="https://jobs.web.cern.ch/sites/jobs.web.cern.ch/files/mop2.png">https://jobs.web.cern.ch/sites/jobs.web.cern.ch/files/mop2.png</a></p>

<p>The biggest category (11,000 people out of 16,000 total) is &quot;Users&quot;: experimental particle physicists who are not CERN employees. I&#39;m one of those.</p>

<p>There is an organisational structure to CERN, which you can read about here: <a href="https://home.cern/about/structure-cern">https://home.cern/about/structure-cern</a> That mostly concerns staff and fellows, who are mostly engineers, technicians, secretaries, etc. Users aren&#39;t directly answerable to the department heads (we have our own bosses at our own universities/labs/etc)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am just curious how an organization conducting all types of experimentation centered around the origins of the universe using high energy and neutral terms like &quot;god particle&quot; is a completely safe thing and nothing catastrophic could happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Particle physics really has its roots in cloud chamber experiments, which detected the collision products of cosmic rays. The Earth is constantly being bombarded with high-energy protons (some with much much more energy than the LHC). You can get more out of your experiments if you can control where and when the collisions happen, hence why accelerators are used.</p>

<p>I realise there&#39;s lots of puffery about the things we can learn from the collisions, but the collisions themselves are everyday natural occurrences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you understand how they can make some [...] frightened or at least a bit skeptical?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. Personally, I think that Dan Brown book &amp; film did quite a bit of damage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So that&#39;s it? For an organization with such a grandiose objective and agenda there is nothing else going on? Nothing esoteric? No earth shattering knowledge and discoveries? How boring. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a <em>lot</em> of physics going on. The LHC experiments have pushed out over a thousand papers between them, then there are all the smaller experiments on the other accelerators. Personally I don&#39;t think it&#39;s boring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The organisation is funded by the member states, and in return it is only allowed to award contracts to businesses in member states. From a purely fiscal point of view, there&#39;s the multiplier effect from that.</p>

<p>Something like 70% of the CERN personnel are not employed by CERN (so it&#39;s not like the member states are funding ~16,000 Swiss salaries). Nearly all of the particle physicists are employees or students at universities in various countries. </p>

<p>For specific projects, like the LHC, funding also comes from participating non-member states, such as the USA &amp; Russia. I believe this takes more of the form of providing expertise, materials and equipment than just cash.</p>

<p>The return on investment from all the money spent on the LHC includes lots of trained-up scientists and engineers and R&amp;D in things like large-scale computing, accelerator &amp; detector technologies which can be applied in industry and medicine. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>CERN&#39;s main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics research – as a result, numerous experiments have been constructed at CERN through international collaborations.</p>

<p>CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web. The main site at Meyrin has a large computer facility containing powerful data processing facilities, primarily for experimental-data analysis; because of the need to make these facilities available to researchers elsewhere, it has historically been a major wide area network hub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Particle accelerators and Internet.</p>

<p>How about you tell me what I should be looking for? Because as far as I can see, I was right: they smash really small particles into each other at high speeds. Nothing nefarious about that.</p>

<p>Where did I say that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but there is no evidence of that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, we have not found evidence of life outside of earth. But given that we roughly understand the parameters that life require coupled with the vast amount of space in the known universe, it&#39;s not unreasonable to believe that life is likely out there, but belief requires no evidence and I don&#39;t deal with unsubstantiated beliefs</p>

<p>It&#39;s the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This isn&#39;t <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a>, most of the shit in here has no or litle evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, sadly. But does the nature of a conspiracy mean there is no evidence? If you believe so, look up the definition of a conspiracy. Most posts and theories here go nowhere because people don&#39;t care about evidence, they care about a cool idea or how it makes them feel. That&#39;s not me, I want truth regardless of whether it will make me happy or not.</p>

<p>That, at least, we can agree on. I honestly have no personal pet theories about UFO/ET type things, it all seems pretty unlikely. I try to consider all possibilities.<br/>
  I am not schooled enough to understand what evidence exists supporting multiverse/many worlds theory. I know that a sizable portion of physicists believe it to be possible, but TBH math more difficult than algebra kinda escapes me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We live in 4 of them, dear. So yes.</p>

<p>In modern physics, space and time are unified in a four-dimensional Minkowski continuum called spacetime, whose metric treats the time dimension differently from the three spatial dimensions. There are an additional 6 or 7 dimensions depending on how you do the math. These dimensions theoretically exist just outside our perception, much like most of the light spectrum escapes our ability to perceive it (though that does not mean infrared light is a myth). </p>

<p>So there are exactly 4 dimensions that we know of: one of time and three of space. The time dimension needs no explanation; The three space dimensions are obviously length, width and height. The math dictates there are more dimensions, otherwise the rest of the universe would not exist around us the way it does. But regardless of whether or not you believe math and string theory, there is definitely more than 1 dimension. </p>

<p>That is why I suggest reading up on this before discussing it. </p>
