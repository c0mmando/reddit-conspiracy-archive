       Honestly, this used to be a place for critical thinking. Now it's becoming a place for genuine people posing questions and a bunch of hive-minded, easy-answer seeking, dimwits rallying against any idea that isn't there own. It's like r/politics has leaked into this sub since Pizzagate blew up. I'm not surprised, just pissed. This isn't a place for circle jerking, it's a place for taking something normally-accepted and looking at it from every angle. Take your downvotes and shove them securely up your ass, you closed-minded shills. Know that your resistance only makes us ask more questions, not less. That's the best part of the core of this sub. Your efforts are futile and you're just giving us more angles to see and helping us find new and better ways to combat stupidity.

       Those dedicated to truth, I have nothing but love for you, whether we agree or not.

       It's crazy. I didn't even know I had a political affiliation until other people started telling me I did. Woaaahhhhhh. Apparently when a system is bipartisan, hating one side means you automatically love the other.

       It has Blatantly changed around here. I stumbled upon this Sub a few years back and found it Thought Provoking and Intriguing. Don't get me wrong: I found that a sizable percentage of things posted were Batshit Crazy. But SOME of it was Fascinating. More importantly, there have always been Bright, Thoughtful people posting here. But in the last 6 months or so it has become 90% Bullshit, in MY opinion. And that sucks because, and call me Naive, I thought we had a Good Thing going here by and large. Rant Over......

       You are spot on. A lot of these Pizzagate people are just as closed minded as the SJWs crying in the streets right now. The clickbait headlines with no supporting evidence, the inability to accept any viewpoint outside their worldview, the narcissism, and the best part: attacking relentlessly those who ask important questions. These types of people completely discredit the movement, and there seem to be lots of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem a lot of these people take this as a joke, and are merely out to make a name for themselves instead of what should be the #1 goal here: brining these sick fucks to justice. I am so grateful that there are still a few open minded people on this sub that can clearly see what is happening, you seem to be one of them.

       PG is not a perfect investigation. I can't stand when I see people beating dead leads or trying to argue that they feel like a suspect is a suspect because it would be convenient if they were. That's not how truth works. Find evidence. Present it. When you do it will be more rewarding than trying to fit a square peg into a circle hole. At the end of the day, it's a lot of people looking for easy answers to very difficult questions. We cannot settle for that. We our complex. Our systems are complex. Our problems are complex. And guess what... The solution and the truth behind it, is very complex.
      </p>

       Keep fighting the fight of justice. We have the potential bridge political gaps with our pursuit of justice. The problem is the involvement of the Clinton Foundation. It's a corruptly run pay to play institution with tentacles in everything. But once you say the C word, it is used as an opening to make assumptions.

       Reddit has become "the reader's digest" of the Internet, formally "the front page of the internet". And your issue is a spill over from that. I've been a long time lurker to this sub and agree it has Changed, but that is from the users fleeing the reConstruCtion of Reddit. Keep posting and being active here. You wait, this sub will grow to become a safe haven for people seeking honest real life answers. This sub will be the new go-to for real answers to current events and past events

       I'm not gonna lie, I downvote everything related to pizzagate. This sub has become invaded by The_Donald, all you need to do  is just look at the post history of virtually anyone that is an ardent supporter of Pizzagate or the shear lack of coverage of one of the most controversial president-elects where there's so much evidence of corruption and abuse that the media (including Wikileaks) literally said they couldn't keep up with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP is probably literally complaining about people complaining about him in the Beau Biden post. Wow who knew disagreeing with OP meant you were a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       How  the hell  is a  post about Biden's son prosecuting a  pedophile on r/Conspiracy? I'm sorry, I don't see how  anyone can go from pizza-related hankie left at house (that Podesta didnt even want back) to largest  cover up in history and still call themselves critical thinkers. Like even fucking Biden is the  schrodinger's pedophile. Just  a month ago  I got people downvoting me for  saying that you couldn't actually hear what Biden had  said when a video on the  front page had provided subtitles of Biden saying a little girl made him horny.

       The politics stuff popped up over night about 2 weeks ago.  This is still an okay sub though because it's so easy to identify the disingenuous based on what this sub is all about.  They can't fake free thinking, they have to dismiss ideas, not entertain them

       I know what you're saying. I see alot of political discussion, with alot of downvoting involved. I don't get too worked up about it tho, I just vote and move on. I Click on the threads that interest me. At the end of the day, we all know that neither the left or right can do shit anyway. It's up to their puppet masters.

       I defended the right to free speech. Trump is a catalyst for change. If you don't see that then you're not paying attention. Have we ever had a reality tv star, who pisses off their own party, who MSM rallied against make it into office? No? Then he's obviously a catalyst for change. Whether it's putting a mirror up to how broken our system is or pushing us to a point of desperation, change is change. But go on. Keep telling me my own arguments while simultaneously proving my point.

       Trump IS the establishment. And we shall hunt him down and crucify him if necessary. He IS the power we need to investigate.

       I agree. Especially now that he is in a position of such terrifying power. We should definitely be scrutinizing him tenfold.

       I also think pedophilia in the USA needs to be taken More seriously and offenders, regardless of political or corporate power, need to be served justice.

       They are probably required to "stay on message" because it seems to me they post variations of the same phrases and arguments.  The most common being combination of something like, 'I've looked into and there is no evidence, where is the proof?  It's just weird hipster art.'

       They also try to dictate what is real and "normal" by using should/would statements.  Victims

       mmm.. Trump is an interesting distraction, but a distraction nonetheless. He's not the enemy. The totalitarian systems that put him in power are the focus. Whether America voted Trump or baby jesus, the shitstem was still fucked.

       I'd never make the mistake of proving someone else's point. And your arguments are there for everyone to see. All I did was read your OP, reply and say that I would look at your post history and it speaks for itself.

       2000 kids go missing in the US everyday. Keep calling them circle jerkers or whatever perverted name you want, I call them righteous truth blazers.

       bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first one I was saying that if I wanted to make sure myself or the people closest to me got away with a crime, I would want to be the one leading the investigation. Is that not something we have seen before? It's called skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second one was just me saying that the people at r/politics love to jump all over anything anti-Trump because it's low-hanging fruit. The article they hated on was misquoted, Trump or not, that's not a great way to read through political coverage. Just the headline? Come on, for a sub dedicated to politics I would expect better than that. Am I wrong? Do the people at r/politics NOT have biases?
      </p>
      <p>
       The third one was me saying what I responded to below "I defended the right to free speech. Trump is a catalyst for change. If you don't see that then you're not paying attention. Have we ever had a reality tv star, who pisses off their own party, who MSM rallied against make it into office? No? Then he's obviously a catalyst for change. Whether it's putting a mirror up to how broken our system is or pushing us to a point of desperation, change is change. But go on. Keep telling me my own arguments while simultaneously proving my point." which you so eloquently responded with an "LOL!" not sure what that means in reference to my response?
      </p>
      <p>
       As I looked through your post history it's clear that I'd be better off arguing with an inanimate object. You seem to like to throw people into groups to serve your own opposing opinions and then when you are back into a corner, respond with something dismissive or vague. I guess we all have our own techniques.

       We will call out his crimes and sins as they occur. And indeed, many are already ongoing from his Swamp Inhabitant cabinet picks to his Tweets attempting to begin a nuclear arms race.

       I hate Trump. My reasons for hating him are obviously different from hating HER. But I hate him, none-the-less. But I pick my battles. And jumping on bandwagons is not where I choose to invest energy. I would much rather dig deep and find the less obvious infractions. Fortunately/unfortunately, Trumps shortcomings are on the forefront of MSM so it doesn't make much sense for me to add to those discussions.

       Yes, what you're posting is bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the first is you telling people to leave and calling them "cucks", a term that has been pretty much adopted by Trump supporters as an insult. The second, again, is a passive aggressive response on your part. In addition, you don't even address how the Donald forum did the exact same thing. The third, again, is you supporting Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your use of the word cuck, attack on those from the politics forum and belief that Trump is a catalyst for change is quite telling. As for my lol, that was all your response deserved, laughter. Anything else or me doing a break by break like I normally do is a waste of time. Again,
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       have an agenda, so me going in depth and attempting to explain it is futile. Only thing I'm doing now is suggesting people look at your history after reading your post. Once they see that, they'll see what your agenda is.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for me, if I throw someone into a group it's because they took the steps to earn it. No one here, and let me type this again and bold it so you really get it,
       <strong>
        no one here has ever backed me into a corner, had me flip flopping like a fish out of water, forced me to make vague statements, etc.
       </strong>
       No one here,
       <strong>
        you least of all
       </strong>
       , has the ability to do that.

       You should work for CNN. Your ability to read what I said and make it your own is almost impressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       No group of people own claim to any word. Speech is free. I can call people cucks and make no implication about my affiliation. Cuck is short for cuckold. To cuckold refers to the idea of being allowed to be made inferior. By allowing your opinions to be swayed so easily by those around you, you allow yourself to be cuckolded. But fuck, I guess even Chaucer was a Trumptard, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Catalyst means change. The same way atomic catalyst can cause a huge explosion, I make no implication as to whether or not the catalyst will be good or bad. I guess I would argue that Clinton would have been a catalyst as well, although far less noticeable. As someone whose agenda is real social change, strengthening of the middle class, and de-privatization of media and pharmaceuticals, I think we must hit bottom before we can go up. Would I prefer that we come together and grow without needing war or depression? OF COURSE. But that opportunity was not given. Trump is that bottom. Clinton would have had us floating in the middle for another 4-8 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       My aggression is not passive. Reddit is a shit storm. Collusion and censorship is rampant and I feel no remorse in calling out how prevalent it is in the r/politics sub. It exists all over this website.
      </p>
      <p>
       My agenda changes everyday I learn something new. I can't wrap my brain around how someone can judge what my agenda is off of 4-5 posts. Reddit is not my main source of information, thank god. You could even take all of my internet history and still not understand a fraction of my perspective because I am a living man and my being cannot be held to a few posts on the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can throw whoever you want into whatever group you want. That's your prerogative. But you miss a bigger picture and it seems as though you end up fueling a system of communication that serves no one, yourself included.

       "If you don't like it, go away." Yeah no thanks. I'd rather voice my opinion in, what I like to think, is still a pseudo-open forum. The purpose of this is not to be a cry-baby, but to raise awareness to my fellow truth-seekers that although this community seems to have changed with the rise of T_D, the migration of PG, and the over-taking of Politics, there are still those in this community that value critical thinking and understanding.

       If you don't see how hive-mind on the internet is like a sort of social censorship, I'd ask that you reevaluate.
Fuck PC. That's why Voat has a strong presence right now. I'm sick of being told what I can and can't say.

       it is still pseudo open? probably because you pc crybaby types haven't succeeded in banning everything you dislike yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       i have an idea: make threads you want to see dont complain about threads you dont like. oh wait that contradicts your pc censorship authoritarian bent, which is all about controlling other people raher than personally creating anything of value

       Honestly. Do you know what PC means? I legitimately  feel like you're having a different conversation than I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not responsible for the ban of anyone so, again, not sure what you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am making a thread I want to talk about. What I want to talk about is the covert ways of censoring online communities under the facade of an open forum. That's a very important and totally valid conversation to be having here and now. So take your ass backwards complaint somewhere else. You're adding nothing to this conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you want to tell me how I'm wrong. Not just attack my character. Those are different things.

       What's funny is it has just Crept into how I write texts, emails, posts. Anyone who knows me sees it Frequently. I always liked how HST used it to Emphasize things. 😁
