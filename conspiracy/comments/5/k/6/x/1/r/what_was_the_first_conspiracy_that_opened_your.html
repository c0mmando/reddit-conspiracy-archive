<p>The entire country didn&#39;t even complain about the daylight murder of  American children by  a military tank on US soil  because the government had them frothing at the mouth for something to be done about the Davidians.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tobacco Companies.</p>

<p>1915 or so: Duke lobbies Congress to have nicotine removed from a book-- the US Pharmacopoeia just before the FDA is formed to prevent them from regulating tobacco.</p>

<p>1926 or so: Tobacco Companies know smoking is causing lung cancer</p>

<p>1958 or so: They see the writing on the wall coming with the Surgeon General, so they collude to form the Tobacco Institute to study tobacco and its health effects and find safer ways for smokers to enjoy their products-- nudge, nudge, wink, wink. For the next 40 years, the Tobacco Institute funds research that muddies the water on health effects, sends &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to testify in trials, and generally does everything to obfuscate, delay and deny what tobacco is doing to people. </p>

<p>Meanwhile tobacco companies are manipulating the amount of nicotine in tobacco, promoting filters even though they already know the smokers suck harder through them, causing incurable cancer further in the lungs, they set up marketing programs in stores that make it easier for kids to steal their products, because they know the average smoker starts at 14 and the earlier you start, the harder it will be for you to quit.</p>

<p>They invent all kinds of bullshit diversions like &quot;Sick Building Syndrome&quot; in the 70&#39;s promoted by The Council for Indoor Air Research, which is just a front for them.</p>

<p>They launch Operation Whitecoat to infiltrate the World Health Organization. Try to divert attention from the effects of secondhand smoke by getting their preferred Surgeon General appointed.</p>

<p>Sweep knowledge of secondhand smoke triggering latent heart conditions in bystanders under the rug along with knowledge that in twin studies, the addiction rate of parents is a more significant factor in childhood smoking than parental monitoring or parental role modeling.</p>

<p>It goes on and on and on and on. I was horrified. I had smoked socially before discovering all this in their own internal documents, but after learning this, I never smoked or bummed a smoke again. I didn&#39;t want one dime of my money to go to these sick bastards.</p>

<p>They wrote the Oil Company, Climate Denial and extreme Republican play book. They are, and continue to be, masters of the long game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The filters actually caused more problems. Smokers drew harder on cigarettes with filters, which got smoke further into their lungs-- causing a whole other kind of lung cancer that was harder to treat.</p>

<p>Roach is the way to go if you&#39;re going to smoke. Coughing is your lungs&#39;s way of protecting you. Filters only fool them into letting down their defenses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I do see that you need to draw harder to get the smoke out, perhaps the filter cools the smoke more which may seem you&#39;re not getting as much smoke into your lungs, when could be the opposite.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t smoke tobacco much nowadays on it&#39;s own, only when I need to pad out other plant products so indeed I only use roach. I wasnt attacking you or anything in previous posts, i actually found your input interesting </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, didn&#39;t think you were attacking. Sorry about the redundant reply. Thought I was responding to a newer post. Another Fun Filter Fact: Tobacco companies designed filters to fool the machines that test for nicotine and tar content. There are little pinholes in the sides of the filters that get covered when people smoke. But when the testing machine &quot;smokes&quot; the holes don&#39;t get covered, so more pure air is drawn in along with the smoke.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve probably detected I know way too much and feel way too strongly about tobacco companies. I&#39;ll stop. Have a lovely New Year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the Titanic had an identical sister ship called the Olympic that was launched one year prior to Titanic&#39;s maiden voyage. In that time, the Olympic collided twice with other ships. Since everything on the two ships said WHITE STAR LINES, all they had to do was paint over the names on the sterns and switch some life rafts.</p>

<p>Instead of paying for repairs on the Olympic, they sank it as &#39;the titanic&#39; and got insurance money! The brand new Titanic was now &#39;the olympic&#39; without any costly repairs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically the Ravens were up 28-6 in the Super Bowl and the power went out in the Stadium. When play resumes the 49ers scored 31 points, preventing a blowout loss that would have distroyed future ratings. </p>

<p>What&#39;s great is the following year the Seahawks beat the Broncos 43-8 and we&#39;re seeing the ratings tumble now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although the WWW came about in 1994, it wasn&#39;t until the late 1990s that there were really a lot of websites out there. And at that time, the conspiracy theory of the day was Vince Foster. It launched one of the major conspiracy theory websites <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/FOSTER_COVERUP/foster.php">http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/FOSTER_COVERUP/foster.php</a></p>

<p>I suppose if I had been on top of it, I would have started earlier by spending my life in a library. But that&#39;s not how I spent my life - I spent it in front of a computer. So when the WWW came along, I was finally exposed to conspiracy theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disinformation.    Institutions that would massage information to control how people acted.    It was obvious in school.    It was obvious that wherever there was power,   people were massaging information for their advantage,  in secret,  to gain an advantage.    Consumerism was daily proof.   What newspapers printed and didn&#39;t was daily proof.   People were collaborating in secret behind the scenes for advantage,  and the laws were applied selectively,  even rigged by those who could benefit.</p>

<p>But the first big event that did not add up for me personally,  left me with a bad bad feeling was the JFK murder/coup.   I was nine.   It was staged,  just didn&#39;t feel right at all.   Of course it helped that I was a State Department brat in DC at the time.</p>
