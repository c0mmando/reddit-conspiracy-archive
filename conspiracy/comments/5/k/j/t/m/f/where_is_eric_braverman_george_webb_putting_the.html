        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/-q3i_fH4RXk?list=PLzbv9C6WPqUCQpvbtg-i3sloR7WTEUrh0">https://youtu.be/-q3i_fH4RXk?list=PLzbv9C6WPqUCQpvbtg-i3sloR7WTEUrh0</a></p>

<p>Eric Braverman, as many of you know, is the Clinton Foundation CEO that has gone missing. He&#39;s been underground and incommunicado for two months. </p>

<p>This guy, George Webb, has been analyzing the data, news, emails, etc about the Clinton Foundation and how it exists to destabilize countries to provide investment opportunities in various rat lines like arms dealing, drug trafficking, resource extraction, and human (child) trafficking.</p>

<p>Haiti provided a template that was repeated in Libya and attempted in Syria (until the evil Russians intervened).</p>

<p>Basically, it boils down to the idea that the Clintons have created a state within a state in the US that deals exclusively and profits from chaos and the immiseration of large swathes of humanity. He is convinced that Clinton/Petraeus were behind the sarin gas attacks in Syria, which goes to show you how fucking sick these supposed defenders of freedom and democracy truly are (and how powerless Obama really was as President).</p>

<p>Listening to this, it starts to make sense why Trump would keep his own private security force, considering how deeply embedded Clinton loyalists, cronies and criminals are inside the government.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reminded of Clinton&#39;s post C-in-C forum outburst where she screamed that if Trump were to become President, that they would all hang. She knows she is the worst kind of criminal, and we are starting to learn that as well. The amount of ruthlessness and depravity for her to operate and profit from these rat lines makes her one of the worst gangsters to ever exist. </p>

<p>These videos and his replies to youtube comments are definitely worth checking out. Please expand on the points raised in the video I linked (which should give you his playlist).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought it was interesting in batch 19 that HRC has a call with general petraues, CIA Director, on September 11th 2012, right before she speaks with the Libyan National Congress President Mohammed Magariaf. Magariaf was an enemy of Gaddafi and has been linked to at least one coup attempt against the Gaddafi regime. This all took place a couple hours before the Benghazi event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He does seem to have information about covert CIA policies. It actually sounds a lot like the things I read about in Cheri Seymour&#39;s book about Danny Casolaro and the &quot;octopus&quot;, The Secret Circle, with assassinations and dirty dealings of all kinds. He has a very interesting way of tying things together. If you look at the rogue factions of the CIA, they&#39;ve been trafficking in drugs and weapons for decades. Human trafficking would bring in a lot of money, plus the surveillance of it would sure given them the upper hand in the blackmail department. I had read a rumor that Epstein may have been set up with the money for his island by certain people just to obtain blackmail material for them. </p>
