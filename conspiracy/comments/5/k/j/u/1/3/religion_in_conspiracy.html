    <div class="md"><p>Well, my take on this is that we&#39;ve also been lied to about the meaning of religious texts, obscuring the metaphorical meanings by only indulging in the literal storyline.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a theory of consciousness I&#39;ve recently stumbled across, that proposes that back in the day, before self-awareness arose via language and abstract concepts, that we perceived our inner unconscious programming as commanding voices in out minds. The show Westworld is heavily based on that theory of the so-called bicameral mind.</p>

<p>If this theory holds true, and I think it does, it would give godly powers to our own individual and collective unconscious minds, and offers a new viewpoint to understand so-called enlightened beings like Jesus, Hermes or the Buddha for instance. All they&#39;ve done is reach within to find the voice of God within them.</p>

<p>Jesus said that heaven is in all of us. I interpret that as divine imagination, constructive creativity, and compassion. I believe to be in tune with oneself is to be in tune with the divine force, or God or Brahma, or whatever you may call the infinite creative potential of all things.</p>

<p>I think the widespread realization of our own divinity as well as the divinity of all things surrounding us, is what was prophesied by the second coming of Christ. Not an enlightened individual leading the way, but an enlightened, empowered collective.</p>

<p>In the end, most literal rules in the Bible can be seen as food for thought, mostly irrelevant to our times, but the underlying themes of compassion, healing, clarity, courage, sacrifice and faith in oneself should not be overlooked. </p>

<p>Whether or not this anon was actually what he claimed to be is even beside the point for me too, but much of what he brought to the table has stirred new insight and also new optimism in me that was duely needed.</p>

<p>Im sure we&#39;re all just beginning to understand what this God within us is capable of, but I&#39;m excited to see this unfold, within me and within others. It&#39;s certainly a powerful concept. </p>

The big conspiracy is that we live in a world that laughs at the Bible when in reality - we are foolish to do so - and manipulated to think such a lie.

Thank you, I watched this video recently, this guy provides a detailed account of his profoundly real experience connecting with higher consciousness, he was firmly a material reductionist beforehand.. his book went to #1 on the NY bestseller &amp; it was translated into 46 languages... it definitely strikes a cord.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, as well as paranoid schizophrenics, deep meditators, psychonauts and people with specific kinds of head injury. Oh and, many generally healthy children as well.</p>

<p>Hearing voices other than your own conscious inner monolog is indeed still quite prevalent, and many still accept their unquestioned authority upon hearing their commands. Of course, these voices (or inner programs, subconscious conclusions, etc...) need not be benevolent, so if one finds oneself confronted with such a hallucination, discernment and a healthy dose of skepticism is duly advised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps. I agree with Ronald Lindsay&#39;s view on this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“For the objective historian, he will always remain a shadowy figure, with little substantive biographical content. On the one hand, we have many who will take things on faith, accepting some subset of the stories as unquestionably true. On the other hand, there are those who insist that Jesus is an invented figure, a myth or a hoax. I think both of these extremes are almost equally implausible.”</p>

<p>Faulty logic.  Either the omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent being exists or it does not.  </p>

<p>If it does exist, and truly is what it says it is, then you cannot try to apply your human logic to its actions.  You would not understand the complexity of its actions or its perfect logic.  You would not have any clue about the complete nature of reality in this scenario other than what the being has told you.  You would have to take its word that it is correct and that there is more to existence that what it seems in our shitty lives, and that possibly a shitty existence on earth is nothing in the grand scheme that includes an afterlife of eternal bliss.</p>

<p>You cannot use faulty, incomplete human logic to try to determine whether this being exists or does not exist.  That&#39;s why it is a system of faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, those are human words used to define him given in his own book (Christianity, judaism, islam). He used those words to describe himself. Not my fault if he lied about himself. Fuck, even in the Bible he says:</p>

<p>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: <strong>for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God</strong>, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not omnibenevolence.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget that in Hebrew, the original language of the old testament, Elohim is the word used for God. Well, what does that word mean? It&#39;s the <strong>plural</strong> form of God, so Gods. This means Christianity and judaism began as polytheistic religions, which isn&#39;t surprising given that they were developed in a time when polytheism was rampant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Fortunately for us, our logic is faulty.</p>

<p>Believers think we&#39;re tricked and deceived. By whom, exactly? The evil that God created? Why should any man or woman, all born without sin, be subjected to punishment?</p>

<p>I find thousands of years of suffering as clear evidence of God&#39;s carelessness and hatred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it is retarded to ask for proof.  Obviously there is no scientific proof so what&#39;s the point?  You clearly do not understand that everybody already knows there is no widespread proof.  It is called a religious belief or a religious faith for a reason.  Not everybody needs everything in life spoon fed to them by a man in a white lab coat, use your brain and make up your own decision.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Religion is not the sole source of &#39;hope&#39;. Hope is just the yearning of something better.</p></li>
<li><p>Hope can lead to dangerous behavior. Instead of acting in a way that can promote change, many people just &#39;hope and pray&#39; for it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Kids with cancer have hope they can live beyond childhood, as do their parents. How many times has hope cured them? How many times has hope helped civilians bombed by drone strikes? Victims of natural disasters?</p>

<p>Hope can often lead to complacency which is detrimental to change.</p>

<p>4 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted[a] by the devil. 2 After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. 3 The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”</p>

<p>4 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’[b]”</p>

<p>5 Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. 6 “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written:</p>

<p>“‘He will command his angels concerning you,
    and they will lift you up in their hands,
    so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’[c]”
7 Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’[d]”</p>

<p>8 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. 9 “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship me.”</p>

<p>10 Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’[e]”</p>

<p>11 Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.</p>

<p>12 When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee. 13 Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali— 14 to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah:</p>

<p>15 “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,
    the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan,
    Galilee of the Gentiles—
16 the people living in darkness
    have seen a great light;
on those living in the land of the shadow of death
    a light has dawned.”[f]
17 From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”</p>

<hr/>

<p>Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
Praise him, all creatures here below;
Praise him above, ye heav&#39;nly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Your 10 commandments also come from the old testament. Your story of how we got here came from old testament. You can&#39;t disregard the parts that you don&#39;t like. It&#39;s the &quot;immutable&quot; (see: unchanging) word of God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You raise a good point.  It reminds me of Jesus&#39;s own words when rebuking the Pharisees.</p>

<p>15 Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, 2 “Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don’t wash their hands before they eat!”</p>

<p>3 Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? 4 For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’[a] and ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’[b] 5 But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is ‘devoted to God,’ 6 they are not to ‘honor their father or mother’ with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. 7 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:</p>

<p>8 “‘These people honor me with their lips,
    but their hearts are far from me.
9 They worship me in vain;
    their teachings are merely human rules.’[c]”
10 Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand. 11 What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.”</p>

<p>12 Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”</p>

<p>13 He replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. 14 Leave them; they are blind guides.[d] If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</p>

<p>15 Peter said, “Explain the parable to us.”</p>

<p>16 “Are you still so dull?” Jesus asked them. 17 “Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? 18 But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. 19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. 20 These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another way to look at it:</p>

<p>Religion is the ultimate conspiracy theory. Think about it- Christianity for example proposes that not only is the world run/owned by some shadow government, but that you have been veiled from reality <em>itself</em>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s simply one step deeper than even some conspiracy fans are willing to go. </p>

<p>And just for fun, let&#39;s try this line of thinking out:</p>

<p>If an unbeliever comes across a secret group of Jesus worshippers, does that convince him that Jesus is real? And when that same person happens across a secret group of Satan worshippers, will that convince him?</p>

<p>Convince him of what, exactly? That Jesus is real? That Satan is real? That Muhammed was right? What about Hinduism? Or Buddhism? What exactly are you convinced of?</p>

<p>That God exists? If he does, do you find him worthy of worship?</p>

<p>If the answer is 0, you&#39;re not following the bible as you should. Yes, this is all old testament <strong>but</strong> Jesus himself said in Matthew 5:18 &quot;think not that I have come to abolish the old law, for I have come to fulfill the law.&quot;</p>

<p>Your 10 commandments also come from the old testament. Your story of how we got here came from old testament. You can&#39;t disregard the parts that you don&#39;t like. It&#39;s the &quot;immutable&quot; (see: unchanging) word of God.</p>
