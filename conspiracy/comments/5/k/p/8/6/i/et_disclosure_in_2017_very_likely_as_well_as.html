<p>The year 2017 may also be time when the secret space program and ET folk get their long awaited disclosure. The following quote, from a source in the Antarctic base, requires more proof before I will believe it but, nonetheless here it is:
“The cabal are all freaked out by what they found in Antarticia – It gave Buzz a heart attack. Very large “pods” with beings inside. That is why John Kerry was there Election Day. Animals and people frozen in time. 12 – 14 foot humans in the pods who were in stasis, are now awakening”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Chinese secret society with 6 million members, including 1.8 million Asian gangsters and 100,000 professional assassins, have targeted Illuminati members if they proceed with world depopulation plans, according to Tokyo-based journalist Benjamin Fulford, 46.</p>

<p>They contacted Fulford, a Canadian ex pat, after he warned that the Illuminati plan to reduce the Asian population to just 500 million by means of race-specific biological weapons.</p>

<p>&quot;The Illuminati, with the exception of Japan, is very much a white man&#39;s game,&quot; Fulford says.</p>

<p>The secret society confirmed Fulford&#39;s information and asked him for advice. He provided a list of 10,000 people associated with the Illuminati, mainly members of the Bilderberg, CFR and Skull and Bones. Neo Cons are also high priority targets.</p>

<p>&quot;I have been promised that not a single person will die if they negotiate in good faith,&quot; Fulford says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too have a strong feeling disclosure will occur in 2017, a Nordic alien communicated with me telepathically recently to encourage me to keep fighting and I was like between worlds for a while when I meditated a shitload I have no doubt they exist, from Cobra&#39;s blog (2012portal):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many groups are working behind the scenes to ensure complete success of Full Disclosure. Dragon sources have communicated that „they and other groups are working on bringing about disclosure officially in the first quarter of 2017.“ When asked an opinion about this date, the Resistance has said „we can not comment on this“, the Pleiaidans have said „it is possible“ and the Sirians have said „it will most likely take longer than that“. Therefore, be aware that this time frame is NOT my estimate when the Breakthrough occurs, but an educated guess from one of the groups I am working with. Although generally the protocol of the Resistance is not to publish any dates and time estimates in this blog, they have made an exception this time for reasons they can not yet disclose to the public. </p>
