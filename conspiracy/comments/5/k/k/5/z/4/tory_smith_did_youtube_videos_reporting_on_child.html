    <div class="md"><p>Holy fucking shit, people.  Just did a quick youtube on &quot;Tory Smith&quot;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s him in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUerL_fo3rM">May 21st.</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh4sno9WgsU">three fucking months later.</a></p>

<p>In the first video, he has a somewhat effeminate manner of speaking - which leads me to believe that he might be gay.  Maybe he is, maybe he isn&#39;t.  Again, I&#39;m just guessing.  If he was gay, then the idea can&#39;t be <em>entirely</em> be discarded that he might have had AIDS and simply died from that.  However, I personally am leaning toward something seriously nefarious having happened to him based upon what he was investigating.</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing this to people&#39;s attention, OP.  Upvote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>First</strong> of all, I&#39;ve never &quot;operated by [or stated] first assuming every gay male dies of HIV/AIDS.</p>

<p>This accusation is so asinine, <em>I even looked through the thread on your behalf to find anyone making such a claim</em>. Thinking you confused me with another poster, whom I did not find. Nobody has made that claim. The first and only time that statement has come up was from <em>you</em>, just now...</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, &quot;Now run those numbers...&quot;, - Are you asking me to make your point for you? Not only will I not make your point for you, I don&#39;t even think you can make that point for yourself. It can certainly be argued that AIDS is becoming less prevalent. The original point stands, gay men are infected with HIV / AIDS much more often than straight men.</p>

<p>As for the rationale you don&#39;t understand - unprotected ass sex increases the chances of transmission of the HIV virus. Gay men typically have a lot more unprotected ass sex than straight men do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how you&#39;ve hastily inserted large words in your argument to make it anything more than a brash generalization. The OP <strong>very clearly states, if you can&#39;t quite clearly read,</strong> that the man was gay and because of that he can&#39;t rule out that he died from HIV/AIDS. Wut.</p>

<p>Just because a gay man dies, the rush generalization should not be of the virus. The population numbers of infections and deaths HAVE gone down but yes, risky male behavior is a large perpetrator for the virus&#39; continuity. There are still droves of healthy gay men. No matter the sexuality, men engage in riskier behavior. Its not insipid.</p>

<p>Something like 60-75% of the new infections come from young, poor, LGBT members. By the logic that if a gay man dies, it no matter what could have been HIV/Aids should mean that if you&#39;re a gay man, you might also be poor, black and have HIV/AIDS? </p>

<p>Your logic is bullshit but you keep arguing a very dumb point, lol. Occam&#39;s razor.</p>

<p>You are misrepresenting my argument and making weak attempts to paint me with logical fallacies that I am not guilty of.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is strongly linked to HIV/AIDS (relative to heterosexuality). This is because HIV/AIDS is much easier to transmit through unprotected anal sex than oral, or vaginal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to chime in on his effeminate nature, perhaps this arose due to his own experiences of rape. I can only imagine that is one of the most emasculating experiences to have. My heart goes out to him, and those who have been through that experience.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that saying &quot;O_o - Holy fucking shit&quot; is simply very apropos in this situation.  It really does take one aback when one sees just how drastically this man changed in such a short period of time.</p>

<p>He got hit with some <em>seriously</em> virulent shit, and got hit with it <em>hard</em>.  The question, of course, is how it happened, where it came from.

<p>Certainly a possibility - but it&#39;s also <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cancer+gun&amp;amp;oq=cancer+gun&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1719j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">been shown that there exists a &quot;cancer gun&quot; that can give you that shit from a distance covertly</a>, so even w/rapid stage 4 cancer there&#39;s still the possibility that it could have been given to him by someone that wanted him to STFU.</p>

<p>I watched this happen to my ex Navy Aunt, who went from being a physically fit, fully functional adult to a sloth like skeleton of grey skin with no control of body functions and died within 60 days.  There was no warning or symptoms prior to a spontaneous doctor visit for stomach discomfort 2 months before she died.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ.  Sorry to hear that.  Seriously.  Do you know what might have caused it?</p>

<p>We are not sure what caused it. She was working as an ER nurse for the last 2 decades, seems odd that it would go completely unnoticed by friends or coworkers. The family was dealing with an incident where my brothers&#39; freelance journals were seized by undercover agents and he was taken into federal custody and interrogated about his religious and political beliefs. My Aunt claimed that my brother was a government patsy the same week that she was diagnosed, coincidentally. A man in Sweden or something wrote that my brother was, too. I think that man worked with wikileaks before leaving the U.S.- I can&#39;t remember his name now.... it was 3 words.. David something something..? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=OAyo5S-7Xyc">His friend said max stole his Vicodin </a> </p>

<p>If you watch this speech him and his gf gave at a conference, he slurs his words BAD and both of them talk nonsense. You can tell Max and his gf are irritated with each other, like their relationship isn&#39;t healthy. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=qNOArHqNi8A">Max and his girlfriend Sarah Adams fked up giving a speech at a Conference </a> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video of his gf Sarah Adams&#39;s high as a kite prob in her clothes from the night before talking nonsense to a neighbor. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=gEZH0afvH9o">Sarah Adams </a> </p>

<p>Also, I read Max&#39;s mom heard the gfs voice in the background when Max called his mom before he died. So, that girl knows more then she&#39;s telling. </p>

<p>The autopsy still hasn&#39;t come back...</p>

<p>Troy, I researched too a couple months back. Everyday he made a YouTube video announcing how many kids have been murdered </p>

<p>I.e Mike pence 157 kids 
Senator John 145 kids 
Obama 142 kids </p>

<p>Then the next day..
Mike Pence 161 kids 
Senator John 149 kids 
Etc etc </p>

<p>I found it weird he knew the EXACT number of kids that died everyday. I came to the conclusion of Drugs or AIDS?? </p>

Could his opiate use have masked other symptoms that would have brought someone else to the doctor? Is that substance a long term, slow acting poison? Could it have been an overdose? Opiate users often go &quot;chasing the dragon&quot;...</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more likely the girlfriend is the one who poisoned him, for several reasons. I&#39;ll do a bit more research and see what I can find but if anyone here wants to shed some light on it, please do.</p>

I could be mistaken, but didn&#39;t Jack Ruby die of cancer very shortly after killing Oswald?</p>
