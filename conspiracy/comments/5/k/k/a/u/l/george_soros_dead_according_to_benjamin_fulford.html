    <div class="md"><p>Fulford puts out some interesting info; some of his narrative has been spot-on for this past year while other things have been beyond questionable. Regardless, it&#39;s interesting.</p>

<p>When he dropped the news about Soros two weeks ago, he also indicated his sources had told him Nathaniel Rothchild had been taken out, too. He&#39;s also indicated both Hillary and the Queen are under house arrest and that&#39;s why neither has been seen much (and the Queen cancelled some appearances). </p>

<p>As of yesterday, the info about Rothchild was incorrect and he&#39;s gone into hiding from his family. </p>

<p>Bottom line is his stuff can be an interesting read, and it needs taken with a few pounds of salt while looked at from the biggest picture possible. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to this week&#39;s full column if you&#39;re curious. <a href="http://operationdisclosure.blogspot.co.nz/2016/12/benjamin-fulford-report-trumps-chain.html">Read more Fulford here</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I heard that the Queen tried to expose the &#39;dark side&#39; for her Christmas message but BBC cut her off and told the royal family to get her under control. Then she agreed to do a normal Christmas message and has been under house arrest since. I&#39;m not sure if I believe it though, knowing that the Queen is evil herself</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise given their penchant for inbreeding as to not mix their bloodlines with ours. Add in that it&#39;s been happening for hundreds of years and it&#39;s pretty much a given there&#39;s a lot of cross-contamination going on within their very tiny gene pool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. After a quick search I found that this has been a thing for a while. I&#39;m always amazed as an avid amateur conspiracy buff that there is so much going on that I am unaware of. Not to say that I think I know it all, or even a lot. The rabbit hole here seems to involve &#39;40s sperm collection, coupled with &#39;50s invitrofert, which I didn&#39;t have time to look into. I always assume the gov/elites are years, if not decades ahead of us (do you really think darpa is showing us their best robot?) so who knows. Like I said before, big if true... the question is will we ever know, or will we know &quot;in time&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We always know what we need to when we need it. </p>

<p>My research started a while ago, like pre-internet while ago, and I&#39;m of the belief it&#39;s impossible for any of us to know all of it when it comes to the levels of depravity and deception that&#39;s been done and is still taking place. </p>

<p>The upside is none of us knows exactly the same things yet we all know a lot more than the populace that still sleeps. When shit hits the fan, and I believe it will, it&#39;ll be easy to fill in the blanks for each other given the vast scope of existing knowledge and we&#39;ll all be able to be of service helping those struggling to cope with their shattered realities. </p>

<p>In the interim, focus on the things that interest you while keeping in mind rabbit holes are never one-way tunnels; there are tunnels that veer off in all sorts of random directions and each of those has even more side tunnels. It has the potential to become an extensive overview or a vast amount of knowledge on 1-2 topics; it&#39;s entirely up to each person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears that way (it&#39;s been taking place for at least a few years). </p>

<p>Given everything that goes on that we&#39;re unaware of until after the fact with those running the show, it&#39;s within the realm of possibilities there are other battles for control taking place behind the scene. </p>

<p>A few weeks before the election, he&#39;d mentioned something about how Hillary wasn&#39;t going to be allowed to steal the election. It was a finite statement with no other details provided. Not gonna lie, it gave me a bit of hope. Things looked like the election was in the bag for Hill and then it happened. She lost. BF has also said all the people Trump&#39;s selecting are intentionally military and he&#39;s the choice of the people trying to change things. </p>

<p>Again, time will tell. It helps to keep a big pic perspective while keeping emotions out of it and watching it play out globally. At that point, it becomes very similar to a chess game.</p>

<p>One by one the Bush/Clinton/crime syndicate is being removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a big claim. Has anyone else seen this claim, or any proof for this claim? Could that account for Braverman, among others? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately Ben Fulford is a fat fraud. If you read his weekly updates for a few weeks in a row, it should be pretty evident that it&#39;s all made up. He&#39;s such a useless sack of crap that I honestly can&#39;t tell whether he&#39;s just writing lies for the money he gets from it, or if he&#39;s somehow mentally ill and believes his own BS. The shit he writes is so unbelievable that it&#39;s just a mystery to me that he has anyone actually paying money for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Benjamin Fulford is an interesting dude. I used to read his weekly blog for fun, thinking it was all Weekly World News-level madness and chicanery, but this past year has changed my tune. He has been saying the White Dragon Society is pushing hard against the elite and winning for the last few years, and at this point, those actions seem to be coming into the view of ordinary people like us. Trump winning was definitely not part of any Western elite plan, and if Soros was in fact &quot;taken out&quot; then that would be a huge blow to that side of the conflict.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also seen Fulford say some of the most ridiculous shot of all-time, so there&#39;s also that.</p>
