<p>BTW my comment had nothing to do with being pro-obama. I didn&#39;t vote for him. I&#39;m tired of every idiot making it a partisan issue when someone has something critical to say about someone else. </p>

<p>Mitt already made his pretty pennies and, unlike Trump, has been paying taxes on his income.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 1866, the Supreme Court ruled in Ex parte Garland that the pardon power &quot;extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken, or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.&quot; (In that case, a former Confederate senator successfully petitioned the court to uphold a pardon that prevented him from being disbarred.) Generally speaking, once an act has been committed, the president can issue a pardon at any time—regardless of whether charges have even been filed. - </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. There&#39;s no burden on you at all. </p>

<p>There&#39;s some circumstantial evidence that certainly allows for the possibility that she has eaten human before, but arguing about it is pointless because neither of you can prove it and neither of you apparently want to truly make a case for our against. So unless someone cares enough to make a legitimate case one way or the other, it&#39;s a waste of energy. You&#39;re just trading logical fallacies back and forth.  </p>

<p>Because people very intimate to her are involved in occult rituals like &quot;spirit cooking&quot; </p>

<p>She 100% thinks she can channel the dead and speak to them </p>

<p>She is closely linked to multiple child traffickers </p>

<p>She has spent time in a country where people eat people </p>

<p>She has sore(s?), or lesions, or something strange on her tongue, which are uncommon and specific to several diseases, one of which comes from eating humans. </p>

<p>Is there any chance that you&#39;re incapable of seeing how it&#39;s a possibility because of your political beliefs? No matter how likely or unlikely.. the man who says with 100% certainty that it&#39;s not true (or that it is true) is a fool.</p>

<p>You seem upset, I think your emotions are clouding your judgement. I don&#39;t even think she&#39;s a cannibal; I just wanted to point out to you the errors in your thinking. Good luck my friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Her friend and chief of staff Podesta has very creepy art in his office depicting cannibalism. That is clue number one. </p>

<p>One of her staff emailed to her about &quot;sacrificing a chicken to Moloch.&quot;  Moloch is a pagan god of child sacrifice and a &quot;chicken&quot; is a term for very small children in pedophile code. Clue number two. </p>

<p>There are lots of other similar clues, but the one that I think is most compelling is the absolute certainty that the people around Clinton had that she was going to win the election. I think they actually believe in a satanic religion, one where they wear purple robes, do human sacrifices and engage in cannibalism. Here is a video about the practices of such a religion. </p>

<p>The charges of cannibalism come from the satanic practices of the kinds of people who kill and rape children in weird satanic religious ceremonies. We do not KNOW she was involved in this stuff, but we don&#39;t know she was not either and there is way too much incriminating circumstantial evidence to ignore the possibility. </p>

<p>His ties to Russia, his ties to Alex Jones, Alex Jones&#39; ties to Russia - especially Aleksandr Dugin - Wikileaks&#39; ties to the Trump campaign, Assange&#39;s ties to Russia, Trump&#39;s ties to Jeffrey Epstein (pizzagaters do not care about this, for some reason, but care very much about Epstein&#39;s ties to Clinton), his taxes, his choice of Steve Bannon as his chief strategist and what that means for Breitbart, Trump&#39;s mafia ties from early on in his career, Trump University, his alleged rapes (including an underage girl who was later silenced with threats), The Trump Foundation, his cabinet appointments direct ties/involvement to/with wall street...</p>

<p>And if you want to know some of my personal theories...</p>

<p>The Republicans knew they would win due to outside fuckery with our election and that&#39;s why they blocked Merrick Garland for so long - they knew they were going to win and that they didn&#39;t have to approve him and could ignore the public outrage.  That&#39;s also why they have betrayed their own beliefs and support Trump.  He was the unintended nominee and the only way they could keep their entire &quot;coup&quot; under wraps was to support him.  To keep his supporters enthralled, they will continue to &quot;publicly&quot; investigate some of Hillary&#39;s scandals, i.e. Benghazi, even though they aren&#39;t pursuing criminal charges.</p>

<p>This is maintained by a large online mostly-Russian disinformation campaign that hinges on Wikileaks and Americans learning to inherently distrust &quot;conventional media&quot; and to inherently believe &quot;alternative media.&quot;  This is why, all of a sudden, orgs like Breitbart, InfoWars, YourNewsWire, ZeroHedge, USWorldPolitics (I think that was one), etc., are being shared as if they have the same journalistic integrity as other long-established orgs.  </p>

<p>This is all laid out well in Aleksandr Dugin&#39;s works, &quot;The Fourth Political Theory&quot; and &quot;Foundations of Geopolitics&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The book emphasizes that Russia must spread Anti-Americanism everywhere: &quot;the main &#39;scapegoat&#39; will be precisely the U.S.&quot;</p>

<p>In the United States:</p>

<p>Russia should use its special forces within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke &quot;Afro-American racists&quot;. Russia should &quot;introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.&quot;[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Americans don&#39;t know who to trust anymore and the &quot;fake news&quot; shpiel is backfiring, as it is now being used as a thought-terminating cliche to actually believe whatever it is you&#39;re reading.  &quot;Media calls it fake news? Must be TRUE&quot; is the new thought-terminating meme.</p>

<p>I believe that Republican leadership realized America was becoming more numerous in liberals as time went on and their time was coming to an end unless they took drastic measures, going back to 9/11.</p>

<p>My belief is that the US is going to enter into a new arms race and start a new war, lose very badly, and completely crumble from the inside, that this is all being orchestrated by international right-wing groups with Russia as a hub, and that the American right is in on it, too.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Edited for spelling/grammar as I read through this all again.</p>

<p>But a genuine thank you. That&#39;s a good post. I&#39;ll be very interested to see what evidence presents itself in many of those instances. </p>

<p>I hope even after taking sides and choosing a candidate, no matter which, people are able to go back to some type of normalcy. The fact is, it&#39;s <strong>us</strong> who are on the same side after all. I think that&#39;s a big part of why the media has been tasked to work so hard to create an irl flame war. If we realized our true power we would win every day of the week. So it&#39;s best to keep people misdirected, misinformed, confused, angry, frustrated, upset, ignorant, and acting stupid.. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bipartisan effort to keep the veil on us, and it definitely has worked and is working.  </p>

<p>This is very important to remember; people on both sides of the aisle are vilifying each other as a true threat to our country.  You&#39;d think that the ultimate goal of political parties was to literally kill off and get rid of opponent parties.  That&#39;s why I hate words like &quot;libtards&quot; and &quot;leftists&quot; and how much they get thrown around here and on T_D.  </p>

<p>Absolutely.  It&#39;s like the allegory of the cave, but in this scenario, the people in charge of the fires and shadows have branched off to start new fires and cast new shadows that seem to be part of the same, original shadows. </p>

<p>On the Russian election hacking: where is the evidence of this? As far as I know there&#39;s &#39;a source in the CIA&#39; that has claimed this. There is more evidence of voter fraud happening on the dem side. If I&#39;m off base here, hit me with some facts. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The FBI and CIA are in agreement, it&#39;s up to you if you want to believe them or not.</p>

<p>The circumstantial evidence since then has also added up as Trump stacks his cabinet with extremely wealthy individuals, some of whom will fairly directly benefit from better relations with Russia.  </p>

<p>And then there&#39;s Mitch McConnell, his wife&#39;s appointment to the Trump administration, and his swift mention and subsequent quash of a Senate investigation into Russian involvement.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Russia psyops and voter fraud are not comparable and are two completely separate issues.  That said, you are absolutely wrong about dem voter fraud.  100%.  Nevermind that Russia wants to undermine the American election system - including seeding doubt about our electoral process - there is simply no evidence of voter fraud.</p>

<p>You asked me for facts, but provided none of your own for me to refute.  So, what kind of voter fraud are you talking about exactly, and where did you get that belief?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who we are going to war with or what the nature of that war is going to be like.  </p>

<p>They are in agreement that Russia influenced our election, not that they magically and nefariously &quot;hacked our election.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the type of doubt that they are trying to sow.  Don&#39;t trust the CIA or FBI, but definitely trust Trump and Breitbart because they eschew intelligence from the CIA and FBI.</p>

<p>And, yes, I believe they are in agreement publicly because other 3rd party organizations have also confirmed Russian involvement and the FBI could no longer deny it to help Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way to get information is from within.  I don&#39;t think Russia &quot;hacked&quot; us electronically, I think they have clearly hacked us physically (i.e., spies, nothing new here) and work to convince individuals within the government (usually low-mid level employees with access to sensitive information, whether intentional or not) to steal information.  This is in contrast to folks like Manning and Snowden, who acted under their own accord.  It&#39;s almost like how ISIS recruits/inspires lone wolf jihadis.  </p>

<p>Also, one other random thing, I see people here talking about Seth Rich and Eric Braverman a lot, and how they think the Clintons murdered them.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m right and they were &quot;convinced&quot; to give up information by a Russian infiltrator, then there&#39;s a high chance that they were killed by THEM and not the Clintons.  Isn&#39;t that like Spies 101?  Tie up loose ends?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe this 100%. I saw something a while back with Michio Kaku. At the time I didn&#39;t think too much of it.  I largely agreed with this Russian host&#39;s criticisms of democracies. I thought Michio getting flustered was pretty funny, because of the cognitive dissonance displayed by a world renown physicist.  It wasn&#39;t the fact that he was flustered that intrigued me, it was the fact that he couldn&#39;t see past his own point of view to engage very valid criticisms and exploits about democracies and in this specific instance, constitutional republics. I saw him use the same tactics that I see other individuals use when they are confronted with valid criticism of their belief systems. Instead of readily admitting to its flaws and conceding that there has to be a better way. I saw an individual dig his heels in, then reluctantly concede to criticisms and then resort to the tried and true &quot;but its better than xyz&quot;.  This is reminiscent of the tactics used against Americans when criticizomg American foreign policy. Or Americans criticizing censorship and first amendment violations.</p>

<p>Ever since I first watched that clip, I occasionally revisit it in the light of current events.  I still largely agree with what the Russian host was saying. I still agree with her overarching point. At first I thought she was trying to prove her point that democracies are flawed in nature because people by and large can be made to believe whatever. Whatever the prevailing belief is tends to be reinforced through affirmation from the surrounding entities. However, the more that I think about it maybe she was eluding to something else entirely.  It seems as if the main weakness in democracy is known, and is fairly easily exploited.</p>

<p>&quot;Psychic ability, wisdom, divination, remove curses, healing, psychic work, business success, to influence people in power. </p>

<p>It can be used to apply incited others to tyranny, abuse of power, idealism and influence people who have power over you. Great for inviting sadness and resentment in others.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read through literally every Pizzagate thing, but that&#39;s because the ones I have had presented to me (back when <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> existed) were so thin and so suspiciously dovetailed with other narratives in the conspiracy community. This one was definitely a joke, he says he&#39;s crossing his fingers in the same breath and no one thinks he&#39;s being literal about it or believes it would actually work. People just saw &quot;Moloch&quot; and freaked out because they&#39;ve read stuff about Bohemian Grove. It&#39;s patent BS from people who desperately want to think the worst of Hillary Clinton.</p>
