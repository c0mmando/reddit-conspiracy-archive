<p>I&#39;ve been following Pizza Gate since the very beginning, and doing my own research, well at least I&#39;ve been trying (I suck at it). Since the Pizza Gate thread has moved to Voat I&#39;ve been unable to keep up with the updates so I don&#39;t know how deep the rabbit hole has gotten. Pizza Gate is way, way bigger than just Hillary, Podesta and Comet Ping Pong; the CIA supply the children to these sick people. Majority of the time they&#39;re foreign. Syrian, Brazilian, Portuguese, ect. </p>

<p>I&#39;m rambling a bit, this is just a heads up to keep your eyes open, and to think of the big picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all traces back to ARK, which ties in with Tavistock. On a greater scale, it ties in with a booming trafficking industry.</p>

<p>On the microscale, Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong are part of a much larger money laundering operation that involved selling crappy satanic art for record amounts of money.</p>

<p>So, Pizzagate is a lot of everywhere in between.</p>

<p>What the investigation has learned is that slavery is alive and well and Saudis are selling white girls from their twitter accounts.</p>

<p>We have new uses for slaves, though, and that is &quot;applied social engineering&quot; where you use a slave in conjunction with the media to create narratives that are used in &quot;mass persuasion.&quot;</p>

<p>They began a variety of experiments in the marketing attempts to sell war bonds during WWII.</p>

<p>Children are abused and tortured to create dissociative states that can be triggered with drugs like scopolamine and other &#39;hypnotics.&#39;</p>

<p>By using people on the ground, the media and controlled narratives, Pizzagate is the revelation that the masses are &quot;persuaded&quot; to the point that most aspects of their culture and political views are &quot;socially engineered&quot; in ways that defy common intuition.</p>

<p>&quot;It is easier to fool people than to convince them that they&#39;ve been fooled.&quot; - Mark Twain</p>

<p>That is why so many people are anti-Pizzagate, because they have been mass persuaded into that belief, even though the truth that our government officials are participating in a massive cover up that ties into governments across the world.</p>

<p>Sure, there are pedophiles. But, there are also forced labor slaves for the mines, domestic slaves that the Saudis are allowed to enslave even in the US, because Hillary established precedence that they have diplomatic immunity, along with their family members.</p>

<p>There are also the slaves that end up in the grasps of &quot;unethical human experimentation&quot; being run by a variety of government intelligence agencies and private intelligence agencies. </p>

<p>Big picture = more slavery happens now than before we won the &quot;War on Slavery,&quot; where everyone&#39;s perception of reality that has been suggested to them is that slavery has ended. It has not.</p>

<p>When everyone realizes this, they will rise up because that is always the final straw if any revolution. Being enslaved. Aldous Huxley&#39;s idea to prevent that was to create &quot;happy slaves.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a post similar to this on the old r/pizzagate. When I was going through the social media accounts of people who were under suspicion, I noticed three reoccurring themes. First were the overtly sexual themes (obviously). Second was a lot of occult imagery. Last, was the repeated pictures of aliens and alien abductions.</p>

<p>Ever since going down this rabbit hole, I&#39;m becoming more and more suspicious that some MILABs are indeed used for abducting children and other things related to pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing. I had a really intense dream last month.</p>

<p>I dreamt that I snuck into what I feel was a MILAB, and I snuck into this room, it was very long and not too wide. It was filled with hospital type beds. There was a door there, it was white just like the entire room, and it looked like a space shuttle door. Behind that door was another door of the same type, but there was a creature inside of it and it had writing on the door. Above the window of the door was written &quot;The Beast&quot; and below the window of the door was a lot of writing that I don&#39;t remember all of, all I remember it saying was &quot;Satan&quot; and &quot;Say Amen&quot;. </p>

<p>They were also keeping children there who had extraordinary gifts, kind of like in Stranger Things where Eleven could move stuff with her mind and they were keeping her to run experiments. I managed to take pics of the lab, the creature and some of the children, and then I was caught and taken into an office. The man in charge was a young Indian man, maybe in his mid 20s. He had an assistant who didn&#39;t look human, he was like robotic or mind controlled or something, void of emotions or thinking for itself. The Indian man told me to hand over the pictures and he&#39;ll let me out alive, I refused and then the Indian man turned into like a vampire, but not really a vampire. His skin turned pale and his eyes turned all weird. I managed to escape somehow and then I woke up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for sharing your dream. I too had a dream that really shook me and I&#39;ve wanted to share it with this community, but wasn&#39;t sure where to do it. This seems as good a place as any.</p>

<p>How do I say this? I&#39;m the type of person that looks away at the surgery scenes during Gray&#39;s Anatomy - I&#39;m also the type of person that enjoys Gray&#39;s Stupid Fucking Anatomy.</p>

<p>This year, I had a dream so heinous, I have no idea how it could have entered my psychi because in waking life there is no way I would have encountered the evil that I <em>partook in</em> in the dream. I don&#39;t want to go into detail because they&#39;re unspeakable, IMO, but elements of this dream have becoming recurring: a child sized doll animated by maliciousness (I can&#39;t quite explain the vacantness of the eyes, yet the inhabitance of a living persona), and mass sighting of a UFO - always the same UFO. </p>

<p>Honestly, people, I&#39;m sharing just to vent because I hate comments like this. If ever there are comments that I dismiss, they&#39;re ones like this. But this is my lived experienced... in a dream. Now that I&#39;ve been exposed to the evils eluded to in Pizzagate, I am actually beginning to really wonder if an unconscious psychological manipulation/warfare is happening...?</p>

<p>Tl;dr: crazy evil dream makes me wonder if psychological &amp; dream manipulation isn&#39;t completely impossible</p>

<p>Edit: I too encountered The Beast in my dream - that&#39;s why I&#39;m replying to your dream - and I&#39;m an atheist!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing!! I feel a little less crazy now. I think unconscious warfare is possible; it&#39;s the only way I can explain some dreams I&#39;ve had. I&#39;ve had numerous intense dreams over the years, like Obama turning into an alien an chasing me down trying to kill me. I&#39;ve had dreams of people trying to kill me a lot. I&#39;ve also seen a UFO while awake, twice this year. </p>

<p>but instead I&#39;m just going to sum everything up for you for the next hour&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is called making a case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I did read that which is why I responded. <strong>Usually people who say that are retards with an exaggerated sense of self-worth</strong>.</p>

<p>So what you&#39;re saying is that you can never tell someone to &quot;look this up&quot; you gotta give them a 20,000 word dissertation instead <strong>that reads like it was wrote by a lunatic</strong>? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is where I rest my case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already did several times. Not every time you bring up something is it necessary/required/contextually &quot;right&quot; to go on a 20,000 word rant. The context of the guys comment is that it&#39;s a random comment on a conspiracy thread on a social media site. The context is that he says &quot;Hey these things are related, look into them&quot; and you are upset that he didn&#39;t post a 20,000 word rant instead. In the context of the guy&#39;s comment, it was more &quot;appropriate&quot; for him to write what he did than to write a 20,000 word rant. Maybe he could&#39;ve added a little bit more info like the names he refused to say, but what he said was &#39;enough.&#39;  Once again, it&#39;s a random comment on a conspiracy thread on a social media site.  Don&#39;t take it so seriously.</p>

<p>&quot;Stranger Things&quot; 2016/17 TV series.</p>

<p>Second season coming out 2017..........along with Prometheus sequel..........and Twin Peaks update......buckle up for 2017.</p>

<p>Stranger Things is so blatantly connected to/depictive of MKUlt./PG/mil.indust. complex linked human experiments it&#39;s not funny I&#39;m surprised people haven&#39;t made the connect in this thread.</p>

<p>I agree people should watch Adam Curtis&#39;s &quot;HyperNormalization&quot; too.</p>
