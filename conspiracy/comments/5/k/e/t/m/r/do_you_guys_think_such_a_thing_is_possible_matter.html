<p>I&#39;m sure a lot of you Trekkies will know what I speak of. A replicator able to make anything by re-arranging sub-atomic particles (which makes sense in theory) </p>

<p>Could such a thing be in humanity&#39;s near future?</p>

<p>Could you guys imagine the implications? Humans wouldn&#39;t need to work for the most part to produce goods and food anymore as it could just be created at will.</p>

<p>Raw resources would be saved as would the earth.</p>

<p>Could you guys imagine such a thing? Because I sure can and it seems logical. Let me hear your opinions </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts exactly! Such a machine technically seems possible and I&#39;m wondering if such technology already exists.</p>

<p>The only problem needed to be tackled with such a device is energy use which could theoretically be eliminated with the introduction of free energy technology which I&#39;m sure exists as well.</p>

<p>Only other problem is weapon creator which should be denied through the device so no one can produce negative creation with the device.</p>

<p>Otherwise such a thing seems feasible and would likely completely change  humanity and its pathway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nuclear power would be the go to choice if a free energy technology would not be possible.</p>

<p>Nuclear energy seems like the best bet if everything else is accounted for it is one of the cleanest energies besides solar.</p>

<p>Such energy would be a good choice.</p>

<p>But we would also need to consider the fact that a lot of energy would be freed by society if matter creation machines were rolled out as societies industries could theoretically shut down and use that leftover energy for the machines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, I cannot answer with a strictly yes or no answer but I can answer like this:</p>

<p>I am thoroughly convinced there are black budget labs in the world where the military says to a bunch of bi-polar/schitzo/psycopathic people with a love for fucked up shit &quot;You think it, we fund it&quot;.</p>

<p>If you can think of an idea I am pretty sure there are companies on earth capable of producing it.</p>

<p>Edit: I also think it tends to be a case of the developers being like &quot;FUCK YEAH!&quot;, &quot;KEWL&quot;, &quot;GOOD JOB GUYS&quot;, &quot;OH SHIT WHAT THE FUCK HAVE WE DONE!&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I apologise if this reads like an attack. I&#39;m of the view that true things are robust enough to handle it, while untrue tend to crumble. </p>

<p>If you are creating the energy from nothing it is a FAR FAR bigger issue than you give it credit for. It would take a significant chunk of ALL the electrical energy available on earth to run just one machine.</p>

<p>If you are manipulating matter, you still have the problem of positioning the atoms without the whole lot exploding or other interesting chemical reactions occurring. The number of atoms in most materials mean that just mapping where you would want atoms in a small object is far beyond all of the computers on earth combined. That is before you&#39;ve even stated working out how to bring them all together and dump the excess energy safely.</p>

<p>Finally, if free energy (ie requires no resources or over unity devices) tech exists it will be well into the extremes of physics. At the very least it will be beyond what evolution can reach. If it was a simple mechanical, or electrical effect, life would have found it at some point. The first life to do this would dominate now. Most of evolution has been getting better at capturing, stealing or protecting or using energy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been trained in science (though not working in it). The laws of physics, as we know them, do not allow for energy imbalances. Such an imbalance would be a major discovery and extremely hard to both hide, and stop being discovered elsewhere. The only claims I have seen tend to fall apart when you loom at them too closely.</p>

<p>There are a few cool energy systems that give cheap energy and might work, including cold fusion etc, but none of those will have the power requirements still.</p>

<p>End result, we have no computers capable of handing the job, no capability to do the job, and no energy supply to run the thing. None of those look fixable in the near future. Other than that, interesting idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are a few glimpses of the problems I imagined would exist with trying to create such a device.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m sure these could be proven or studied id hope they could be overcome for the sake of helping to preserve the earth and its future chance of life with such a devise existing.</p>

<p>I will be the first to admit that such a device sounds very very positive and could be a catalyst for humanities next step in evolution that I and many others would love to see.</p>

<p>It&#39;s time humans take the next step up in the leader of evolution and consciousness and I think we have the technology to do so now. </p>

<p>Consider a nuclear bomb and the energy released.  They say something like 1% of matter is converted to energy.  That means to create the same nuke material (a few kg), you need to input the  energy released by those  same 100 nukes</p>
