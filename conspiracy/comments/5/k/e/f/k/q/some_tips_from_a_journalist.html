        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been working as an investigative journalist near St. Louis for about six years. I&#39;m easy to identify through my reddit history, so I won&#39;t go too off the rails. I&#39;m also a mod at r/aliens for some reason, so the paranormal and conspiracy theories are my bread and butter.</p>

<p>That being said, when I go after something, I suspend my cognitive bias the best I can. I neither believe nor disbelieve. I simply ask questions. This is a tactic I believe many of you incredible researchers should utilize. </p>

<p>For example, I never questioned 9/11 until I read the official report. I watched Loose Change and Zeitgeist and pointed out they each were persuasive arguments. I wanted something neutral. Within that report, I noticed the authors openly write a Saudi passport was found in the wreckage of the towers, but not the black box. I do not pretend to know what happened on 9/11, but that&#39;s a good place to start asking questions.</p>

<p>I still do not believe or disbelieve Pizzagate. Those alleging what you are alleging have very interesting circumstancial evidence, however, I would like to see someone come at it from a position of neutrality. I would hope someone with a rational demeanor could approach the owners of these places with a list of valid questions and ask them with a little respect. That&#39;s what I do to either attain a good explanation of truth or make them comfortable enough to tell me provable lies. </p>

<p>Again, I am completely neutral on a great many things, but I am very concerned with objective truth. I peruse this sub because many of you genuinely research your opinions. Whether I care or agree with you or not doesn&#39;t matter, I respect your critical thinking. </p>

<p>Now, you all lose me with Christian God, flat earth, mountains are tree skeletons, etc. But, I usually chalk this up to some sort of controlled opposition based on origin and promotion of those ideals. </p>

<p>To me, the most important thing out there is Assange. Find him, ask him the right questions, and then match his answers with evidence and earlier interviews. Assange trumps Pizzagate. Pizzagate could be a goose chase, but something is definitely up with Assange.</p>

<p>Finally, stop with the weird backwoods Missouri racism you seem to have. Fringe nutjobs elected Donald Trump and almost Hillary Clinton. That&#39;s insane. What&#39;s more insane to me is the anti-gay, anti-trans, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and anti-Jew rhetoric of the far right and the anti-white, anti-male, and anti-Christian rhetoric of the left. We&#39;re all the same pile of shit with nuggets of gold in each of us.</p>

<p>P.S. Your stance on climate change needs to be updated. Yes the monetization of carbon use is scary, but we do need to shift to renewable energy asap.</p>

<p>Thanks! Keep on looking into everything. The hunt for truth can be messy. Be brave, be humble, be informed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some valid points.</p>

<p>Want to know something in regards to Pizzagate?</p>

<p>If whistleblower laws were drafted to protect people who got honey potted (see: bankers, corporate managers, yada yada) in relation to this whole shit fest, you would see the flood gates open, with a bunch of degenerates who took too much of a liking to drugs and prostitutes to stop and think to themselves &quot;hang on a minute, these hookers aren&#39;t 21 anymore, I&#39;m lucky if they&#39;re 16&quot;.</p>

<p>As it stands though you won&#39;t see much in regards to PizzaGate as it&#39;s the biggest blackmail ring in the world that has unfortunately entrapped some of the highest ranking people in the world, a lot of who have the ability to sign off on certain weapons, vaccines, technology etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a giant fucking blackmail ring that lures people in under the guise of friendship and &quot;brotherhood&quot;.</p>

<p>Edit: By whistleblower law, I don&#39;t mean pardon these people, I mean take everything on a &quot;common sense&quot; basis, let&#39;s not jump the gun and go &quot;REEEE PEDO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS&quot; or &quot;REEEEE YADA YADA YADA&quot;. Do it whilst stepping back and putting yourself into their shoes; supposed friends having their pants down and holding them in a non monetary based slavery system until their dying day. </p>

<p>You stop and think why that Jimmy Saville got away with it for so long, he probably had dirt on everyone, a lot of who probably want to put an end to the whole thing, but can&#39;t due to the fear of backlash.</p>

<p>That said I remember it clear as day. Corporate banker gets to know a rich client etc etc, gets invited for a few drinks... Few drinks turn into a couple of lines and some spirits instead of beer. Fast forward a few months and they had video and pictures of the guy diddlin&#39; kids, then extorted a multi million dollar loan from him.</p>

<p>Yeah,  the CO2 debate is a sidetrack,  and &quot;global effects&quot; likewise,  as the data is too complicated and easy to debate.   Reminds me of physicists playing around with building 7,   lost in nuances that the average guy is not going to follow.    While its obvious at so many levels that there is foul play.</p>

<p>What is NOT debatable is that &quot;shift to renewable energy asap&quot; should be supported by all,  immediately,  and largely because there are devastating effects to millions of people at numerous locations from continuing the present policy,  there are pollution hellholes.   The CO2 debate seems ideally suited to pushing off the appropriate responses.   So sad.    Goldman Sachs and other traders and a bunch of policy wonks win on one side,  and the entrenched energy elites win on the other,  while the planet is losing big time,  and conspiracy fiddles around siding with the energy oligarchs.   Its pathetic.</p>

<p>Its an amazingly fortunate coincidence that renewable energy has recently been the fastest and lowest cost component of the energy sector.</p>

<p>All emissions that cause a rise in temperature in the atmosphere must be reduced, like RIGHT FUCKING NOW. You can pollute the shit out of earth all you want (like we have done for who knows how many civilizations), thing is though I think it&#39;s aroudn 7 degree celsius increase and that sets in motion a domino effect that will eventually result in a calderra fucking our shit up.</p>

<p>That is not a &quot;Ohhh -insert country here- had a volcano, cool&quot;, that is a &quot;Ohhhh -insert country here- has ceased to exist because a 5 square mile hole just opened and is now firing magma and shit everywhere&quot;.</p>

<p>You look back at the Egyptians, Mayans, Incas, Aztecs, Romans, Saxons, Vikings, blah fucking blah.. We have stories of how they lived, evidence of their architectural prowess etc, but have you ever had an accurate account of how they cease to exist? No, because it&#39;s always the same and we never learn and people try and write scholarly articles of how it happened....</p>

<p>It happened the same as it will happen this time - We reach technological advances beyond our imagination, we pollute the shit out of the earth, the earth gives us some warnings and we ignore them, and then bam, calderra, enjoy 1 month of ash blocking out the sun then 6 month of mini ice age then massive amounts of disease due to corpse accumulation in the areas of survivors.</p>

<p>Rant off but it&#39;s common sense and we are just a retarded species who will never learn.</p>

<p>If the earth decided to &quot;fart&quot; a bit of gas out it is what it is, chances are it will solve the problem itself.</p>

<p>The REAL problem is the artificial earthly pollution caused by humans.</p>

<p>The answer isn&#39;t to CULL everyone with some funky weapon or some shit, it&#39;s to educate people. We must take Sweden as an example, they are importing waste because they have the system running perfectly.</p>

<p>Instead of panicking we should just run a copy cat system worldwide of sweden and make recycling the biggest commitment of the human species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this.  This sub needs some professionals in the mix to help tone down some of the crazy rhetoric around here.  I as well would love for people to be able to look at PG from a neutral stance - too many around here are actively pursuing the &quot;DAE everybody is a pedo?!&quot; argument, when really they should be trying to find real, hard evidence.  Circumstantial &#39;evidence&#39;, if you can even call what&#39;s been put out on PG as evidence, is not much to go off of.  I&#39;m not saying kill the PG &#39;investigation&#39;, but seriously folks.  <strong>Lose the god damn bias.</strong>  We pride ourselves on supposed critical thinking but all I see are mass circle jerks, concern trolls, and <em>extreme</em> group-think on some subjects.</p>

<p>Also the divide that&#39;s cropped up since the elections is insane.  I&#39;ve never seen so many insults, so much name-calling and disrespect in this sub.  Let&#39;s try and love and respect each other a little more around here, right?  <em>Right?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is just the current bandwagon that the mass hysteria has attached to. Pedophilia has been going on since before the Greeks were inventing Democracy. Most Pizzagaters throw out any Pedo story as proof of a conspiracy when it is no such thing whatsoever. Rich people spend money on guilty pleasures. No conspiracy.  The only interesting aspects to the Pizza stories are when political influence is being manipulated via Pedophilia. Guys like Epstein and his exploits. <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/10/09/the-sex-slave-scandal-that-exposed-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epstein/">https://nypost.com/2016/10/09/the-sex-slave-scandal-that-exposed-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epstein/</a>  He&#39;s involved in conspiracies to manipulate power via Pedophilia. Sadly disinfo gets pumped into Pizzagate like everything else that is dangerous. A billion stories get thrown on the wall and the masses are confused, letting the big fish operate still. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only pure thing is the steady forward march of time. There is no going back.  This is what we have developed over the lifetime of our species.   Hacks like Daniel Quinn offer pseudo-religious drivel and absolutist thinking in the guise of some great archaic revival paradigm shift.  This sort of thinking is deeply regressive. It sells a lot of books though.  It sets up a false reality where civilization and mankind are somehow not a natural product and expression of nature.  The tired old trope that we naughty apes have thrown off the sacred balance of the idyllic natural wonderland.   It&#39;s essentially the same old &quot;Nobel savage&quot; shit repackaged.  Anti-civ is the religion of cowards, a leafy blanket of some idealized Avatar-Esque utopia.  It&#39;s a nice pacifier for those who are smart enough to SEE the problems of the civilizations that have come before and moronic enough to think that those problems are insurmountable.  </p>

<p>Civilization is all we have.  It&#39;s our OS.  Fix the bugs, don&#39;t shut it off. If it crashes, we pick up the pieces and try again.   You seem like a smart guy.  Keep digging.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The investigation should start with the missing children statistics in that area as well as FOIAs for any info on the police investigations into those missing kids and any reports on Comet Ping Pong (which, I did see that post where a FOIA proved they lied about investigations. That was interesting). Also, someone should call that dude and say, &quot;hey, I want to clear your name to all these assholes on reddit claiming you diddle kids in a basement you may or may not have. The only way to shut them up is by answering some questions about your weird ass personal life.&quot; I bet that will go better than you&#39;d think. If it doesn&#39;t, step two is trying to connect with employees and patrons. </p>

<p>I guess, honestly, the only thing I see on here are people dismissing all evidence to the contrary. I mean, let&#39;s hear the other side of this. Let&#39;s hear defenses besides some stupid ass NPR interview full of soft questions. I want to know what these people genuinely think about the investigation. </p>

<p>Also, that guy with the gun story was suspicious AF. That story and the following fake news hoopla made me think there may be something to this Pizzagate. </p>

<p>Then again, I used to run a 3,500 member Facebook group dedicated to pizza called &quot;Pizza Pals,&quot; so I feel pretty awkward about pizza being code for child sex. I really really love pizza and I think sex with children is deplorable. I motion we change this whole pizza thing to better reflect how great of a food pizza is and how awful pedophilia is. </p>
