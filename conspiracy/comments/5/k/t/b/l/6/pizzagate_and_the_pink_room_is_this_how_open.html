        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">54</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-28 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/zenmasterzen3.html">zenmasterzen3</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some background on The Pink Room case:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the Mornington Peninsula child-care-centre case broke, an investigative journalist infiltrated an elite child-pornography and pedophile club based in Melbourne. Its members were all wealthy and elite members of Melbourne society. It was chaired by the CEO of a major Melbourne Charitable Trust. </p>

<p>The children from the Mornington Peninsula child-care-centre reported being taken to a &quot;pink&quot; room with a spa and other significant decor. It was in a house where the children were sexually abused, tortured and filmed (amongst other locations). Three children independently identified the house that they had been taken to, to the investigators. Sure enough, the room had been painted a dusty-pink color, and it had a spa and the other decor items described by the children. However, as you now know, no further action was taken against the owner of the child-care-centre, nor others suspected of being involved in the ring. What is most significant however, is that the pink house WAS REGISTERED TO THE VICTORIA POLICE!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s hard finding info on this case, as the sickos have made art exhibits, stores all with the name &quot;pink room&quot; since then to cover their tracks, much like the Discovery Channel documentary &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot; on child abuse was scrapped and the sickos followed it with a documentary on marital domestic violence called &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyway, the pedos got busted partly because of the distinctive room. The elite have houses and show off their money and taste with distinctive decor. So here&#39;s the plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask under FOIA for photos of all rooms used in the pedo films, snuff films etc. which FBI has.</li>
<li>Publish these photos</li>
<li>Ask everyone if they have seen similar rooms (such as cleaning staff who may have cleaned the room)</li>
<li>Do background check on the person who owns the house</li>
<li>Inform authorities + media.</li>
</ol>

<p>What do you think of this idea?</p>

<p>If you think this is a good idea and are brave, repost on voat plz as I don&#39;t have an account.</p>

<p>FBI also had a listing of pictures they needed help IDing in relation to trafficking... reddit went nuclear on that post... dissected every little detail to help out the FBI. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he he he </p>

<p>Just one last change if that is possible: move the &quot;zenmasterzen3 of reddit asked this get posted here since he cant post on voat&quot; down the bottom. Thing is, most people have a short attention span. If you haven&#39;t got their interest by the first sentence, they&#39;ll hit the back button. Moving that comment down the bottom would help the idea a lot.</p>

<p>Also, if you break the plan down to look like this somehow, that&#39;d be super: </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Ask under FOIA for photos of all rooms used in the pedo films, snuff films etc. which FBI has.</li>
<li>Publish these photos</li>
<li>Ask everyone if they have seen similar rooms (such as cleaning staff who may have cleaned the room)</li>
<li>Do background check on the person who owns the house</li>
<li>Inform authorities + media.</li>
</ol>

<p>it should be fun to see what folks add to the conversation you started</p>

<p>ok dude we got deleted because of this.......</p>

<p>I need to remove this submission per rules 1 and 2. In order to resubmit, please briefly explain the connection between these findings and the Pizzagate investigation, and provide sources for each claim contained in this post. If that is not possible given you&#39;re just proxying someone&#39;s submission from Reddit, then /v/pizzagatewhatever is the appropriate sub for this post, and please resubmit there. Thank you.</p>

<p>do you feel like adding let me know otherwise i will post it at the other pizzagatewhatever like suggested </p>

<p>The connection between the Pink Room and Pizzagate is that the investigative technique used to bust the Mornington Peninsula pedophile ring can be reused for Pizzagate.

<p>if you find darkweb wikis, they even list these sites for you to go to. avoid at all costs as they are most likely honey pots </p>

<p>i was physically ill when just below websites for finding drugs, there are sites listed dedicated to &quot;hard candy&quot;</p>

<p>if you want to do the good fight, there is a group on the darkweb dedicated to tracking down the IPS of known pedos and posting them.  outting these fuckers in our own communities is a good place to start!</p>
