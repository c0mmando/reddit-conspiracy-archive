       Some background on The Pink Room case:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When the Mornington Peninsula child-care-centre case broke, an investigative journalist infiltrated an elite child-pornography and pedophile club based in Melbourne. Its members were all wealthy and elite members of Melbourne society. It was chaired by the CEO of a major Melbourne Charitable Trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        The children from the Mornington Peninsula child-care-centre reported being taken to a "pink" room with a spa and other significant decor. It was in a house where the children were sexually abused, tortured and filmed (amongst other locations). Three children independently identified the house that they had been taken to, to the investigators. Sure enough, the room had been painted a dusty-pink color, and it had a spa and the other decor items described by the children. However, as you now know, no further action was taken against the owner of the child-care-centre, nor others suspected of being involved in the ring. What is most significant however, is that the pink house WAS REGISTERED TO THE VICTORIA POLICE!!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's hard finding info on this case, as the sickos have made art exhibits, stores all with the name "pink room" since then to cover their tracks, much like the Discovery Channel documentary "Conspiracy of Silence" on child abuse was scrapped and the sickos followed it with a documentary on marital domestic violence called "Conspiracy of Silence".
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the pedos got busted partly because of the distinctive room. The elite have houses and show off their money and taste with distinctive decor. So here's the plan:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Ask under FOIA for photos of all rooms used in the pedo films, snuff films etc. which FBI has.
       </li>
       <li>
        Publish these photos
       </li>
       <li>
        Ask everyone if they have seen similar rooms (such as cleaning staff who may have cleaned the room)
       </li>
       <li>
        Do background check on the person who owns the house
       </li>
       <li>
        Inform authorities + media.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       What do you think of this idea?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think this is a good idea and are brave, repost on voat plz as I don't have an account.

       FBI also had a listing of pictures they needed help IDing in relation to trafficking... reddit went nuclear on that post... dissected every little detail to help out the FBI.

       Thanks :) I hope we start making progress. I have been bitching about this issue for years (and I know others have been raising attention for it for decades, some getting killed for it) and it is great to see the attitude of the majority changing from "you're crazy" to "fuck what can we do?" :)

       Hi chickyrogue is it possible you could break up the paragraph so there is some spacing? I think it's a bit hard to read. We want to make sure to give this idea the best chance so if you could go to the trouble to edit it and format it better that'd be super! :)

       Just one last change if that is possible: move the "zenmasterzen3 of reddit asked this get posted here since he cant post on voat" down the bottom. Thing is, most people have a short attention span. If you haven't got their interest by the first sentence, they'll hit the back button. Moving that comment down the bottom would help the idea a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you break the plan down to look like this somehow, that'd be super:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        <li>
         Ask under FOIA for photos of all rooms used in the pedo films, snuff films etc. which FBI has.

       The connection between the Pink Room and Pizzagate is that the investigative technique used to bust the Mornington Peninsula pedophile ring can be reused for Pizzagate. Here's a source for the FBI using room photos to identify sex traffickers so the FBI should support us with this endeavor:

       Here's a question, if someone went on the darkweb, downloaded these sick videos, took screen caps of the rooms (with victim edited out for privacy) and posted the screen shot, would they have broken the law?

       i love where your heart is OP.  do not do this. . .
      </p>
      <p>
       if you find darkweb wikis, they even list these sites for you to go to. avoid at all costs as they are most likely honey pots
      </p>
      <p>
       i was physically ill when just below websites for finding drugs, there are sites listed dedicated to "hard candy"
      </p>
      <p>
       if you want to do the good fight, there is a group on the darkweb dedicated to tracking down the IPS of known pedos and posting them.  outting these fuckers in our own communities is a good place to start!

       Most targets are selected at random and wind up homeless. If you experience any strange stuff read "the matrix deciphered" for more info.
