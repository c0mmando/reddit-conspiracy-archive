        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Well that sure didn&#39;t take long. Amidst the UN talks, and the anti-muslism rhetoric the JIDF has slipped in and taken a hold of The_Donald and are now equating pro-trump with pro-zionism. I&#39;m happy to see a lot of people still speaking out against Zionism in the sub, but there are talks of mods removing posts that are critical of Israel, and now we&#39;re seeing sticky posts on that sub with pro-Zionism hints.</p>

<p>Remember: just because you&#39;re pro-trump doesn&#39;t mean you have to toe the line with Zionism, and hate arabs. I hope this isn&#39;t a sign of a negative 4 years at our feet. I&#39;ve been pretty open minded about trump so far, but this has made my ears perk up and smell something fishy. </p>

<p>Before CTR there was JIDF and it seems they&#39;ve got a new target: Donald Trump supporters.</p>

<p>edit:
Here&#39;s your source:
<a href="https://m.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5kuf3u/t_d_stands_with_israel/">https://m.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5kuf3u/t_d_stands_with_israel/</a></p>

<p>Also note: This is a sub that actively trashed the CEO for targeting dissenting opinions. While i agree The_Donald can ban someone for having a differing opinion about America and Trump, but this is being thrown in with anti-Zionism rhetoric too which is not the same thing. A lot of awake vets equate their being in Iraq and Afghanistan with greater Israel, and these heros support America, not Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is absolutely a Zionist.</p>

<p>Surely you already knew this? His kids are Jewish hardcore Zionists who are a very big part of Trump&#39;s administration. They will have an outsized say in everything involving Israel.</p>

<p>Trump, earlier today, told Israel he would overturn the US refusal to veto the UN condemnation of Israeli settlements on Palestinian lands.</p>

<p>Trump also is considering defunding the United Nations simply because this vote occurred in the first place.</p>

<p>In fact, Trump has also planned to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a de facto recognition that Israel&#39;s rightful capital is Jerusalem. This is scary business for so many reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a beautiful dream. But it ignores the history of thousands of years and forgets that Arab oil became a vital world commodity during that last 100 years. Which gave Muslims the leverage they had previously lacked. To balance things, the US and Allies, following WWII, created a Jewish Nation in the middle of it all. And gave them nuclear weapons and large amounts of money in addition to security guarantees.</p>

<p>I am not opposed to anything involved on any side, really. What I am opposed to is the inherent conflicts that arose from all those different factors.</p>

<p>All those facets make this an incredibly difficult issue to solve. Throw in DAESH and Taliban and Al Qaeda, and Y&#39;All Qaeda (in the USA with the rise of Trump) and it all looks more complex than ever.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the narrative they would like us to believe. That things have been too messed up for too long, and no solution is possible. But I don&#39;t believe that to be the truth, for a few reasons; </p>

<p>Many Arabs and Jews today are friends, both around the world and in the Middle East. Many Arabs and Jews get married. Rallies occur where Arabs and Jews hold hands while marching, preaching that they refuse to be enemies. Here in Canada, we have Jewish Voices for Peace, a group lead by Jews in support of Palestine and peace. There are similar Palestinian groups who fight for that cause. There are groups of Rabbis and Jews around the world who fight for peace alongside Palestinians and Muslims. There are even some brave Jews in Israel who support peace for Palestine, and these people are treated terribly by most of the Jewish community. Arabs who support peace are usually not treated with such harshness from their own as Jews are. I&#39;ve seen a video of a Jewish boy in Israel, a young teenager, wearing a Palestinian flag on his yarmulke, and police officers aggressively yelled at him and grabbed/detained him for doing so. Support for peace is out there from both sides, it&#39;s strong, but the media deliberately doesn&#39;t show it. They want the masses to believe there is no solution in sight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the campaign trail in 2016, the New York billionaire—like most Republican candidates—frequently promised to tear up the Iran deal and move the U.S. Embassy to divided Jerusalem (in previous years, Democrats have made similar promises). In March, speaking at the annual convention of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the powerful pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC, Trump accused the United Nations of trying to “impose” an agreement on Israel and Palestinians.</p>

<p>What does that even mean? You are on reddit. You aren&#39;t &quot;here&quot;. You need to stop looking for somewhere to be, and just be yourself. You don&#39;t need a group identity, you need a self identity. When you have a self identity you are more likely to see past the herd&#39;s bullshit and more easily discern truth from lies.</p>

<p>I wrote in Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012. I have heard rumblings about him getting into the Fed, but that just seems like someone is toying with me. The reality is that are headed downhill and there doesn&#39;t seem to be slowing down. We&#39;ll see, but I don&#39;t have a lot of faith in Trump, especially given the way he has stocked his cabinet with billionaires, GS bankers, and Zionists. Bad news, man.</p>

I&#39;m going to respond to comments in a civil and objective manner and make sure the truth is at least heard by some, until they ban me. There are moderates there, not just zionists and neocons and those moderates will see what is going on. Us leaving is what they want, I will only do it when banned and I suggest you do the same. Even if they ban anyone who objects to settlements and massive foreign aid and points out how Israel is not a good ally and has been constantly manipulating America into fighting its wars if we can sew the seeds before we are canned that could help bring people around. Mention the USS Liberty, foreknowledge of terror attacks (9/11 and 7/7) and the fact that they have stolen secrets from America and sold them to China and that they have never backed America in a war, the average American will see whats going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in the same boat as you my friend. I think a lot of people on there right now are Israeli shills but the vast majority are actually legit. Are you noticing that the upvotes for Israel is always extremely high. No one is going to attack a pro-Israel post.</p>

<p>The time I spend on the_donald has decreased to like 2 minutes a day. Does it seem to you like all these people are now fooled into thinking that if Trump is in favor of something it MUST be good. People voted for what he stands for and not the man himself.</p>

<p>Trump can appoint Papa fucking John as Secretary of state and there would be MAGA threads bragging that the liberal media is complaining about Papa John because &quot;we are just winning too much&quot;. &quot;Papa John knows how to get deals DONE..he will work great with other countries.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even just the Zionism thing that pisses me off. It&#39;s the fact that there is no criticism of the guy allowed whatsoever. These are just my opinions on the matter though. </p>

<p>&quot;and that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got to say about the war in Vie-ut -naam&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you guys, there&#39;s a weird amount of support for Israel. But remember, most of them are not privy to the notion that 9/11 was an inside job, quite possibly with MOSSAD involvement.

<p>The problem with this sub, however, is it&#39;s heavily infiltrated by actual anti-semites. Yes, i know hacids have extremely racial theories. Yes, there is probably a jewish mafia. But they are by no means at the top of the pyramid. They&#39;re one of the gangs competing for power. The vast majority of jews are as innocent as followers of catholicism are for the actions of their church.</p>

<p>Having said all that, the concern is that Obama is acting absolutely recklessly, it seems like he&#39;s willing to start a war just to make a wee bit of history in the middle east for his ailing legacy. It gets us nowhere to try and force a sovereign state&#39;s hand. Especially one with nukes.</p>

<p>That, combined with the fact that Clinton on the other hand had ties to almost <strong>all</strong> of those groups, is why you see <strong>more</strong> anti-Clinton threads on a <strong>conspiracy</strong> forum.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly you&#39;re living in a fantasy world just because you hate Trump for personal reasons and obviously shilling for your party. Saying &quot;No no but he&#39;s rich!&quot; doesn&#39;t = ties to &quot;illumanti&quot;. Period. Factually. It does not. Every president to come before has ties to those groups as do most prominent politicians. You don&#39;t get to just yell &quot;Wah wah but he&#39;s rich&quot; and classify someone as &quot;illuminati&quot;. If that&#39;s what you think, go make an occupy poster and stand on wall street with the rest of rejects and bums (who are actually being funded by the people they think they&#39;re protesting). Or a BLM poster or whatever Soros groups are calling themselves these days. You&#39;re just another person jealous and resentful of those who have it better to me.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re seriously going to say that the establishment power base did not make a concerted effort against Trump then you&#39;re not even trying to have an honest discussion, which means I have no more interest in carrying this on any further.</p>

<p>And no I could care less about his foreign business interests, they&#39;re just alarmist, bigoted bullshit by the left. An empty attempt to discredit someone for something that&#39;s totally not illegal or immoral in any way. </p>

<p>And I could especially care less considering he&#39;s the first candidate to run on a platform of putting America first in my lifetime (which is what makes it kind of laughable when dems try to make this fantasy, without evidence, of him being beholden to foreign powers, after 8 years of UN Obama)</p>

<p>BTW since we&#39;re talking about that, your beloved Hillary took 25 million from Saudi Arabia and podesta received an email which read &quot;Foreign govt donations, the money is IN&quot; (Which literally <strong>is</strong> illegal and basically treasonous BTW).</p>

<p>Let me guess, you&#39;re obsessed by every little thing Hillary has done of the last three decades, but apparently you don&#39;t care at all about Trump&#39;s foreign business interests. This is just bizarre to me, dude.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What do you think this means? What does it mean to you? I hate that having a political opinion = shilling.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He was endorsed by the Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, and the RNC - the epitome of the Republican establishment. His Transportation Secretary is the wife of the Republican Leader, and a former Bush appointee. His Chief of Staff is the former chair of the RNC. HIs AG is a long-standing Republican Senator - part of the swamp, like the others. He is surrounding himself by the establishment. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to break it to you, but Trump actively solicited donations from foreign governments. From the President of Mexico, and from lawmakers in Scotland, England, Iceland, Australia, and more. That&#39;s illegal, but he way. Yet Trump gave between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation. </p>

<p>By the way, the two largest donors to the Trump Campaign were the McMahon&#39;s. Linda McMahon was just appointed to his Cabinet. Pay to Play, anyone? </p>

<p>I&#39;m also curious about what Trump uses his Foundation for. I know it spent $20,000 to by a 6 foot tall portrait of himself and his small hands. And another portrait of himself for $10,000. And a Tebow autograph for $12,000. And he used Foundation funds to settle lawsu8ts. </p>

<p>Why is it tax free, again? </p>

<p>*Edit. Ooh, I found more. </p>

<p>Trump accepted donations for a registered lobbyists for Saudi Arabia. From an agent for a leader of the Congo. From members of a firm that represent the embassy of Korea, embassy of Bangladesh, and the Center of Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Wow what a giant wall of lies, half-truths and misinformation.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sorry to break it to you, but Trump actively solicited donations from foreign governments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL this is how I see shit like this and know that you and those on your &quot;side&quot; who spew this nonsense are pieces of shit. <strong>Those are chain emails that his campaign sent out to anyone they could.</strong> Some of them found their way out of the country the way same way any chain email does. You&#39;re seriously trying to suggest he solicited donations from Vincente Fox from that? A man who publicly and actively spoke against him at every opportunity and whom he had a public &quot;feud&quot; with?</p>

<p><strong>FUCK you people are MENDACIOUS!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way, the two largest donors to the Trump Campaign were the McMahon&#39;s. Linda McMahon was just appointed to his Cabinet. Pay to Play, anyone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the problem is that this factually is not pay to play. You factually cannot tie Linda McMahon being appointed to his cabinet to donations made my Vince McMahon, who is a long time friend and business partner of Trump. Your assertion that she was appointed because of financial contribution rather than her longstanding association with the man and being someone that he was familiar with and could trust is absolutely baseless and unfounded. You should feel shame at leveling such an accusation but sadly I know that shame is one emotion people like you do not feel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump accepted donations for a registered lobbyists for Saudi Arabia. From an agent for a leader of the Congo. From members of a firm that represent the embassy of Korea, embassy of Bangladesh, and the Center of Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And anyone can make a donation? Any citizen of the US can donate to a presidential campaign. Not illegal. What your talking about is factually not the same thing that your rotten, corrupt, illuminati demigogue Hillary did. Period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m also curious about what Trump uses his Foundation for. I know it spent $20,000 to by a 6 foot tall portrait of himself and his small hands. And another portrait of himself for $10,000. And a Tebow autograph for $12,000. And he used Foundation funds to settle lawsu8ts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without even bothering to check on the majority of those cases you mention, because I already know what a lying, mendacious piece of shit you are, I&#39;ll just say that off the top of my head I know that your reference to Trump using his foundation money to &quot;settle a lawsuit&quot; is bullshit. He fought a legal battle with the foundation money for the right to fly the American Flag. People like you and the BS left wing media keep trying to spin it as he did something dishonest. Not that it&#39;s important, but I&#39;m willing to bet if I took the time to look into the other charges (which I won&#39;t, because you&#39;ve proven yourself so blatantly dishonest) I would find the other side of the story to dispute those too!</p>

<p><strong>You are a lying piece of human shit!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Oh and saying over and over again that Paul Ryan endorsed him means something is really embarrassing to your own argument as everyone who actually followed his campaign (and didn&#39;t get their info from left-wing media) knows all of the drama and BS that surrounded that. Not that it would matter anyhow as obviously the speaker is going to endorse the Republican Nominee once he&#39;s the nominee or risk political suicide (Even though he almost didn&#39;t and to this day gets booed by Republicans at rallies for how he handled things).</p>

<p>No. The establishment was not on his side. That was readily apparent. You&#39;re living in a world of <strong>fucking make-believe</strong>.</p>

<p>Buddy honestly you are either really evil or really stupid to believe MSM / left-wing lies without cross checking the facts for yourself on something other than &quot;snopes&quot; or &quot;politifact&quot;, which are nothing more than fictional vehicles for left-wing propaganda.</p>

<p>it&#39;s just so obvious when people are actively trying to prevent assimilating any new information that may impact their predispositions and already constructed world view.   There is great honor in having the humility to say &#39;you know, I hadn&#39;t considered that&#39; or something along those lines...you know, allowing for &#39;growth&#39; haha.</p>

<p>Good on ya for taking the time; even if you didn&#39;t make progress with the person you were talking to, at least you are impacting the lurkers&#39; and other readers&#39; perceptions.  Perspective, so important</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, I know some people have trouble reading so I will break it down:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We have no idea what Trump&#39;s foreign business interests are</p></li>
<li><p>He was endorsed by the Republican establishment, and is appointing that establishment to his Cabinet - with priority, apparently, to his big donors. </p></li>
<li><p>Trump illegally solicited donations from foreign government officials. He also received donations from lobbyists for foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia, Congo, Bangladesh, and more. </p></li>
<li><p>His tax-free foundation spent $20,000 on a 6 foot tall portrait of himself. As a percentage of total foundation expenditures, that&#39;s more than the Clinton Foundation spend on humanitarian causes. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Is that any easier to read? Or should I write it in crayon? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which i mentioned. I also linked the deleted comments which really dont seem like they shouldn&#39;t of been removed. The thing here to note is vote manipulation that is generally held by the moderators target specific posts they want high up on the front page. So while all the comments question the post; the post still has a lot of upvotes. If you don&#39;t think the_donald uses voter manipulation, think again. They used to use it to battle the admins specific rules, but are now using it to push their agenda: the neocon return to greater Israel project.</p>

<p>INB4 &quot;Jews Suck&quot; yeah, I&#39;m antisemitic, ok? I dated two of them, from prominent families, in my youth, before I knew what was up in the world, and I saw their horrendous tribalism and bigotry first hand (I was a victim of it).

    <div class="md"><p>Have Muslims gripped the world with a mythical extermination event like the Holocaust<sup>TM,</sup> unlike the Zionist Jews? Have Muslims been the direct cause of any wars that have occurred over the last few decades (I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re redpilled about 9/11 and 7/7, Brussels, Paris attacks etc.)? Who fucked Syria leading up to the refugee crisis? Who fucked Iraq and Afghanistan to oblivion and led to spillover effects into neighboring countries like Pakistan, which has been ravaged and infiltrated on high government positions by Taliban&#39;s remnants? </p>

<p>I admit, Muslims have plenty of problems (that&#39;s evident from the Pakistani Muslim immigrants causing serious problems in the UK since the past few decades, for example). But how about actually letting the common Muslim flourish in a democracy independent of puppet strings attached by the US-Israeli hegemonic alliance? Proxy wars and the corporatism agenda in the Middle East have shattered any chance of independent growth, and I promise you the world would be a very different place and Muslims would have a better impression had there been little such interference.</p>

<p>Source: educated Pakistani Muslim here. You&#39;ll probably think that my faith lends a bias against the HoloHoax, but that&#39;s not the case at all. I was once a vehement believer of the Holocaust and sympathized with the Jews, but research into proper revisionist work of historians has changed my mind. Sorry, but those who bandwagon behind this mythical event are just as guilty as those leading the narrative.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not a single gas chamber has been proven to have the capacity to do so. All existing gas chambers were constructed post-war, claimed to be exact replicas, yet they have flimsy wooden doors or chimneys. Tell me, what the fuck kind of gas chamber has these insecure controls?</p>

<p>The reality: Slave-labor camps used gas chambers to delouse its occupant workers. No evidence uncovered yet which indicates foul-play</p>

<p>Nazis made shrunken heads, lampshades and soaps from the remains of Jews</p>

<p>Each of these lies has been thoroughly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_made_from_human_corpses">debunked.</a></p>

<p>If you&#39;re too lazy to go through all those links, I&#39;ll summarize for you: they have all been debunked as liars who conned the world, and some even had the audacity to make millions out of that lie. Please note that I have not mentioned dozens of other accounts which have been completely debunked as piles of fabricated horseshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nazi testimonies, especially from Rudolph Hoss cannot be debunked.</p>

<p>No they can&#39;t, but if you wanna take his word for it, why not also believe him when <a href="https://rudolfhoess.wordpress.com/">he claims to have been tortured</a> during <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v07/v07p389_faurisson.html">interrogations</a>? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not just his testimony - Germans also confessed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre">Katyn massacre</a>. Today we know the Soviets did it. They admitted they were responsible after the USSR broke up; Germans admitted to steaming Jews to death. Today we know that <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_holocaust13.htm">never happened</a>. <strong>The &#39;confessions&#39; mean nothing when torture was used to get them.</strong></p>

<p>Following reports that defendants were tortured at the Malmedy massacre trial, the US Army formed the “Simpson Commission” to investigate the alleged misconduct. Judge Edward L. Van Roden was part of this commission. According to <a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/Auschwitz/Dachau/VanRoden1948.html">Van Roden’s book, American Atrocities in Germany</a>, out of 139 cases of treatment of alleged German “war criminals” who were investigated by the commission—and who were subsequently put on trial by the American Military Tribunal in Dachau after World War II—”137 of these Germans were tortured by having their testicles crushed.”</p>

<p>Other methods used by the American interrogators included brutal beatings, placing a hood over prisoners and punching them in the face with brass knuckles, breaking their jaws, knocking out their teeth, putting them on starvation rations, and subjecting them to solitary confinement. The prisoners were then presented with prepared statements to sign. Confess or face more torture... Tell me, what would you have done against such horror?</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot my closing statement:-</p>

<p>The point here is that one lie after another has come tumbling down on the Holocaust<sup>TM</sup> Narrative. So one has to wonder, what else were we told that was a lie? </p>

<p>Which is why the HoloHoax makes zero sense. There isn&#39;t a single record of any communication between the nazis intercepted by the Allies, which indicated any implementation of the so-called final solution. There are no mention of intended gassings, tortures, cremations post gassing whatsoever. </p>

<p>The available records actually show figures of death 50 times lower than the 6 million lie. Germans were fighting a two-front war, you think they would divert their war machine resources into such an inefficient and non-beneficial plan? Newsflash, they were in it to win the war, not enact extermination of this mythical 6 million people group. </p>

<p>No, I question the officially regurgitated history because it doesn&#39;t stand up to scrutiny, and what doesn&#39;t stand up to scrutiny doesn&#39;t stand up to common sense, plain and simple. The scientific method isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s the best one we have. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This was war. The Germans needed resources to feed into their war machine, so they set up slave labor camps. That&#39;s right, these weren&#39;t concentration camps, they were <strong>slave labor</strong> camps. Does that make the Nazis angels? Hell to the no, enslaving a populace to work is wrong. But there&#39;s one very interesting aspect that I discovered in my research. </p>

<p>According to the &quot;meticulous records&quot; of the Nazis, these slave laborers were VERY well fed, they had their own theaters and entertainment programs, and were even allowed to do localized trading within the camps. How the hell do you think the resource-starved Germans were putting such a fierce fight on two fronts? They kept their labor force well fed and sound. Some historians even argue that these camps were the safest places to be in Nazi occupied territory given how well protected and resource-supplied they were. </p>

<p>Do you know the real cause of those 300,000 unfortunate war casualties? Disease and starvation. When the Allies ever-so-righteously bombed German supply lines and infrastructure back to the stone age, you have to wonder what the fate of those slave laborers would be when they begin to run out of food and medicines... Of course they&#39;d be riddled with diseases like typhus and die of starvation etc. </p>

<p>This was war, and atrocities were bound to happen. But we should make it a point to investigate the whole truth and not get behind the mathematically impossible and scientifically unproven holocaust narrative out of sheer emotion. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s something to ponder over for you - why is it that several countries have outlawed skepticism over the holocaust? Why are people threatened with their property, careers, and even their lives when they try to get a more clearer picture in these places? If the narrative is foolproof and fully provable, why is it always above scrutiny? I&#39;m genuinely curious about your answer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post here. I&#39;m curious what Iran would look lime today had the US backed Coup not of happened. Look at what Syria looked like before the war, had a relative large Christian population who had strong support for Assad and lived in peace with muslims there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you, we use examples of why muslims are bad by citing the same muslims governments who we&#39;re allied with and Israel supports. Why is there no Rhetoric of Suadi Arabia being the boogy man, yet Iran is going to wipe Israel off the map? Seems like the extremists all live in places like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qutar yet Israel and America work very closely with those same entities. When you start to see through the smoke it makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because Trump is the first person elected president with no ties to bilderberg, trilateral commission, bohemian grove, skull and bones, freemasonry or any of the other places that are supposedly where the illuminati gets together to decide future world leaders. Not only that, it would appear by all objective accounts that every establishment force genuinely aligned against him in the general election. </p>

<p>That, combined with the fact that Clinton on the other hand had ties to almost <strong>all</strong> of those groups, is why you see <strong>more</strong> anti-Clinton threads on a <strong>conspiracy</strong> forum. She&#39;s essentially illumanati epitomized whereas Trump genuinely has no discernible ties. Regardless of that, people trash him anyway and it&#39;s insane to suggest that this sub is somehow in his corner or in his defense, so your point is totally nonsense and just typical left-wing victim playing even when it&#39;s not true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have Muslims gripped the world with a mythical extermination event like the Holocaust<sup>TM,</sup> unlike the Zionist Jews? Have Muslims been the direct cause of any wars that have occurred over the last few decades (I&#39;m assuming that you&#39;re redpilled about 9/11 and 7/7, Brussels, Paris attacks etc.)? Who fucked Syria leading up to the refugee crisis? Who fucked Iraq and Afghanistan to oblivion and led to spillover effects into neighboring countries like Pakistan, which has been ravaged and infiltrated on high government positions by Taliban&#39;s remnants? </p>

<p>I admit, Muslims have plenty of problems (that&#39;s evident from the Pakistani Muslim immigrants causing serious problems in the UK since the past few decades, for example). But how about actually letting the common Muslim flourish in a democracy independent of puppet strings attached by the US-Israeli hegemonic alliance? Proxy wars and the corporatism agenda in the Middle East have shattered any chance of independent growth, and I promise you the world would be a very different place and Muslims would have a better impression had there been little such interference.</p>

<p>Source: educated Pakistani Muslim here. You&#39;ll probably think that my faith lends a bias against the HoloHoax, but that&#39;s not the case at all. I was once a vehement believer of the Holocaust and sympathized with the Jews, but research into proper revisionist work of historians has changed my mind. Sorry, but those who bandwagon behind this mythical event are just as guilty as those leading the narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Wow what a giant wall of lies, half-truths and misinformation.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sorry to break it to you, but Trump actively solicited donations from foreign governments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL this is how I see shit like this and know that you and those on your &quot;side&quot; who spew this nonsense are pieces of shit. <strong>Those are chain emails that his campaign sent out to anyone they could.</strong> Some of them found their way out of the country the way same way any chain email does. You&#39;re seriously trying to suggest he solicited donations from Vincente Fox from that? A man who publicly and actively spoke against him at every opportunity and whom he had a public &quot;feud&quot; with?</p>

<p><strong>FUCK you people are MENDACIOUS!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way, the two largest donors to the Trump Campaign were the McMahon&#39;s. Linda McMahon was just appointed to his Cabinet. Pay to Play, anyone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the problem is that this factually is not pay to play. You factually cannot tie Linda McMahon being appointed to his cabinet to donations made my Vince McMahon, who is a long time friend and business partner of Trump. Your assertion that she was appointed because of financial contribution rather than her longstanding association with the man and being someone that he was familiar with and could trust is absolutely baseless and unfounded. You should feel shame at leveling such an accusation but sadly I know that shame is one emotion people like you do not feel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump accepted donations for a registered lobbyists for Saudi Arabia. From an agent for a leader of the Congo. From members of a firm that represent the embassy of Korea, embassy of Bangladesh, and the Center of Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And anyone can make a donation? Any citizen of the US can donate to a presidential campaign. Not illegal. What your talking about is factually not the same thing that your rotten, corrupt, illuminati demigogue Hillary did. Period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m also curious about what Trump uses his Foundation for. I know it spent $20,000 to by a 6 foot tall portrait of himself and his small hands. And another portrait of himself for $10,000. And a Tebow autograph for $12,000. And he used Foundation funds to settle lawsu8ts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without even bothering to check on the majority of those cases you mention, because I already know what a lying, mendacious piece of shit you are, I&#39;ll just say that off the top of my head I know that your reference to Trump using his foundation money to &quot;settle a lawsuit&quot; is bullshit. He fought a legal battle with the foundation money for the right to fly the American Flag. People like you and the BS left wing media keep trying to spin it as he did something dishonest. Not that it&#39;s important, but I&#39;m willing to bet if I took the time to look into the other charges (which I won&#39;t, because you&#39;ve proven yourself so blatantly dishonest) I would find the other side of the story to dispute those too!</p>

<p><strong>You are a lying piece of human shit!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Oh and saying over and over again that Paul Ryan endorsed him means something is really embarrassing to your own argument as everyone who actually followed his campaign (and didn&#39;t get their info from left-wing media) knows all of the drama and BS that surrounded that. Not that it would matter anyhow as obviously the speaker is going to endorse the Republican Nominee once he&#39;s the nominee or risk political suicide (Even though he almost didn&#39;t and to this day gets booed by Republicans at rallies for how he handled things).</p>

<p>No. The establishment was not on his side. That was readily apparent. You&#39;re living in a world of <strong>fucking make-believe</strong>.</p>

<p>Buddy honestly you are either really evil or really stupid to believe MSM / left-wing lies without cross checking the facts for yourself on something other than &quot;snopes&quot; or &quot;politifact&quot;, which are nothing more than fictional vehicles for left-wing propaganda.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail in 2016, the New York billionaire—like most Republican candidates—frequently promised to tear up the Iran deal and move the U.S. Embassy to divided Jerusalem (in previous years, Democrats have made similar promises). In March, speaking at the annual convention of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the powerful pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC, Trump accused the United Nations of trying to “impose” an agreement on Israel and Palestinians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One lie after another has been debunked regarding the Holocaust:-</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nazis used gas chambers to kill Jews</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a single gas chamber has been proven to have the capacity to do so. All existing gas chambers were constructed post-war, claimed to be exact replicas, yet they have flimsy wooden doors or chimneys. Tell me, what the fuck kind of gas chamber has these insecure controls?</p>

<p>The reality: Slave-labor camps used gas chambers to delouse its occupant workers. No evidence uncovered yet which indicates foul-play</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nazis made shrunken heads, lampshades and soaps from the remains of Jews</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each of these lies has been thoroughly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_made_from_human_corpses">debunked.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Witness testimonies/memoirs are a clear indication of Nazi abuse and oppression</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh you mean testimonies from the likes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/24/holocaust-survivor-lied-joseph-hirt-auschwitz">Joseph Hirt</a>? Or perhaps you meant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SQWB36uKkw">Herman Rosenblat</a>? Nah, you probably thought of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha_Defonseca">Misha Defonseca</a>? Oh wait, you were definitely talking about <a href="http://www.eliewieseltattoo.com/">Elie Wiesel</a>, right?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re too lazy to go through all those links, I&#39;ll summarize for you: they have all been debunked as liars who conned the world, and some even had the audacity to make millions out of that lie. Please note that I have not mentioned dozens of other accounts which have been completely debunked as piles of fabricated horseshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nazi testimonies, especially from Rudolph Hoss cannot be debunked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they can&#39;t, but if you wanna take his word for it, why not also believe him when <a href="https://rudolfhoess.wordpress.com/">he claims to have been tortured</a> during <a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v07/v07p389_faurisson.html">interrogations</a>? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not just his testimony - Germans also confessed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre">Katyn massacre</a>. Today we know the Soviets did it. They admitted they were responsible after the USSR broke up; Germans admitted to steaming Jews to death. Today we know that <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_holocaust13.htm">never happened</a>. <strong>The &#39;confessions&#39; mean nothing when torture was used to get them.</strong></p>

<p>Following reports that defendants were tortured at the Malmedy massacre trial, the US Army formed the “Simpson Commission” to investigate the alleged misconduct. Judge Edward L. Van Roden was part of this commission. According to <a href="http://www.fpp.co.uk/Auschwitz/Dachau/VanRoden1948.html">Van Roden’s book, American Atrocities in Germany</a>, out of 139 cases of treatment of alleged German “war criminals” who were investigated by the commission—and who were subsequently put on trial by the American Military Tribunal in Dachau after World War II—”137 of these Germans were tortured by having their testicles crushed.”</p>

<p>Other methods used by the American interrogators included brutal beatings, placing a hood over prisoners and punching them in the face with brass knuckles, breaking their jaws, knocking out their teeth, putting them on starvation rations, and subjecting them to solitary confinement. The prisoners were then presented with prepared statements to sign. Confess or face more torture... Tell me, what would you have done against such horror?</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot my closing statement:-</p>

<p>The point here is that one lie after another has come tumbling down on the Holocaust<sup>TM</sup> Narrative. So one has to wonder, what else were we told that was a lie? </p>
