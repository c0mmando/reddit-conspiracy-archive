<p><strong>35,576,604,000$</strong></p>

<p>Saved you some money, could use the rest to for training and drug rehab. You could probably get an even better deal since it&#39;s a mass purchase and buy houses in even cheaper areas. If we&#39;re going to spend the american taxpayers money, at least this way it can potentially come back to us and keep our neighbors safe.</p>

<p>But for Obama, Trump and Hillary, America comes last after Israel, Saudi Arabia, Goldman Sachs, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...I&#39;ll speak? I guess. Israel seems like a good option as an ally because it gives a land to a large religious group of the world to be represented by. This works against the Global Islamic takeover agenda because the Jews are steadfast in their religion and won&#39;t be pushed over by a jihad. It&#39;s obviously more complicated than that but the main threat facing the world is the Salafi of Islam (at least if you&#39;re a westerner imo). Anyone who is working against the threat of religious dogma is an ally in the eyes of T_D.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean if raiders come to raid you shouldnt just sit there and take it. Israel as ancient history that is ingrained in their culture. For the sake of human peace the majority of jews should get a homeland vs. palestinians which are currently assisting in the Jihad against the west. We are coming upon a WW3 like moment between Christianity vs. the extremist of Islams. How bad it gets depends on our alliances moving into the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that.   But if you don&#39;t like people attacking you, do you think it is a good idea to take their lands?   I mean, it isn&#39;t as if they are going to be appreciative.    I think for either side to heal, Israel needs to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/05/24/136495202/background-israels-pre-1967-boundaries">give back all the land they&#39;ve taken and go back to pre 1967 borders</a>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just an A or B situation. Either we give the jews land or we don&#39;t. There has to be an answer and the sides have developed  as they are. Either we side with Israel, Russia (and probably other western nations will fall behind us) or we side with the muslims. I may not know the jewish people aren&#39;t looking to stab us in the back. but I know the jihad against the west is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion you don&#39;t have the best knowledge of this situation. But like I said that is just my opinion and I respect yours.</p>

<p>Russia is not with Israel. Also, You also were not aware of the fact that the reason we ever started getting hit with terrorists attacks was because of our involvement with Israel. Osama Bin Laden said it himself in 1990&#39;s. I&#39;m not a fan of Islam and I know there would certainly be extremists killing innocent people around the world but not even close to the amount we have now.</p>

<p>Here is an analogy for how Israel has caused us problems.</p>

<p>If everyday I hand you a rock and you throw that rock at John&#39;s head..John isn&#39;t going to like me after a few weeks of him watching me hand you a rock to throw at his fucking head. I&#39;m the US. You are Israel. John is Palesine and the rest of the Middle East.</p>

<p>Osama used an extremely similar analogy in an interview way before September 11th.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Trump has been extremely pro-israel from the start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, he has, but it was more than a bit difficult to read, because the &quot;love affair&quot; always seemed one sided. Early in the Republican race, (August, 2015) <strong><em>FORWARD</em></strong> magazine announced:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/318770/trumps-strong-jewish-ties/">Trump Has Strongest Jewish Ties of all GOP Candidates</a></strong></p>

<p>So we knew that he was &quot;kosher certified&quot;... HOWEVER, aside from extreme right-wing (Ultra Orthodox, etc) he failed to garner much support from Jews, whether in Israel or in the US. </p>

<p>And of course he kowtowed to Zionist Jews at the AIPAC Ass-Kissing-Contest - but that has become an obligatory &quot;rite of passage&quot; that ALL prominent US politicians must endure.</p>

<p>Still, Jews showed very little support for Trump, donating almost ZERO money <em>(until Uncle Sheldon stepped up at the last minute)</em>, all while berating and defaming him in the press, accusing him of being racist, anti-Semitic... you name it. Meanwhile, Jewish Mega-Donors SHOWERED Hillary with Ca$h - over $100 Million (~10% of her total war chest), and the boy&#39;s writing those BIG checks could hardly be called &quot;anti-Israel&quot;, could they?</p>

<p>Now, given the constant stream of ATTACKS and total lack of support, one might wonder whether kissing Zionist Ass had left him with <strong><em>a bit of a funky taste in his mouth</em></strong> - especially AFTER the election, when Jewish authors and publications went utterly APE SHIT - all but calling him &quot;Hitler&quot; and predicting another Holocaust.</p>

<p>The <em>FORWARD</em> went so far as to ask:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://forward.com/opinion/353769/did-jewish-media-screw-up-by-focusing-on-donald-trump/">Did Jewish Media Screw Up by Focusing on Donald Trump?</a></strong> </p>

<p>Archived here: <a href="https://archive.is/WPdpw">https://archive.is/WPdpw</a></p>

<p>But in spite of all this, Trump didn&#39;t bat an eye - hell, he didn&#39;t stop kissing Bibi&#39;s ass long enough to come up for air! And his OUTRAGE last week when Obama failed to VETO the UNSC resolution (rightfully) censuring Israel for its atrocious, inhumane and ILLEGAL settlement policies??? <em>[hint: There&#39;s a reason that the Zionist State is increasingly being seen as a PARIAH by the world at large - and it has NOTHING to do with &quot;anti-Semitism&quot;]</em></p>

<p>So, how can we possibly reconcile the unseemly behavior of Trump - a world-class EGOMANIAC who reacts to the slightest criticism by losing his shit on fucking TWITTER???</p>

<p>Well, there are a few possibilities:</p>

<p>One: Trump is a CHUMP - a SUCKER who is too ST00PID to know that he is being played like a fiddle by Jews who schmooze him to his face while stabbing him in the back </p>

<p>Second, that Jews are a MUCH more politically diverse group than many would imagine - and while this IS true - at least to some extent - the overwhelming majority of Jews tend to bind together like a <strong><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_79JhZ0Mjrzo/SjRv6ZVGFsI/AAAAAAAAA4c/vdALxR9Nd3M/s320/erer.jpg">fasci</a></strong>  - strongly united when it comes to the support and defense of Israel</p>

<p>A third and rather bizarre possibility (remember, this IS <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>!) is that it is not Trump that was played as a &quot;SUCKER&quot;, but the American People - who were intentionally led to BELIEVE that &quot;The Donald&quot;, as an America-Firster, was at last a hope for &quot;salvation&quot; - a man who would look after THEIR interests - when in fact he was just another pawn of the Big Zionist Machine that has been playing Uncle Sugardaddy as a schmuck and a SUCKER for decades. But this would require a Zionist Conspiracy on a scale not seen since the rise of Hitler - so while possible, it would seem rather unlikely...</p>

<p>Or would it?</p>

<p>Trump has been ACCUSED of playing footsie with Russia - but in action, he has been tongue-kissing Zionist Ass (at least so far) - and given Russia&#39;s support of Assad, it would seem that supporting BOTH Russia AND Israel would be incompatible... or maybe not?</p>

<p>Time will tell, but at <strong>this moment</strong>, it is sure starting to look like Trump is a Zionist tool - and if that be the case, we can expect the US to be going balls deep - fighting Syria, Iran, and likely Russia.</p>

<p>So, what&#39;s YOUR take on all of this, <a href="/u/DrDougExeter">/u/DrDougExeter</a>?</p>

<p>Russia and Israel enjoy a very close, friendly relationship. Jews love Trump, so the ones that call him names are pretending to hate him to fool the Gentiles. Under Trump&#39;s presidency, &quot;the hammer is coming down!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;ve been seeing some dialogue - but I had attributed it to respect and courtesy as a matter of practical necessity, rather than &quot;friendship&quot;.</p>

<p>Looking to Syria, for example, from what I can see, Putin really shit all over Israel&#39;s plan, which (I think) was to remove Saddam (done!) and then Assad (tried!), then to set the Jihadists against one another until they fought themselves into exhaustion. The nation states of Iraq and Syria (and possibly Lebanon) would then be DISSOLVED, with borders being redrawn along ethnic/religious lines (Sunni, Shiite, Kurd, Druze, etc) making sure that each group was powerless to wage meaningful attacks against their overlords.</p>

<p>AS A BONUS, I am convinced that Israel had planned to have a &quot;homeland&quot; set aside for all Palestinians - likely somewhere FAR AWAY (like Iraq). It would then be proposed that all Palestinians living in the West Bank, Gaza, and Israel proper be &quot;resettled&quot; to the new &quot;homeland&quot; (with OTHER people&#39;s money, of course) so that &quot;peace&quot; could be achieved at last.</p>

<p>THAT, I believe, WAS the plan - at least until Putin came along and fucked things up by meddling in Syria - preventing Obama from putting US boots on the ground, etc. </p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Putin&#39;s meddling has totally trashed Israel&#39;s plans, so, please explain to me how - given their divergent interests in the immediate vicinity, Israel and Russia can be on &quot;friendly&quot; terms?</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/205761">Putin sends New Year&#39;s greetings to Netanyahu</a></strong></p>

<p>Quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his message to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Putin noted with satisfaction that Russian-Israeli relations have <strong>&quot;retained their positive dynamics,&quot;</strong> even improving in the last year. </p>

<p>Putin added that these positive dynamics are an expression of &quot;his resolve to make every effort in the coming year to enhance the entire range of bilateral ties for the benefit of the people of Russia and Israel and <strong>in the interests of ensuring stability and security in the Middle East.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Israel and Russia have seen an increase in cooperation over the last year, most notably with the establishment of <strong>a hotline to coordinate each country&#39;s respective activities in Syria</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To his credit, Putin tends to be very polite and diplomatic in his communications - something that Obama, Netanyahu and Trump could learn from.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but I see these &quot;positive dynamics&quot; as a necessarily courteous version of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_standoff">Mexican Satndoff</a>. It&#39;s not that they are necessarily &quot;friendly&quot;, rather, it&#39;s that both realize that being &quot;unfriendly&quot; could have VERY serious consequences.</p>

<p>As I explained above, Israel does NOT like what Russia is doing in Syria (they fucking HATE it), but Putin is no Saddam or Assad. The S 300 /S 400 anti-aircraft systems that Russia has installed in Syria could turn Israel and the entire region into a &quot;no fly zone&quot; in a heartbeat - and Israel knows it well.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy-defense/127830-161016-israel-asks-russia-to-update-security-coordination-after-s-300-deployed-to-syria">Israel asks Russia to update security coordination after S-300</a></strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s what the &quot;hotline&quot; mentioned above was all about - being in very close contact to avoid &quot;accidents&quot; that could spin into disaster in a matter of seconds, and neither side wants that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that Putin has aggressive intent toward Israel - and I don&#39;t think Israel thinks they do either, but Putin has made it clear that Russia does intend to protect its interests in the region - and those interests are NOT necessarily aligned with those of Israel.</p>

<p>In the past, Israel has been &quot;smart&quot;: They don&#39;t like fighting their own wars, and they have been very successful in using the political and financial muscle of Zionists to con the US and other Western nations into doing their dirty work for them, as in Iraq and Libya. They almost succeeded in getting the US to go balls-deep into Syria, but following the botched Sarin gas false flag in Ghouta, they had to back down - and that opened the door for Putin to intervene - and he did, though the action was delayed by the Western inspired coup in Ukraine. </p>

<p>After the failed &quot;Red Line&quot; threats, Obama got cold feet. With Trump coming into office, it&#39;s going to be a wild card. I think Israel will do all they can to con him into barging head-long into Syria (and Iran), even if it means that doing so would put the US head-to-head with Russia.</p>

<p>Why should Israel care if Russia and the US lock horns? As long as they are not directly involved, and can maintain &quot;plausible deniability&quot;, it would all be &quot;good&quot; for the Jewish State... unless it went nuclear - but that&#39;s another matter.</p>

It would be interesting to see what or how many bills and measures that strictly benefit Isreal those reps with dual citizenship have voted for.

<p>Check this out...They can only use this money to PLAN a revitalization.    That&#39;s what it is for...REVITALIZATION OF A PERFECTLY FINE AREA.   I was left thinking, although we aren&#39;t as big as say NYC, with homeless, we could easily open up a shelter, a brand new rehab, all from scratch, yet we use it to PLAN REVITALIZATION.  That&#39;s all we can use it for by law.  WHAT THE FUCK.  (That face when there is an estimated population of 20,000.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s right.  20,000 people.  That&#39;s the fucking population, and we are using 10 million for bullshit planning.  If we divided it equally, we&#39;d each get 500 - which I don&#39;t want to happen, I want them to either house, clothe and feed what homeless we do have, or pretty much anything other than PLANNING.</p>

<p>What will end up happening is, the local counsel will hire their friends at absurd prices.   Fucking government man..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup a common practice among politicians unfortunately, charge an extreme over price for something that shouldn&#39;t cost that much and then pay your friends a wage that&#39;s ridiculously above the market rate for &quot;consulting&quot; and etc. It is the hallmark of financial mismanagement and echos of communism and failed central planning. It&#39;s pretty much what Putin did when hiring contractor &quot;friends&quot; that charged prices way above market rates to build the stadiums for the Sochi olympics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty harsh to realize the world is not fucked because we can&#39;t fix it, but because we don&#39;t want to. Plain and simple.</p>

<p>When people say things like &quot;they want us to be poor! we are being manipulated to buy and make the rich richer!&quot; we tend to think it&#39;s nonsense. But when you start thinking about it, thinking about in how many better ways the money can be spend, you realize it&#39;s true. There&#39;re people ill or in the streets while we (in my country) are giving money to banks. 20k millions (I think it&#39;s 20k billions to USA) given as a present TO A BANK while they&#39;re cutting the help for students and disabled people. C&#39;mon what the fuck. This is the major conspiracy.</p>

<p>Edit. And 20k billions is the official number given by government, some say it doubles it, maybe even more, and banks were literally scamming people, not metaphorically, literally!</p>

<p>The US GDP is about $18 trillion a year. About 18% of that goes to healthcare. That&#39;s $3.2 trillion a year.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no way the price is $30 billion.  That might be the price of food, but you need to account for the wars and corruption going on.  If the US unilaterally and consistently worked to get the food out there, they still would have to contend with regional politicians who will coopt that aid and use it exclusively for their own military, or prevent enemy populations from receiving it.  Next you have to deal with the problem of disenfranchising farmers who can&#39;t compete with &quot;free&quot;, which results in an unemployed population who is condemned to perpetual slavery relying forever on the continued graces of foreign aid while they themselves forget about work and a useful way of life.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s kind of the point.

<p>In the past, there wasn&#39;t enough to go around. Wars make sense when this is the case. Fighting for resources and wealth when there wasn&#39;t enough to go around.

<p>38$ billion israel giveaway</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You drop this assertion without explanation, so I had to go figure out what you were talking about. It seems you&#39;re referencing <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/09/united-states-israel-memorandum-of-understanding-military-aid/500192/">this military aid deal</a>.</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Military_Financing">there are four recipients of US military aid totaling more than $1b/yr</a> and Israel is third on that list.</p>

<p>You also make it sound as if this is money that&#39;s being handed over to Israel. That&#39;s not really true.</p>

<p>This is a ten year package of military support, which is primarily made up of promises to reimburse US weapons manufacturers for purchases of weapons and weapon systems (such as the $500m earmarked for missile defense systems).</p>

<p>As such, this is really just a chunk of the US military budget being paid to US companies by the US government with Israel among several other nations benefiting by receiving the hardware.</p>

<p>If you really want to get upset about something, I would focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:InflationAdjustedDefenseSpending.PNG">the overall US military budget</a>, which could provide about $1000 to every single person living in extreme poverty, <em>around the world</em>, per year (a sum of money that would far exceed most such families&#39; current income sources). Of course, the logistics of that are obscene, but it would still be a better way to spend the money, even if only half of it made it to the intended recipients.</p>

You could justify Iraq and Afghanistan by saying that these are dirt poor nations that had their governments and military totally destroyed by American intervention so now we need to pay them to rebuild so that they can fight against active insurgencies we helped create. You might be even be able to justify the money to Egypt by saying that we&#39;re buying friends in the Middle East, it&#39;s not a great reason, but it&#39;s a reason.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But Israel is a first-world country with a strong economy and free democracy. They shouldn&#39;t need our help, especially not so much of it.</p>

<p>1. The data looks old, like 2008/2006. What are the current numbers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which data? There was a fair amount of detail I linked to... If there is something you feel has changed, feel free to cite more recent info, but I linked to what I could find. Obviously the main thrust of my points were the deal itself and the current size of the budget, both of which are pretty current (last year).</p>

<p>If you want to argue justification, we could certainly have that political debate, but that&#39;s not what I was attempting to do. I was putting our military &quot;aid&quot; into perspective (it&#39;s odd to call it aid, it might make the discussion more logical if we called it what it is: gun vouchers).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The wikipedia list, it uses data from 2006 and 2008. Given the political changes since 2008, it would be interesting to see what the top countries are now. Did Israel move up or down? Is Egypt still included after the Arab Spring and coup?</p>

I mean, it isn&#39;t as if they are going to be appreciative.    I think for either side to heal, Israel needs to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/05/24/136495202/background-israels-pre-1967-boundaries">give back all the land they&#39;ve taken and go back to pre 1967 borders</a>.  </p>

<p>Oh and guess what.   This also happend to be the time Israel attacked an ally, killing 34 Americans:  <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/ussliberty.html">The USS Liberty</a>. </p>

<p>Israel isn&#39;t the ally you think they are.    </p>
