<p>Nevertheless, every journalist ought to be aware that it is Pizzagate that will ultimately take down World Shadow Government that unlawfully controls the US Government and every other Western power.
The Internet is now overwhelmed by misinformation, disinformation and false information about the Washington, D.C. scandal known primarily as Pizzagate.</p>

<p>Pedogate is Global, Pizzagate is Local
Many have complained that Pizzagate should be called Pedogate.
In fact, Pizzagate is just one of many Pedogates occurring around the world at this very moment.  As the title indicates, “Pizzagate Represents Only a Single American Franchise Within a Worldwide Child Trafficking Operation Known As Pedogate“.</p>

<p>The most critical point here is that Pizzagate is the lynchpin that is inextricably connected to all the other Pedogates.  Because it represents the child exploitation operation in the nation’s capital and related power centers, its outing has the capacity to expose the whole bloody child abuse culture.  Yes, Pizzagate is that prominently configured within the world-wide Pedogate scandal.  It’s not the grand-daddy like the Brussels Pedogate, but it involves a Who’s Who of American society and especially the political class.</p>

<p>First, it’s important to understand that Pizzagate was revealed by the double whammy of the Podesta WikiLeaks and Anthony Weiner’s 650,000 emails.  In other words, the time had come for this pedophilia in high places to be blown wide open.  Because it all went down just a couple of weeks before the most contentious election in U.S. history, the whole world was watching the American political theater with utter amazement.</p>

<p>What the reader needs to understand is that Pizzagate represents only the tip of the iceberg—a global iceberg of profound criminality committed against the children of the world.  Not only does it concern a much larger worldwide pedophilia ring known as Pedogate, it also involves an international crime syndicate that trades in the exploitation of children—EVERYWHERE —24/7.</p>

<p>What makes Pizzagate so very explosive is that all of the key players are deep in D.C. politics and Washington power-plays, US government influence peddling and federal power-brokering.  And then there is the C.I.A., often regarded as the intelligence agency that not only controls the many Pedogates occurring nationwide, but also closely monitors each and every one of them.  After all, these unimaginable child abuse operations are implemented — first and foremost — as the primary control mechanism that keeps American politicians in complete check.</p>

<p>The C.I.A. has always been notorious for being deeply involved in the top 3 illicit revenue-producing operations of the world.  Drug trafficking and arms trafficking are both quite HUGE; however, it is child trafficking that really keeps them in business.  The CIA has so many black budgeted operations to fund that they require massive funding from these criminal activities to continue to run them across the planet.  Child trafficking also provides a special means to control those in positions of perceived power.  However, it is those who occupy the highest echelons of the global power structure who are also taken care of by way of this global pedophilia ring.</p>

<p>The very endeavor that put the Clinton Foundation on the map was its response to the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti.  However, a woman who was caught and convicted of child smuggling (33 children) — Laura Silsby — and who Secretary of State Clinton tried to protect from prosecution, also has ties to the Foundation.  Which is why the mainstream media (MSM) was eerily silent on this whole criminal matter.</p>

<p>Because the C.I.A. uses pedophilia to control so many politicians, Mr. Alefantis was quite unbelievably identified as the “49th most powerful man in Washington, D.C.”  He is also on record for visiting the White House at least 5 times.  He has photos of himself with Tony Podesta, half of the super-lobbyist duo with brother John Podesta.  And he has a thank you letter signed by Hillary Clinton for the use of his restaurant for a Democratic event that raised some serious money.</p>

<p>The only way that the global Pedogate operations can be terminated is for people of good will and those with a conscience to face it front on.  The perps have only gotten away with so much flagrant criminality against the children because of the unwillingness of good people to acknowledge its occurrence.  Even those who know all about it are either afraid or unwilling to stop it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post, this is a fantastic high-level understanding of &quot;The Matrix.&quot;</p>

<p>The CIA is, in many ways, in control of the government. They do this largely through blackmail. They also kill people, run drugs, and do a few other things.</p>

<p>It appears to me that every president since Clinton has been firmly placed there by the CIA (I am unsure about Trump).</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible it was more of a warning than an assassination attempt. He used a .22 revolver, and the shot that hit Reagan was a ricochet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was saying that if they wanted to kill him, they would have shot him with a more powerful caliber. </p>

<p>A .22 is basically going to have to hit the heart or brain to kill someone. Assassins sometimes used them because they were fairly easy to suppress, but even this is now obsolete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol I have extensive experience with guns. .22 is not the smallest round. Every heard of a .17? Secondly, a bullet that doesn&#39;t exit and just bounces around inside you is much more deadly. It doesn&#39;t bounce off you that&#39;s for sure. It&#39;s people like you that perpetuate terriblly wrong and even dangerous information that make the world a worse place to live in. If you think a .22 isn&#39;t strong enough to kill someone (even though many people use them to illegally hunt deer) then have one of your buddies shoot you in the face with a hollow point .22 and see what happens. Just please tell me you are trolling or at least save face by lying about your limited knowledge on the subject and use the opportunity to learn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus, where to start? </p>

<p>The round is small but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t dangerous. </p>

<p>My reasoning for the .17? You said a .22 is the smallest round which is false. Plenty of people use .17 but you wouldn&#39;t know that obviously. If you&#39;re wrong about this, why would anything thing else you are saying be true?</p>

<p>Please show me these COUNTLESS videos, articles, stories (hahahha), etc. that mention this that aren&#39;t all referencing the same unlikely occurrence. </p>

<p>You never said anything about a metal jacket. Stop changing your arguement. Your original one was that a bigger gun would be easier to conceal. </p>

<p>Many people shoot .22 hollow points. Do you live under a rock?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand the power behind such a small round. Get a high grain round and have your friend shoot you. Let me know what happens. K bye.  </p>

<p>EDIT: a .22 and a .223 ( 5.56 the round used in AR15/M4&#39;s the shit the military uses) only varries by .003.  3 THOUSANDTHS of an inch. Of course one has more powder behind it and the length of the bullet carries but to say something that is .22 inches in diameter can&#39;t kill someone is asinine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone is disagreeing that it is a smaller round. And a reason for using a .22 over a 9mm or a magnum shell, it&#39;s EASIER to conceal a smaller weapon and it is quieter. Also, if you&#39;re going to be close enough to someone to kill them with a pistol effectively, the size of the bullet won&#39;t matter too much. A .357 is smaller than a .500 mag so why don&#39;t all assasins just walk around with a S&amp;W 500?
That article only supports my point. The round is dangerous enough to richocet off of something and kill someone. You know you can ricochet bullets off water right? its all about angles. I want to see countless articles describing many occurances of .22 just bouncing off people. Any anger I have comes from the fatally dangerous narrative you&#39;re perpetuating by severely underplaying the potential a .22 has of killing someone. You have to remember the majority of people are dumb and will take your statements too literally. Just like Hollywood comedies like to always have a gag where they toss a loaded gun around like a toy.  Yeah, I get it, it&#39;s a joke, but some jackass out there is going to shoot his friend and blame TV or some dumb shit and then Liberal media will make a big deal out of the dangers of guns and blah blah blah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thing with that story is it doesn&#39;t matter what round was used (short of a .500 BMG or something absurd) it still would ricochet. AND it still killed someone. Plus it&#39;s one isolated, freak accident , not COUNTLESS stories (your words not mine) of various instances in which .22s just bounced off people like a trampoline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, lots of people get killed by .22s. My point was that an assassin is unlikely to pick non-suppressed .22 revolver. A rifle is much more likely to do the job, and a larger caliber pistol is somewhat more likely to do the job.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the actual street data. A .22 is fatal 34% of the time, a .357 magnum also 34% of the time, and a rifle 68% of the time:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.buckeyefirearms.org/alternate-look-handgun-stopping-power">https://www.buckeyefirearms.org/alternate-look-handgun-stopping-power</a></p>

<p>I would have expected the .357 magnum to be higher, but I suspect the .22 is baking in both .22 pistols and rifles. A .22 rifle has about 300 extra FPS in muzzle velocity, and people are much more likely to hit with them in a gunfight, so if we isolated only .22 pistols, I would guess that the fatality rate would go down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might invoke cognitive dissonance in some, but Walt Disney, which of course is for a child audience, has some of the most numerous examples of subliminal sex symbols embedded in the movies, and shows, cartoons, all of it. Just a quick Google search for Disney subliminal:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=walt+disney+subliminal&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;prmd=ivn&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtoLPUoprRAhVMPiYKHQivCpcQ_AUIBygB&amp;amp;biw=722.6290691557117&amp;amp;bih=451.4553748051796&amp;amp;dpr=1.33">Disney subliminal</a></p>

<p>Take your pick.
In reality it&#39;s full of occult and sex symbolism. So even in our culture, in our arts and child shows is some sick and twisted shit hidden everywhere.</p>

<p>So imo, the symbolism was the tip of the iceberg. Our society is being fucked with hard. But explain all this symbolism in movies, cartoons, art, especially commercials from major corporations are embedded with subliminals. Some satanic, some sexual; mostly occult mythological references important to their secret societies. So it&#39;s right there in front of our face, mocking us. I have so many examples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, pizzagate doesn&#39;t center around one local pizza joint.  That&#39;s the msm narrative.  It was called pizzagate, because of the code words initially found in Podesta&#39;s emails, not because of Comet Pizza.  Few days later, some of the same code words with odd context were also found on Stratfor leaks.  Comet Pizza only surfaced after further digging on #spiritcooking.</p>

<p>EDIT: Pizzagate isn&#39;t just about pedo stuff.  Spiritcooking is tied to pizzagate, as they were discovered almost simultaneously, involving the same cast of characters.  So pizzagate includes occult rituals involving children by powerful people in DC.  It&#39;s much more than pedophilia and human trafficking.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but what you&#39;re suggesting is kind of naive and ignorant. You don&#39;t just stop investigating a murder suspect because they could potentially be innocent.</p>

<p>What you are suggesting is asinine and complete ass backwards.</p>

<p>Besides, if they wanted to legitimately shut this down they would have done an immediate open investigation on the podesta brothers and dropped it at that.</p>

<p>They have not done that. It&#39;s all defensive back pedaling and name calling and bs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that could be horrible abuse of children and indicative of pedophilia that they recklessly bragged about on Instagram. Or it could be they bought a pinata and they accidentally got one for adults. The kids broke it open and instead of candy they were upset to find condoms and alcohol. The parents thought this was hilarious and posted it on Instagram.</p>

<p>You said:</p>

<p>In any case: the police have investigated all the &quot;evidence&quot;, and concluded that there is absolutely nothing there. So there&#39;s your proof - a full investigation of all of this has been done, and there wasn&#39;t anything to it. You can sleep easy, you protected the imaginary children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which was a complete and total lie. There was no investigation. The cops decided it was bullshit and refused to investigate. Which is hardly surprising, since Alefantis is reportedly one of the most powerful men in D.C. and Podesta can get away with rigging a Democratic Primary without criminal charges being brought against him.</p>

<p>And does nobody want to talk about Podesta&#39;s public announcements about aliens? That&#39;s what I want to be talking about. </p>

<p>But so what? These people are guilty of far worse crimes than raping children. </p>
