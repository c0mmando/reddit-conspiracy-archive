        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-29 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Ilsaluna.html">Ilsaluna</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This was released in Project Syndicate yesterday where he begins with this:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Well before Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, I sent a holiday greeting to my friends that read: “These times are not business as usual. Wishing you the best in a troubled world.” Now I feel the need to share this message with the rest of the world. But before I do, I must tell you who I am and what I stand for.&quot;</em></p>

<p>What follows is a lot of blustering seemingly designed to make the reader feel sorry for him based on all he&#39;s been through until he drops this tidbit:</p>

<p><em>&quot;I find the current moment in history very painful. Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of closed societies – from fascist dictatorships to mafia states – are on the rise. How could this happen? The only explanation I can find is that elected leaders failed to meet voters’ legitimate expectations and aspirations and that this failure led electorates to become disenchanted with the prevailing versions of democracy and capitalism. Quite simply, many people felt that the elites had stolen their democracy.&quot;</em></p>

<p>So, he&#39;s noticed we&#39;re waking up. It&#39;s requires some mental gymnastics (or hypnosis) to go from elites stealing democracy to democracy being in crisis (below). It seems he might be using two different definitions of democracy. </p>

<p><em>&quot;Democracy is now in crisis. Even the US, the world’s leading democracy, elected a con artist and would-be dictator as its president. Although Trump has toned down his rhetoric since he was elected, he has changed neither his behavior nor his advisers. His cabinet comprises incompetent extremists and retired generals.&quot;</em></p>

<p>It would appear he&#39;s not happy his pulling of strings in the election didn&#39;t work out the way he planned. In reading a bit more, he says this,</p>

<p><em>&quot;The US will be unable to protect and promote democracy in the rest of the world.&quot;</em></p>

<p>There it is. He&#39;s pissed. His war machine has come to a screeching halt. When was the last time in recent history democracy was protected or promoted within the US or by the US in other countries? <em>crickets</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s not just the US, though. He&#39;s also the conductor of the &quot;it&#39;s Putin&#39;s fault&quot; train, too. </p>

<p><em>&quot;I am particularly worried about the fate of the EU, which is in danger of coming under the influence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose concept of government is irreconcilable with that of open society. Putin is not a passive beneficiary of recent developments; he worked hard to bring them about. He recognized his regime’s weakness: it can exploit natural resources but cannot generate economic growth. He felt threatened by “color revolutions” in Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere. At first, he tried to control social media. Then, in a brilliant move, he exploited social media companies’ business model to spread misinformation and fake news, disorienting electorates and destabilizing democracies. That is how he helped Trump get elected.&quot;</em></p>

<p>And finally, he emphasizes that everything he&#39;s been responsible for is actually Putin&#39;s fault. Well, everything except Wikileaks and the DNC&#39;s emailpalooza. </p>

<p><em>&quot;The trouble is that the method Putin has used to destabilize democracy cannot be used to restore respect for facts and a balanced view of reality.&quot;</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s of note, yet not surprising, he doesn&#39;t offer any solutions to the &quot;problems&quot; he sees. According to this picture he&#39;s painted, he&#39;s merely a spectator on the sidelines and is concerned because of what he sees happening. There&#39;s also the option of reading the crystal-clear writing between the lines and it indicates George is pissed and he still has a few lame tricks up his sleeve because things aren&#39;t going his way anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold them all accountable. No free tickets. Anyone messing with our freedom has to be removed from power. Any future, promising leaders should be under the same scrutiny. The only reason Soros walks around a free man is because we haven&#39;t booted him out yet. </p>

<p>Still, I have a real good feeling for 2017. One day, someone should be a Trilogy movie out of this. 2016 was the crazy election full of leaks. 2017 will probably be the rise of the people. 2018 will probably be the purge of corruption. The movement has gained so much momentum now that there doesn&#39;t seem anything that can stop it anymore. It&#39;s literally a train with no brakes. </p>
