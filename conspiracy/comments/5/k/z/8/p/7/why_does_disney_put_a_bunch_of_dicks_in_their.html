<p><strong>&quot;The Ring&quot; portrays Disney as a corporation using the ruse of family-friendly morals to disguise their primary motive of profit, particularly through the portrayal of Mickey Mouse as a foul-mouthed, greedy, and physically violent company president.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disney was an FBI ...not an agent, but a citizen who works closely with the Bureau. You get a label and all that. And of course he was a Mason.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=walt+disney+masonic+club+33&amp;amp;oq=walt+disney+masonkc&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l2.15245j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=silk&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">Walt Disney Masonic club 33</a></p>

<p>This one shows how they sexualized mickey mouse:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/W0SJIgSstO8">https://youtu.be/W0SJIgSstO8</a></p>

<p>Compare that with Disney&#39;s own words:</p>

<p>&quot;Mickey Mouse is to me. a symbol of independence. He was a means to an end. He popped out of Manhattan to Hollywood at a time when business fortunes of my brother Roy and myself were at lowest ebb and disaster seemed right around the corner. Born of necesity, the little fellow literally freed us of immediate worry. He provided the means for extending our organization to its present dimensions and for extending the medium of cartoon animation to new entertainment levels. He spelled production liberation for us.” – Walt Disney</p>

<p>“All we ever intended for him or expected of him was that he should continue to make people everywhere chuckle with him and at him. We didn’t burden him with any social symbolism, we made him no mouthpiece for frustrations or harsh satire. Mickey was simply a little personality assigned to the purposes of laughter.” – Walt Disney</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just thought of something else kind of funny. If you consider the Georgia guidestones are partly about population control, then why do masons promote sexuality and sex kittens everywhere you look, or don&#39;t look? Can anybody unravel that contradiction? </p>

<p>All I can think of is that the numbers on the stones represented how many masons, It is their own population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Early sexualization = more teenage pregnancies = more broken families = less education = more dumb people. It&#39;s easier to get rid of dumb people e.g. through unhealthy and GM food. Notice how Americans start to die earlier again? Everything works as planned. The plan is just too big for the ignorant individual to see.</p>

<p>Ever noticed how almost every Disney movie has a broken family? So many orphans (jungle book, Tarzan, Notre dam ...) Or bad parents/family (peter pan, Aladdin, Dumbo, Cinderella, Ariel, Lion king ...). It&#39;s all on purpose.</p>

<p>What do you feel about the theory that if the elite &quot;tell us&quot; by hiding stuff in plain sight, then they feel justified in their actions...I&#39;ve heard that&#39;s why they do this stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yea, and they also use an invented dogma and occult doctrines to justify what they do, and in some ways at the root of it all is mythology, like in the Simpson link. But they use a lot of Roman myth, Egyptian myth, mixtures of demon worship and witchcraft prominant in the dark ages ,and Crowley. It&#39;s basically a mix of all that.</p>

<p>I just heard a new song on the public radio and its called &#39;Blood Cup.&#39;</p>

<p>They are getting more and more persistent, it will be their own undoing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was my reaction too. I listen to it to and from work, I often wonder why I&#39;m doing it. Blood cup, yea, the grail of Satan, in other words. They don&#39;t even care anymore. Soon they will just have a song called&#39; Sell Your Soul To Satan&#39;, playing 24/7</p>

<p>Only thing scary about this is it doesn&#39;t seem to bother enough people yet. They can&#39;t very well have a satanic church service on pbs, so they have to do it in other ways, but don&#39;t people give a shit? A show called Lucifer on Primetime didn&#39;t even raise a lot eyebrows in a sort of hey, Wtf , is going on here kind of way? This is right after vampires was all the rage, and supernatural and other shows geared towards always the dark and negative limitations. So no wonder, we have basically been made used to it.</p>

<p>I imagine all of a sudden the whole nation realizes how much they are being taught to be Satanists.  And what happens.</p>

So be careful Rockran, there is more to disney than meets the eye, and I have plenty of stuff on him you can&#39;t debunk. But at least you get a glimpse of how they put pedo triggers in kids shows. Do you know what those are? Would you like to try to debunk it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you say they are not affected, how do you know? Especially when it&#39;s been studied that subliminals do work. Show a picture or product or symbol hidden in a show enough times and people are programmed to buy it or think highly of it, if the show was being enjoyed.</p>

<p>So think about it with that green castle with the dick in it. You are a kid watching, and your excited the characters finally got to the castle, and there it is, and it&#39;s got a big dick on it, or is in the shape of a dick, or in the clouds behind is spelled SEX. How on earth is that appropriate for a young child?</p>

<p>at one time subliminals were banned in advertising. But that didn&#39;t stop them, they just got better at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not. But do we need to satisfy adult entertainment needs in some arbitrary cartoon for children? It shouldn&#39;t be in there, period. And what does the parent think when they are watching a cartoon and they notice a Dick..</p>

<p>Really?? how else do you react....</p>

<p>As for Sex ed. What&#39;s wrong with that? At least it is honest and in a sterile environment...hopefully.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like asking if a TV show needs to be entertaining. </p>

<p>Technically, no. But if you want parents to happily watch with their kids, you should include content for all ages. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what does the parent think when they are watching a cartoon and they notice a Dick..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought it was hidden? Pick one: HIDDEN, or NOTICEABLE. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This joke is pretty funny: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xmAC9Qu908">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xmAC9Qu908</a></p>

<p>So you&#39;ve got no problem with kids seeing dicks. What was it you were complaining about again? </p>
