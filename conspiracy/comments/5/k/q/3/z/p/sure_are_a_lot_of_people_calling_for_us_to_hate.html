       We'll start to call him out as he does more things of a conspiratorial bent. It's that simple. "Well why is everyone picking on just Clinton? If she gets tried for treason, we should all look real hard until Trump is, too! For fairness' sake!" -- That didn't work during the election, and "you guys leave her alone! She lost and we need to focus on Trump!" just makes the PTB seem that much more desperate. It's scary, in that I don't know what's going to happen as we tie all these nooses that need tying, but I think we all see that any price is worth paying.

       It's like this. The corruption in DC is so entrenched and systemic, it will be no easy task for anyone trying to drain the swamp. Maybe Trump was a con job, but we should give him the benefit of the doubt until at least his first hundred days are up. It is very difficult to know what kind of Machiavellian machinations are being employed by both sides, but the last thing we need to do is ingest these endless fucking black pills being put out daily by the corporate press. I know this community is basically addicted to cynicism, even if it is usually justified. Let's see how this shakes out before we assumin' all is lost and pouring ashes on our heads.

       Also, he's got a long history of dishonesty/shady business practices. He's not some unknown.

       Come on guys, this seems pretty clear. He's part of the billionaire elite. He flew on the Lolita Express with Jeffrey Epstein, just like Bill Clinton. He's no friend of the common man, he just plays one on TV.

       The establishment libs called him racist, sexist, and homophobic. They claimed he was a Russian spy with ties to the mafia. They pleaded with the electors to change their vote. And now they're delegitimizing his cabinet choices.

       Hillary Clinton IS the swamp. Her loss was a win for the world. Trump will do fine. I highly doubt he'll sell arms to the Mexican Cartel and ISIS like Obama did.  I just hope everyone is not overly critical of him all of the time. He's just a little behind in the times and and not very eloquent, but I don't think he's at the same level of corruption as the current establishment represents.

       Trump is "draining the swamp".  You just have a different idea of what the swamp is.  It's not CEOs and Wall Street.  It's DC.  It's career politicians and globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has always said that he was going to bring in successful people from the private sector.  So what exactly are you calling him out on?  Not appointing people that Bernie Sanders would have appointed?  Of course he's not going to do that.

       Mnuchin hasn't worked for Goldman in like 14 years, and Goldman is private.  The are not part of the US government.  Just because they have influence in DC does not mean they are not private.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is always a possibility of corruption within the government, but you are operating under the assumption that past associations mean that Mnuchin, or whoever else, is automatically corrupt.  The fact of the matter is that Trump is not in office yet.  His cabinet has done nothing, so it seem to me that you would be complaining about this no matter who Trump picked, and you will continue to complain no matter what happens in the future.

       Actually... Wall Street has pulled some sleezy shit in combination with those career politicians. Example: the bank bailout. We just need politicians that are interested in protecting the nation's people from the greed of these industries while also fostering a good environment for industry growth. It'll be interesting to see what Trump's new cabinet does. I'm not holding my breath, but I'm also not going to freak out over his pretty standard choices so far. (Standard as far as what I would expect from trump)

       They have, but I would argue that the government is most at fault.  They made the laws, and they ignored the repeated warnings that the housing bubble was about to pop.

       The issue is the people who are qualified to do these jobs are exactly the people who we don't want to have them. We don't want them to have these jobs because they knew enough to take advantage of the system. I'd say how it plays out is how Trump manages these people. If he's smart, which I think he is, he will keep a tight grip on his presidency and if he can get them on his side it might just be what the country needs.

       Maybe Trump believes they'll do what is good for the country rather than what is good for their former employers.  Maybe he'll replace them if he finds he was wrong about that.  Until we see what Trump allows these people to do, there's no reason for a former Trump supporter to declare that he's changed his agenda based solely on his cabinet choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       I too suspect that a lot of Trump's decisions will be mistakes, as he was, after all, merely the lesser of two evils, but I can wait to see the effects of his decisions before I criticize him for causing those effects.  We'll have four years to talk about how bad Trump is, so there's no need to get ahead of ourselves.

       The idea is that the establishment has fractured and is now fighting each other. It's a war for either corporate globalism vs patriotism. Don't think Trump wasn't part of the establishment the other members of the team weren't part of the establishment also.

       I don't think appointing a GS is a dumb choice. I think him running his campaign on the phrase of "drain the swamp" and then literally bringing in the heads of company's that lobby hard and made "the swamp" into what it is is the joke itself. I have nothing against the individuals he appointed. I think Trump just made himself a giant hypocrite is all. Who needs to lobby when the most powerful men are going to be whispering in his ear anyways now.

       That would be preferable to putting active climate science deniers in charge of environmental agencies.

       Is this a joke? He's

       Of course not. But combatting climate change costs effort and money. Limiting carbon emissions, even if it is good for the entire planet, is a cost to the people who have to limit these emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is literally one of the main reasons why the government exists. To help balance your personal costs, which you care about, with the costs your actions have on everyone else or on the planet, which you personally might not care about as much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not doing this encourages you to act without regard for how your actions incur costs to everyone else, and if everyone does this it can be a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump doesn't want to heat the planet up to flood the world out of spite, but he does want to reduce costs to energy producers by making them not have to care about how their actions incur costs to the environment via global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not doing it with the purpose to further global warming. But his actions will, almost undoubtedly, further global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one wants to cause global warming. People do shit that causes it because doing so furthers their own interests.

       Right... so maybe people just made up "Global Warming" in the first place as a specter to throw money at... a way to funnel cash to further their own interests... think of it that way... and maybe Trump knows a few guys on the inside of all the nonsense that he trusts to tell him "Global Warming is money laundering bullshit." The NSA knows everything.

       Well, I'm saying that Global Warming probably is a bigger deal than you make it seem. I'm sure as hell not going to listen to someone who has no scientific background over all the scientists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, we should all act as if Global Warming is real (even if you don't believe so) since this is the only planet we have. Who in the right mind would oppose keeping the environment clean?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, you are acting as if everybody has an agenda except for Trump. You are saying that you are not protecting him, but every statement that goes against him you oppose strongly. I'm only judging him on the things he has done and said, and with that in mind I'm telling you that he's as bad as Clinton (although in a slightly different way).

       Who says a clean environment has anything to do with the temperature of the globe? Maybe certain kinds of pollution actually cool the planet... ya never know. I like it warm anyways... I'd guess the planet has always greatly fluctuated in temperature and the organisms on it just had to deal with it... adapt to survive.

       I'm sorry, but you sound like someone who has no idea about the subject but wants to discuss it. Preventing global warming is part of the bigger concept of keeping the environment clean. Global warming is one aspect of keeping the environment clean.

       'I like it warm anyways', this statement makes you look like an idiot, but I guess anything goes when protecting Trump.

       It's true that the temperature alway fluctuated on earth, but not in this short time span. It takes a great amount of time for the temperature to change significantly (if its happening naturally).

       So when everyone talks about "Global Warming" it is just a codeword that really means "Clean Environment"... why don't they just talk about pollution then? Why dance around the core issue? If I said I liked it cold you'd also say I was an idiot... Why you keep bring up Trump? Lets talk about "keeping the environment clean" and the benefits that conveys...

       No, not really. If somebody is talking about global warming, they are usually talking about global warming. If somebody is talking about keeping the environment clean, that includes (or should include) global warming too (since global warming occurs mainly because of pollution). It's not that hard to get. What I'm saying is that humanity should try its best to keep the environment clean (which also includes preventing global warming).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ofc I would say it, because that isn't an argument for or against preventing global warming. "We should save the tiger from extinction", "No, I don't like cats anyway". It's just stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because this is a post about Trump and in every comment I've seen from you you are trying to protect his policies/ideas. Keeping the environment clean should be common sense, not something that you do because you want to reap benefits. Right now, humanity is like a disease to this planet, slowly killing it. We should change that.

       Because I'm saying that we not only should stop global warming, but keep the environment clean. It's not that hard to get, is it? So just because humanity has always been a disease we should continue to do so? Also, it has never been as bad as it is now (which is logical, given the technologies we have now).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not whining. I saw you saying that we shouldn't call Trump a climate change denier because we don't exactly know, when Trump himself stated that he is a climate change denier on multiple occasions. His cabinet picks are also a spit to the face of the people that genuinely trusted him.

       I will admit that. We see it all the time. However, it's more like reverse bribery. Most scientists are NOT doing it for the $. A few may be in positions of great profit, but not most. If you wanted money and bribes you go into politics or medicine.

       Grants go to the people that are conducting research that is leading to establish the narrative the powers wish to push... You can be factually correct, and then have your research cherry picked to force an idea on the unwitting public... or even the government. If this stuff was so obvious to everyone we'd have no need for scientists to study it.

       It's funny that you are saying he's not a critical thinker when you are missing the point entirely. Yes, what he's doing is bad and this sub should call it out. OPs point is that if the same powers that be that we criticize are all criticizing Trump, that casts a shadow of doubt that Trump might actually be the hope we need that's going to fight the status quo. Ninjakicks point is that yeah he deserves to be criticized for his picks, but lets be honest, no matter who he picks he is going to continually be picked apart by the media and the populace as well. That's because he's been pushed for so long as someone we have to hate. Which takes us back to OPs point, that if the same powers that be that control us are telling us to hate Trump, maybe that's a sign he's what we need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you should try some of that critical thinking.  You can criticize Trump while not completely having your head up your ass.

       If the "powers that be" put out an article saying that being set on fire is bad, I'll set myself on fire as soon as possible because it's best to assume that anything in mainstream media is bullshit and works against my best interests, without even looking at it.

       So what you're saying is that there's no middle ground for suspicion or critical thought, we have to think exactly the way you do or else we are idiots, right? Grow the fuck up. Your hypocrisy is showing. Try some of that critical thinking and figure out why you are even arguing. So are we not supposed to be skeptical of mainstream media or are we supposed to completely trust it?

      <p>
       But you're not being skeptical of mainstream media. You're completely distrusting it, out of hand. Which is just as bad as completely trusting it out of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were skeptical of it and thought critically about it, you wouldn't say bullshit like the fact that they criticize Trump is inherently evidence that Trump's actions should not be criticized or that he's "what we need".

      <p>
       Being cynical is not being skeptical. And you've clearly confused the two.

       I'm glad you know exactly what I'm thinking in my head and know that I'm completely distrusting it instead of being skeptical. Maybe you should use those powers for good instead of just to talk shit on here.

       The only person here confused is you, really. Go back and read my comments. I laid it out clearly how I was skeptical of Trump and also skeptical of mainstream media. Learn to read and think critically.

       Yeah... I think the whole election was rigged in multiple directions... but in the end his side won the rigging... cause he really sold himself... He made people rally behind him enthusiastically... whilst HRCs side was halfheartedly endorsing her at best... The whole thing was so fucked that they are gonna brush the details under the rug for the sake of the nation... Trump won... end of story. No need for the details of every fucking country on the globe dicking with every facet of our beloved institution.

       I think everyone all around the globe had little probing tentacles all over this election... America is a dirty dirty pie from so many fingers being in it... in the end we'll never find out how rigged/unrigged this election was... if it was 100% legit Trump would have still won and thats what matters.

       The first source in the article is an NYT article written Dec. 13th which is mainly complaining that

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Under its chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, the giant oil company sidestepped Baghdad and Washington, signing a deal directly with the Kurdish administration in the country’s north. The move undermined Iraq’s central government, strengthened Kurdish independence ambitions and contravened the stated goals of the United States.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       While it may be helpful to the gov.'s foreign policy to have companies that fall in line, those companies are under no obligation to do so. As long as they are not side-stepping lawful sanctions, they are allowed to do whatever they want.

       Again, I'm not saying there's not anything here worth looking at.

       Not necessarily true. But it's certainly worth questioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I look at how the Founding Fathers laid the groundwork for the federal government, I get the impression that they never intended it to be a place of 'career politicians'. In other words, you would run for office, and once your term expired, go back to doing whatever else you want to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think one of the sources of the perceived disconnect between politicians and their constituents is that these guys get into office, go to D.C. and return once every couple of years to do a couple of campaign fundraisers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I support congressional term limits for that reason.

       Oh I'm sure there are plenty of people that stuck around DC for a while without being corrupt... but if you hold any position of value I'm sure someone somewhere makes sure they have "leverage" over you in case they ever need to use it... Thats why Trump and the FBI are working so closely... they are vetting every last little secret every candidate has... I'm sure some of these meetings in the Tower are literally Trump calling them out for past minor indiscretions the FBI has factually confirmed and seeing if they admit to it and ask for forgiveness... a chance to repent and be born again if the dirty deeds weren't too nasty.

       Some inconvenient facts about Steve Mnuchin, Trump's jewish secretary of the treasury:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Goldman Sachs partner (like his father)
       </li>
       <li>
        Member of Skull &amp; Bones
       </li>
       <li>
        Worked for Soros
       </li>
       <li>
        Zionist
       </li>
       <li>
        Hollywood propagandist
       </li>
      </ul>

       I guess the "good" thing is that he fits in well among the other crooks and swamp monsters in zionist Trump's "anti establishment" cabinet.

       Dude this game is all staged to get a result that they want. They want the people to think this way to give them a sense of some sort of feeling of control. When you are playing this game, you have no control, its all staged for them to continue an objective and they use the elections as a drama that the people fall for every single time. its a fucking epidemic that people are stupid enough not to see though this.

       No fucking shit, and speaking of idiots anybody that thinks their vote for a third party will anything sure looks like one. Its cliche, but its a 2 party system (in name only, its a one party corporate party) and the only thing that will change that is a coup, not sitting around kissing your own ass because you think voting for Gary Johnson gave you some imaginary moral high ground

       I'm not US-American, so I didn't vote. Nice try though. Also, the same ol' 'voting for a third party candidate won't change anything' argument. Well, no shit, but it's not about changing anything since your vote to the Reps or Dems won't change anything either. It's about showing that you aren't happy with the current system, if more people did this it MIGHT change something in the long run. Voting for establishment parties won't change anything for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       But nice logic you have there 'Voting for 3rd party candidates won't change anything. The establishment parties are run by corporations, and the system doesn't allow anything else than the two parties. Whelp, let's just vote for one of the two parties, which sure as hell won't change anything either.'

       you dont seem to understand that Trump
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       a third party candidate. He doesnt align with the policies of either side.

       Nobody knows what Trump's ideologies are. He is constantly contradicting himself and changing opinions daily. He already backtracked on a lot of his 'campaign promises'. His cabinet is full of establishment people, contradicting his statement of 'draining the swamp'.

       Where did I say I supported Hillary?
      </p>
      <p>
       For that matter: Where did I say I was eligible to vote? What makes you think I'm even a US citizen?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just a European bystander. And that's why I'll have to live with the consequences of US foreign policy (endless war) whether the Israel puppet is called Trump or Hillary (who's a close friend of Trump, and who benefited greatly from his donations). We Europeans get all the refugees from the wars Trump is gonna start on behalf of his puppet masters in Israel.
      </p>

       Would Hillary have been any better?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably not.

       Does that mean we can't criticize Trump in a conspiracy sub?

       Nope.

       Because Trump is not ideal, but Clinton's election would have destroyed the rule of law. Because Clinton has helped cause misery for millions upon millions of people here and abroad, and because with Trump instead of Clinton there might be a smidgen of a chance that we'll stop fucking around so much in the middle east instead of zero chance. Because I vote in a swing state.

       Reality is created by the choices we make. You refuse to take responsibility for these choices, which actually causes the actual problems in the first place. They have convinced you to be an employee of you own company. You have nobody else to blame but yourself. And that goes for the rest of you idiots that don't know how to act like a man by refusing to bend to popular oppinion and false media propaganda.

       Different people have different ideas about how to use what power they have to effect the changes they want. Their opinions being different from yours doesn't mean they're idiots. And striking up a conversation by calling me a fucking idiot isn't helpful to anyone.

       I thought we were done? You still talking out of your ass. You have nothing to say and nothing to contribute because you don't know who you really are. And that is proven fact by that you invest in a system that enslaves us. You're worse than useless, you actually think supporting government makes the world a better place. All you are doing is following orders programmed into you by society and the cultural engineers.

       I didn't report it because I value freedom of speech, and because I'm all too familiar with rules being enforced arbitrarily in order to censor speech. I'm surprised you didn't read the context to see whether this could be the reason my comment was reported.

       Because you don't like the people who are bashing him doesn't mean that you shouldn't do your research and make up your own opinion.  Having a knee jerk reaction like "MSM hates him, so I'll like him!" is exactly as bad as the people who are deceived by the MSM.

       I feel for American's who voted for Trump believing he'd be any different than other presidents. The sad fact is his reign will bring more of the same (look at what Barry Obama said he'd do in his campaign to what he did do). He marketed himself brilliantly to the disillusioned granted but he won't change shit.

       Because the very nature of this game is a polarization it's the content that polarizes, you want to talk about humans coming together without a centralized control system that's constructive  because we are in our power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to talk about a system that isnt in our power and is designed to control people isn't how you stop polarization. its not something that belongs to us. We shouldn't be involved in it in the first place.

       If presidents are chosen, then the message doesn't really matter and the people didn't fall for anything.  Personally, I see Obama's presidency as a marketing move on the establishment's part (at least initially) because, well.. black guy

       The one thing that he does different is his appearance. He plays at being a stupid man child, with his stupid tweets, short fuse, and small vocabulary. I speculate this is more of the same game you are talking about. He plays to the lowbrow voters, (which seems to have worked) by being relatable, despite his contempt for the poor.

       While the red blue game is rigged against us, as an illusion of choice, with both sides playing against us. I see a lot more catastrophic blows to the world as a whole with red team holding the flag. Climate change and less regulations on corporations, leading the charge.

       Really? Because all I see lately on this sub is a bunch of stupid fucks from /pol/ sucking his dick. Before this election this sub rarely had anything posted about partisan politics. Now it's basically 80% Pro Trump/Anti Hillary.

       Most of the users here see through the puppet show that the two party system has become. It's just a small vocal minority that has ruined what used to be a great sub.

       Does it matter what anyone is saying, whether the MSM or anonymous posters like myself?  Just look at Trump's cabinet picks.

       But every election year the politicians convince us to fight amongst ourselves over which nominee will get to whittle away our freedoms.  The great majority of us fall for it and actually believe, so we blame our fellow Americans for all the shitty things our rulers do, while the rulers get a free pass on everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our pseudo democracy is very efficient because it makes it seem like it's our fault things are going badly, we picked the wrong wealthy corporate servant to rule us.  Next time's Goldman Sachs candidates will be better.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the meantime we'll just keep being the libtards and conservatards, our scapegoats this cycle will be rednecks, immigrants, and trans people, pick which one you want to pretend ruined the country, depending on which flock you belong to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The important thing is you point your blame down, never up.  The powerless have been ruining things since the beginning.

       The media is bashing him because he makes it easy. He's said and done so many stupid things, so of course he's going to take heat for it. Blindly trusting media outlets is obviously bad, but so is blindly believing the opposite of everything they say.

if they tell me something once and that is it, its probably true.
if they repeatedly bash me over the head with it, they are probably trying to convince me to believe a lie.

       That's what the news does...they report on claims non-stop. I don't like it, but that's how it works. A part of this particular case was that it involved information that only the Bush administration was privy to. It's hard to debunk something when you don't have the means to investigate yourself until after the fact.

       it can also be both, i really don't like some of his picks, but at the same time were acting like he can roll in and just flip the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       hes got a republican majority everywhere hes got to fill the spots with some one and after that campaign does any one expect him to invite democrats in?
      </p>
      <p>
       politics is an influence peddling game, the appointments are always used to buy favours, to expect him to not be able to play that game is imo pretty silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think the media had their noses figuritivly rubbed in their own shit over the election so they are still just bitter and hate on him for that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       the reality is we have no idea what to expect from this guy, hes never held office, and hes been a media figure for longer than many of us have been alive, we won't know where he is steering the ship until at least 6 months in.

       Yeah I'm with you. It is completely obvious that our government serves Israel. I don't even see how that can be debated. You have politicians like Ted Cruz jumping at the chance to act publicly outraged over the UN's decision and cutting a funding to them.

       I thought Trump would keep his distance from Israel like Obama. I was hoping Zionists were losing some power in our government. That's not true though.

       we continue to allow the occupation because its an easy way to conduct human testing for all of these weapon systems. there is a reason the militarization of our police forces began when israel started conducting their counter terrorism training.

       I don't think he will change much of anything important. He'll act like a typical republican, cut taxes, increase spending, pro oil, etc. We don't know what he will do, Trump is very eratic and we haven't seen a president who's public image is as scary as Trumps.

       see i dunno, he isnt a republican is the thing, before this he had been a life long democrat.

       Trump plays to the crowd, so it pretty hard to say either way, the cabinet so far looks like yeah hes kissing the republicans rings pretty hardcore, erratic imho is a poor word. i dont think this is erratic at all i think it is all very very calculated, i just dont know the stuff behind the scenes to be able to fully understand the angle.

       You are correct... NSA tipped off the FBI and they rallied the Armed Forces... its beautiful... cause these are the same people that signed up for the job to protect human lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Justice is on the horizon... and it has next to nothing to do with Trump... they could have done this with anyone with a minimal number of strings to be snipped.

       That's correct, but it also appears to be the reason for Trump avoiding Intelligence Briefings, if you ask me. It would seem that he's not too trusting of the MI-Complex and prefers his own sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now depending on your perception of Trump's intelligence and rigor, that might be an admirable or a foolish decision, but I think it's too early for us to judge.
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems to be the crux of this whole debate to me. It's too early to judge one way or the other. Let's wait a few weeks to see what his cabinet is actually intending to achieve under his leadership and act according to their actions, not what we perceive their actions most likely to be.

       I don't know why I bothered reading half the comments. It's like I enjoy making myself suffer.

       Look you fucking lemmings, you wanna know what the black pill is? Look at this sub. Look at /pol/. Look at any forum that bothers discussing politics and history. They're either compromised or fighting for dear life to keep solidarity. You fuckers can't keep it cool and mitigate shilling and take action. Pizzagate was the best thing to happen for our ilk because it unified our folks while shining light on the most damning and sickening thing we can all rally against to expose.
      </p>
      <p>
       But lo and behold, now that pizzagate is dying down, everyone reverts back to being assblasted partisans. I can't believe there are people bitching about Trump over something as contentious as "climate change" while children are getting face fucked in some millionaires rape dungeon. Fuck you and your fucking libshit crocodile tears. There are children getting raped and smuggled around the world by very influential and connected people. I THINK THATS CONCERNING, DONT YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care that Trump picked some seedy shekel to be his treasurer or that were not getting our promises. What did you think was going to fucking happen. It's Washington politics -- a fugazi in of itself. What matters is that people quit being egotistical, be open to information, investigate, work together, and help bring justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, what's missing is the mindset of our great great grandparents. Coal miners, rail road workers, etc. Tough men and women who wouldn't think twice to incessantly protest and fight if they were double crossed by an authority figure. Virtually everyone bitches and goes back to jerking off and watching Netflix. It's a laughing stock.

       They only did that because they knew it would rally suckers like to support him. If they didn't want him to be in power, they would have ignored him instead of giving him so much publicity. Yes, most of it was negative. But it's still publicity. And you fell for it.

       I tend to think that it was more that Trump was old-school and just did the same song and dance that all politicians do, whereas Clinton outsourced support, which of course raised alarm bells in the hearts and minds of those who still rely on empathy to understand the world around them.

       My favorite parts of this are two tweets by Mr. Donald J. Trump after Obama's reelection in 2012:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He (
        <em>
         Obama
        </em>
        ) lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election.  We should have a revolution in this country!
       </p>
       <p>
        More votes equals a loss...revolution!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Interesting.  So, Mr. Trump, you feel the popular vote is more important than the electoral college?  Okie dokie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every politician is a liar, first, last, and always.  Bush is a liar.  Obama is a liar.  Trump is a liar.  Shillary is a liar.  The sooner you idiots that fell for his schtick realize this, the sooner we can get back to digging for the truth through the shit, piss, and muck that corporate media, the lobby groups, and our gov't shovel at us.  Until then, please stop acting like those who don't worship at the feet of the Cheeto king are somehow complicit with a conspiracy to deny a billionaire a public platform for the further profitability of his own and other billionaire's already bloated fortunes on the backs of the working class.

       They just want a strong-man daddy to throw his weight around. They'll post links and articles about how big banks crashed the market, then cockgobble a guy who has heads from those same institutions in high level positions of his cabinet. And it's still somehow Clinton's fault. Fuck Clinton AND Trump, and fuck whoever is just on one side.

       You are right, that they're on the same sides. Trump is hiring guys from institutions Hillary took huge amounts of money in speaking fees from. Ironically, one big smear against Clinton was her huge profits from lectures at these institutions, now that Trump is appointing them it's been swept over (like many other things from the campaign).

       Do you ever second guess the idea of favoring someone not because of who or what that person is, but because that person is being attacked by institutions?

       If Trump gets caught on something bad enough, this will be one of the first places I visit to check the climate.  I think with the PG allegations most people are in the least on the "At least he's not Hilary" train, not the "Trump is perfect" train.  If something about him is found, however, how many here will believe it if it originates in the MSM?  We've all burned by/burnt out on MSM for bias, etc.

       I agree. Clinton has so much dirt under the rug and dead bodies in the closet and in the cellar and in the back yard and in her foundation's back yard etc.. that she needs to pay the price. Her crimes and hypocrisies are current and relevant despite the poor snowflake losing the election. Bring her down now before she escapes with something lame like natural death.

       I like Trump because he's not a career politician. I like his cabinet because they're not career politicians. I like Trump because everyone in the mainstream media hates him. I like Trump because the Democrats hate him, I like Trump because the Republicans hate him. I like Trump because they blatantly lie about him to make more people hate him. I like Trump because he's rich and doesn't have to answer to anyone. I like Trump because he cannot be bought. I like Trump because he does not fuck children. I like Trump because he appointed a cabinet full of people who do not fuck children. I like Trump because he will call Hillary Clinton a criminal publicly and put her in jail. I like Trump because no one has any dirt on him to put him in jail. I like Trump because everyone tells me I should hate him. That's the mistake they made.

       What scares me most is it is subconscious attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are attempting to stir resentment within the human psyche; 
as if to call in on the lone wolves that need just enough to formulate an attack. Muslims; He is going to kick you out; Now he is hiring the bankers; (they did the initial slams via us media) then use the subliminal messaging to push people into a deep state of resentment;
If I were trump I'd send a decoy into the tower and literally vacation off radar until the 20th; Holding the inauguration in a non biased state like Ohio; This rise up movement appears to be the DNC Not my president movement; Rise up formerly being BLM Associated; Almost how ISIS was formed; It is truly as if they have segregated the weakest minds via fear tactics to call on them for support in the election; Now that they have lost they are attempting to use them as an army of dissidents against the Trump administration in its lead to take office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly Trump is a good dude; He is literally a top notch citizen and an amazing father; He holds american traditions and values up higher then prioritization and corporate agenda; Hes taken the wolves by their reigns, and insured that those that need to be on leashes are on the tightest of leashes he can muster. The saying is that you keep your friends close and your enemies closer is exactly what I see him doing; This isn't to go against the people; This is a tactic to hold those important to the people fully accountable for their future actions by forcing them to work for him;
      </p>
      <p>
       I see a smart chess player and an honorable man; I truly feel this is nothing more than a last minute run for freedom by the criminal as we know her HRC. Whose obviously abused her power as sec of state. Embarrassed herself and now our Nation in her federal investigation; While attempting every trick in the book to cheat us out of our choice in president; Going as far as blaming the results of her failed campaign on Russia itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like people wake the F up. If you destroyed evidence in a federal court case; You would be dog meat in a grinder; Used to feed pigs. 
If you possessed classified materials illegally and multiple documents at that you would be kissing your families good by for good measure; And had you funded a terrorist regime as they are now reporting; You would be walking to the gallows; Do not pass go; Do not collect 200 dollars; So is this the devil in Prada; Yes
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let someone else get away with what you couldn't. Your words are important; Instead of chanting not my president in some obviously pushed DNC narrative programming the masses to dissent against an american legacy and ICON. Why don't you take your real power and push for equality with a new message. Just three simple words; Which you all should know exactly what they mean in their entirety...
      </p>
      <p>
       LOCK..
      </p>
      <p>
       HER...
      </p>
      <p>
       UP!
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously guys. If reddit could do anything. We can repeat that on every forum and thread; And For once be proud that we did something for the history books; Something for our nation; and something for the world itself;
      </p>
      <p>
       Or be pawns of us media; Get a freaking patriot to take a knee and leave our country to the wolves; Because seriously if you don't open your eyes now; That is exactly what is going to happen...
      </p>
      <p>
       And special thanks to Putin for being a patient saint in this not falling for the games of the DNC and their b.s. narrative. 
I personally respect him more, based on his actions alone!

       Trump was definitely not part of the plan, and I'll gladly take him over the current establisment.  That said, he has done some seriously shady things over the years, and I think anybody who is expecting him to change America for the betterment of anybody but Trump is going tovbe sadly disappointed.  At least he's probably not a child murderer.

       Trump over Hillary any day. I voted Trump because the media, neocons, neoliberals, and establishment all hated him.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one thinks Trump will be a savior. We just know if Hillary was elected America would no longer exist. It's borders would be erased and it's sovereignty would be handed over to a world authority. . At least with Trump we will still have a country to try to fix in the future.

       The truth is we had a choice between a candidate that wanted to erase the borders and hand over the sovereignty of the country to a global entity, and a candidate that does not want to dismantle the country..
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a pretty simple choice, really.

       I have no control over who we get to choose from, but I do know that not participating accomplishes nothing. They will not magically say "look yellowsnow2 didn't even vote in our rigged election, we now must stop rigging elections"  That is a ridiculous fantasy.

       Its called divestment. BDS is working in Israel because people chose to stand against the enslavement of Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now you are saying that the people cant divest from there own corrupt institutions to stop criminal activity. I'm sorry but that is complete bullshit. You have a fucking choice. what you are doing is letting someone choice for you BY THINKING YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

       Why do you still call me names for having a different perspective than you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you keep telling me how to think?  First you tell me to remove myself from the game, basically don't vote. Hillary fanatics were saying that a lot on this sub during the elections. Then you say I have a choice and that I am letting someone choose for me by thinking I don't have a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your circular logic is not productive. I had a choice and I CHOSE TRUMP.  He was my choice. I liked what he said and how he looked at things. I disregarded all the propaganda and chose. It was a very easy choice with the criminal Hillary running against him.

       Did you know that in reality the president can't just launch a nuke for no reason?

       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_football">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_football
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If the president orders a nuclear launch, can anyone stop him?
       </p>
       <p>
        Presumably, by the time the POTUS got into that position, they gained the scruples not to launch a needless nuclear annihilation of another nation.  That said, there's a chain of command that involves the Secretary of Defense who could refuse to relay the order (his codes —or those of the Asst. Sec. Defense in his absence— are required to launch) and then quickly call the Cabinet and Congress to report that the POTUS had gone crazy. The Cabinet can declare the President unfit in a letter to Congress.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, there's a "must notify" part of the nuclear protocol that requires the DoD and whomever else inside the White House to notify senior leaders of the US government in the event of a nuclear launch.  These leaders would include (and presumably not be limited to), Speaker of the House, President Pro Temp of the Senate, Majority/Minority Leaders of both houses of Congress, the Chairperson of the various oversight committees that are tied to war (Appropriations, Defense, Intelligence, Energy).  The chain of command, that requires the Secretary of Defense and others to relay such an order is robust enough to handle such a statistically-impossible scenario of a "rogue president" ordering a launch.

       Trump is the best chance we've had in 50+ years. But it's cooler to be a contrarian than to support any politician so I get why the quick turn here against Trump. I'm giving him a chance.

       Because I'm saying that we not only should stop global warming, but keep the environment clean. It's not that hard to get, is it? So just because humanity has always been a disease we should continue to do so? Also, it has never been as bad as it is now (which is logical, given the technologies we have now).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not whining. I saw you saying that we shouldn't call Trump a climate change denier because we don't exactly know, when Trump himself stated that he is a climate change denier on multiple occasions. His cabinet picks are also a spit to the face of the people that genuinely trusted him.

       Did you know that in reality the president can't just launch a nuke for no reason?

       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_football">

       </a>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If the president orders a nuclear launch, can anyone stop him?
       </p>
       <p>
        Presumably, by the time the POTUS got into that position, they gained the scruples not to launch a needless nuclear annihilation of another nation.  That said, there's a chain of command that involves the Secretary of Defense who could refuse to relay the order (his codes —or those of the Asst. Sec. Defense in his absence— are required to launch) and then quickly call the Cabinet and Congress to report that the POTUS had gone crazy. The Cabinet can declare the President unfit in a letter to Congress.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, there's a "must notify" part of the nuclear protocol that requires the DoD and whomever else inside the White House to notify senior leaders of the US government in the event of a nuclear launch.  These leaders would include (and presumably not be limited to), Speaker of the House, President Pro Temp of the Senate, Majority/Minority Leaders of both houses of Congress, the Chairperson of the various oversight committees that are tied to war (Appropriations, Defense, Intelligence, Energy).  The chain of command, that requires the Secretary of Defense and others to relay such an order is robust enough to handle such a statistically-impossible scenario of a "rogue president" ordering a launch.

       They'll do whatever kind of mental gymnastics it takes to justify the shit Trump does. It's a joke. The guy is full of shit and it's really easy to see through if you aren't blind.
