        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems obvious to me that the UN&#39;s 2030 Agenda (Formally called Agenda 21)  is the blueprint to create a totalitarian world government. If that’s the case, to gauge the fight against the NWO, we just need to compare the state of the world with the goals of that document. </p>

<p>I do believe the year 2000 (Based onto Global 2000 report) was the initial objective date for the NWO. In failing to meet global objectives by y2k, 9/11 was a false flag to initiate extreme measures to accelerate progress.</p>

<p>I’ve detailed this thinking with reference links in a previous post:

    <div class="md"><p>Nice 9/11 post.. I&#39;ve been wanting to read into 9/11 more so that post is very helpful. </p>

<p>Do you think they are about to do another false flag on the 9/11 scale since their timeline is once against running behind bc of Trump? </p>

<p>I feel as all the hate pushed out by the MSM on Muslims is getting us ready for another false flag terrorist attack. 
But then again, Obamas truth of Syria is coming to surface so that might not work...</p>

<p>The elites are definitely in a corner right now and they won&#39;t just give up so anything is possible. 
But it looks to me, if Trump keeps his word... NWO/2030 will become extinct </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pray Trump keeps his word - the only alternative is bloody revolution after that.  Praying that his voters (myself included) stay on his ass.  I can&#39;t tell if the old order is actually intimidated by his administration or if it is just a show.

    <div class="md"><p>It need not be bloody (as it would be your brothers and sisters bleeding, not the elite), but it would need to be massively disruptive (think power grid, networks, hacks and leaks, information warfare), decisive and too fast to be controlled. That&#39;s where I see us headed anyway.</p>

<p>Forget the violent revolution, as there is no scenario where that could possibly work, even with a &quot;well-armed militia&quot;. I believe the threat of force and personal violence is necessary, but only if everything else fails, as it&#39;d be most improbable to succeed on its own.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my view anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the whole power grid deal (shutting down the PG fucks the public up just as well as the govt), we are already in an intense info war, and we have already had hacks and leaks.  I think the only way a revolution would work is with the cooperation of the military and law enforcement on the side of the public - otherwise, yeah we would be toast.  But we&#39;re toast regardless, so what does it matter</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why be so defeatist? I mean, of course, the odds have never been in our favor and even when they have, the popular momentum was simply co-opted and steered in another direction (occupy, etc.) but we&#39;ve never had so much information in our hands before; something the establishment tries desperately to obfuscate and control. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re toast at all, I firmly believe the old regime is, though. The only question to me is how bloody they will make their demise.</p>

<p>And as to police and military, I hold the same hopes as you do, but the handling of the NDAPL protests has shown that any hesitant police officer will simply be swapped for another who is ready to fight their brothers and sisters if commanded to. Still, if the uprising was big enough, we&#39;d likely see many of their ranks step down and join the other side.</p>

<p>And finally, I agree too, that we are already in the midst of information warfare, and I find it captivating how quickly things are moving right now. From Syria to high-level pedophilia, from the UN to the fed, there&#39;s lots coming to light and reaching thousands of ready listeners, and we&#39;re sure to reach a tipping point sooner rather than later. I just hope bloodshed can be avoided – if at all possible. We&#39;ll have the much stronger footing for a new beginning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dare I say, Trump is in a good position to facilitate the will of the people against the old order, especially given his military cabinet picks.  Alternatively, he could be our worst enemy if he is not working for our interests.  What is your opinion on Trump here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On him I&#39;m similarly divided. </p>

<p>It may well be that he&#39;s playing in the same old game as many here claim, but his cabinet picks are not yet proof enough for me of that fact. Their actions will proof one way or another.</p>

<p>I did find myself agreeing with much of his more underhanded rhetorik; not grab em by the pussy of course, but his insinuations like wanting to break up the fed, wanting to reduce the US&#39;s interventionist ideology, investing in infrastructure and energy production (even though I would prefer more emphasis on clean power, rather than back to coal), all stuff that will be good for the general population of the US and the world.</p>

<p>I also firmly believe he&#39;s in the know about much of what we know here. His early comments on 911, his 2012 tweet about child fuckers and how to deal with them, the fact he banned Epstein from one of his estates for hitting on a 14 year old, there&#39;s lots that seems genuine that I firmly agree with. </p>

<p>I still think he&#39;s played many of his followers a fair bit, as he did in his reality TV shows with his audience, giving them controversy, edgy statements, all that jazz. He undeniably knows how to cater to the masses, which just happens to necessitate a rather unsophisticated language and rhetoric. He certainly played a good game so far.</p>

<p>But again, he could long have been in somebody else&#39;s pocket, who knows. It would certainly make it easier to explain his miraculous victory against Hillary Fucking Clinton and her entire corrupted establishment ilk. If he was just another Soros asset, it was a brilliant swindle for sure. I won&#39;t put it past them though.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, what do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t join reddit until around Octoberish, and it was because I stumbled across The_Donald.  I knew I hated Clinton, and it was refreshing to see a coalition of people who were supporting Trump and exposing the system; as opposed to the media and establishment one sided swamp story that I was hearing/seeing day in and day out that was destroying Trump .  I really liked Trump and believed a lot of what he said leading up to the election.</p>

<p>Coming on r/conspiracy about a month or so ago opened my eyes to the world a lot.  I&#39;ve begun asking questions and seeking motives more than ever before in regards to how the world really operates.  It definitely made me question Trump harder; but ultimately, he seems to be too big of an enigma for me to nail down at this point in time.</p>

<p>These are some of the alternatives that I derived from the situation on what I expect will happen, and I think that they directly relate to how he was &#39;enabled&#39; to be elected, too:</p>

<p>Least likely, in my opinion: I keep seeing the theory that Hillary&#39;s whole campaign was actually a ploy to push the country towards Trump (Trump being totally corrupt and part of the HRC/Obama system).  I think this theory is ridiculous- there would have been much better, cheaper and more efficient ways to sell this method that would also trick the public into trusting the &#39;system&#39; again (i.e. Fake &#39;incarceration&#39; of HRC to make the people think she is thwarted, followed by media and establishment increase in positive mention about Trump).</p>

<p>Next lowest likely scenario: what you see is what you get.  Trump is literally just a billionaire who saw his country fledgling and he literally intends to do everything he said he would do.  I believed in this at first during the election - but now, when I take a step back, I realize this is probably terribly naive.  Despite Trump being a billionaire, he is still a small fish in a big pond in regards to finance.  If people wanted him gone, and he didn&#39;t have a system of channels in place to defend himself and his family, they would have done so in attempt to protect the old order.</p>

<p>Third to least likely - both HRC and DT are establishment, Hillary is preferred, but whatever happens, happens.  This alternative seems like it would be the most likely one, but there is one major problem I have with it.  If they &#39;didn&#39;t care&#39; about Trump being elected because he still represents the old order, then they TOTALLY fucked up.  They fucked up, because they based Trump&#39;s campaign on the roots of &#39;awakening&#39;.  Basically, Trump&#39;s campaign was a sort of catalyst for the public to realize how badly they are being fucked in the ass by the establishment.  The system got exposed with Sanders / wikileaks, DNC looks terrible, HRC looks awful, media took a huge hit in any hope of being trusted or relied on to deliver honest/unbiased agenda driven news, and even the people who supported hrc lost a lot of hope in the system.  Honestly- if this alternative is the true case, it doesn&#39;t even matter; because they created a major wave of awakening in the public, which is devastating in the long run for them.</p>

<p>This brings me to faction theories - Trump is sort of the tip of a spear that is comprised of intelligence and corporate elitist bodies.  This means that Trump is still ingrained in the establishment, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that he is an enemy of the public (however, I think it does make him an enemy of the Clintons/Obamas, regardless).  </p>

<p>Trump could be part of a different &#39;evil&#39; faction from HRC, which is basically trying to topple the Clinton/Obama faction and enact their own form of oppression over the people and the world.  Alternatively- Trump could be the spearhead of a &#39;good&#39; intelligence/corporate faction that actually sees the recklessness of the old order and is trying to correct the trajectory that we are on (at least, influence it positively).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, like you said, there doesn&#39;t seem to be enough to make a conclusive decision.  If it is a faction thing, whether good or evil, it would totally explain why the media and current establishment are thrashing him, since he is trying to topple them.  Similarly, his cabinet picks could be the best or worst people for the job.  And lastly, his policies sound good on paper, and compared to HRC/Obama, they are divine- but its too soon to tell if he was just telling us what we needed to hear, only to be manipulated later.</p>

<p>My gut tells me that he is part of a mostly &#39;good&#39; faction (they aren&#39;t perfect by any means).  I really don&#39;t have any concrete evidence.  But I think that if he was an &#39;evil opposing faction&#39;, then the HRC/Obama crew would have done a better job about exposing his lies or his cabinet - but really, they haven&#39;t offered anything better or more substantiated than your typical conspiracy theorist on here - I think worst case is that he is unpredictable.  The left can&#39;t 100% figure out what he is going to do with them, and the public can&#39;t determine if he will fuck us.  I believe the answer is somewhere in the middle of all of that, but leaning more towards the &#39;good&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wholeheartedly agree with that. On all points. I find the theory of factions, evil as well as good fascinating too. At least a subset of the US&#39;s founding fathers arguably would have been a secretive faction, with pure and democratic intent I suppose. Though I&#39;m not an American, so I wouldn&#39;t say I know too much about that. It seems to me though that the American Project started out as an attempt away from general ignorance and towards general enlightenment, but not everybody was always fully on board with that plan. That some factions (even globally speaking) prefer a system of masters and slaves, while others believed it was possible to be King among a people of kings.</p>

<p>Have you read the High Level Insider threads by any chance? Not that I&#39;m fully convinced he&#39;s legit, but I find his perspective extremely insightful, as well as hopeful, that there still powerful people out there that think it in their best self-interest to see the rest of us thrive along with them. It struck me as a logically consistent, compelling and a much less gloomy view of the world, and I think you&#39;d find it as fascinating as I have, true or not.</p>

<p>And one last point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite Trump being a billionaire, he is still a small fish in a big pond in regards to finance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think finance is actually less his issue, after all, he strives to simplify how money and taxes work – at least that&#39;s the impression I got – but his bigger issue is that he is totally new to this level of power, to the fact that people are at this moment undoubtedly putting together contingency plans to get rid of him should he refuse to play along, and that he will have to come up with plans to prevent being JFK&#39;d. That the Fed can strangle or crash the economy at any point in time and blame Trump for the downturn. These kinds of things are new to the Donald (not even mentioning the alien files and all that shit), and I&#39;m very interested to see how he handles them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read every single one of the high level insider threads.  Can&#39;t tell if they are a LARP or not - but regardless, they inspired me and elevated my thinking/perspective on this topic.  Before I read those, I was literally mentally roadblocked at the &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; stage.  As you probably noticed, my little presumptions were pretty much based on what the HLI said - but I feel a little more confidently that the new administration is making a positive push; as opposed to the HLI who basically claimed that Trump was establishment and friendly to HRC/Obama; however, he is unpredictable and may actually listen to the public, but he is not our Jesus Christ savior.</p>

<p>Right or wrong - its good to be looking at this situation from new complex angles, rather than just &#39;left&#39; and &#39;right&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is noooo ~<em>~<sup>~anti-Christ~</sup></em>~*~ Its a metaphor for everything that is the opposite of Christ. Raping little boys for example. </p>

<p>The Bible and especially Revelations has been the elites weapon for centuries. Just another scam keep us peasants under their thumbs and separate from God. Creating a middle-man and rule book. </p>

<p>Revelations is NOT a prophecy. It&#39;s a playbook. If it were to even happen it wouldn&#39;t be because of prophecy. It would be because of memetics. When enough people believe in something it can manifest. Collective thought is very powerful. </p>

<p>If Jesus DID exist, it seems like he tried his hardest to trick people into giving up their devotion to evil ideologies. Just to have his message spun on its head and have it be used as a tool of oppression. </p>

<p>Just keep in mind, that evil Vatican you mentioned.. Are the ones who picked what stories went into the bible, and they&#39;re the ones who edited the original canon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth theory was revived by a mason, so I think it&#39;s bullshit. I believe Agenda 2030 is bullshit. </p>

<p>I think a lot of conspiracies are created by disinformation agent to scare the population and make us feel hopeless. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let the bible being bullshit take away your hope. That doesn&#39;t effect the existence of God. If evil exists, so does its counterpart </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also idk if I believe in the shape shifting in a literal sense. </p>

<p>Also, I think the whole celebrity cloning is also bullshit. Mainly because, there are way too many celebrities who talk about it. If it was legit they&#39;d be kept silent. I think MKUltra does exist, to an extent but, I think it&#39;s mostly blackmail. Recordings of the sick shit they do in rituals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking that the other night. If they believe so much in Satan then the opposite has to exist too. </p>

<p>There is so much evil in this world. More then I ever knew of and it&#39;s so in our face. I just can&#39;t comprehend their purpose of spreading so much evil. The worst mistake ever made in history is letting these elites take control of our planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been like this since the beginning. Kings, The Church and other tyrants ruling over the peasants. Their evil shit does two things, it makes them feel powerful, and it makes us scared to go outside. Were easier to control if we&#39;re scared and feel hopeless.</p>

<p>I think I told you this yesterday but, look into memetics and the REAL occult.

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the whole power grid deal (shutting down the PG fucks the public up just as well as the govt), we are already in an intense info war, and we have already had hacks and leaks.  I think the only way a revolution would work is with the cooperation of the military and law enforcement on the side of the public - otherwise, yeah we would be toast.
