       The subversion and infiltration on this site is all over. I'm getting down votes in this sub alot for talking about marxism and Clintons scandals. I'm getting snark and such dismissive attitudes. I hadn't experienced this before the election.

       is ground zero for information dissemination. It will be more subtle here, no brigading bots and downvote parties, it will be the introduction of doubt and uncertainty as the enemies of truth are hoping to play on paranoid nature of people who have seen beyond social conditioning and are loathe to trust anything they encounter as a result.

       they may not watch foxnews but they do talk about it for example have you ever gone to dailykos, one of the top dem websites, well it used to be anyway, it has lost viewers due to only talking about how bad and evil republicans are. Thru internet is how younger people that are mostly liberal get news and they did keep track of foxnews lies.

       There's neocons and then theres conservatives. Hillary might be a neo-con. Neocons are conservatives with Marxist sympathies. Most neocons were former Democrats that were politically active in the 60s and 70s.

       "The ends justify the means" is a mantra for marxists. Meaning they will lie about political allegences. They will say whatever or do whatever with the only conviction and creed being the gaining of power. Regardless of what ends they want, the means are always justified to these people. The truth is intentions do not matter, it's the consequences. Marxists believe their intentions take superiority and if the means are evil ultimately the good end will outweigh it.

       Hillary refers to this as "making hard choices" "tough decisions". They basically are telling people we need to do immoral things and because I have no conscience I'm going to look at it with cold hard logic. A machine and sociopaths operate off of logic. A human being with a sense of morals uses reason and compassion.

       They are Marxists insofar that it serves their interest. She probably doesn't give a shit about utopian visions but Marx's ideas along with subsequent followers who branched off his philosophy, are using his ideas. The main book of tactics they utilize is Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky. Clinton also did her dissertation on Alinsky and Marx.

       When I think of a capitalist I think of someone who does actual business and trade. Not a opportunistic politician that extorts, bribes and kills her way to the top. Just because she is rich doesn't make her a capitalist. Also capitalism is not an ideology, it's simply a description of trade and property. It's an "ism" but not a ideological "ism." Capitalism is a natural process, even in places where capitalism is made illegal black markets still pop up like in North Korea.

I don't believe capitalism is a natural process.  Individualism rampant in western culture makes it seem natural.

       Animals constantly trade and create mutually beneficial relationships. Trade is seen outside of humanity. Trade is how species coexist. When they can't, they fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bastiat's The Law says when trade ceases warfare begins. Trade is the natural process, just like evolution, for a organism to coalesce with the enviroment.
I could see Hillary being fascist which isn't a far offshoot from neo-con. By the way I subscribe to the horseshoe theory of politics. Marxism and fascism are extremes and they aren't much different from one another and eventually either way devolves into an authoritarian dictatorship.
If you still see the political positions on a straight line of left/right you'll probably think I'm an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Trumps time with the reform party. He has been saying the same things for years. He isn't a fascist. Shit he was working with Jesse Ventura for a while in the political world. Also how hard is it for a candidate to talk positively about helping businesses and not sound "corporatist"? See the thing is Trump doesn't advocate to hold one business up over another. Corporatism picks winners and losers. Trump wants to create a economic enviroment that encourages businesses to prosper this is just good governance. The rhetoric of these two positions can almost sound exactly the same, but it's a world of difference in terms of consequences.

       I'm unaware of animals that trade.  What would some examples of this?
Beneficial relationships and communal living, sure.  But, trade?
Working w Jesse Ventura is a waste of time.  That's just pandering to his base.  I don't see him or his cabins picks to be objective towards businesses but hopefully I'm wrong.

       It's hilarious if you ever post about pizzagate the responses you get. I always dismissed the whole shill thing but now it's almost too obvious. If you ever actually try to converse with these people they will resort to insults. They never back up their claims and if you corner them on any point they deflect and insult.

       So... T_D is not an American sub.  Anyone who thought so is, ironically, a "cuck" of sorts.  In other words, they're being used.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an international right-wing/nationalist movement and it exists in T_D, uncensorednews, altright, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's counterintuitive, but they are heavily supportive of Israel, at least in its current form.  Israel is the enemy of their enemy (Muslims) and Netanyahu is a right-wing Jewish nationalist.  They have a LOT in common.

       Israel is a heavily right-wing country in terms of their politicians.  They depend on right-wing America for their existence.  Everyone thinks it's liberals because Jews tend to be socially liberal.  Their international politics, however, are hardcore right-wing and isolationist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right-wing/nationalist dream to "glass" the Middle East hinges on the existence of a strong and resistant Israel.

       The Donald is no longer relevant and has been taken over by agitators/trolls since the election.  These agitators try to fulfill the exaggerated stereotypes that liberals want to portray Trump supporters as.

       This post from December 2015 contradicts that. In fact they say they are more underground than ever and "don't feel the need to update their online presence anymore" implying they want people to forget they exist.

       Yeah, I wouldn't trust anything this users spreads around here, just check their history. It's pretty common sense that JIDF has only been pushing more as the years move forward, despite not being in the immediate public's eye.

       There are plenty of Israeli/Jewish "Public Diplomacy" operations (aka Hasbara) that are far more active and populous. Continuously citing "JIDF" only runs misdirection for the real Israel shills.

       I think it's unrealistic to, for example, think that Nazism is dead because they were defeated in WWII.  We know they had contingency plans for a 4th Reich.  To think that Soviet communism is dead, or any of these other failed ideologies.
      </p>

       It's even easier to rebrand little internet groups like the JIDF.

       Indeed. I even have a "woke" family member (he's very anti-Israel and he's been a 9/11 truther and general conspiracy theorist for more than a decade). But to this day, for some reason, he's a fervent Trump supporter. I really don't get it. None of Trump's cabinet picks or statements on Israel, mean anything to him. He just ignores all of it. The level of cognitive dissonance is insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aren't Americans either, so we have nothing to gain if Trump actually deports immigrants and "makes America great again". Quite the opposite.

       The whole (((alt-right))) is just one big limited hangout engineered counterculture. It's just sad because these are still my type of people, like... I'd prefer a Trump supporter to a Bernie/Hillary supporter any day. Trumps bombastic attitude/rejection of political correctness wooed crowds and they fell for the "media is against Trump" meme or the "he's funding himself so he isn't subservient to any special interests"
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of these guys are still red-blooded American men who are sick of PC culture/ liberal tyrants encroaching on their lives but unfortunately, they fell for the Jews Trojan horse. It's not their fault, and you can't blame them for it either.

       If someone is legitimately a threat to the establishment then they will just ignore that person like they did to Ron Paul. The media whining about Trump just helped Trump immensely because the MSM knows that no one trusts them. It's like reverse psychology for them to pretend like they detest Trump, they know exactly what they are doing.

       They are Marxists insofar that it serves their interest. She probably doesn't give a shit about utopian visions but Marx's ideas along with subsequent followers who branched off his philosophy, are using his ideas. The main book of tactics they utilize is Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky. Clinton also did her dissertation on Alinsky and Marx.

       When I think of a capitalist I think of someone who does actual business and trade. Not a opportunistic politician that extorts, bribes and kills her way to the top. Just because she is rich doesn't make her a capitalist. Also capitalism is not an ideology, it's simply a description of trade and property. It's an "ism" but not a ideological "ism." Capitalism is a natural process, even in places where capitalism is made illegal black markets still pop up like in North Korea.
