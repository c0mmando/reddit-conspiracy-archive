<p>The conspiracy is regular truthseekers will fall for the psyop, and create a didvide and conquer scenario, which is happening here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given the Wikileaks mails, I actually believe, that Hillary wanted to run as the underdog (that&#39;s why Bernie got rigged out at the primaries) and for some reason she&#39;d never expected Trump to win (who actually did?). Thus I&#39;m not saying that he&#39;s anti-establishment but really that something went terribly wrong. They even rigged the election towards Clinton but the people are probably just so desperate for a change. Whatever it might be.</p>

<p>I could tell trump was going to win just by how the media was presenting him. And after all the wikileaks releases, it was a slam dunk for him.
When hillary won the primary, they basically handed trump the election on a silver platter. 
Hillary had way too much baggage to even have a chance. Plus every 8 years is a party switch.</p>

<p>Is this what you feel? Or do you have any proof of it? </p>

<p>I honestly feel Trump&#39;s victory is not due to the Loominutty so much as the internet and alternative media. Without presence of wikileaks (in b4 &quot;wikileakz=CIA!) and non-MSM voices doing the research and raising alarms, it would have been easier for the MSM to railroad that dirty cunt through to office.</p>

<p>Honestly, I was expecting a third term for Obama after Killary was either indicted through more leaks, or just plain died from her illness. That was a path to war, dictatorship, martial law. So much so I didnt vote Trump.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a real danger in thinking that &quot;the hidden hand&quot;s control is omnipotent. What we have now is potential. Exciting times to be alive, for sure.</p>

<p>What happened to this illness, btw? For months news was replete with her seizures, word garbles, the man identified as a doctor and and the diazepam pen, but I have seen nothing of this since a couple weeks prior to the election.

<p>First of all, there isn&#39;t any divide and conquer scenario here.  The users creating any divide are users that don&#39;t subscribe to this sub.  These users come from other subs to try and disrupt things, like those assholes at /conspiritard.  </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists have historically been what most  would consider right-wing. Bill Cooper was a christian conservative, so is Alex Jones. They havent &quot;swayed&quot; really. </p>

<p>I used to be pretty left before I ran in to conspiracy. It was the only time I actually listened to what small gov&#39;t advocates had to say. A short perusal of the history of both left/right totalitarianism reveals that any over-reaching state power is bound to abuse said power to prop up an elite class. The leftist ones are also much more insidious, which is why they tend to be much more stable and longer lasting.</p>

<p>I would bet most people fall in to a socially liberal, politically conservative part of the spectrum. </p>

And if Donald Trump was a career politician, I would actually be certain of it, I would not have voted for him, and I would not have supported him.

<p>Keep in mind that we all have different desires. Whilst workers like you and I may live lives that would be changed with greater amounts of monetary wealth, those who have monetary wealth seek other things. What Donald Trump may seek, or rather what he may require as payment for his participation in The Game (<em>I lost the game</em>), I cannot tell you. I don&#39;t support the man or any others seeking office for that matter, but I am willing one day to be pleasantly surprised if Donald Trump emerges as a <strong>TRUE</strong> threat to TPTB and uses his office for moral good.</p>

I personally can&#39;t think of any good reasons for a lavish billionaire to step into politics (although people claim he thirsts power). Him appointing rex tillerson as Secretary of State tells me that we will potentially have some oil deals with russia, and trump really is trying to crush china for meddling with their Yuan while selling our dollar holdings. He is very very pro-israel and that is kind of a red flag as far as NWO goes, but i&#39;m still crossing my fingers.</p>

<p>The blog is an interesting conjecture and covers many points I&#39;ve mentioned over the years about the hardening of U.S. martial law and the ultimate road to a global military conflict. My concern with it (keeping in mind it is just conjecture and theorizing) is that all the supportive links are also on blogs with little to no factual sources. Not downplaying logical thinking and forming reasonable patterns bears no weight.</p>

<p>He has been cheating the government for years on his taxes. &quot;Imagine what he will do for us working class people.&quot;- coworker. He&#39;s going to make it so the rich don&#39;t pay taxes and the working class remains the working class so he doesn&#39;t have to get his hands dirty. </p>

<p>Trump is not actually going to make any decisions. Everyone he has appointed are a bunch self serving dicks. Really head of EPA guy denies climate change is an actual thing? Education lady has never been in education. Literal rothschilds and Soros boys. </p>

<p>After the election he said he was just making shit up so he could be president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Early Edit: Donald Trump never said he was &quot;just making shit up to be president&quot; as was proved below when you follow this conversation. That was a very misleading thing to say.</p>

<p>Do you have him on video saying that he was making shit up to be president? Because that certainly sounds to me like a false accusation. I follow every word the man says and I certainly have never heard him say that at all. So if you could provide a video link to him saying that he was making shit up just to be president, everything else you said we&#39;ll have a lot more credibility with me.

    <div class="md"><p>Your compilation is very misleading.  And it is purposely cut up and intended to make him look like a liar on those instances. Although I&#39;m not buying it and here&#39;s why. Paul Ryan? There&#39;s no need to pick on him because he won. But he clearly stated that if Paul Ryan steps out of line he will stop being nice. The rigged election? Well it obviously wasn&#39;t right because he won. I felt the same way. Actually, the recount proved that there was some election fraud going on, it just wasn&#39;t enough to overcome the voter turnout that caused Trump to win the presidency. Lock her up? That one&#39;s debatable, but it&#39;s very obvious as of right now that there are other people in Washington trying to press some charges on Hillary. Reopening the email case and what not. Trump just not leading the charge because he&#39;s not trying to add to the separation that our country is going through, he&#39;s trying to unite everyone like a good president. Something Obama and Hillary should have done by asking people to stop protesting and stop rioting and to support our new president elect. And drain the swamp? I heard him say he didn&#39;t like the buzzword drain the swamp. I heard him say he thought the term was hokey. But I certainly didn&#39;t hear him say that he&#39;s OK with the corruption. So again, your edited video would be great for the average person, but not for someone who knows how to read between the lines. I do appreciate your effort though. And if you wanted to post that drain the swamp comment unedited within the confines of the speech that he gave, I would be very interested to hear what he said slightly before and slightly after because I can guarantee you it would confirm that he is planning on draining the swamp. And that concludes my analysis of your biased, edited video. But the truth will be told when he gets into office. I&#39;m not one who thinks that he can do no wrong, but I am one who will give him every opportunity to do right before I judge him. </p>

<p>Drain the swamp unedited: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=pL9pfoux-5s">https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=pL9pfoux-5s</a>  </p>

<p>Edit: it must be frustrating trying to exchange factual information with someone who actually does their own research and doesn&#39;t just accept what they&#39;re told is true? It may lead someone to believe that you&#39;re attempting to mislead the people. It&#39;s very unfortunate. From now on, you should always post unedited videos as truth and maybe refrain from posting someone else&#39;s little compilation video that&#39;s clearly intended to mislead people. Very dishonest by him. And I&#39;m not sure if you were being dishonest to me, or you were misled by his video as well.</p>

I&#39;m going to edit my previous statement so it is less aggressive and I personally apologize to you. </p>

<p>Edit: as I re-read my previous comment, I was hard-pressed to find any opinions other than my feelings that President Obama and Hillary Clinton should tell the American people to get behind president Trump and unite our country instead of consistently trying to divide it. Everything else I stated was factual. And if I&#39;m pressed to do so, I have no problem providing additional indisputable evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason there are so many Donald Trump supporters here discussing conspiracy theories is because Hillary Clinton and her supporters, really most of the country who did not listen to what Donald Trump was saying, are the people who fall for everything that the News tells them. They&#39;re the people who don&#39;t think for themselves, and don&#39;t think outside of the box. Donald Trump legitimately ran his campaign on a &quot;the government is corrupt and lying to you&quot; platform. So the majority of trump supporters are people who know about most of the corruption, and the people who are trying to paint Trump conspiracies are doing so based on the mainstream media putting the idea into your head that Trump is this evil terrible person. Or CTR of course. </p>

And obviously he&#39;s a ruthless businessman pushing for tax cuts and business stimulus, so the all powerful big business/corporations will have slightly more power than they did under Obama. I don&#39;t really buy into the Russian hacking conspiracy, but if it were true, I think they&#39;re real motive would NOT be to put a puppet into office, but instead put in somebody with a high chance of destroying the US. Anyway, don&#39;t forget that with this election both candidates were extremely unpopular, and it&#39;s a shame that one of them had to win. Although it has been fun watching the world burn.</p>

I think that all of his cabinet picks are a way for him to thank his big donors and/or established republicans telling him who to pick so he can keep playing. Not sure about the Russian hacks, from what I&#39;ve read it&#39;s most likely leaks from a point source in the DNC but if it was the Russians than I could see them wanting trump in power because of his incompetence, lack of political experience and his malleability, pay the guy a sentence long complement and he&#39;s on his knees ripping at your belt.
