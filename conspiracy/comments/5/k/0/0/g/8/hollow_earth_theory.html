    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d believe in hollow earth with entrances at the pole(s) well before I&#39;d ever believe in flat earth. 
But I&#39;m more prone to believe that there are undersea or underground beings and possibly civilizations we have only encountered rarely or, in the case of government, secretly.
I imagine that there&#39;s a lot more to the ocean floor than we&#39;re told, and I figure anything down there is older and possibly more advanced. Maybe it&#39;s just a great place to hide an alien base, or maybe what we think of as aliens are just humanoid sea life.</p>

<p>As for underground life, my assumption is they are more feral, more tribal than we are. Subterranean pockets of life, possibly tunneling very deep- but not necessarily a fully hollow earth. Yeah you see that a lot in sci fi: the Fulmer in Skyrim, the creatures in The Descent, the Time Machine etc but it makes more sense biologically. Maybe at some point some ancient humans went underground, got lost or trapped and survived and inbred into albino savages- or just maybe we&#39;re descended from some underground race that made it to the surface and stayed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After years of research, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that humans, as we are now, were very advanced in the ancient past (+12,000 years ago).  We (or our elites, at least) developed underground and underwater bases which (most of) survived the cataclysms.  The inhabitants of which are the occupants (or controllers) of the craft we think are ET.  They&#39;ve been the &quot;gods&quot; of ancient cultures, coming up from below ground/water to replenish the Earth (or what was left of it) after they and/or nature destroyed it.  They (the ancient, but advanced human civilization) are responsible for the worldwide pyramids and other megaliths beyond the academic and technological grasp of mere tribes/early civilizations (as we&#39;re told of them.)  Perhaps, they&#39;re the &quot;hidden hand&quot; which is directing earth dwellers&#39; development until a point which is near or equal to what was lost.  Maybe they&#39;ll never come out to rule directly.  Why would they, other than ego?  I could be wrong, admittedly, but this is where my research has led me.  I hope it rings a few bells within whoever reads this.</p>
