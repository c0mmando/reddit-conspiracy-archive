       I'd believe in hollow earth with entrances at the pole(s) well before I'd ever believe in flat earth. 
But I'm more prone to believe that there are undersea or underground beings and possibly civilizations we have only encountered rarely or, in the case of government, secretly.
I imagine that there's a lot more to the ocean floor than we're told, and I figure anything down there is older and possibly more advanced. Maybe it's just a great place to hide an alien base, or maybe what we think of as aliens are just humanoid sea life.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for underground life, my assumption is they are more feral, more tribal than we are. Subterranean pockets of life, possibly tunneling very deep- but not necessarily a fully hollow earth. Yeah you see that a lot in sci fi: the Fulmer in Skyrim, the creatures in The Descent, the Time Machine etc but it makes more sense biologically. Maybe at some point some ancient humans went underground, got lost or trapped and survived and inbred into albino savages- or just maybe we're descended from some underground race that made it to the surface and stayed.

       After years of research, I've come to the conclusion that humans, as we are now, were very advanced in the ancient past (+12,000 years ago).  We (or our elites, at least) developed underground and underwater bases which (most of) survived the cataclysms.  The inhabitants of which are the occupants (or controllers) of the craft we think are ET.  They've been the "gods" of ancient cultures, coming up from below ground/water to replenish the Earth (or what was left of it) after they and/or nature destroyed it.  They (the ancient, but advanced human civilization) are responsible for the worldwide pyramids and other megaliths beyond the academic and technological grasp of mere tribes/early civilizations (as we're told of them.)  Perhaps, they're the "hidden hand" which is directing earth dwellers' development until a point which is near or equal to what was lost.  Maybe they'll never come out to rule directly.  Why would they, other than ego?  I could be wrong, admittedly, but this is where my research has led me.  I hope it rings a few bells within whoever reads this.

       Something is strange, that's for sure. What I don't know. Something is there. People say you can go hire a plane, trek around, go on a tour, but no one seems to go too deep. Was Byrd a disinformation agent? Could have been some weird psychop on Russia.

       Most of the life down there exists by feeding on dead things from up above. A dead whale feeds some things which get eaten by other things, but it originally comes from the surface.

       There are a small number of tube worms that exist via chemosynthasis, but they really don't make up a functioning ecosystem.

       That's not really true. There are plenty of ecosystems out there that are devoid of sunlight and are independent of decaying materials as a food source. The truth of the matter is that the more we search for life in places we don't expect it we still find life.

       Oh, and did you know it has more pressure that deep than there is in space? I could imagine Nebulas being vast eco-systems.

       There is an entire ecosystem at the bottom of the sea where there is zero light penetration. At mid ocean rifts, there are tubules that feed off of the gasses the way plants do on the surface. They lay the groundwork for other organisms to exist.

       Not arguing the case for underground life (or against) just saying that its possible to have life without sunlight, even on our own planet.

       It's actually the most important ecosystem in the entire world. What happens there is called the Antarctic Convergence. The nutrients created there support a very large population of phytoplankton. No suAn entire food chain goes straight from there. The nutrients will flow on the super slow, ultra deep currents off the shelf and be carried around the entire planet over the course of a hundred years.

       So deepest ever trilled hole is about 12km. No entries known, no underground lifeforms discovered. How would you life underground w/o sunlight, oxygen and food? I think it's a pretty unsustainable theory.

       Just playing devils advocate, how wide was the hole? Scaled for size, Would it be like sticking an atom-thick needle just a few millimeters into an orange and claiming seeds don't exist because you didn't hit one?
