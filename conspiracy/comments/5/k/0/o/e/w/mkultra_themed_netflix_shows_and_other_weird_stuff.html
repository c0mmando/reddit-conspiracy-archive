        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Stranger Things is an obvious one because it literally mentions Mk-ultra by name and the little girl was being experimented on in sensory deprivation tanks, but Winona Ryder, the mother of one of the main characters was the God daughter of the infamous TIMOTHY LEARY who was played a huge role not only in MKULTRA experiments but also popularizing the use of psychedelic drugs to the masses. His popular mantra of &quot;Turn on, Tune in, Drop out&quot; was the perfect subversion psyop to socially engineer an entire generation. The whole counterculture of the 1960&#39;s was nothing more then a giant social engineering psyop imo. Here is a list of redflags that one can easily look up to see that the 1960s hippy counterculture was something alot more sinister then a &quot;grassroots&quot; movement of &quot;enlightened&quot; youth who just wanted to live in harmony or whatever other stupid shit people thought the hippies were.</p>

<p>Gnostic Media&#39;s Jan Irving goes into great detail about MKULTRA. He mentions that many popular new age/counterculture gurus were actually CIA agents. <a href="http://www.gnosticmedia.com/how-darwin-huxley-and-the-esalen-institute-launched-the-2012-and-psychedelic-revolutions-and-began-one-of-the-largest-mind-control-operations-in-history/">http://www.gnosticmedia.com/how-darwin-huxley-and-the-esalen-institute-launched-the-2012-and-psychedelic-revolutions-and-began-one-of-the-largest-mind-control-operations-in-history/</a></p>

<p>Here is the Trailer for OA. I&#39;ve only seen a few episodes but it looks like she&#39;s in a sensory deprivation tank (Which also happen to be a huge part of Stranger Things plot) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvHJtez2IlY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvHJtez2IlY</a></p>

<p>Idk why they are doing this but I just thought it was interesting and worth sharing on here, especially in light of all the pizzagate stuff </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out Black Mirror. It&#39;s not necessarily PG related, but it&#39;s dark and twisted UK dystopia (aren&#39;t they best at dystopia) related to technology. At first I thought it was interesting, but the more I watched the more it just seemed sick. I don&#39;t know if I can explain, but at some point I had enough and didn&#39;t want to watch anymore. I guess I felt like it was trying to &quot;prepare&quot; me for the brave new world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched all of black mirror I should&#39;ve included that in my post but its episodes varied but yeah, it was alot of orwellian dystopics scary shit. It was definitely predictive programming conditioning you to get used to what is to come (or is already here)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>whats the Path about? I remember watching a few episodes of Penny Dreaful and it was drenched in the occult, but it got way to fucking gay for me so I stopped watching it. I remember christians being up in arms about Yu-Gi-Oh cards and Harry Potter being dangerous for children because of the occult themes... maybe their was something to that?</p>

<p>Working on releasing some writing that will describe in greater detail the &quot;dog programming&quot; that&#39;s mentioned there. There&#39;s almost no information whatsoever on the internet about it. I actually found that page from trying to find anyone speaking about it. There&#39;s a very brief mention in UW Ozian&#39;s Chainless Slaves (which I&#39;m about to link on here after this post) but no details or info</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here is a direct quote from a report on Auschwitz-Birkenau, by the United States War Refugee Board in 1945:</p>

<p>&quot;800 to 900 yards from the place where the ovens were, the prisoners were squeezed into little cars that ran on rails. In Auschwitz these cars had various dimensions and could hold up to 15 people. As soon as a car was loaded, it would be set in motion on an inclined plane that traveled at full speed down a corridor. At the end of the corridor there was a wall, and in the wall was the door to the oven. As soon as the car hit the wall, the door opened automatically, and the car would dip forward and pitch its cargo of living people into the oven. Right behind it came another car, and so on.&quot;</p>
