       On 9-11, when we saw Hillary collapse... I saw that video over and over, as well as all her other episodes. I couldn't help to feel like wow, this lady doesn't even seem human, almost more like a clone of some kind.. I've also seen pictures of Trump with the Clintons as friends. I understand friendships end all that but I can't help to think that maybe just maybe... she ran, so that he could without a doubt win. I don't know for what reason or what's next but she pushed the "awake" movement within the nation, and all attempts to change the results of the election have clearly failed.. also the fact he didn't go ahead and prosecute her and said she's had enough and what not?... why? What do you all think? The way she fell on 9-11 she didn't seem human. I'm no doctor but fuck man it's just a feeling.

       Listen - I love a good conspiracy theory; but the recurring theoryI keep seeing pop up that HRC's campaign was just a ruse to get Trump elected is complete nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole 'movement' that was behind the Trump presidency is totally opposite of everything that the establishment theoretically wants in the public: essentially unity of ideas, breaking away from the culture/society/celebrity agenda/media agenda, all of it; the fact that a large group of people officially got together and declared the establishment as an enemy (regardless of whether or not Trump was lying to his voters) is just bad for them.  They created a situation where a group of people were willing to bear arms and hit the streets if the establishment performed a coup to block the electoral college, ect.  A large group of people who also now declare people like Julian Assange and Ed Snowden, among other whistleblowers, as heroes in a modern era.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its just stupid - and now that the public is so riled up, Trump has to stick with his promises once he hits office.  Its too hard for the public to miss anything that he does wrong or whenever he goes back on his word, because when he does the left makes sure everybody knows it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying Trump is a squeaky clean leader by any means.  But I personally think that worst case scenario is that Trump is pro-establishment yet he belongs to a totally opposite internal-faction than Hillary does- and Trump's faction may be less imposing on the people (at least in the short term), than Hillary's blatant iron fist regime would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its likely special interests vs special interests; but one group may be more understanding to the fact that the more you squeeze the people, the more they want to revolt and eliminate the establishment.  Fortunately, I think large numbers of people are starting to 'wake up' to the fact that regardless of who is leading, we are still be suppressed and abused - hopefully the Trump election is a catalyst for the public to realize that we do have all of the power, we just need to use it

       Well said. I have never read this "conspiracy" train of thought before but if that's the case I suppose I'm not surprised. I totally agree that his "movement" was totally the opposite of the tptb which was part of me thinking oh, problem and solution.. like when you got some real facts in front of you how in the hell in your right mind could you vote for Hillary.. see what I mean with that? I fully agree we, the people have power I just feel like this 5D chess thing includes the masses "becoming awake" to a degree I feel like the "biggest" people OF the "awake" movement possibly might be agents them selves. Like control the damn truth since it's getting out and point the direction we should go. That's why I try to question it all. Not saying I'm right or anything. Thanks for your reply.

       I believe they are playing problem-response-solution, except this time the 'problem' of awakening masses was created unintentionally and they are trying to deal with it.  I think the left's solution is to clamp down harder and divide people more.  The right's solution, assuming trump is corrupt, is to 'let some slack out' on the leash, to once again make people believe they are free.  Trump's solution is better than being blatantly persecuted by the left; but at the end of the day, we are still being ruled, and the ruling class tends to just get harsher and conditions worsen with more time.  The people need to take control, which I think will invariably happen considering an election like this one was totally unprecedented

       Trump isn't going to pursue prosecuting Hillary because he doesn't actually give a fuck. He just said that to get votes.

       yeah Trump does fit into the model of a set up.  the classic anti-establishment guy who is really crypto-establishment.  the "let's wide a wave of populist support to do sketchy shit" dynamic.  yes, this is all conceivable with Trump.

       Obama back in the day was the solution. The "change" been a long time now that the majority of people "want change" bc we "all know tptb are bad". I might be wrong but when he started to run, Trump that is I read he was for way more surveillance. Not sure about that tho. I think they already do all the surveillance they want. Like the patriot act for example just made it " officially leg" but duh it was being done already.

       Yeah i just don't think Trump has the support to be really divisive.  There's a cohort of people (generally people who self-identify as liberal) who watch the MSM and who think he's a demon or something.  Seeing these people get wound up in real life is fascinating.  It's like they've been taken over by a demon themselves.  Anyway, this cohort smells, to me anyway, all civil-war-y.  Because of this balance of support, I think he has to walk a straight line.  But you know, he could easily pull a juke move and turn it all around.  Probably wouldn't work though.   Unless that's the entire plan to begin with.

       Supposedly she's very sick... propped up by a cocktails of drugs nonstop... Trump isn't even president yet... just wait a few months and you will see a big chunk of the most notorious of the government elites all go down... It's happening now... it's gonna be great.

       I'm not specialist on prosecuting but he said he would appoint a special prosecutor , once he won it was brought up and he straight up said he wouldn't. Some people say he's waiting until he is president but idk. And yes I am.

       He appointed a new AG who is not Loretta Lynch. His name is Jeff Sessions.

       As for your earlier question:

      <p>
       It made me question if you are actually American, because as an American, you should be aware that Trump has not yet taken office. You should also be aware that the new AG would be the person to prosecute Hillary, if there is a case to do so.

       Umm. Wow. I feel like maybe you're really young, so I'm gonna give you a pass here:

       Trump isn't president yet.

       We don't just go willy-nilly prosecuting people from Manhattan cause we can't.

       Trump isn't president yet, I got it. I understand he can't prosecute yet. That's fine I'm not saying that alone is the cause of this whole thought. As far as being young, you pasted it your self, I said I'm no specialist in "prosecuting" so thanks for educating me on that. Had nothing to do with age.

       I assumed you were foreign - then young (both plausible). I was giving you the benefit of a doubt instead of calling you stupid.

       I think tptb know exactly how the public feels so they play on it, and it always ends up looking like "problem and solution" so yes, they control the main stream media, and yes they know we don't trust them, so why not play on that..
