<p>&quot;chicken&quot; and &quot;chicken hawk&quot; have been used as desciptions for &quot;young boy&quot; and &quot;young boy lover&quot; as gay terms for decades -
this is well known to most people </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(gay_slang)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(gay_slang)</a></p>

<p>&quot;The term has existed in the gay vernacular for many decades, and is still used today. David Henry Sterry, a former prostitute turned actor and director, titled his 2002 memoir, &quot;Chicken: Self-Portrait of a Young Man for Rent&quot; -  Author Philip Herbst traces its origin to the 19th century, where it was used to describe the youngest sailors on a ship, who were often used for sexual purposes&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;stereotypically describing an adolescent or pre-adolescent youth.&quot;</p>

<p>And in the picture he&#39;s holding a toddler, and it looks like a female toddler too. Every one if your links describes a young boy.  Not to mention the hashtag is plural, meaning they are both chickenlovers. So are they both into young boys? Or do they both love chicken considering they&#39;re at a restaurant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh hey bud. I see you hanging around here. You seem to be repeating the same things, despite everyone&#39;s best effort to educate you.</p>

<p>You seem to be in denial regarding the term &quot;chicken lover&quot; even when many people have explained that the term means men who are sexually attracted to young boys.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also been pointed out to you that the child appears to be a boy. Wouldn&#39;t it actually make sense then that the hashtag is being used in the way we&#39;re telling you it is? Or are you 100% positive that the child is a girl?</p>

<p>If by that you mean ignoring my line by line rebuttals of your posts, then yes it&#39;s very educational into how a witch hunt reacts to facts against the narrative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You seem to be in denial regarding the term &quot;chicken lover&quot; even when many people have explained that the term means men who are sexually attracted to young boys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes explained, without ever linking to anything prior to a month ago proving that it is.  You linked me to chicken hawk, and he linked me to chicken, both of which as you noticed, are NOT chicken lover. But close enough for you right? Not to mention both are talking about young boys and not toddlers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s also been pointed out to you that the child appears to be a boy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And do they have proof of this? Considering this is pizzagate, i&#39;m guessing no. They&#39;re wearing pink though which is usually a sign that a toddler is a girl. But a boy fits your argument better so you say he&#39;s a boy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t it actually make sense then that the hashtag is being used in the way we&#39;re telling you it is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, because even all the nonsense you&#39;re shouting is true, he used it plurally, indicating both people in the picture are chicken lovers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or are you 100% positive that the child is a girl?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you&#39;re making this hing on something that nobody can prove or disprove, which is actually exactly what I expected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have proof the child is a girl?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t have any proof that it&#39;s a boy, and no matter then gender, it still proves literally nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ding ding ding.  It&#39;s not just him, others are doing it too.    From about a week in it was being manipulated, it went from speculation to &quot;THIS IS HAPPENING&quot; with no changes in facts, no new information, at times information that adds nothing, and all the most damning evidence was found in the start, despite this, when it was still just the original conspiracy theorists, the statement was &quot;MAYBE&quot;.</p>

<p>Suddenly some normies or something must have found it, because we got bombarded by posts like &quot;OMG I am sick, literally sick, is this real?&quot; followed by &quot;THIS IS HAPPENING&quot;.</p>

<p>It was obnoxious to the point of invading other boards, it almost felt like a psyop, but I truly believe that everyday, normal Joes ARE that stupid, and that&#39;s what we saw.   They realized they could improve their social status by &#39;breaking&#39; the news to friends, who then broke it to more friends and before long it was a circle jerk of &quot;ITS HAPPENING&quot; despite no new evidence.</p>

<p>You even had people making threads about how sick it made them, like they fucking matter enough to start a new thread...until you realize, they were whoring out their karma.  </p>

<p>The people who actually were digging originally, are long gone. (Mostly).   They were looking at facts, and all the socially fluent fucks did, was bring in misinformation, bullshit, and speculation, while stating all of it as fact.  </p>

<p>It was interesting, and worth going through the emails, right up until the bombardment.  At that point I walked away.  It&#39;s too much, I have a low idiocy tolerance.  The people before the bombardment, they should be respected for how they handled the info, the new gen who swapped it to &#39;pizzagate&#39; should be shot with packets.  /rant.</p>

<p>yeah, trying to support alternate currencies is clearly unpalatable - oh sorry, I have that backwards.</p>

<p>I like some of what he has to say... but the way he says &quot;pizzagate&quot; makes me cringe.. and I lost interest in him when he started working the &quot;buy gold&quot; shilling into everything... I guess a guy gotta pay the bills though.</p>

<p>seems like you&#39;re following into the same cognitive bias that many on this sub do.  if someone isn&#39;t perfect, or more accurately, if someone isn&#39;t palatable, then you discard their work.  this is a flawed way to examine information, btw.  also it&#39;s super easily gamed.  the only people that will meet your Hero Threshold are the ones who have the resources to spin.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh... nothing against him really... I shy away from all youtube based sources of information... because in the end they are all taking information available elsewhere and presenting it to me... I can read faster than they can speak... youtube is just another layer of obfuscation that a person like me doesn&#39;t need to deal with. It is great for folks without the time to check the original sources... but I like to form my own opinion based things I saw and verified for myself. </p>
