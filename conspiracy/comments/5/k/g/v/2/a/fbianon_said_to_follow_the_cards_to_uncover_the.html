        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I wanted to post this on voat, but I guess voat isn&#39;t allowing any new subscribers. Anyone know of a way to get a voat invite?</p>

<p>When it comes to pizza gate, we know that its a satanic cult that loves its symbols. We also know that they traffic humans, blood and organs. We also know that they will go into areas that are hit with a disaster or war countries. What is the largest organization that is known as humanitarian and the first to respond? The Red Cross. The Red Cross is the symbol for the Knights of Templar.  </p>

<p>I decided to search for a connection between the Red Cross and the Clinton Foundation. I found one link. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/beneficiary-registration-kits-british-red-cross">https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/beneficiary-registration-kits-british-red-cross</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2013, BT committed to extending an existing partnership with the British Red Cross by providing $75,000 in funding to support the development of three Beneficiary Registration Kits (BRK), that are comprised of: mobile devices, plastic cards, and bar-code printers. The BRKs will enable Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies to distribute assistance during and following disasters in a more efficient and targeted manner. Using lessons from previous disaster situations, the BRKs will be prepositioned in three regional locations including: Panama for the Americas, Kuala Lumpur for Asia Pacific, and Nairobi for Africa. The BRKs will then be deployed to disaster situations across these regions as needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beneficiary Registration Kits (BRK) &lt;--This is the only place I can find this phrase. I really don&#39;t know what this is or what the Plastic cards are used for. I can make a guess that its a field kit for setting up a quick communications network, but why not say this?</p>

<p>The important question to ask is why the link to the Red Cross in these 3 countries?  When I google clinton foundation and any of those 3 locations, I find years of stories involving the Clintons involvement in there. </p>

<p>In Panama the Clintons pop up in lots of stories about their association with people in the panama papers. No big surprise, but I can&#39;t seem to search past these results, My google-fu is weak it seems. I was thinking this link would let them traffic through the canal, but it seems inspections or crew visas aren&#39;t needed to go through the canal. </p>

<p>Kuala Lumpur pulls up several bits of corruption involving the clintons. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/Clinton_Email_August_Release/C05772078.pdf">Also found out</a>  Hillary forced a change in power there during her time at the State Department. </p>

<p>in Nairobi for Africa I can&#39;t find a whole lot, but I did find a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/53146">Podesta email</a> trying to troubleshoot a problem there. </p>

<p>Anyone got any google fu tips on drilling deeper into these things? I think a lot of the core things the Clinton foundation does can be linked to these 3 places. Is this idea too much of a stretch or not clear?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI anon explains exactly why.  Basically he/she says if we knew the full truth our eyes would fall out of heads.  Let that sink in for a minute.  He/she also says that they have a duty to protect the country but not doing anything would be wrong.  I&#39;m assuming that what they&#39;re saying is here&#39;s some bread crumbs that can lead you to the truth.  If you&#39;re smart enough to find it you can probably handle it and when you do find it its so unbelievable that even if you go telling anyone they&#39;ll just call you a conspiracy cook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy Hook/Pulse were false flags to keep us a state of fear. Celebrities who speak out get thrown in mental institutions, or killed. Osama Bin dead longer than we&#39;ve actually been told, and was never thrown in the ocean. Obamas birth certificate is a forgery. Our government is the terrorist, and are also funding the terrorist groups. They are also molesting and taking children for their rituals. Taxes are used to continue your enslavement, and we pay them like good little serfs. South Korea revolted with just the shadow government of shamans...What will it take for us?</p>

The videos of the million or so people in the streets was fucking awesome. </p>

<p>And as far as I know, they weren&#39;t looting stores or making it about gender or some other BS.
The government was fucked, and the people as one collective group, were pissed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the trick with pizza is the low overhead, i believe. The cost of making a pizza to the selling point is astronomical, so it wouldnt be hard to hide money, especially when catering is taken into account. And theres also no proof of product afterward, given the expectation that its eaten. You take a huge payment for a &quot;catering&quot; job and never make the food, and whos in a position to argue that the order never actually went out?</p>

<p>A decent catering job can run upwards of $15k for a night, easily.</p>
