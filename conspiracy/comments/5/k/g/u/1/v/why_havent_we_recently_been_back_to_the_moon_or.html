    <div class="md"><p>I study aeronautical engineering, we have definetly been to the Moon, no doubt on my mind about that. </p>

<p>Is the footage from the first landing real? Honestly who knows, it doesnt even matter, even if they faked that one, we&#39;ve been to the Moon on several other ocassions.</p>

<p>Rocket propulsion technology is largely the same it was 50 years ago, its newtons 3rd law, you blow shit up behind you and you accelerate forwards, we have been using fossil fuels ever since for that.</p>

<p>The reason we havent gone back is because its far too expensive and these kinds of missions take a long time to be planned and developed. Besides all the science we could have done on the Moon has already been done in orbit at the ISS, which can be seen to the naked eye on a clear day, no conspiracy theories here.</p>

<p>We have definetly been to the Moon and well be back soon enough, well also go to Mars in a few decades, and explore the solar system in the next Century or so.</p>

<p>Dont listen to the nutjobs who deny all this, we need the public to support manned exploration of space if we want to better humankind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, how are you so sure? We went to the moon 6 times in a 3 year period and then never went back. It&#39;s so expensive that we managed it 6 times in 3 years but couldnt afford to go again at any point in the last 50 years? No other country could afford it or thought it would be worth it? What proof or evidence makes you so sure?</p>

By the 6th time no one really cared that men were going to the moon (The apollo 13 mission had trouble getting any press attention until stuff went wrong). So by that point NASA was being defunded because the public didn&#39;t care as much so they decided to spend their funds somewhere different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoever controls the moon would control the planet, its been thought of for a longgg time that if someone had a base up there they could just hurl moon rocks down at earth if they really wanted too. </p>

<p>There is a major strategic point in being there, there is a mirror on the moon but that could have easily been put there with a missle or a probe. </p>

<p>While I want to beleive we went to the moon, the thing that keeps bugging me is that moon is located outside of earths protective radiation belts. 
So if they did go to the moon, how did all those guys not end up sterile and crazy, thats one of the main problems going to mars  you know.</p>

<p>We do not have the technology yet that is capable of generating a strong enough electromagnetic field to block solar and cosmic radiation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These links should answer any of your questions. Also, spending a week in space orbiting The Moon and returning to Earth is a lot different than going to Mars. It would take approximately 9 months just to get there, we would have to stay for some sort of duration for research and setting up a home base, and the 9 months it takes to get back. We&#39;re talking a minimum of 2 years for the mission. A little research goes a long way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, you can&#39;t really call bullshit when you openly admit you have &quot;zero real world knowledge of the topic&quot;. Listen I&#39;m with you a little, as in I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist and there&#39;s lots of interesting stuff out there on the internet, but it is absolutely beyond expensive to do it. 
Let me try and break some of it down for you. The space station has cost about $200 billion or more(as in almost a quarter of a trillion dollars) and its &quot;only&quot; 250 miles above our planet. Also it&#39;s taken 20 years to build. It costs on average $70 million dollars to send one astronaut to the ISS and get them back, so imagine a small crew of 6 and you can see how it starts adding up. The Moon is 250,000 miles away(takes 3-4 days to get there going fast af) and that&#39;s not even touching on Mars which takes a bare minimum of 6-9 months to reach. Not to mention the shielding they need to have to survive the radiation on the trip (that they are still developing), building next generation ships that are much faster and more efficient, and figuring out a way for a human to survive for literally years in either zero G or just a fraction of our Earths gravity on the Moon or Mars. If you think there&#39;s a cheap, easy, and fast way to do this, I bet all the people working on it would love to know. We physically need gravity, most astronauts are only in space for a week or two at a time and it has huge physical and psychological effects on them. 
There is probably not a more fiscally responsible company than the big ones like NASA, SpaceEx, Virgin etc when it comes to getting the most bang for their buck. They have multiple experiments and whatnot going on for every single mission(whether it be a Mars Rover or a mission on the ISS). These are just a handful of the obstacles we need to overcome in order to do this, out of hundreds if not thousands. NASAs annual budget compared to our military&#39;s (USA) is peanuts, and these programs need to be economical as well. 
I&#39;m not gonna bother on the aliens subject, what the government actually has and knows or anything like that because it&#39;s a guilty pleasure of mine... however, if you want us all traveling to space rather inexpensively and quickly, we are going to need some serious advances in publicly available technologies. That&#39;s why SpaceEx and Virgin Galactic etc are so cool, it&#39;s not just NASA anymore. We&#39;ll get there it&#39;s a matter of when, not if. Elon Musk and his team are making this happen on the Moon and Mars just in the next decade or so... and that&#39;s not even counting all the other programs around the world working on this. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people here that could explain it far better than I. Also as a side note, if the world governments and economies put EVERYTHING into space exploration, like the US and Russia did in the 50s and 60s, of course we would get there faster. However, there are a lot of people and problems down here that need fixing too, and the world is more complex than ever. We are going to see some cool stuff in the next 10 years trust me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s not the science making me doubt we went to the moon, it&#39;s the economic excuses for why not since, money is printed out of nothing all the time and we waste trillions a year on wars. If we could go back to the moon we would cost is meaningless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money is most definitely NOT printed out of nothing. Please do yourself a favor and learn some basic economics. I agree that we waste far too much on military spending and wars and whatever, trillions of dollars like you said, but that&#39;s not the entire issue. You don&#39;t just write a blank check and we&#39;re on The Moon tomorrow. If you read what I said above money isn&#39;t the only problem we have or the biggest. We are still figuring a lot of this stuff out. I must reiterate that NO, they don&#39;t just print money and there you go, it&#39;s a little more complicated than that, and by a little, I mean A LOT. And as for the trillions in debt, you, me, and everyone else in the country and the world have to pay it off. That&#39;s one of the many reasons so many people are pissed off. We are still on the verge of collapse again with the way Wallstreet, corporations and the government handle our finances for their own personal gain, but it&#39;s also not so black and white(that&#39;s why it&#39;s hard to stop). If any government did that to the extent that you&#39;re saying, our world economies and possibly civilization would have collapsed ages ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its better to spend the money on several smaller launches of interest, and maintaining several missions at once.

<p>The space program has a budget, like anything else. I&#39;m sure it would use most of it to even plan such a venture out. Especially considering there&#39;s no real reason to put humans on ground, as it can be done safely from the ISS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I don&#39;t believe this one either. Albeit a lot of my skepticism has started from the Kubrick hidden messages. First, I realized through PG that he wanted to tell us about it in Eyes Wide Shut. Then I realized that if that&#39;s the case maybe the symbolism in The Shining has some real weight to it. It would be so easy to fake the moon landing video, especially when you realize that Kubrick was the director of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The moon landing videos themselves are horrible quality.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it also such a great excuse to say that the moon is useless and that we won&#39;t make any flights there anymore? Yeah, let&#39;s just wait until whenever they say we will make a manned flight to Mars.</p>

<p>The creation of NASA is such a great way to funnel money into other projects all while putting some small percentage of those billions of tax payer dollars into CGI and a few rockets. I also read somewhere that we were actually behind Russia in the space race and then we ended up beating them and getting a successful landing. Not that the U.S would ever lie to us or anything.</p>

<p>How do we know that anyone can get through the Van Allen belt radiation?</p>

<p>There are also some pretty compelling pictures of the Challenger crew all grown up with the same name. Questionable stuff tbh.</p>

This whole conspiracy hinges upon either USA fooling Soviets (which is pretty unlikely since Russians were certainly paying <em>very</em> close attention to the project), or Soviets giving up one of the biggest propaganda victories of the Cold War. Neither seems plausibke to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the time of the moon landing only one other nation was even in the running to reach the moon as well.  The Soviet Union was the other runner in the Space Race and once the USA landed there there was no longer any propagandistic reason to get to the moon.  This is especially evident in the fact that many people from the USSR didn&#39;t know that the Americans had landed on the moon until decades later when the iron curtain fell.</p>

<p>No other nations had space programs anywhere near as advanced as the USA and USSR at the time which is why we didn&#39;t see a chain reaction of nations going.  Once they realised the cost and relatively low benefit of moon missions to science they focussed their efforts elsewhere with satellites and the like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything we&#39;d put up there would have to come from earth in the first place. This would only really be viable if the majority of materials were manufactured and sourced on the moon. Otherwise everything has to climb out of two gravity wells, not one. That&#39;s also assuming the moon has the raw materials needed in abundance. Even if all that were to play out, we&#39;d need to have workers to man the entire production chain, keep them alive, and give them a reason to be there.</p>

<p>So, you have a situation that is only beneficial if the moon has resources needed for a space program, when you get there, you have to build infrastructure (for refining and manufacturing in addition to supporting the biological functions of the people running everything), wait for it all to be ready, and man the facility. Not only does this sound absurdly expensive (maybe the break even is at the billionth satellite), but it also sounds like you&#39;ve given a group of probably smart people complete autonomy and no viable way to get them to do what they&#39;re told. It would be like 17th century Britain colonizing Australia, but sending the best and brightest while giving them the tools to tell the Queen to fuck off, because each ship you send to put down a rebellion can now carry only a handful of marines, and since they make everything they need, economic sanctions aren&#39;t likely to mean a damn thing to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to propose a different theory than most of the posts in the thread: </p>

<p>The Solar Warden program [1] is real and the us military (a branch of the navy) has the ability to put ships in space easily, regularly, and travel some distance from earth using a means of propulsion which is currently undisclosed. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve possibly set up a moon base, though there is possibly little of value there, and we also know it&#39;s a very harsh environment (for equipment etc). </p>

<p>I find it difficult to believe the US military black budget of the size in the order of $52b EACH YEAR [2]  doesn&#39;t afford a space program. That&#39;s 2.5 x NASA&#39;s total budget. [3]</p>

<p>If we assume there are black programs of the level of technology (in today&#39;s terms) that gave us the U-2 and SR-71 in the 60/70&#39;s, we should be able to expect there are undisclosed propulsion systems, and technology that afford easy space flight. </p>

<p>Also, the it is US military doctrine for &#39;total spectrum dominance&#39; which includes &quot; terrestrial, aerial, maritime, subterranean, <em>extraterrestrial</em>, psychological, and bio- or cyber-technological warfare&quot;. [4]  I think it&#39;s pretty clear the US has total dominance in all of those, but we don&#39;t see anything about the US military putting people in space. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also feasible that some form of zero-point energy has been developed [5], which affords the US military the ability to circumvent traditional space launch. </p>

<p>In fact if we believe what we&#39;re told, the US has no means of putting people in space, and relies on Russian rockets.  This just doesn&#39;t align with US military doctrine, or advances in technology used by the military, or the black budget. Which is why I don&#39;t believe what we&#39;re told. </p>

<p>I conclude that the US military has people in space and travelling further than the moon, regularly, because the Solar Warden program exists. </p>

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li><p>In the 1960s <strong>USA</strong> and <strong>USSR</strong> had an immense space race that lead <strong>USA</strong> to be the first nation on the moon. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>USSR</strong> never went with a manned mission to the moon, despite having the first successful outer space journey with Yuri Gagarin. <strong>USA</strong> on the other hand, <em>had all nine manned missions returning safely to earth.</em></p></li>
<li><p>All of the manned missions to the moon was american, and occured between 1968 and 1972, all manned moon missions happened in the span of <em>four years</em>. </p></li>
<li><p>After these manned missions <strong>USSR</strong> were more than happy just staying away from the moon (with manned missions), and ironically the space race led to <strong>USA</strong> and <strong>USSR</strong> eventually co-operate the biggest space station in orbit around earth, the ISS.</p></li>
<li><p>After 1972, not a single person has been on the moon.</p></li>
<li><p>We have since sent many probes and rockets, and <strong>China</strong> sent the Chang&#39;e 3 rover in 2014. Still, we  don&#39;t really have any <em>indubious</em> pictures of the moon surface or <strong>Apollo 11</strong> landing site, though obtaining such pictures should be of little challenge these days.  </p></li>
<li><p>The space between earth and moon is <strong><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/27/1414425762200_wps_16_CLqdeKf_jpg.jpg">massive</a></strong>. It is to say lightly <em>incredulous</em> that <strong>USA</strong> went to the moon and back <em>9 times</em>.  I don&#39;t really understand the Van Allen Radiation Belt, but on NASAs website they call it <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/van-allen-probes-spot-impenetrable-barrier-in-space">nearly impenetrable</a>. Mind you that a manned missions would go through this belt <em>twice</em> in <a href="http://universe-beauty.com/albums/userpics/1/8/space-photo-img334.jpg">this kind of protection</a>. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The moon missions were part PR and part science. Both of which were pretty much used up.</p>

<p>We beat the Russians to the moon that was a big deal back then. The enthusiasm of the public was huge at first but as time passed the public wasn&#39;t as impressed as it was. </p>

<p>We learned quite a bit from the samples collected and the science that was done. Obviously, it isn&#39;t everything that we could learn but since a trip to the moon is hugely expensive you have to balance investment with the expected results. We probably wouldn&#39;t learn anything worth the expense of sending any more men to the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>remember <strong>the Moon is 250,000 miles UP</strong>, its not over there or somewhere else. its <strong>UP</strong> with all the gravity and orbital speed problems that go with that scenario.</p>

<p>we do not travel to the Moon, we climb up to it, then have to match its orbital speed and then inject into orbit while doing so.</p>

<p>I seem to remember many moons ago (sic) that kids shows and others including computer games/sims, used to suggest that one launches and then go so far then coasts then retro fires rockets to slow down. this is a story for five year olds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orbital mechanics are not immediately intuitive, but you can grab a simulator or a half-decent game which incorporates orbital mechanics to get a feel for it. Odds are those kids shows are more accurate to the real situation than the scenario you seem to be painting in those first lines.</p>
