       I study aeronautical engineering, we have definetly been to the Moon, no doubt on my mind about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the footage from the first landing real? Honestly who knows, it doesnt even matter, even if they faked that one, we've been to the Moon on several other ocassions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rocket propulsion technology is largely the same it was 50 years ago, its newtons 3rd law, you blow shit up behind you and you accelerate forwards, we have been using fossil fuels ever since for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason we havent gone back is because its far too expensive and these kinds of missions take a long time to be planned and developed. Besides all the science we could have done on the Moon has already been done in orbit at the ISS, which can be seen to the naked eye on a clear day, no conspiracy theories here.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have definetly been to the Moon and well be back soon enough, well also go to Mars in a few decades, and explore the solar system in the next Century or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont listen to the nutjobs who deny all this, we need the public to support manned exploration of space if we want to better humankind.

       I mean, how are you so sure? We went to the moon 6 times in a 3 year period and then never went back. It's so expensive that we managed it 6 times in 3 years but couldnt afford to go again at any point in the last 50 years? No other country could afford it or thought it would be worth it? What proof or evidence makes you so sure?

       Because it was a prestige thing at the time (space race with USSR). By the 6th time no one really cared that men were going to the moon (The apollo 13 mission had trouble getting any press attention until stuff went wrong). So by that point NASA was being defunded because the public didn't care as much so they decided to spend their funds somewhere different.

       Whoever controls the moon would control the planet, its been thought of for a longgg time that if someone had a base up there they could just hurl moon rocks down at earth if they really wanted too.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a major strategic point in being there, there is a mirror on the moon but that could have easily been put there with a missle or a probe.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I want to beleive we went to the moon, the thing that keeps bugging me is that moon is located outside of earths protective radiation belts. 
So if they did go to the moon, how did all those guys not end up sterile and crazy, thats one of the main problems going to mars  you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not have the technology yet that is capable of generating a strong enough electromagnetic field to block solar and cosmic radiation.

       These links should answer any of your questions. Also, spending a week in space orbiting The Moon and returning to Earth is a lot different than going to Mars. It would take approximately 9 months just to get there, we would have to stay for some sort of duration for research and setting up a home base, and the 9 months it takes to get back. We're talking a minimum of 2 years for the mission. A little research goes a long way.

       During those 3 years we didnt send many probes to other planets, or put anything in orbit.
We now do all those things on the regular. Its better for the progress and health of the industry to have several small launches from different companies than to have a single government do huge launches.

       Gotta call bullshit here. No way is "too expensive" a reason for the US not to go to the moon. ( I have zero real world knowledge of the topic, but I still don't believe you when you claim that as a reason)

       I dunno, you can't really call bullshit when you openly admit you have "zero real world knowledge of the topic". Listen I'm with you a little, as in I'm a conspiracy theorist and there's lots of interesting stuff out there on the internet, but it is absolutely beyond expensive to do it. 
Let me try and break some of it down for you. The space station has cost about $200 billion or more(as in almost a quarter of a trillion dollars) and its "only" 250 miles above our planet. Also it's taken 20 years to build. It costs on average $70 million dollars to send one astronaut to the ISS and get them back, so imagine a small crew of 6 and you can see how it starts adding up. The Moon is 250,000 miles away(takes 3-4 days to get there going fast af) and that's not even touching on Mars which takes a bare minimum of 6-9 months to reach. Not to mention the shielding they need to have to survive the radiation on the trip (that they are still developing), building next generation ships that are much faster and more efficient, and figuring out a way for a human to survive for literally years in either zero G or just a fraction of our Earths gravity on the Moon or Mars. If you think there's a cheap, easy, and fast way to do this, I bet all the people working on it would love to know. We physically need gravity, most astronauts are only in space for a week or two at a time and it has huge physical and psychological effects on them. 
There is probably not a more fiscally responsible company than the big ones like NASA, SpaceEx, Virgin etc when it comes to getting the most bang for their buck. They have multiple experiments and whatnot going on for every single mission(whether it be a Mars Rover or a mission on the ISS). These are just a handful of the obstacles we need to overcome in order to do this, out of hundreds if not thousands. NASAs annual budget compared to our military's (USA) is peanuts, and these programs need to be economical as well. 
I'm not gonna bother on the aliens subject, what the government actually has and knows or anything like that because it's a guilty pleasure of mine... however, if you want us all traveling to space rather inexpensively and quickly, we are going to need some serious advances in publicly available technologies. That's why SpaceEx and Virgin Galactic etc are so cool, it's not just NASA anymore. We'll get there it's a matter of when, not if. Elon Musk and his team are making this happen on the Moon and Mars just in the next decade or so... and that's not even counting all the other programs around the world working on this. I'm sure there are plenty of people here that could explain it far better than I. Also as a side note, if the world governments and economies put EVERYTHING into space exploration, like the US and Russia did in the 50s and 60s, of course we would get there faster. However, there are a lot of people and problems down here that need fixing too, and the world is more complex than ever. We are going to see some cool stuff in the next 10 years trust me.

       it's not the science making me doubt we went to the moon, it's the economic excuses for why not since, money is printed out of nothing all the time and we waste trillions a year on wars. If we could go back to the moon we would cost is meaningless.

       Money is most definitely NOT printed out of nothing. Please do yourself a favor and learn some basic economics. I agree that we waste far too much on military spending and wars and whatever, trillions of dollars like you said, but that's not the entire issue. You don't just write a blank check and we're on The Moon tomorrow. If you read what I said above money isn't the only problem we have or the biggest. We are still figuring a lot of this stuff out. I must reiterate that NO, they don't just print money and there you go, it's a little more complicated than that, and by a little, I mean A LOT. And as for the trillions in debt, you, me, and everyone else in the country and the world have to pay it off. That's one of the many reasons so many people are pissed off. We are still on the verge of collapse again with the way Wallstreet, corporations and the government handle our finances for their own personal gain, but it's also not so black and white(that's why it's hard to stop). If any government did that to the extent that you're saying, our world economies and possibly civilization would have collapsed ages ago.

       Its better to spend the money on several smaller launches of interest, and maintaining several missions at once. Manpower is also a reason going to the Moon hasnt been repeated, NASA runs several other missions to celestial bodies, missions that last decades and take hundreds of people.

       It might not be too expensive in the scope of overall cost. But when you could spend that money on other projects like landing a Barbie doll or something on Saturn. Something they haven't done yet, when they have already gone to the moon. It doesn't seem too far fetched.

       The space program has a budget, like anything else. I'm sure it would use most of it to even plan such a venture out. Especially considering there's no real reason to put humans on ground, as it can be done safely from the ISS.

       The article does make several fair points, but still, radiation in space can at most incapacitate some crew membres, 3 years of exposure is not lethal, much less a few months on the trip to the Moon.

       It does under very low doses of radiation. Radioactive disorders are degenerative and generally not immediately lethal. Standing in front of your microwave for 3 years might give you an unusally high amount of radiation but it certainly wont give you deathly cancer.

       True. Something like that could be powered with fission pile technology, or a conventional steam reactor using open to space heatsinks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I have with that theory is how did they hide the traffic from earth based observers? I would think someone would have seen supply missions en route, or picked up on traffic leaving earth's orbit.

       Yeah, I don't believe this one either. Albeit a lot of my skepticism has started from the Kubrick hidden messages. First, I realized through PG that he wanted to tell us about it in Eyes Wide Shut. Then I realized that if that's the case maybe the symbolism in The Shining has some real weight to it. It would be so easy to fake the moon landing video, especially when you realize that Kubrick was the director of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The moon landing videos themselves are horrible quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it also such a great excuse to say that the moon is useless and that we won't make any flights there anymore? Yeah, let's just wait until whenever they say we will make a manned flight to Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The creation of NASA is such a great way to funnel money into other projects all while putting some small percentage of those billions of tax payer dollars into CGI and a few rockets. I also read somewhere that we were actually behind Russia in the space race and then we ended up beating them and getting a successful landing. Not that the U.S would ever lie to us or anything.

       Soviets didn't seem to have any problems with lying. And if they got caught so what? Their allies and citizens wouldn't dare to speak against them, and their enemies already hated them.
       <br/>
       This whole conspiracy hinges upon either USA fooling Soviets (which is pretty unlikely since Russians were certainly paying
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       close attention to the project), or Soviets giving up one of the biggest propaganda victories of the Cold War. Neither seems plausibke to me.

       It's a good question, but we could ask it about so many things.  Why didn't Saddam expose 9/11 when he was on the verge of being deposed?  I think we have to assume other countries want to a) keep their own secrets so they don't expose others or b) opposing countries are really run by the same people higher up.

       It is inordinately expensive to go to the moon or for any space mission for that matter.  There also isn't a whole lot of science that can be done on the moon that either hasn't already been done or couldn't be done from Earth/orbit.

       There are far more scientifically interesting bodies in the Solar system like Mars and Enceladus (A moon of Saturn with water).

       At the time of the moon landing only one other nation was even in the running to reach the moon as well.  The Soviet Union was the other runner in the Space Race and once the USA landed there there was no longer any propagandistic reason to get to the moon.  This is especially evident in the fact that many people from the USSR didn't know that the Americans had landed on the moon until decades later when the iron curtain fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       No other nations had space programs anywhere near as advanced as the USA and USSR at the time which is why we didn't see a chain reaction of nations going.  Once they realised the cost and relatively low benefit of moon missions to science they focussed their efforts elsewhere with satellites and the like.

       Low benefit? What a fucking load of bullshit. That's the best excuse you can come up with? 
And from where does your authority stem to decide what in science is beneficial and what is not?

       Everything we'd put up there would have to come from earth in the first place. This would only really be viable if the majority of materials were manufactured and sourced on the moon. Otherwise everything has to climb out of two gravity wells, not one. That's also assuming the moon has the raw materials needed in abundance. Even if all that were to play out, we'd need to have workers to man the entire production chain, keep them alive, and give them a reason to be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you have a situation that is only beneficial if the moon has resources needed for a space program, when you get there, you have to build infrastructure (for refining and manufacturing in addition to supporting the biological functions of the people running everything), wait for it all to be ready, and man the facility. Not only does this sound absurdly expensive (maybe the break even is at the billionth satellite), but it also sounds like you've given a group of probably smart people complete autonomy and no viable way to get them to do what they're told. It would be like 17th century Britain colonizing Australia, but sending the best and brightest while giving them the tools to tell the Queen to fuck off, because each ship you send to put down a rebellion can now carry only a handful of marines, and since they make everything they need, economic sanctions aren't likely to mean a damn thing to them.

       No one is going because the USA didn't go to the moon and no one can still go to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is landing and then taking off from the moon, a capsule doesn't have the appropriate maneuvering to achieve that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon landing was faked, though they have collected dust and other samples from the moon from probes and stuff like that. Unfortunately we haven't and won't be able to send people to the moon or Mars until at least 5-10 more years. In fact India or China are going to be amongst the first in 2022 to send people to Mars.

       There is an overwhelming amount of evidence showing that we did not land on the moon.  The people that still think we landed on the moon are the same people that have not research the subject deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think about it, without even looking at the stacks of  evidence.  We wouldn't put the first women on the moon?  The cosmonauts would just give up (even though they were beating the US in all other "space races) and never put a Russian on the moon, even though the US safely did it 6 times in 8 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       We wouldn't have cameras set up on the moon showing us pictures of the Earth and space?  Rovers with cameras?  Give me a break of course all of these things would happen, and don't give me the "it cost too much money"  because we print the money and it hasn't stopped us growing in any other aspect of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       We would probably even have had a Super bowl or some reality show on the moon by now if we could get there.  Companies would pay any amount of money to advertise from the moon.  We can't get there, I'm sorry it was a "Hollywood trick" and not even a very good one if you actually examine it.

       I'm going to propose a different theory than most of the posts in the thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Solar Warden program [1] is real and the us military (a branch of the navy) has the ability to put ships in space easily, regularly, and travel some distance from earth using a means of propulsion which is currently undisclosed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've possibly set up a moon base, though there is possibly little of value there, and we also know it's a very harsh environment (for equipment etc).
      </p>

       I find it difficult to believe the US military black budget of the size in the order of $52b EACH YEAR [2]  doesn't afford a space program. That's 2.5 x NASA's total budget. [3]
      </p>
      <p>
       If we assume there are black programs of the level of technology (in today's terms) that gave us the U-2 and SR-71 in the 60/70's, we should be able to expect there are undisclosed propulsion systems, and technology that afford easy space flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the it is US military doctrine for 'total spectrum dominance' which includes " terrestrial, aerial, maritime, subterranean,
       <em>
        extraterrestrial
       </em>
       , psychological, and bio- or cyber-technological warfare". [4]  I think it's pretty clear the US has total dominance in all of those, but we don't see anything about the US military putting people in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also feasible that some form of zero-point energy has been developed [5], which affords the US military the ability to circumvent traditional space launch.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact if we believe what we're told, the US has no means of putting people in space, and relies on Russian rockets.  This just doesn't align with US military doctrine, or advances in technology used by the military, or the black budget. Which is why I don't believe what we're told.
      </p>
      <p>
       I conclude that the US military has people in space and travelling further than the moon, regularly, because the Solar Warden program exists.

         had an immense space race that lead

         to be the first nation on the moon.

         never went with a manned mission to the moon, despite having the first successful outer space journey with Yuri Gagarin.
         <strong>
          USA
         </strong>
         on the other hand,
         <em>

        <p>
         All of the manned missions to the moon was american, and occured between 1968 and 1972, all manned moon missions happened in the span of
         <em>
          four years

         After these manned missions
         <strong>
          USSR
         </strong>
         were more than happy just staying away from the moon (with manned missions), and ironically the space race led to
         <strong>
          USA
         </strong>
         and
         <strong>
          USSR

         eventually co-operate the biggest space station in orbit around earth, the ISS.

         We have since sent many probes and rockets, and
         <strong>
          China
         </strong>
         sent the Chang'e 3 rover in 2014. Still, we  don't really have any

       The moon missions were part PR and part science. Both of which were pretty much used up.
      </p>
      <p>
       We beat the Russians to the moon that was a big deal back then. The enthusiasm of the public was huge at first but as time passed the public wasn't as impressed as it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       We learned quite a bit from the samples collected and the science that was done. Obviously, it isn't everything that we could learn but since a trip to the moon is hugely expensive you have to balance investment with the expected results. We probably wouldn't learn anything worth the expense of sending any more men to the moon.

       Don't assume everyone who doesn't agree with you is a shill. There's a difference between brigading shills that try to slide the discussion and start troll fights and people who simply have a different point of view than you.

       remember
       <strong>
        the Moon is 250,000 miles UP
       </strong>
       , its not over there or somewhere else. its
       <strong>
        UP
       </strong>
       with all the gravity and orbital speed problems that go with that scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       we do not travel to the Moon, we climb up to it, then have to match its orbital speed and then inject into orbit while doing so.

      <p>
       I seem to remember many moons ago (sic) that kids shows and others including computer games/sims, used to suggest that one launches and then go so far then coasts then retro fires rockets to slow down. this is a story for five year olds.

       Orbital mechanics are not immediately intuitive, but you can grab a simulator or a half-decent game which incorporates orbital mechanics to get a feel for it. Odds are those kids shows are more accurate to the real situation than the scenario you seem to be painting in those first lines.
