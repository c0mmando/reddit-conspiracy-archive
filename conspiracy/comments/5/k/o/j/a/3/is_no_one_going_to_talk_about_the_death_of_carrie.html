       alex jones claims Carrie fisher was murdered for book sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       probably not far off....
      </p>
      <p>
       i personally believe that Carrie fisher had some additional "dirt" on the cast / crew... and was going to write a tell all... that would have potentially damaged the USD 4 Billion Star Warsâ„¢ brand.  And Disney wasn't about to roll the dice on that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       hard to imagine how a heart attack gun could be smuggled on board a plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       that said, bribery exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       and a plane is the perfect place for a "heart attack" -- no one to come to your aid for hours, potentially.

       what about george michael? i mean the guy dies on christmas day = "last christmas". if you wanted to create some nice big human interest stories to fill the festive news cycle u couldnt do any better than these two. go check the msm news. bbc news is now just these two celeb stories.

       She was killed for ticket sales and emotional anchoring. Literally my parents went to watch star wars. Means nothing...except both of them refused to see force awakens because they were huge fans of the originals and didnt like the forced minority character placements. They didn't want to see rogue one either....until Fischer dies. Now they are going for nostalgia and I'm sure this is the case for a multitude of other people. $$$ also with the tragic event they will be reminded when the sequel comes out. The the next sequel and the eventual prequel to the sequel. Soft psy ops.

       Do you really think I am gonna believe the AHA? They do not help people one bit with heart problems. All they do is take peoples money so they can get rich. They may be under the guise of non-profit but it does not make it true. Those type of orgs actually pay people to manage their money, taxes, advertising, printing etc. while the volunteers get nothing for their help and dedication. When has an org like this actually helped anyone try and get the help they need when they have no money for doctor visits or inssurance ? Never. So you wanna quote a corrupt system like that by all means then quote them.  But here is where I quote them.

       Their mission statement: 
What We Do: To improve the lives of all Americans, we provide public health education in a variety of ways. Weâ€™re the nationâ€™s leader in CPR education training. We help people understand the importance of healthy lifestyle choices. We provide science-based treatment guidelines to healthcare professionals to help them provide quality care to their patients. We educate lawmakers, policymakers and the public as we advocate for changes to protect and improve the health of our communities.
      </p>

       In no way, does it actually say they help people. This is an organization that does not help people find a good doctor for treatment and help them pay when they have no money or insurance to pay for it. I know many people who make too much money to get insurance through the state for free or even be able to afford obamacare cause they make too much money. The world is run by a bunch of dicks who will say and do anything except actually help people just for a quick buck. You are barking up the wrong tree  buddy. Nice try though.

       Get a life and leave me alone. I know all I need to know about heart disease so no I do not need a lesson in it. My mom died three weeks before Christmas, 10 years ago, from a massive heart attack. And guess what the doctors had her on several medicines that were known to cause heart problems such as darvocet and pradaxa. And just so you know darvocet is a non-opiod pain reliever that was pulled from distribution because of the heart problems and deaths from it. So why should i trust mainstream medicine when they put these drugs out without properly studying them ?  Mainstream medicine is killing people on a daily basis. I took care of my mom for 10 years before she died also. She was 52. way too young to die.

       I'm sorry you lost your mom, I to have lost mine. I'm sorry if you feel I was attacking you or being rude. You asked me for proof so I gave it. You didn't like the first links I posted because they were from the AHA. So I posted different links showing  the coralation between this time of year and heart attacks.
Edit* also darvocet was an opioid.

       Ha well, to be honest I've never seen Star Wars, is there something specifically correlated between the Death Star and Princess Lea. Also, for the correlation to truly be fishy you'd have to look and see how often Star Wars employees have done AMAs. I would imagine for a franchise that popular that someone from the projects in Doing an AMA at any one month.

       Could be connected, just needs more research!
