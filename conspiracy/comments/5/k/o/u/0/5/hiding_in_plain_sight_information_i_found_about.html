       I mean we seed our clouds in order to help get more rain water...And weather is just the exchanging of energy on it's most basic level.

      <p>
       I think at this point it's ignorant to think man is 'incapable' of affecting anything of the natural order. Nature is based in math...or math is based in nature (whichever came first) and anything that follows the laws of nature (or math) can be understood, unraveled, and put back together.

       Known of this paper for decades. William Thomas lives in my neck of the woods and I have been observing the weather modification for decades. I have gone from being ridiculed to hearing others state what I was aware of since the mid 90s.

       Of course we will try to control and manipulate our weather. It would be a natural progression of our advancement. Of course they would keep it a secret. Can't take responsibility for any and all accidents that will occur.

       Dr Bernard Eastlund (the one time patent holder of HAARP) upon selling his patent to the US Navy was given a 10 gag order. Once this lifted he came forward and spoke of the abilities of this tech. He was dead in less than a year.  The effects range from over the horizon comms to weather alteration and jet stream manipulation to creating earthquakes.

       The US has been using the weather as a weapon since the Vietnam War when cloud seeding was used to flood the Ho Chi Minh trail. Your links are broken but the document you refer to hasn't been 'Hiding in plain sight'.... It's been out there for anyone to view for years. And there's nothing in it which refers in any way to so-called 'chemtrails'.

 he's a nasty little troll ... he'll misunderstand everything you say and conflate it .. than he'll format his reply piece by piece like a pro aND cHerry pick .. very crafty.... he's scoured all the resources on geo engineering and has made up his mind

       I have never said that contrails are 100 percent safe. Never. I frequently mention they bad effect they are having on the environment. They block sunlight during the day and trap infra red heat at night. But they are not poisonous.

       Do I ever sound like I am defending geoengineering? I think it is madness to tinker with the weather. Cloud busting just moves rain from one place (read: poor area) to another (read: wealthy area), and the ideas being discussed for Solar Radiation Management are like something out of Dr Strangelove.

       anyone who isn't completely brainwashed can see they hit the major cities heavily right before some major shit goes down, clearly something is in the chemicals that affect the mental health of the masses, maybe even containing viruses in addition to the aluminum and barium.  if they did want to try to reverse the global warming, gold would work 1000x better than aluminum and coal ash.

       If you're spraying chemicals on the air it's a 'chemtrail'. I know cloud seeding seems innocuous, but some of the chemical combos they use are not. And the MSM saying everything is a normal contrail when they are obviously spraying for weather mod, i.e. They are chemtrails, is super misleading.

       Really? I thought chemtrails were those long white clouds that come out of airplanes. Your definition seems to be: "Any weird shit in the sky that I don't understand". FYI the chemicals used in cloud busting include silver nitrate, dry ice, and common builders cement. And the process is done at low altitude. Spraying anything at six miles altitude would be pointless as there's no weather up there to affect. Aircraft contrails are not part of any deliberate attempt to control the weather, but they are having a serious effect anyway because they cut down sunlight. So no, nobody is "Obviously spraying for weather mod".

       Nah. Just pointing out that while you lot are all "Looking up" at the contrails, the mad scientists are getting on with their twisted plans to fill the Stratosphere with sulphides. But, don't let me get in the way of your silly chemtrail fear porn.
