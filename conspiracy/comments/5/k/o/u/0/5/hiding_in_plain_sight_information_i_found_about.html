<p>I think at this point it&#39;s ignorant to think man is &#39;incapable&#39; of affecting anything of the natural order. Nature is based in math...or math is based in nature (whichever came first) and anything that follows the laws of nature (or math) can be understood, unraveled, and put back together. </p>

<p>Known of this paper for decades. William Thomas lives in my neck of the woods and I have been observing the weather modification for decades. I have gone from being ridiculed to hearing others state what I was aware of since the mid 90s. </p>

<p>Of course we will try to control and manipulate our weather. It would be a natural progression of our advancement. Of course they would keep it a secret. Can&#39;t take responsibility for any and all accidents that will occur. </p>

<p>Dr Bernard Eastlund (the one time patent holder of HAARP) upon selling his patent to the US Navy was given a 10 gag order. Once this lifted he came forward and spoke of the abilities of this tech. He was dead in less than a year.  The effects range from over the horizon comms to weather alteration and jet stream manipulation to creating earthquakes. </p>

<p>NASA and the US milatary have both outright stated that high altitude releases of particulate would mitigate the loss of the ozone. They said this decades ago </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re spraying chemicals on the air it&#39;s a &#39;chemtrail&#39;. I know cloud seeding seems innocuous, but some of the chemical combos they use are not. And the MSM saying everything is a normal contrail when they are obviously spraying for weather mod, i.e. They are chemtrails, is super misleading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&lt;If you&#39;re spraying chemicals on the air it&#39;s a &#39;chemtrail&#39;</p>

<p>Really? I thought chemtrails were those long white clouds that come out of airplanes. Your definition seems to be: &quot;Any weird shit in the sky that I don&#39;t understand&quot;. FYI the chemicals used in cloud busting include silver nitrate, dry ice, and common builders cement. And the process is done at low altitude. Spraying anything at six miles altitude would be pointless as there&#39;s no weather up there to affect. Aircraft contrails are not part of any deliberate attempt to control the weather, but they are having a serious effect anyway because they cut down sunlight. So no, nobody is &quot;Obviously spraying for weather mod&quot;.</p>
