    <div class="md"><p>nkusa.org is a group of rabbis who are anti-Israel in a very big way. Very religious Jews who are not down with Israel at all, with lots of specific historical reasons why. They are the experts, and it&#39;s more than can be typed into a hundred reddit comments.<br/>
They are very nice and will share info on whatever questions you have. They like spreading the word of peace. I mostly despise religion, but they are a hip crowd of academics. They are the biggest PR threat to Israel, around. They are very active in NY, almost every day picketing the UN, and organizing. The mass media does not want anyone to know about this particular group of Jews. The &#39;&#39;liberal&#39;&#39; fringe media never even heard of them, and would be in for a shitstorm if they gave them publicity.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Most history is bent if not broken. Especially if you learn it from a single source, usually the source provided to you by your government and educational institutions.</p>

<p>Nuremberg was a joke and they call it a show trial for a reason. Because it was fake. The testimony was ridiculous and outrageous, the documentation was forged. Most documentation out of Germany and Russia was never used because it proved otherwise or was withheld. Torture to gain confessions. etc...</p>

<p>The simple fact is that the Allies bombed Germany well after the war was over to maximize casualties and then took pictures of cut-off camps after the bodies piled up. These deaths are a result of the Allies actions. There is documentation by IBM and the IRC that prove that the camps in NSDAP controlled Europe were towns and POW camps and nothing more. And there has never been more than hearsay, second-hand testimony claiming ridiculous stories by jewish &quot;survivors&quot; of extermination. Most of the stories are impossible and insane.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that there weren&#39;t executions and death squads that were used to eliminated enemies within Europe during wartime. I&#39;m saying that the extermination of a people didn&#39;t happen and it is a delusion created by a psychotic people who want attention and money. The real genocide of WW2 was in Ukraine and carried out by the heirs to the Bolshevik (&quot;Russian&quot;) Revolution. It&#39;s called Holodomor, not holocaust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a vast majority of them have a psychotic delusion much like their Semitic brothers. If you&#39;ve seen any footage of the average hebrew civilian in Palestine, they are batshit crazy. They are the product of a twisted government and a twisted culture that oppresses while thinking they are the victims. They always have been this. </p>

<p>Russia, Germany, America, Palestine. All victims of these people and the narrative always remains the same. In Russia they were being oppressed by Russian nationalism so they had the Bolshevik revolution and committed genocide against the Slavs, got rid of Christianity and created and Atheist state that favored their business practices. In Germany they worked under the Treaty of Versailles and mocked and abused the Germans in the media and on the streets financially from the top to the middle and committed genocide against Europe because the Allies wouldn&#39;t take their refuges who came from Russia and were turned away by Germany. America has sacrificed it&#39;s nationalism to them as well and sacrificed many soldiers to fight their wars against the people they are committing genocide against now and tomorrow. Mass death to make way for their egos.</p>

<p>And no, a holocaust didn&#39;t happen. That&#39;s soviet propaganda and not supported by the facts.</p>

<p>And no, the jews weren&#39;t persecuted for what they did in WW2. They have never been punished rather rewarded by reparations. They were persecuted for what they did before and after WW1 in Germany and most of Europe and Russia.</p>

The US then feels perpetually responsible for them because they were the main victims of the war. Also there is the strong religious support from middle America.

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure Holocaust wasn&#39;t a hoax though. Potentially exaggerated maybe. I&#39;ve read a lot about it on ask historians and they&#39;re usually pretty good and the Holocaust is far enough away that historians take a different angle (especially of negative retellings of USA foreign policy)</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to see the Holocaust victims in Jews, you can hear from many survivors, many confessions from Nazis. Genocide happens often. Now, does the Israeli state use the Holocaust as an excuse to do horrible shit? Yes. Just like any western country tbh but Israel is definitely one of the worst because of the Diaspora of wealthy, powerful Jewish people </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where exactly is the evidence of this mythical talmudic number of 6 million Jews who were supposedly targeted by the Nazis and subject to vicious forms of torture and death like gas chambers? </p>

<p>When I was in high school, I kept coming across this phrase used to describe the Germans, &quot;incredibly efficient killers and torturers&quot; in various forms in both mainstream history books and lectures. The whole time, I was being repeatedly drilled with the idea that these Nazis were incredibly efficient and ruthless. It was only just two years ago that I turned all this around and wondered, how much effort and resources would have been required for the Nazis to ensure the complete eradication of six million Jews.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s have a little fun with mathematics shall we? (my favorite pastime!)</p>

<p>It is repeatedly regurgitated by Zionists that 6 million Jews were killed and cremated over a 4 year period. 6,000,000 divided by 4 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 gives us the number of people killed per second. The reciprocal gives us the number of seconds taken to cremate one person.</p>

<p><strong>That&#39;s one person killed, then carried out of the chamber, then cremated almost every 21 seconds.</strong> Please keep in mind that a modern crematorium takes somewhere between 1-3 hours to completely turn a corpse to ash (older ones took much longer). Do you realize how mathematically impossible and implausible that is?</p>

<p>What is required to properly cremate a corpse? Do you realize how enormous this project would be? The sheer amount of coke, dehydration, fuel etc. is enough to make you question WHAT IN THE HELL WERE THE GERMANS THINKING IF THEY ARE CLAIMED TO BE THESE &quot;INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT KILLERS&quot;? Guess what my friend, Hitler and the Germans wanted to win the war... So why the hell would they divert these massive resources to such a nonsensical plan?</p>

<p>Where are the massive factories of death? Where&#39;s are the huge arrays of crematory ovens? How in the hell did energy-starved Germans fuel those ovens? <strong>You should recall, Germany had a resource-hungry two-front war they were fighting, and the Allies ever so righteously bombed German infrastructure and supply lines, both civilian and military to cut off resources of war for Germans... Wouldn&#39;t you think that ramping up factories of mass murder, in order to kill your slave laborers, would have been the most counterproductive thing they could have done?</strong> All this time, we keep hearing how Germans were these EFFICIENT KILLERS, very adept and EFFICIENT in their methods of supposed torture and genocide... Do you realize how much labor would be required to move six million corpses into those crematoriums and/or those mythical gas chambers? Do you think these &quot;EFFICIENT&quot; Germans would be so retarded as to divert massive labor and effort into this incredibly inefficient plan? Again, I remind you, Hitler and the Germans were in it to win the war! Not enact some mythical Talmudic mass-extermination of Jews.</p>

<p>EDIT: Minor grammatical errors. Also used star instead of x turning the numbers to italics LUL</p>

<p>EDIT 2: One little thing I should clarify. Am I denying that people, including Jews, underwent horrors of war? Not one bit. The fact of the matter is, these &quot;concentration camps&quot; were SLAVE LABOR camps, which were designed to feed into the German war machine. I&#39;m contesting the claim that Jewish massacres took place as a result of &quot;the Final Plan&quot; in these camps, on the order of Hitler (adorably enough, no mention of a Jewish HoloHoax is ever found when one examines the memoirs of presidents and prime ministers like Churchill and FDR LOL).</p>

<p>A majority of those killed in the Holocaust died of disease or starvation, not gas.</p>

<p>More, the &quot;21 second&quot; thing seems unreasonable expressed that way, but it is not when you see it as ~180 people killed per hour or ~4000 people killed per day.  Remember, there were 1200 concentration camps by the least estimate, and up to 40,000 &quot;detainment centers&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that the Battle of Stalingrad had two million casualties in five months - that&#39;s one casualty (which includes people seriously wounded) every five seconds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jews were in no way the &quot;main victims of the war&quot;. They weren&#39;t even close.</p>

<p>20 million Russians alone died.</p>

<p>I bet you don&#39;t even know how many Chinese died, Japanese died, Germans died...</p>

<p>But we all know the bogus 6 million figure of Jewish deaths. The question is why? Why was there a holocaust museum in Washington DC before there was even a WWII memorial to all the G.I.s that died?</p>

<p>Why, if the Germans wanted to exterminate Jews would they spend hundreds of millions of dollars building camps, employing guards and supporting the vast infrastructure required to house and home millions of Jews. And then, for no explicable reason, gas them?</p>

<p>Why not save all that time and money, spend 5 million on 7.62mm rifle ammo and shoot them all. Job done.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because the whole thing is bullshit.</p>

<p>The US interned Japanese in camps after Pearl Harbor and the Germans interned Jews after September 1939. Both groups, rightly or wrongly, were viewed as possible subversives behind enemy lines.</p>

<p>The only difference?</p>

<p>The Germans lost the war, their supply lines were bombed to dust, food production was non existent and all those dead emaciated Jews  you see on the old news reals were people who died of starvation after Germany had no functioning infrastructure. German civilians died in droves too.</p>

<p>The holocaust and gas chambers is a complete hoax perpetuated after the war by vindictive Soviets and a West that needed a moral reason to justify the destruction of Europe.</p>

<p>At most, and according to Red Cross records., 250-300k Jews died in the war. Though a tragedy, where&#39;s the memorial in Washington DC for Dresden (50k dead) and Hiroshima and Nagasaki (150k dead).</p>

<p>All of it is Jewish media propagated lies and Schindlers List is bullshit. Jews won WWII. They got Israel out of it and 100 million non Jews died.</p>

<p>Where&#39;s their Schindler&#39;s List Hollywood movie lament?</p>

<p>Nowhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, this is actually true.</p>

<p>the attack on the Liberty for example - was a false flag. Egypt was supposed to take the blame for sinking of the ship and this would have allowed LBJ to invade and take control of the Suez Canal. It failed because the Israeli fighter pilots and gunboats recognized the American flag and refused to continue the attack.</p>

<p>the US did take control of the Suez Canal 10 years later following a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt that also saw the US become the benefactor of Egypt - essentially controlling the country and its strategic waterway.</p>

<p>The 1973 October/Yom Kipur war that led to the peace agreement was also a false-flag orchestrated by the United States (namely Henry Kissinger). Essentially the then newly established Egyptian leader made a deal with HK that he will switch sides (from USSR to US) if the US helps him strike a blow against Israel - and that&#39;s exactly what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is actually true - the IAF fighter pilot quoted was just giving the cover story because Israel could not admit that  it attacked a US ship at the request of LBJ and McNamara - it&#39;s also the reason why McNamara told the 6th fleet commander to stand down the jets that were supposed to assist the Liberty - (mentioned in the link you provided).</p>

<p>it was a false flag and the radio comms show both fighters and sailors were very reluctant to continue the attack after identifying the star spangled banner - they had to be strictly ordered to attack again by their commanders and even then were very reluctant to do so and at some point actually refused to carry out their orders.</p>

&quot;..... do not be afraid of bad Mr Friedman. He is likely to do a lot of good. And definitely he can’t make things any worse. Nobody believes the Jews will give some parts of Palestine to Palestinians, anyway. So let them take all of it and make it a democracy. This will undo the Zionist enterprise faster and better than any war can do.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>$10.4 million per day, you say?</p>

<p>I find it interesting that, following Friday&#39;s UN Security Council vote condemning Israel&#39;s settlement activity (the first <em>Israel unfriendly</em> UNSC vote since 1979), Netanyahu vowed to STOP FUNDING UN programs.</p>

<p>Jerusalem Post:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Benjamin-Netanyahu/Netanyahu-Israel-will-stop-funding-the-UNs-institutions-476412">&#39;Israel to stop funding UN institutions&#39;</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israel will not accept the decision and it will be cancelled, he stated, though it may take time. <strong>He also stated that Israel would stop funding UN institutions.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, how much HAS Israel been giving to the UN?</p>

<p>Well, according to this <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/contributions/honourroll.shtml">United Nations page</a>, it looks like Israel &quot;gives&quot; the UN about <strong>$10.7 million PER YEAR</strong> (see line item #13).</p>

<p>So, Israel&#39;s ANNUAL contributions to the UN is about the same as the US gives Israel EVERY DAY.</p>

<p>Boo Hoo!</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>I, for one, find it very disheartening that so few Jews - whether Israeli or &#39;foreign&#39; - have the balls to stand up and condemn the Zionist Machine.</p>

<p>This may be because they <em>fully agree</em> with Zionist policy, or it may be because they are fearful of the backlash that they would receive from their fellow Jews...</p>

<p>In any case, dissent in silence is no dissent at all, and when and if shit hits the fan (G-d Forbid!), their absence of backbone may come back to bite them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s messed up some honestly do and it&#39;s great it warms hearts watching you almost tear up than forget they have no voice when compared to the majority</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This may be because </p>

<p>they fully agree with Zionist policy</p>

<p>Honestly most do it&#39;s fact they feel they have a obligation to support what they believe are &quot;jews&quot; and they just want to visit the &quot;land&quot; they consider &quot;holy&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame half of em </p>

<p>But the truth is most younger jew blindly support because they don&#39;t have any idea or maby don&#39;t care that they&#39;re in the wrong (not the jews) but the Illegal occupiers who commit the acts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>, or it may be because they are fearful of the backlash that they would receive from their fellow Jews...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also true from most of the older very noble jews who are outspoken they face backlash from either the zionist state itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if shit hits the fan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have a samson option sothat show you how morally corrupt they are they will probly die some of them if they speak</p>

<p>as they have a history of poisoning people (Yasser Arafat ; Pulonium 21) </p>

<p>Allegedly zionists poisoned (Stalin with Warfarin) but i don&#39;t believe it was organized in some sort of contortment.</p>

<p>aswell as (FDR he died from the same Brain hemehragging as Yasser Arafat who died of Pulonium 210)</p>

<p>JFK even died four months after announcing he&#39;d like to have nuclear weapons inspectors visit the dimona plant in the zionist state</p>

<p>The prime minister of the zionist state even resigned so he wouldn&#39;t have to refuse.</p>

<p>If you bring this sort of stuff up even the most open minded person would label you a anti you know what</p>

<p>Or younger non zionistic zionist supporters will attack them for what they believe is there right to occupy another people land because they supposedly lived there once </p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly sad on both ends but i don&#39;t know why we don&#39;t allow the native americans to reoccupy the land they once lived on.</p>

<p>So why  should we repatriate a group of people from a kingdom that was dismantled in the era that &quot;wars were commmon&quot;, &quot;kingdoms came and went&quot; and there was almost &quot;no diplomacy as we know it today&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like they were enslaved</p>

<p>And it was the romans who allegedly kicked them out
But it&#39;s still sad</p>

<p>In any case, dissent in silence is no dissent at all, and when and if shit hits the fan (G-d Forbid!), their absence of backbone may come back to bite them.</p>

<p>SIEG HEIL</p>

<p>NO nazi</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They stole nukes from French government against the orders of De Gaulle. It was a big treason that nobody seems to remember... Actually sometimes (rarely) there is a documentary on it on TV (<del>public channels meaning financed by taxes and ads</del>) but it&#39;s like people don&#39;t care at all of what&#39;s going on 10 miles from them but will start complaining when it backfires at their face. Latest example: Syria. We supported the bad guys from the start and now we&#39;re like what the fuck, refugees go back home... Terrorists what do you want? You hate our freedom that&#39;s why you attack us.. What fucking freedom??? We&#39;re all as propaganded as North Koreans in some kind of way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most shocking part is Israel did 911. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you! Mad dog indeed!</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick. Only bad magicians use CG. The Israelis planted real explosives in the WTC but used CG to make it appear &quot;hijacked planes&quot; flew into them. Want proof?</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the United States supports Israel:</p>

<p>The United States was built upon Christian fundamentals. Ingrained into the making of the laws. Israel, especially Jerusalem, is to  Christians what Mecca is to Muslims. Jesus was a Jew. Most of the people in the Bible were Jews. </p>

<p>Strategically, it&#39;s like having a good friend nearby who has your back whenever shit goes down aka when you have to fight. Israel is our best friend who&#39;s surrounded by enemies. It gives the United States a base to land planes in any potential Middle Eastern war. </p>

<p>God forbid WW3 were to break out but the United States, Russia and Israel have 99% of the nuclear weapons out there. The United States and Israel would be allies in any potential WW3. </p>

<p>And just to put it plainly, Jewish people, for the most part, have white skin. To put it even more bluntly, hold a gun up to a white supremacist and make them choose which person out of a Jew, Black, Hispanic, Native American, etc they would fuck. They would have to choose. They&#39;ll always pick the Jew. </p>

<p>I could go on but you get the point.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Though it&#39;s a nice thing to hate Jews as it&#39;s really easy, the money is part of Israel-Egypt peace agreement. Egypt gets money too*.</p>

<p>The money we get is then re-invested in American companies and it&#39;s being used to co-develop military technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>While I cannot deny the holocaust happened,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does everyone who mentions Hiltler have to say the above?  Like it&#39;s programmed for everyone to say it in some form that &quot;the holocaust happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Very strange indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure Holocaust wasn&#39;t a hoax though. Potentially exaggerated maybe. I&#39;ve read a lot about it on ask historians and they&#39;re usually pretty good and the Holocaust is far enough away that historians take a different angle (especially of negative retellings of USA foreign policy)</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to see the Holocaust victims in Jews, you can hear from many survivors, many confessions from Nazis. Genocide happens often. Now, does the Israeli state use the Holocaust as an excuse to do horrible shit? Yes. Just like any western country tbh but Israel is definitely one of the worst because of the Diaspora of wealthy, powerful Jewish people </p>
