<p>Not a single one has straight out asked him what happened.  The most recent interview they ask &quot;has internet been restored?&quot; he says &quot;yes&quot; and then they move fucking on!  </p>

<p>I dont get it.  </p>

<p>Why has not a single person asked him about the POL, or PGP keys, or the supposed compromising of WL, or why he cant walk to the window, or Kerry threatening the embassy, or what happened on Oct, or what those 3 files they &quot;threatened leaking&quot; were, or his relationship with Pamela Anderson etc....</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t this the first question asked in all 5 fucking interviews/</p>

<p>Where are you?  What happened Oct 17?  Whats going on now?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why not just say that straight out.  Either him or the interviewer.  In the article or in person.  &quot;I dont wish to discuss POL or my location or what happened Oct 17th&quot;.  Or &quot;Full disclosure: Mr Assange asked me not to ask him or not to publish information about his whereabouts or what happened Oct 17th&quot;.  Both would be sufficient.  </p>

<p>After all he&#39;s perfectly capable of saying &quot;I dont wish to discuss this, lets move on to another topic&quot;.  In fact he did that when Hannity asked him multiple times about his sources and Assange repeatedly said &quot;WL does not discuss source information&quot; and his tone of voice was clear, he wasnt budging on the issue and wanted to move on to other topics&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ultimately i just find it wierd none of the interviews so far have even addressed it publicly.  </p>

<p>Theres been a ton of bizarre stuff going on since Oct 17.  None of it has been addressed in interviews since.  Id love to hear JA&#39;s opinion and the facts about what happened and whats going on (if you believe he&#39;s alive).  </p>

<p>I find it frustrating.  And annoying.  If he&#39;s alive and safe and his internet is back on, he has no reason to not talk about what occurred.  And the interviewers, if they are educated, know we all were and are still worried about him and his safety.  </p>

<p>All these interviews are focused on the election, which is understandable to an extent, but, I think I can speak for most people on this sub and say if somehow we got to talk to assange right now, today, my first question to him sure as fuck wouldn&#39;t be Julian, what do you think about Trump and Hillary?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so why not just say that?  &quot;A note to our readers or viewers: JA wants to keep his location private for his own safety and will explain at a later date&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And to all WL supporters I know youve been worried about me for the past few months and wondering how Ive been and whats been going on.  I will explain in the future but for now, for my own safety and security I prefer to not reveal my location and any other info&quot;</p>

<p>It would take seconds for WL to tweet this, for JA to say it himself or get another WL official to say something on his behalf.  Or to have a reporter who is interviewing you make this statement to start the article.  Or Pilger could have said it himself first thing, first few seconds of the interview.  </p>

<p>How hard is it to say it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This all might make more sense for you if you looked at things from his point of view rather than yours. Perhaps the opposition is not sure whether he is still in the Embassy or not and he wants to keep things that way. We know nothing -- he could perhaps have done a bunk in late October and perhaps the Embassy itself is not confirming things either way, they have no obligation to do so. Therefore the opposition is looking for every clue they can find to prove his location. Certainly the internet and the Embassy communications are being watched closely for any peep that will give him away. If you look at things that way every visit and supposed &quot;PoL&quot; has been a vastly successful spoof to confuse the opposition which, unfortunately, confuses his friends also. A strangely bending shirt collar suggests to his friends that the tape was faked, but it also suggests the same thing to the opposition, that he is not in the Embassy at all and the tape was faked. Works both ways. To be safe the opposition now has to keep an eye on the Embassy and the rest of the UK at the same time. If they know he is in the Embassy they only have to watch that location. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I knew that I would be smarter than his crew which I am not but I can make a case that he is alive either in the Embassy or alive somewhere else. First point, why is anyone wasting time on this matter if he is dead? He can&#39;t effect anything if he is dead so why pretend he is not? How would Wikleaks be effected? A certain drop in morale but let&#39;s face it, a high proportion of his supporters suspect he is dead in any case. And what could they do about it? How would the opposition be effected? A job done and the chance to depart the scene discretely if they have cleaned up the mess. So, ergo, if anybody still cares about him he is alive.</p>

<p>Now, I suspect he is in the Embassy behind a good smoke screen but I would prefer it if he actually had given the opposition the slip and he is now in a safe house awaiting a fishing boat to Iceland. The latter makes a much more exciting story and provides a better reason why there has been no PoL.</p>
