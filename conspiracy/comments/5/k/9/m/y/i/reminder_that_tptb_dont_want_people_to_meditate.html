        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe meditation, astral projection and remote viewing are powerful tools to learn about our true history and please don&#39;t doubt that there&#39;s a war happening.</p>

<p>Meditated hours everyday for months I was like between worlds for a while, saw an angelic realm with thousands of clear beings, floated from body, got attacked twice by really scary entity sounds then they induced depression/suicidal thoughts for couple months with tech.</p>

<p>Got banned from a new and strangely active Iranian spiritual (occult) forum that advertised Crowley and demon summoning way too much just for recommending a book. Shortly after they showed me an eye of Horus when I closed my eyes.</p>

<p>Then went through Eve Lorgen&#39;s bullshit reptilian possession experience (they changed the info since) after getting sucked in by Donald Marshall&#39;s bullshit theories, they squeezed my heart about 20 times for 2 days, an AI spoke through me, made me cry like pushing a button, showed a virtual reality dream of being tied and stabbed in the throat and got tortured bad for a few months after to try and get me institutionalized. I typed in google I won&#39;t go crazy to let them know (they&#39;ve tried different things by finding out things I&#39;d said on skype or at my friends house) the night they let up I heard a handler say &#39;she said she&#39;s not going crazy&#39;. Around then a Nordic contacted me to encourage me and handlers sounded pissed (also channeller Bashar is disinfo, that&#39;s not how aliens communicate but it&#39;s what the tech they use to cause forced speech is like, it can also control eye movement, lot of celebrities eyes move in different directions during interviews which is kind of a scary thought. edit: holy crap I just remembered Bashar keeps his eyes closed when he &#39;channels&#39;)</p>

<p>I&#39;m connected to a program 24/7 that tortures me after almost every activity (worse for stuff it doesn&#39;t like) like when I read, draw, while I type certain stuff, when people upvote me, when I get facebook notifications, when I meditate and am between sleep/wake state so I don&#39;t astral project, sometimes when strangers talk to me or just look at me and they been affecting my life covertly for years by various methods and stalk me often.</p>

<p>Join the weekly global meditation every Sunday 4 pm GMT if you can (I feel a lot of energy when it happens, sometimes from a day before): <a href="http://2012portal.blogspot.com/2016/08/make-this-viral-weekly-ascension.html">http://2012portal.blogspot.com/2016/08/make-this-viral-weekly-ascension.html</a></p>

<p>Just btw I posted this before and deleted it soon after and they tortured me pretty bad for it...</p>

<p>(Don&#39;t bother trying to convert me with Jesus stuff and yeah sure I&#39;m schizophrenic and I need to give money for medication, whatever you say.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God damn they&#39;re upping their responses...</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure of the targeting, thankfully I knew a doctor I could trust, I told her everything and she gave me some pills to deal with anxiety from the constant tortures (cuz she understood how this tech could theoretically work and she too was wrongfully prosecuted for other political reasons) but I stopped taking them after a short while as I found out I don&#39;t need synthetic drugs. I&#39;ve spent time and effort to heal since and I&#39;m fine now, it was too much of a psychological shock when I had just found out everything and they tortured me bad for a few months to try and get me institutionalized. I suffer mostly from others suffering and all I ever wanted was to help the world, call it illusions of grandeur or whatever you want, this is my life-long goal and I won&#39;t stop until I&#39;m dead.</p>

<p>what? </p>

<p>and btw people are dying to try and get the truth out, I haven&#39;t intentionally disinformed if I have at all...am tortured with directed energy weapons daily and gangstalked in Iran at 22 :/ I have faith people can discern for themselves what is true or not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kind of you. I do have various hobbies, one of them happens to be raising awareness about targeted individuals. I&#39;m not very fond of Reddit is probably why there&#39;s not much variety to my posts. I do believe people need to be making the reality of the corruption more obvious cuz, and it makes me extremely sad, but there are way too many people who are cut off from their emotions and don&#39;t give a damn about others suffering. There needs to be a massive change on this planet :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before posting I was pondering about the title, maybe I should&#39;ve gone with: I want to encourage skeptics to meditate and have your own experiences if you think other intelligent life forms don&#39;t exist. But I wanted to make the corruption more obvious.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what this entire thread seems like.</p>

<p>IMO you&#39;re wrong and I&#39;m telling people of my covert tortures cuz it&#39;s covert and wrong and this is a conspiracy sub. I&#39;m tortured with directed energy weapons everyday...I like making corruption obvious sorry if that bothers you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I agree with you. Thanks for that link, also. I&#39;ve been falling into ruminating about external influence on my mental state but am fairly certain it&#39;s all of my own doing. Thus, I agree that OP is also creating their own experience of perceived psychological torture caused by external sources. </p>

<p>Now, whether OP is a disinfo source or has been caught up in believing one, I can&#39;t say. I can say that the mind is so extremely powerful that it can torture itself merely by believing it is being tortured by something outside of its influence, etc... I could ramble on but the gist is that there would be almost no difference in symptoms between external &#39;directed energy attack&#39; and &#39;psycho-somatic false belief self-torture&#39;.  It&#39;s very hard to free oneself from one&#39;s own prison. </p>

<p>Thanks again for the link. Those sorts of instructions are very helpful in escaping the prison of the mind. I&#39;ve been lately trapping myself too often. </p>

<p>what?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m tortured with technology, all I&#39;m trying to do with this post is making more people aware that this happens so hopefully more people will get pissed and create a big push in our collective consciousness.</p>

<p>This information is pretty important IMO because they ruin certain people&#39;s lives covertly and the subject is trolled badly online. relevant post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ivqbw/targeted_individuals_the_most_important_issue_we/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ivqbw/targeted_individuals_the_most_important_issue_we/</a></p>

<p>edit: this poster asked me for my meditation method on another post, after explaining to him pretty thoroughly and mentioning twice that my tortures are caused by technology he goes on a pseudo spiritual rant trying to convince me that I&#39;m meditating wrong and he still refuses to accept this is happening to me so yeah...just be aware that shilling is a thing that happens a lot on this subject. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of the context in which the events occurred (my harassment was covert for years until I found out about it) thousands of other targeted individual testimonies, whistleblowers and also things are happening to me like my heart being squeezed 20 times in 2 days or causing forced speech in me...so I will NOT accept other people&#39;s &#39;opinions&#39; that I am not feeling instigated physical tortures (that is also spiked after certain activity) all I can say is this is a shitty thing to want to experience yourself to be able to only believe that it&#39;s happening to people and I feel sorry for you if that is the only way you can be convinced. </p>
