    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but for different reasons. Sometimes their interests overlap but many times they don&#39;t. The cultural Marxism pushed by the globalists has infected their own tribe so much that there are now many leftists Jews in and outside of Israel who want to dismantle it as a state. </p>

<p>Israel acts as a &quot;safe zone&quot; for them. I read an article recently about how Israel is becoming a safe haven for pedophiles. Considering they have hundreds of nukes the anti-zionist crowd isn&#39;t that big of a threat currently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, Google &quot;Iraq 1960s&quot; or any &quot;savage&quot; country in the ME. It looks like Europe. Wahhabism was dead until we got in bed with Saudis. </p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly so lost as to how the whole power structure works. </p>

<p>Is it banksters, Saudis, Zionists, Jesuits, satanists? </p>

<p>I&#39;m finding it harder and harder to believe their all in it together. Considering the recent fall out just within the Rothschild family. </p>

<p>I think the mutual pedophile/murder blackmail has them all in a stale-mate TBH. </p>
