    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right about the BPA thing. There are a multitude of other chemicals that act as endocrine disruptors and estrogen mimics.</p>

<p>So it kind of makes sense that we&#39;d see some wide scale effects. </p>

<p>As for elites, occultists and secret agendas? That one is open for debate. Is the whole chemical thing part of an agenda or one massive fuck up?</p>

<p>What I have read about in my own research is that the top occultists hate the male/female model of discrete genders. They want to break down traditional roles and blur/erase the lines between them. This is supposed to be why we&#39;re seeing homo and bi-sexuality being promoted. This is supposed to be why the mass media is promoting masculinized women and feminized men.</p>

<p>If someone wants to ignore this, that&#39;s their choice. If they want to disagree or disbelieve... same thing. </p>

<p>A lot of people have commented on this topic. My own take on this is that they&#39;re running an MKUltra type of program. But it&#39;s not directed at individuals like the original program. In this case it&#39;s aimed at society in general.</p>

<p>Same methods and goal though. Break down the target&#39;s identity by various means. This is done in order to create a completely new identity.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing with society. Just ask someone who&#39;s 70 years old how things used to be and they&#39;ll always tell you how much people have changed... how stuff that used to be unthinkable in their day is &quot;normal&quot; today.</p>

<p>I suspect that this is not a normal rate of social change... it&#39;s being imposed on us from above. If you&#39;re young, just stick around another 20 years and you&#39;ll see what I mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the feminism is promoted by top people as being a great thing. But what does it do?</p>

<p>To me, it seems like feminism tricks women into thinking it&#39;s better to see their needs as being different or separate from everybody else&#39;s. So a <em>potentially potent force for social change gets split into separate movements</em>. </p>

<p>Public health vs women&#39;s health + everybody else.</p>

<p>Employee rights vs the rights of female employees + those of everybody else.</p>

<p>Violence against women vs violence against anybody</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve got to wonder if feminism has been a success. If women had campaigned for similar changes together with everybody else in a unified, common cause... perhaps the world would be a much better place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re echoing something that i&#39;ve thought for a long while. Because it&#39;s such a sensitive subject it&#39;s not something that Trans folk often want to hear from non-trans people so i haven&#39;t brought it up to many but you hit the nail on the head i think.</p>

<p>They want people confused, they want to normalise what is really a tragedy for many kids caught in situations that make then suicidal. They want us fighting about how some people are just &quot;crazy&quot;, with no empathy toward the victims.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Christian and i&#39;m sad to see Christian groups falling in to one of the two traps surrounding the issue that &quot;They&quot; have orchestrated. We should have empathy and we should look for what&#39;s hurting our kids because it&#39;s not right that we have a generation coming of age that is trapped in chemical confusion and genetic manipulation that&#39;s hidden from their eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I respect your theories and research about modern chemicals being the cause, I have to respectfully disagree, with evidence.</p>

<p>There are anthropological accounts of transgenderism that predate chemical pollution of the body. Notably, explorers in the seventeenth century discovered them to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit#Historical_and_anthropological_accounts">natural part of Native American culture</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have submitted substantial evidence that those Indian men who, both here and farther inland, are observed in the dress, clothing and character of women - there being two or three such in each village - pass as sodomites by profession.... They are called joyas, and are held in great esteem. - Don Pedro Fages, 1775</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you take the current rate of transgenderism, .3%, and posit that the average size of these villages he referred to would be &lt;~1000, then 2-3 per village corresponds with the modern rate.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Cashier">Albert Cashier</a> was a transgender man who originally used a fake male name to enlist and fight in the American Civil War, and spent the rest of his life afterwards as a man.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia">Hijra</a> have existed in India long enough to have been mentioned in the Kama Sutra</p>

<p>There are many more examples of transgenderism that predate the commercial introduction of BPA in 1953, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili_Elbe">Lili Elbe</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Jorgensen">Christine Jorgensen</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Lind">Earl Lind</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Tipton">Billy Tipton</a>, and more.</p>

<p>The truth is, that in all countries where transgenderism was not widely accepted and documented, transphobia was. In China, where there is little historical anthropological evidence for transgenderism, Confucianism as the dominant religion reinforces traditional gender roles, and accounts for the heteronormativity of the culture.</p>

<p>The &quot;rise&quot; of transgenderism in America is congruent not with the commercial use of BPA, but with growing acceptance. There are no more or less transgendered people in terms of physiology, but there are &quot;more&quot; in the sense that they are now open and not hiding from a repressive heteronormative culture that castrated Alan Turing, the father of modern computing, for being gay.</p>

<p>The resultant rate of transgenderism, as I said, corresponds with what little historical estimates we have. There is a gap, however, I believe, in the current perceived rate of transgenderism and the realistic rate. I personally anecdotally think that the push for transgender acceptance has led to a sharp increase in faux-trans people. They are depressed, economically and socially, and so when they hear stories of how transgender people never knew why they were depressed until they pinpointed transgenderism as the cause, they attach to the notion and self diagnose. As they tell people, the sunk cost fallacy comes into play, and they have to reinforce the self lie. Confirmation bias causes them to be extremely vocal, as they try very hard to convince other people of the legitimacy of their condition, though they are really trying to convince themselves. I have seen cases exactly like this that carried on until the person started to receive hormone therapy, at which point they finally realized their mistake and backtracked. Others have even gone so far as to fully transition, only to find that they are less happy than before their transition, and eventually detransition. I think this sort of springboard effect is a natural effect of the rapid loosening of oppression, and will smooth out over time.</p>

<p>Back to your post, your testimony is reflective of the historical role of transgenderism in societies. If you compare gender to political leanings, transgender people are sort of the &quot;independents&quot; of gender. They experience both genders. As a result, they often become matchmakers, shamans, and spiritual leaders. They have a unique perspective on life and as such stand in a unique position to give advice to both men and women.</p>

<p>Many conspiracy theories relating to gay or transgender people often refer to the de-masculinization of society. Personally, I think this is a disinformation strategy meant to divide and conquer the heterosexual majority against the LGBT minority and their supporters. Often, you will find these claims in the context of some pretty kooky stuff, like that the de-masculinization of society is a prelude to alien colonization. Realistically, the positive traits attributed to masculinity exist independent of gender. In short, Kaitlyn Jenner could probably still kick your ass.</p>

<p>As a disclaimer, I have not looked into the effects of BPA and would be interested in an elaboration on why you think it relates to transgenderism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From those BPA sources you provided, I would be wary of saying that it can be attributed to widespread human transgenderism, as OP suggests. These turtles spend their whole lives immersed in BPA &#39;reservoirs&#39; where the chemical has built up in their environment. This is different from the amount that humans are exposed to, and is less than the effects of fluoride which is intentionally added to water in greater amounts, and the effects of which are still debated even in conspiracy circles. I do find it interesting that it mimics estrogen and the prevalence of it in our ecosystem should be examined.</p>

<p>As far as children being raised as transgender in greater numbers, it makes me a little sad. I think a some of these cases are simply heterosexual guilt on the part of the parents projecting transgenderism onto a child in misguided attempts at solidarity.</p>

<p>I think that as far as child rearing goes, parents should not in any way &quot;force&quot; transgenderism on their children, just as they shouldn&#39;t force heteronormativity on them either. Parenting as it relates to gender issues during the developmental years should be neutral. Children should be taught about traditional gender roles, but not punished for not conforming. A potential transgender child should be made to feel welcome within their family and community, but should be allowed to decide for themselves as they grow into adulthood which gender they identify as.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been to a doctor regarding my being transgender. I also don&#39;t believe that genital mutilation, and chemical castration is a &quot;good&quot; solution to the issue. Neither do I believe in SSRI&#39;s or other psychotropic drugs prescribed to contain issues like anxiety.

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting.  I have another angle to this intersection of conspiracy and transgenderism.  Its from observations is in the porn industry.  There seems to be a connection in &quot;shemale&quot; porn (let&#39;s not argue over terminology in the discussion OK, I get the dislike of this term), between transgenderism, alchemy, Gnosticism, satanism, and mind control</p>

<p>I first took note of these associations when i saw a &quot;hyno&quot; video that flashed a Nazi symbol.  It was an SS SIG runes within a female symbol in alchemy.  The video, and at least 10 others like it, uploaded by various users, shares this symbol flashed quickly and surreptitiously thru these videos in various &quot;subliminal&quot; techniques.   I knew immediately this was trying to establish a kind of covert &quot;brand&quot; whistleblowing on a group making this type of video, which must have taken hundreds of man hours in editing time to produce, with access to tens of thousands of hours of pornographic material</p>

<p>This made me pay attention to these videos.  I noticed that a vast majority of shemale actresses have tattoos that are overtly esoteric and occult, not the run of the mill stuff.  Also common are butterflies, roses, owls, sacred geometry, kabbalism motifs, and ouroboroses, triangles, and black/white checkerboards on their outfits or in their room... Also SIG runes, Nazi stuff, pentagrams and upside down crosses.  With the Russian sm porn and Asian sm porn a vast majority take place in upscale hotel rooms that almost look like small apartments.  Its clear by tge surroundings and production value they have a lot of money to invest in this type of porn</p>

<p>Are you getting where I&#39;m going with this?</p>

<p>That its commonly known that music, Hollywood, porn are run in large degree by masons, with tetherings to the intelligence community ... Given what we know about pizzagate (and its history extending backwards in time even beyond the 60s) the picture becomes more clear:  that--to my mind-- transgenderism within specifically the porn community--and to the exclusion of truly gender dysphoric individuals to whom we are most sypathetic--could likely be the product of kidnapping and child sex trafficking by people associated with Satanism, luciferianism, gnosticism, Freemasonry and the intelligence MKULTRA monarch subproject updated and redirected to carry out the trans agenda of he Frankfurt school as part of a globalist transformation...and that this kidnapping victims get to make a deal with them wherein they are groomed and made into a star in a kind of magical rite ... That porn is occult magick and that the actors are part of &quot;the great work&quot; of global alchemy...  And to some degree the porn actresses k ow this </p>

<p>Edit:spelling...I&#39;m on mobile</p>

<p>I realize to the uninitiated this woukd seem lunatic outpost stuff but I can back up every claim I made</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what your birth sex was but from your description it appears you transitioned from male to female. I appreciate your willingness to discuss your situation and your observational impartiality that allows you to consider your condition could have been brought about by bpa and other endocrine system interruptions. </p>

<p>Have you considered hormonal therapy to re-align with you birth gender? Or do you think you have identified as the other gender for too long to be able to go back?</p>

<p>I mean no disrespect in asking this and I believe sexuality isn&#39;t black and white. Hormones are a very powerful thing and I have seen examples of men who used exogenous testosterone switch gears and become transgender. I&#39;m not sure if this was the result of something they always felt they should do and the testosterone use was an attempt to get back to their birth gender or if the massive amounts of test were converted to estrogen and became part of the mechanism that made the individual identify more as female. </p>

<p>Maybe it has more to do with the hormonal situation during pre-adolescent years? I&#39;m sure there probably isn&#39;t any one answer but thanks for talking about it. </p>
