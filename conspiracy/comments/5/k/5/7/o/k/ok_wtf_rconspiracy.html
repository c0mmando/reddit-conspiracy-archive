       This sub has always felt like the place to be for actual conversation.  And like many of you, with so much disgust for Clinton, I cherry picked some Trump ideas, got on the_donald and road the high energy mix of blasting MSM and talkin' conspiracies for last few months.  I got out of the_donald today after coming here and seeing how infested it is with circle jerkers.  We had lefts/rights agreeing and discussing whats really happening in this world and now the trump train has dug its hooks in and brought tremendous bias to a place 2 years ago felt like it had almost zero compared to every other sub out there.  I didn't  have a problem with trump supporters, hell I supported them when all my liberal friends were being sore losers.  But now this Isreal stuff...some of the team picks...this sub should be in an uproar as the elite stay in power and no justice has been served for anything anyone up there has done.  Reddit has gone to shit...this sub has been divided by shills and trump circle jerkers alike.  If this sub continues down this path im not sure where I'll go but it wont be here.

       Prior to the election we all knew both parties were corrupt.  Now that we have elected Trump, there are those who feel he is part of the same establishment and those who feel he is not.  I honestly have no idea where Trump stands with regards to the establishment but I hope he has been honest with the American people.  Within 6 or 12 months we should have a good idea of what Trump's agenda is; at that point I see this community realigning in a particular direction.  Right now there is no reason not to embrace Trump, as he is our best shot at "draining the swamp."

       These are pretty much my thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im just going to keep an open mind. See what happens. Nothing else anyone can really do about it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, the media is still against him. The political and hollywood elites are still against him. You would think some of this shit would have died down if he was a puppet of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I really dont know what's going on, but like I said,  I am going to keep an open mind about it and see what happens.

       Very true..seems the same patterns of push back from MSM are mirrored here more aggressively then ever.  Fox is just lucky to be on "this" side at the moment if that makes any sense....or we're unlucky.  Things were simpler when everyone hated conspiracies.

       Im just saying and my tin foil hats strappen down harn rn, but what if Trump ran the MSM? Considering everything they have done to "hurt" him has done nothing but help him. How many stories are we gonna have that make him look like shit but lack sinple evidence? He did run a huge show on NBC for quite some time... Like they love to say "9d chess"

       Obama was successful in getting many of his policies passed.  To say he (and the dems) didn't "change" the country is just plain false.  Our country has changed more drastically in the last 8 years then ever in modern history.  As for the shilling, sounds like establishment craziness to me.

       These picks would be ostracized by this community if they were being picked by anyone other than Trump.

       It's literally a long list of people with ties to organizations and corporate/financial entities that this sub has long rallied against.

       I'm not sure why he picks who he picks.  Only thing I can figure is he believes we will enter into another recession/depression and is looking for people who can help mitigate damage and help the country recover.

       Interesting point..I may have drank a sip of that kool-aid and im not proud of it and if you want to call me part of the problem so be it. But this wasnt ment to be feel good at all more of a realization I had about myself and wanted to share in hopes that if anyone else made the same mistake I did, think about questionable judgements that may have come from being so (deservedly) anti-clinton.  Im typically a lurker so im not sure how much of a problem I have caused. This was more to anyone who thinks conspiracy and the donald are on the same page...they may share a few talking points but the donald lacks the depth of skepticism needed in this day and age.  I realize that now and here I am expressing it, thats all.

       Let me tell you this, the damage has already been done and it won't be reversed. You should have thought about this long and hard before you got drunk from the kool-aid.

       Yes, this sub and the donald are on the same page and we all know where the fault lies. So it doesn't matter if the donald lacks the depth and skepticism when it's shown time and time again that many people within this community lack depth and skepticism.

       The path to "being awake" has a different learning curve for everyone. Its funny cause you're right about me and although I didnt vote for trump or post anything "pro-trump" (what im talking about was mainly internal) I dont blame you for calling me out for it.

       oooh you can read a post history, congrats.

      <p>
       Edit: and I bet you were hoping for a better response. But posts like these are a dime a dozen, the meta bullshit that goes on in this sub is the worst part of it. The drama and shitposts are something none of us want to deal with. There are definitely shills and faithful supporters for all sorts of topics beyond Trump. People are upset with Trump's behaviors, but then again there are people who are pretending he is the greatest and those who blindly follow him. Donald Trump hasn't ruined this sub, he's just added to the noise. I don't know what you are asking for but I think these things should have a 'Meta' tag or something so I and others can know when to stay the out. Again, bye thanks for nothing.

       Yes.  I had such a grasp on that concept.  I was always a liberal leaner and watching them implode while supporters stood by blindly was gross.  The military spending in this country is out of control and people who have been here since before the election know exactly why.. I lost sight of that momentarily when it seemed like all main stream elite pushed back so hard on trump.  But seems now that was plan b for them all along and i fell for it.  Im not perfect.

       Trump has sadly proved that group think isn't just reserved for the masses, it's also very prevalent in conspiracy circles.

       So many drank the kool-aid and now they're dealing with the cognitive dissonance that follows.

       You're not alone.  A lot of us have noticed an uptick in astroturf coinciding with the election.  Unfortunately, it seems to be here permanently.

       I love Trump but watching the herd mentality of T_D is just scary. I like Trump cuz he triggers cucks and is good entertainment, but watching these people eat up every word that comes out of his mouth is pathetic and thats the thing its at the point were you cant even question him. LoL ive been on T_D since it was pure satire and only people who have been there since day 1 will actually know the sub was created to bash and make fun of Trump...

       And if you want proof look at my comment history, all my karma is from T_D and my posts dont actually have anything to do with praising Trump they more or so bash the left.

       Fack, I'm a Canadian and I fell for it. I thought he was a better choice because of the whole "no-fly-zone" in Syria, that Clinton wanted. I shouldn't care but I'm anti-war and Soviet bombs would have probably crumbled in mid-flight and hit us Canadians while en-route to the USA. Now Trump seems to be alienating China, and showing how cozy he is to Israel. Why does it now seem there will be war either way? Maybe I'm thinking to deep into things.

       At this point being against killery  doesn't matter any more  and being against Trump is relevant. I find this  to be the best sub on reddiit by far.

       Yes.  I had such a grasp on that concept.  I was always a liberal leaner and watching them implode while supporters stood by blindly was gross.  The military spending in this country is out of control and people who have been here since before the election know exactly why.. I lost sight of that momentarily when it seemed like all main stream elite pushed back so hard on trump.  But seems now that was plan b for them all along and i fell for it.  Im not perfect.
