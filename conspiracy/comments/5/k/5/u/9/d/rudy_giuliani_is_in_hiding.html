     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       Here is the email I received... I'm not sure on the details but it sounds viable, considering what's up:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Dear friend,
      </p>
      <p>
       First, we want to think you for the work you are doing. Your efforts do not go unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Giuliani has been taken to a safe location and we are awaiting instructions from a group of people we call light workers, who work behind the scenes to protect people like Rudy who come forward. They are patriots within our government, protecting what is left of our Republic and Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, Mr. Giuliani is in grave danger, but he is safe for now. And indeed, they are using CGI and other methods to "replace" him.
      </p>
      <p>
       What appears to be a hired group of COINTELPRO agents have taken over the Internet, declaring Rudy's brave statements a "hoax" and pointing everyone to a completely fake Twitter account (
       <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani">
        https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani
       </a>
       ) that Mr. Giuliani has no access to and nothing to do with. These agents and agitators are easy to spot and identify.
      </p>
      <p>
       We understand the skepticism as well, but Mr. Giuliani's safety is paramount. His safety is the priority, and at a later time when his safety can be assured, he is expected to make a public announcement -- but not within the borders of the United States. We cannot state in more urgent terms how serious this issue is for his safety, and that of his family and some of his close friends. His public statements on his official Twitter quickly caused an immediate response from the CIA, DHS and "shadow" elements within our government. We have been told there was "panic" when Rudy began speaking the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Giuliani requests humbly that you spread his Official Statement far and wide on social media (this link --
       <a href="http://henrymakow.com/2016/12/rudolph-giuliani-confirms.html">
        http://henrymakow.com/2016/12/rudolph-giuliani-confirms.html
       </a>
       -- contains the statement and his other Tweets for you to use).
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way to help us is to spread the word, and re-post Rudy's statements about PizzaGate from his closed Twitter account using social media, like YouTube. His statements contain many truths that will lead you in the right direction. Do not let agitators and agents try to stop you, because they will, and they will attack and threaten you. (However, if you feel your safety is in doubt, please do not proceed.)
      </p>
      <p>
       That is all we have for now. We will be in touch.
      </p>
      <p>
       -- A patriot"

       Convert to text? You mean copy-pasting the already selectable text from the email, as in the quicker, more accessible, more searchable and more readable approach to this kind of thing?

      <p>
       Still, the lack of any kind of source or corroboration of other recipients is bothersome.

       Ok, because people's sexual prowess totally determines their ability to process information. I'm fully confident in my sexual abilities and I did have one gf that was hard to please but I dumped her cause she didn't shower enough (was a francophile)... I am using an ass as a pillow as I send this. lol yeah bitch, definitely too slutty to be 11.

       If this turns out to be true. That man will have gained a lot of my respect. I was kind of suspicious with the double unverified twitter accounts, it's possible he really just busted at the seams.

       I feel the same way. If this really is from him, I wish that he remain safe and reach asylum, in order to fully expose these scum as they truly are. When twitter, Reddit (just banned r/pizzagate) and other platforms protect pedophilia - it becomes a goddamn social value and that is disgusting. If things don't change, we can expect the disintegration of our entire way of life under the rule of the pedo-Overlords.

       How can you continue on being a good little slave when you know what's going on. I have hope that things are getting ready to change big time, they have too, otherwise I cannot live with the guilt of doing nothing. Occultists must relish the thought that so many are now widely aware of what's occurring and yet nothing is being done. Roman Catholic Church paid out like 4 billion or something last year to settle molestation charges against its holy priests.

       Yeah, you're right. It's only spelled with one L... I just think Hillary is a joke and we should change the word hilarious to hillarious, in order to reflect how funny it is that she had the unlimited resources of the democratic party but used them like an idiot and failed to reach the presidency. It's hillarious she lost and she is just a joke in general. It will be even more hillarious when Trump throws her in jail. I just hope that it is for a very long time and that most of her crimes are accounted for.

       They are claiming that the Giuliani account that was taken down for tweeting about pizzagate was actually his real account and he has gone into hiding for his own safety. I'm not involved, so I can't give much more info, or verify anything definitively... that was the entire email I received.

       Giuliani is a scumbag and complicit in the murders of over 3000 Americans on 9/11. The only way I would accept him as a whistleblower is if he went down with the rest of them.

       From your Makow leak, he's updated it
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Latest- Giuliani appeared on Fox this morning. He said Fox had cancelled. I don't believe this was CGI. Obviously the above statement was a scam to promote the fake news narrative. It's interesting the government is going to so much trouble to discredit the truth and truth seekers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday--  Twitter suspended this account.  Here is the archived page.  "Giuliani" says he has been threatened.  Snopes, no doubt a CIA front, is saying this account was suspended because it was an imposter. It looks real. It still is the main account listed by google. They say he had no Twitter account. There is another started in August with 70K followers but no tweet since Dec 1.  It's possible this is an "official" Twitter feed while the suspended one was personal. It's also possible the suspended one was indeed a parody account. "There are about four of them out there that pretend to be me," RG told Chuck Todd in October. But he didn't say, "I don't have a Twitter account."
       </p>
       <p>
        But how does a "fake account" get 11,000 followers in nine months? Why would he tolerate it? What "Giuliani" says in his Statement is true. It's possible he was spurred by his rejection for Sec. of State. 
It's also possible that this is a "fake news" psy op. i.e. A phoney RG reveals the truth and then the real RG denies he said it. Thus the real truth is discredited.
       </p>
       <p>
        My view is that the truth is never a hoax. I am concerned however that this Statement wasn't on his official Twitter account, the one with 70K followers.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Glen says (Comments), this does seem "too good to be true." But I'd rather be thought gullible than risk discounting a genuine whistle blower. I believe man's higher nature does shine through and will triumph

       Actually neither twitter account has been confirmed. They are both unconfirmed. There is no reason to confirm unless one is really trying to prove themselves. The whistleblower account does look more real.

       I also didn't downvote. I think that it is possible they have the technology to do that. When we see stuff from NASA, it can be 20 years or more in the past. Their technology is way beyond the point they are willing to show the general public... 
I don't know who the real Giuliani is and I asked him to provide more proof, but of course if the OP email is real, then he won't be able to prove it until he is somewhere safe. You may be right, I just don't have any more info yet...

       You make some valid points but you still dismiss this outright... Fake News was made up by pedophiles to silence the issue and I'm not a part of that. I have no agenda. I just want to share this if it can help to bring things to light. Please look at the link and contact the email on that page if you would like more info, because I have nothing else to offer on that matter. Thanks for the analysis, anyway.

       I'm not going to show my email... the only other info you could get is their email and you can find that through the link. That's how I contacted them and received this response in the first place. Sharing in case it can help things.

       Why is a screen capture from some random ass redditor any more reliable? That shit could be faked 100 ways man. The standard of proof should be much higher.

       You can pist a screencap, while blacking out identifying information. 0/10 obvious troll is shockingly obvious. 
Also, ill just leave this here:

       Wow, okay. Quote my response to a troll, as if that actually posts something. I guess I shouldn't have engaged... and no, the screenshot (wtf is a screencap) wouldn't have proven anything that I didn't already copy-paste on the screen. Try again- you just struck out with every intelligent person in this subreddit.
