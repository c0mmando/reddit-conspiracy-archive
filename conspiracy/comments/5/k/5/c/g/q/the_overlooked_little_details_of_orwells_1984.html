        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Almost every day throughout the internet is amateur bloggers and professional journalists saying &quot;le 1984 is come true.&quot; What irks me is that nine times out of ten, these people are referencing the surveillance state in America. This irks me because 1984 described an entire world of detail and many smaller yet equally important details of the book don&#39;t get the attention the surveillance aspect of 1984 gets. </p>

<p><strong>The Inner Party</strong></p>

<p>The protagonist in 1984 thought he was in the party that ran the country. What he comes to learn is that he was in the &quot;outer party.&quot; Within the Ingsoc Party is an inner party, a small elite group of people that run the show. </p>

<p><strong>Perpetual war for perpetual peace</strong></p>

<p>The inner party was an international inner party of members from every nation. They colluded together to make sure that the wars they were waging against each other would only target the proletarian, the lower classes of society and their slum cities. No nation would take any measures against the other that would defeat them and end the war. The war was meant to last forever. Because in the name of winning the war, the people would work 20 hour shifts in the factory for the war effort. The people would allow their rations to be cut, for the war effort. And anyone who criticized these things was labeled unpatriotic, for going against the war effort. </p>

<p><strong>Turning dissidents into Patriots</strong> </p>

<p>The protagonist in the book was not killed for his crimes. Killing a dissident makes martyrs and people remember the man having died as a dissident. The protagonist was merely tortured until his resistance was weakened and he became patriotic. Similar to how Cuban dissident Elian Gonzales was drugged up while in the custody of the elitist Aspen Institute and when he got out of there he gave a speech before the US Congress in which he refers to Fidel Castro as his second daddy.</p>

<p><strong>Community service and propoganda</strong></p>

<p>In 1984 the citizens of Oceania all devoted several hours outside their work to &quot;community service.&quot; This community work wasn&#39;t in the name of charity, but in organizing parades to celebrate the regime and put up posters celebrating the party and so on. </p>

<p>There are several examples of real life counterparts but the most infamous American one would be Lyndon Johnson&#39;s War on Poverty. Many of the job training centers set up with federal funds were being operated by professional agitators to organize protests or of the job centers. Often these would turn into riots. I&#39;m sure many of you know the name Saul Alinsky. What you don&#39;t know is that Alinsky trained federal employees in these job centers.</p>

<p>This is why Republicans in the seventies scrapped many of our government ran employment centers. </p>

<p><strong>The change in units</strong></p>

<p>At one point our protagonist meets an old man in a bar who talks of how beer hasn&#39;t been served in pints since the revolution. In real life, England will not adopt a metric system until after 2000 but metrics was used everywhere in the book 1984. The reasoning is that to ration living space, food, tobacco etc can be done more easily with metrics. </p>

<p>I know a lot of you think the metric system should be adopted. The metric system is the best way to measure the length of radio waves or the size of a star. Fact is, the English system of measurement is better for applicable, normal people situations simply because the human mind is bad at dealing with abstract numbers. For example, whereas the human mind can easily imagine what a group of five people looks like, asking the mobs to imagine 3500 people, exactly, is not possible. The human mind can imagine what a shit ton of people looks like, but can&#39;t distinguish between 5000 or 10000000 people. </p>

<p>The human mind can easily picture what 5 feet 6 inches looks like but can&#39;t easily imagine the equivalent 165 centimeters. Or how the mind can contemplate a five story building but asking it to contemplate a building of the abstract 62 feet isn&#39;t as easy. </p>

<p>There is a black market in Europe for measuring cups in imperial units. The markets for many nations on every inhabitated continent sell food in imperial units despite being in metric countries. Keep in mind that shop owners in England who sell food using imperial unit scales have been fined heavily, had their property confiscated and jailed in some cases: something to expect for America. The metric system only gets enforced with brute force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That blog post is very silly. I have grown up with the metric system and I have no trouble whatsoever visualizing 133 cm or anything else for that matter. There is no advantage in visualizing small things on either systems. Visualizing large things is easier with the metric system though, because the different units are so easy to convert.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t mind that you use the imperial system. It works well in every day life, as does the metric system. You only think it doesn&#39;t because you are not trained in it. However the metric system is vastly superior when it comes to science, and to promote scientific literacy you ought to educate your children on both systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because you&#39;re trained to think in those terms. Describing height in a satisfactory manner is no problem where I live as people are used to thinking in those terms. In fact our system allows for more accurate descriptions of height, although one can argue that being that precise is redundant.</p>

<p>With that said, I&#39;m sure imperial units are more intuitive. But they are not vastly superior to metric in every day situations like these people are arguing. The difference is minor at best and dropping the imperial system might be a worthwhile sacrifice to encourage scientific literacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you until the metric bit. I understand where you&#39;re coming from, I think, in that abstracting a concept does generally make it harder to intuitively grasp for many people and as such leaves them more open to manipulation. However I see no reason to think it&#39;s not a matter of familiarity and habit; you just grasp the system you&#39;ve grown up with easier than any other. Personally, having grown up with metric, it makes much more sense to me than imperial, since, for example, it&#39;s easy to convert different measurements into each other within the logic of the system, eg litres to kilos (1 litre water = 1kg) which makes it easy to imagine. Conversely, I&#39;m sure there are similar things you can do with imperial which I couldn&#39;t. Regardless I think this shows that the change into metric you mention, even if it allowed some manipulation, couldn&#39;t possibly enable anything long term, as the next generation would immediately have adapted. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re on to something in that language used can make people feel like they understand, but their minds aren&#39;t quite adapted to comprehending fully, allowing some degree of deception. I just don&#39;t think the metric/imperial thing is that.</p>

<p>Your other points feel spot on, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me the aspect of perpetual war in 1984 is one of the most interesting, overlooked, and important aspects of this book. I will try to lay out some of the ideas that are often overlooked. </p>

<p>Perpetual war had many functions, some of which are mentioned in the OP. Additionally, perpetual war was important to the government because it allowed the production and consumption of goods, without giving the public any added benefit. The people are paid a meager wage to produce the product, and then that product is sent off to war and destroyed in battle. The products do not go into the market to give the population an added benefit, and as a result people never have the resources to challenge the governmental paradigm of 1984. </p>

<p>The book also explains that the &quot;rationing&quot; that occurred was probably a farce to get the population to accept the lower standard of living. Production numbers were made up to be very high so that it seemed added benefits were on the horizon, but they never come. This caused the population to only be concerned about fulfilling their needs, such as buying razor blades. Note that basic needs such as food water and shelter are taken care of by the party, these are the needs that cause people to rise up when they are not fulfilled. The population is kept in constant want for better food, better shelter, etc. and this is what they concern themselves with. The population is given just enough to be pacified, but not enough to be able to be free to think about their oppression. </p>

<p>Perpetual war also gave the population an enemy. I think most of the people in this sub understand why it is that governments need and create enemies, but there is another reason mentioned in 1984 that is quite interesting. The enemies created by the government in 1984 were used as an outlet for people&#39;s anger. If someone is angry because they can&#39;t find good food, they can channel and release that anger during the 2 minutes hate. (In the US people are pissed off because their jobs don&#39;t pay shit, so they blame immigrants and hate on terrorists as an outlet for anger) In the end the people never truly understand the cause of their anger and suffering. </p>

<p>Perpetual war was the mechanism for pacifying the people at home through several different avenues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything was spot on until you got to comparing immigration skeptics to the two minutes of hate. The difference between the two minutes of hate and real world migrant skepticism is that the two minutes of hate was government sponsored. Our American skepticism of immigration isn&#39;t a skepticism that gets support and organization of government institutions. Just the opposite. </p>

<p>Our government had given grants to promote radio programs in Spanish in this country. Through arts endowments our government tax dollars finance leftist artwork in Latino communities. </p>

<p>Why? Remember how in 1984, the globe was regionalized into three countries. The nation of Oceania was comprised of dozens of modern day countries. </p>

<p>Compare this to the European Union. The EU is a regionalized entity. Should the EU gain more powers to govern the internal affairs of its members, the nations of Europe lose Sovereignty and the actual nation is the European Union. </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s very bad for nations to merge the economies. If you merge a socialist nation&#39;s economy, like Mexico, with a free market nation such as America, then one economic system has to give our for the other one. The united States would be Socialists in government and economy is we were to merge with Mexico. </p>

<p>Because there would be no borders between the nations after these nations are merged, there will be no immigration. Only migration. The organized invasion of southwestern America, and it is organized, is meant to change the culture of that part of the country so much that a &quot;revolution&quot; merges the nations into a socialist bloc. </p>

<p>As for Syrian refugees, there is no denying the fact that power mad Leninist Obama has beefy despicable intentions with them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was humming and hawing about putting in that remark about terrorism and immigration. I didn&#39;t intend for the ideas of immigration or terrorism to have any bearing on my comment.

    <div class="md"><p>I liked how you worded it. The dramatization you presented that in war, the people use their labor to produce for the country, giving the government wealth off their labor, and because the goods of the war industry get destroyed and dont go to the people then  the people stay stuck in their lowly positions. This is the same as inflation.</p>

<p>In inflation, the money loses value as more money enters the economy faster than more goods can be added. In a warlike atmosphere of 1984, more money is spent on war production and it trickles through society but the goods are destroyed. Inflation is a way the government robs the people with an invisible tax. Imagine you buried $25,000 in the ground in 1945. That money would had gotten you a new house in 1945 but today it cant even make a downpayment on a house. So inflation robs the people, making them have to work more and more for less and less.</p>

<p>In war, the government produces propaganda based on support for the war effort abroad but also activity on the home front. Because in history war generally breaks down the family unit and weakens the role of religion, war spreads the demoralization of the people. So the government sometimes spreads propaganda to keep the people moral. This propaganda can turn into propaganda in favor of more government powers over the people.</p>

<p>In world war two, the war time production inflated the currency. Our government funded propaganda and hollywood produced films on <em>fighting inflation.</em> These films stated that should an individual ignore government rations of products and buy something on the black market, outside government control, then that person contributes to inflation by putting more money into the economy than the government permitted him to. This propaganda served to not only make people obey government edicts on rationing (which is really just a way to control the people) but to make people believe inflation was caused by some source other than the federal reserve.</p>

<p>Now you make the point that people blame the wrong things for the problem. I disagree. The thing is that information flows too freely in America. The people have too much ability to out maneuver establishment censors and get the facts straight. </p>

<p>What I do see happening is: the people will realize part of the problem but not the whole problem. Or they recognize what causes some problem but dont recognize the origin of what causes the problem. Or they have bad ideas of how to fix problems. In some cases an activist group that seeks to fix problems is controlled opposition.</p>

<p>One example: the various activist groups that want to fix the national budget with an Article V convention. This is also called a &quot;convention of the states,&quot; a &quot;constitutional convention&quot; or &quot;amending convention.&quot; What you call it doesnt matter. What it is is a convention of delegates from every state to make any number of amendments to the constitution or even scrap the whole thing and replace it. This type of convention has not been called since 1787, when our constitution was first drafted. Individuals sucked into these activist groups (Call A Convention; Move To Amend; Convention of States Project) which all have establishment ties, are people that realize our national debt is atrocious but they&#39;re sucked into supporting a very dangerous &quot;fix&quot; to the problem.</p>

<p>Ill give you an example of a very misguided group: armed militia members. These are people that train in weapons usage in case they ever have to revolt against the government. They have legit concerns but they do not understand their militia cannot duplicate the American revolution of 1776. First of all, the revolutionary war was a &quot;top-down&quot; organization: the militias were funded by the governments of the states. The states made sure the militia was organized the same way across the thirteen colonies.</p>

<p>These modern day militias are rag-tag teams of private citizens governed by themselves and each militia group is different from the last. That is a problem. Should these militias every have to rise up against our government, they&#39;d be indebted to the Chinese because many of the parts for the weapons they&#39;d be using would come from China. Thats a problem.</p>

<p>What Im getting to is that I believe the information flow is too strong for people to blame the wrong things. What I see happening is people blame only the symptoms of a problem, or they fall for the wrong solutions to a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider that a calorie is a metric unit. </p>

<p>Now if a communist nation controls how many hours one works and how much food you get in rations, then the government has to coordinate this with how much land is set aside for farming. </p>

<p>The government would while setting aside land for farming, know in advance how much land could feed how many people and how many hours of work that food can give the energy to do. These calculations can be done through imperial units, measuring out the land in imperial units and the food in ounces instead of grams, but it would just be easier with metrics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Napoleon had his scientists, mathematicians, and archeologists crawl all over the Great Pyramid in Egypt but they didn&#39;t find anything out of the ordinary because they used the metric system.</p>

<p>When the British Royal Engineers surveyed it using the Imperial System, however, they were absolutely amazed at all of the mathematical relationships that were embodied in the structure&#39;s measurements.</p>

<p>The ancient builders of the structure apparently used what is now called &quot;the Pyramid inch&quot; for all of it&#39;s measurements and there&#39;s only a hair&#39;s-breadth of difference between that and the Imperial inch.</p>

<p>The Imperial system is based primarily on an adult man&#39;s body. The inch is the width of a thumb, a span, the distance between the tip of the thumb and a the tip of the little finger is approximately nine inches with four spans making a yard. The foot is the length of a  foot, naturally, with three feet also making a yard. Base twelve provides far more ways to both divide or multiply by either odd or even whereas base ten does not. </p>

<p>So Imperial units, once learned, pretty much allow anyone to make and calculate fairly accurate measurements either without needing any tools or by simply improvising tools to measure with using their own body as a template. The metric System which is used primarily in science is like most of science itself both arbitrary and artificial. What get&#39;s all too often missed by science are the same kind of accurate mathematical relationships that were deliberately encoded in the Great Pyramid that also exist and can be found in many aspects of nature and natural phenomena.</p>

<p>Science likes to promote the idea that nature, and indeed all existence, is completely random, accidental, and without any point or purpose and by using the Metric System they don&#39;t have to contend with or admit to anything different. Meanwhile both our own physical forms as well as those of everything in nature are all bound together and intimately related in very precise mathematical ways... as the great thinker Protagoras said five hundred years before Christ, &quot;man is the measure of all things&quot;. That&#39;s not generally taken literally, yet there is a clear and important truth to it all the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to ignore the bulk of your post, but I found your aside on metrics interesting.</p>

<p>IMHO, the metric system is best applied in large quantities only, and the English/Imperial system is far superior for small measurement. The key reason I believe this to be true is the ease of division inherent in the Imperial system. Can you visualize what 0.625 of a centimeter is? 6.25 millimeters is a bit easier but 5/8th is far more intuitive. 5/8ths of an inch is a valid notation whereas 5/8ths of a centimeter is not. </p>

<p>There is a practical aspect as well, being that dividing a length into equal parts is easier to do with a system based in fractional notation.</p>
