<p>And it&#39;s not a &quot;YOU can still win this.&quot;  It&#39;s a <em>&quot;WE</em> can still win this.&quot;</p>

<p>Regardless, it seemed you were asking why a show needs to be put on if &quot;you&#39;ve already won&quot;.  At best, that statement&#39;s ambiguous and can be interpreted in various ways.  At worst, it looks like you&#39;re wondering why TPTB need to put on a good show since they&#39;ve &quot;already won&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I responded the way I did.  They <em>haven&#39;t</em> won yet was my point, and it seemed like you were saying they &quot;already won&quot; is all.</p>

If any party acts as if they&#39;ve already won then it just alienates everyone who didn&#39;t support them.

<p>It&#39;s stunning to me that this isn&#39;t obvious to most people. They don&#39;t need or want support, they&#39;re supported by the system itself and the special interest groups that benefit from that system. They only need your participation. You dipshits keep legitimizing them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my theory:</p>

<ul>
<li>The election is theater. They president is just a puppet for our masters.</li>
<li>It seems like HRC is the candidate TPTB want to be their puppet. They have probably been planning on her for decades. </li>
<li>Donald Trump is playing his role, which has been in the making for decades. </li>
<li>Elections can easily be fixed, but they can&#39;t convince the public unless the result is close to the expected results.</li>
<li>HRC is so completely unlikable and was so completely sloppy in her public life, that it is REALLY hard to get her elected.</li>
<li>Trump is a big enough buffoon that an HRC win wouldn&#39;t seem unbelievable. Or so they thought.</li>
<li>However HRC is WAY more unlikable than they thought. They had to rig things WAY more than they thought they would have to against Sanders.</li>
<li>Even Trump would destroy her in a fair election. They have to destroy him in every possible way to make a HRC win seem even possible.</li>

<p>That has zero bearing on whether it actually matters if they win, whether anything will be different after they win, or whether they even <em>can</em> win in the first place.</p>

<p>In other words, the fact that there is a shadow government in control, by no means implies that everyone involved in politics is a part of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they want to scare people to vote for Hillary. That&#39;s all they have left in this shit show. People see and sense that Hillary is crooked, but if MSM put enough fear in them about Trump they will still vote Hillary, or at least make that story plausable since the election is rigged</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever seen a drama? Or hell reality television in this last decade?</p>

<p>In my opinion it&#39;s all just one giant show. I won&#39;t go as far to say every word leader is in on it but I will say every US &quot;leader&quot; is. You do not get that far in politics without being complicit in the same corruption.</p>

<p>And anyone who has truly stood against them in the last century has been &quot;murdered&quot; or committed &quot;suicide&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a registered voter and I don&#39;t vote in the presidential elections for this very reason. In my mind your just perpetuating the cycle of destruction by giving tangible value to a superficial vote. I&#39;ll also note that in my mind even voting for a third party candidate is obtuse. The very idea we have to split amongst ourselves and draw a imaginary line in the sand in regards to our political beliefs is absurd and feels like a the living political embodiment of divide et impera.</p>

<p>If your looking for someone to vote for despite what I say then I&#39;d vote for the one who &quot;promises&quot; to start removing money from politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. </p>

<p>Ya, I was gonna vote for that &quot;person&quot; anyway.  :D  </p>

<p>Not because I like it, but on the off chance that your opinion is wrong and there actually is some truth to elections then I&#39;d rather go that way...</p>
