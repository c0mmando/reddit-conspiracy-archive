    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the DDoS attacks were Julian&#39;s supporters at all, nor would he tweet that. The tweet saying it was his supporters sounds like a misdirection scheme for both the public and his followers. That&#39;s why I no longer trust the integrity of the Wikileaks tweets this week, and I also believe their main channels of communication to the public have been compromised. It&#39;s too coincidental to the events of the Ecuadorian embassy cutting off the internet. All this right after Obama removes ICANN from Congressional oversight... so ICANN could be used to fabricate DNS and keep the website, twitter, etc going with disinformation, allowing the Clinton campaign to turn its greatest threat into an asset. This is all very coordinated.</p>

<p>-uh, no.  McConnell&#39;s primary mission is refueling and transport.  It really hurts any points made here when people make stuff up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you don&#39;t get a hacker joke so you suddenly think wiki is compromised, but nope, their twitter is pretty consistent with a leftist anti clinton view, the changes are likely due to the fact that there is now one of of the moderator of the twitter offline (assange) but the rest of the line stayed the same before and after (pro green). There are reddits that have proved that the emails couldn&#39;t have been doctored because they were also in chains that weren&#39;t doctored (the same emails that failed the test passed it when in a chain).
Conspiracy theories are good as long as they don&#39;t undermine truth tellers, which now they do, you can&#39;t just doubt of everything with no reason because without facts you can&#39;t make a good judgement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes down to it, we are talking about the United States government. Would they even need to hack a twitter account to take control of it? I imagine that if wikileaks was posing a credible threat to the powers that be that they could simply tell twitter to give them control and it would done within a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>Then again. Wikileaks has put out some very damning stuff in the past so if the government were really interested in stopping them, then why wait till now? Is it really the ICAAN thing? </p>

<p>I double checked the email in question:    </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25829">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25829</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/Eqg6c2.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/Eqg6c2.jpg</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s quite possible that the OP just made a mistake in copying/pasting the raw source (don&#39;t use &quot;view source&quot; on Wikileaks, do it via the method outlined in my post). </p>

<p>Otherwise even the slightest byte being off/missing/added will lead to a failure in verification.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the version of <strong>dkimverify</strong> being run on that website is that it has an unfixed bug. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>The DKIM signature verification fails if message Content-Type is: multipart/alternative</h1>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
As you can see in the 25859 email:  </p>

<pre><code>Content-Type: multipart/alternative;
</code></pre>

<p>So that&#39;s really a <em>false negative</em>.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<hr/>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>Yeah OK that&#39;s great but WHY is that happening?</h2>

<p>Well, the (unfixed) problem seems to be that internally, in the code, write() will flush the stream after transcoding the content in cases where the content is not already in its target encoding.
So what happens is that an extra &#39;\n&#39; is added when being flushed and the buffer doesn&#39;t end with a &#39;\n&#39;, while the canonicalization methods only require to add a &#39;\n&#39; if the body DOES NOT end with a &#39;\r\n&#39;. </p>

<p>In the current version, as the body is being written when the last line was not a newline (&#39;\n&#39;) is a state which can be true even if we are not yet at the end of the body.  </p>

<p>The unfortunate reality is that these kind of failures are relatively common with DKIM (that problem was only really noticed a year ago, for example).</p>

<hr/>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>—&gt; Newline problems \n vs \r\n<br/>
…the bane of programming for over 3 decades. People shouldn&#39;t get overly excited if something fails, because false negatives aren&#39;t a rare thing when you have all of these permutations of OS systems, MIME encoding types, line endings, etc.</p>

<p>The easiest emails to verify will usually be ones between relatively few people (or if a lot of people, then with most of them using say, Gmail or Yahoo).  </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve seen a lot of issues when emails have an intermixture of 7-bit and 8-bit encodings, that type of thing tends to f* things up pretty easy.  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway hope that helps. Sorry again for not double-checking the website verifier at first - I was just in a rush. </p>

<p>Thanks for noticing that, I&#39;ll probably update the post with a link to these comments here for anyone having problems.  </p>

<p>If you find anything good and the verification thing is being wonky, I&#39;d be happy to take a look. Just send me a PM or page me to the thread and I&#39;ll check it out~</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your up/down vote count is hidden, not to mention how anti-Wikileaks Hilary and anyone/everyone that is voting for/paid by her has been up until now, I mean CNN said it was illegal to access the WikiLeaks until now, Hilary blamed Russia as a measure to make people not want to be influenced by &quot;Putin&quot; aka an exKGB enemy of the USA, Donna Brazile said the emails were doctored, and NOW people should read them and judge for themselves? Give Me A Break, she wouldn&#39;t post a joke on Twitter that could possibly be misinterpreted as encouragement to look at files that show her in a light of being potentially (but very likely) unelectable (depending on what you value in a leader), dishonest, cruel (arguably evil), treasonous, hypocritical, egotistical/extremely arrogant and unethical (to say the very least).</p>

<p>I feel really bad for Julian Assange wherever he is and whatever condition he is in. Even if he is on a private island with 100 virgin concubines, an open bar w/ bartender, a movie theatre with access to Netflix &amp; HBO (but no computer), and anything else he wants. Assange would be miserable if he knew what they were doing to his forced transparency regarding Hilary, Podesta, and the DNC.</p>

<p>I feel like the threat to Hilary was one thing because the election could easily already be rigged in her favor.
The threat to the DNC was another thing but it didn&#39;t impact anyone powerful enough to really matter. Even most of the Podesta emails didn&#39;t matter that much. BUT the threat to Obama, his administration and his &quot;legacy&quot; matters to the few people that have the capability to silence/alter/control WikiLeaks; if I had to guess as to why the foot finally dropped on WikiLeaks, that would be my best guess.</p>

That doesn&#39;t seem that odd to me. Maybe saying that joke originally at the dinner, yes, but not quoting it on twitter. On the other hand, she&#39;s also joked about email/server scandal.  Does that also mean HRC wants us to pay more attention to that scandal and look into it more or is she trying to get us to feel like it&#39;s really no big deal and just brush it off?

Oh yeah, and if you cite that I haven&#39;t been coming to r/conspiracy that long, I kept search conspiracy theory in the front page search box, once I finally tried just conspiracy months later, I found what would become my primary news source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, I never meant to imply you were CTR but that they&#39;re in this sub much more than even a couple months ago and they are infiltrating this sub with misdirection, distraction and of course trying to discredit wikileaks. Just because regular posters aren&#39;t CTR doesn&#39;t mean CTR&#39;s ideas can&#39;t take hold in the minds of regular posters. Obviously I don&#39;t know whether or not wikileaks is compromised. Of course I&#39;m very concerned about that and very much hope Julian is alive. I just don&#39;t want everyone to stop reading the podesta emails. Yes, let&#39;s be skeptical and cautious but let&#39;s also not stop reading them in case we&#39;re just being played by concern trolls. </p>

<p>As a disclaimer, I lurk a lot on reddit and am still somewhat of a newbie.  I am embarrassed to say but I&#39;m clueless on how to spot CTR by their comment history. Do you have any tips on how to spot them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question: what spin? I don&#39;t think we&#39;re adversaries here. We&#39;re probably more on the same page than you realize. I&#39;m concerned about WikiLeaks being compromised too but I&#39;m also wary that CTR would also like to discredit WikiLeaks. So I&#39;m just trying to weigh all the evidence myself, and part of that is pointing out that some &quot;evidence&quot; gathered may be misinterpreted. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s important to point that out in order to get to the truth? I&#39;d like to have a real discussion. So I&#39;m asking you politely, are you denying HRC made this exact quoted joke at the Al Smith Dinner?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, that&#39;s fair. I wish you would have said that in the first place, that it&#39;s suspect because she made a joke about WikiLeaks at the dinner and that&#39;s what was weird about it. I understand the concern, but HRC was technically the first person to mention Wikileaks at the third debate when all Wallace&#39;s question was about was are you a fan of open borders. Yes, she did it to get in front of it and spin it to being about Russia, but she still didn&#39;t need to bring them up. After reading a lot of the Podesta emails, I think her staff is just shit at jokes and humor.  Most of her jokes that night weren&#39;t funny. I guess I&#39;m still not convinced this is a missing piece of the puzzle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, maybe I should give up. How am I not being clear? HRC said that joke at the Al Smith Dinner, then she or staff tweeted one by one every joke HRC made at the dinner on her Twitter page for her adoring fans in case they missed her &quot;witty&quot; jokes at the dinner.  HRC or staff even put every joke in quotes to show it was from the earlier dinner.  I linked the guardian article which printed her jokes from the dinner to show the tweet was just her tweeting her quoted jokes from the previous dinner. I don&#39;t think anything nefarious is going on; HRC is just not funny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think it&#39;s highly unlikely that HRC would mention WikiLeaks in a joke? I don&#39;t find it that odd because she&#39;s also flippantly joked about her email/server scandal.  Does that also mean HRC wants us to pay more attention to her email/server scandal and look into it more or is she trying to get us to feel like it&#39;s really no big deal and just brush it off? I&#39;m just thinking she&#39;s adding a different tactic on top of the Russia fear-mongering tactic and just trying to make a joke of WikiLeaks and act like it&#39;s just one big nothingburger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the top: The first email linked <em>may have been</em> altered but it is not necessarily the case. I have noticed, in my own email, that some reply-chain emails don&#39;t verify properly, particularly those in mailing lists. I am not sure if this is a function of the re-mailer used in mail lists(which I suspect to be the case), or if this is because it does not include the quoted replies as part of the email body to hash. If there is someone such as an SMTP admin or engineer who can elaborate on this, that would be awesome.</p>

<p>For the second email though, from georgetown.edu, lacks DKIM header info entirely. This is not uncommon and a large portion of emails will likely not have DKIM headers. This is something that many server admins neglect to set up(as someone who ran personal SMTP/IMAP servers previously, I and many others consider it unnecessary). However, <strong><em>all</em></strong> emails sent from Gmail, Yahoo, any .gov domain or hillaryclinton.com have DKIM signatures and there may be other domains that have them as well. The fact that it lacks a DKIM signature from a corporate or .edu mail server is not remarkable, save for the fact that the lack of a signature means the email can&#39;t be verified for authenticity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the original upload to that website above was a year earlier by [name redacted] who is a woman. This means that Peter Mattingly is a likely a fiction in one of two contexts, either from a viral &quot;creation&quot; of somebody at a date prior to the sending of the email and release of the leak or as part of it. If you can prove the first part your much closer to disproving the second. Which is more than anything else so far in terms of physical verification. That&#39;s why.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t familiar with the name, so I did some quick google work. His twitter feed is HEAVILY pro-hillary/anti-trump, probably CTR involved.</p>

<p>Developed an online tool called SparkPoint as an &quot;Online Community Mobilization Tool&quot;. He is/was the VP of BlastRoots, which offered a service which uses &quot;Technology and Data to Optimize Public Affairs&quot;. BlastRoots was acquired by BIS Global in 2015, but that&#39;s mostly a dead end.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure both of the software tools he&#39;s been involved with are right up CTR&#39;s alley as far as a project management system for their heinous agenda. Who better to set up/manage those systems than the founder himself?</p>

<p>Not sure what it means coming from wikileaks, didn&#39;t find anything in the Podesta e-mails.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say for sure what&#39;s going on with WL/Assange, what they&#39;re really about, just asking people to ask questions and do research</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does this mean Obama and Hillary have taken over Wikileaks and are now fakeleaking to control the conversation?</p>

<p>So can we mark any leaks from this point on as suspect leaks?</p>

<p>I hope people had archive.is&#39;ing the podesta emails that were already leaked.  Or screenshotted</p>

Because there&#39;s actual video and written proof of all those things I just said. Are you denying that that was the same verbatim joke she said at the Al Smith Dinner? Did you even watch it? I did. Would you like me to link the video from the Al Smith Dinner for proof as well? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the version of <strong>dkimverify</strong> being run on that website is that it has an unfixed bug. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h1>The DKIM signature verification fails if message Content-Type is: multipart/alternative</h1>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
As you can see in the 25859 email:  </p>

<pre><code>Content-Type: multipart/alternative;
</code></pre>

<p>So that&#39;s really a <em>false negative</em>.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<hr/>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>Yeah OK that&#39;s great but WHY is that happening?</h2>

<p>Well, the (unfixed) problem seems to be that internally, in the code, write() will flush the stream after transcoding the content in cases where the content is not already in its target encoding.
So what happens is that an extra &#39;\n&#39; is added when being flushed and the buffer doesn&#39;t end with a &#39;\n&#39;, while the canonicalization methods only require to add a &#39;\n&#39; if the body DOES NOT end with a &#39;\r\n&#39;. </p>

<p>In the current version, as the body is being written when the last line was not a newline (&#39;\n&#39;) is a state which can be true even if we are not yet at the end of the body.  </p>

<p>The unfortunate reality is that these kind of failures are relatively common with DKIM (that problem was only really noticed a year ago, for example).</p>

<hr/>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>—&gt; Newline problems \n vs \r\n<br/>
…the bane of programming for over 3 decades. People shouldn&#39;t get overly excited if something fails, because false negatives aren&#39;t a rare thing when you have all of these permutations of OS systems, MIME encoding types, line endings, etc.</p>

<p>The easiest emails to verify will usually be ones between relatively few people (or if a lot of people, then with most of them using say, Gmail or Yahoo).  </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve seen a lot of issues when emails have an intermixture of 7-bit and 8-bit encodings, that type of thing tends to f* things up pretty easy.  </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway hope that helps. Sorry again for not double-checking the website verifier at first - I was just in a rush. </p>

<p>Thanks for noticing that, I&#39;ll probably update the post with a link to these comments here for anyone having problems.  </p>

<p>If you find anything good and the verification thing is being wonky, I&#39;d be happy to take a look. Just send me a PM or page me to the thread and I&#39;ll check it out~</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, that&#39;s fair. I wish you would have said that in the first place, that it&#39;s suspect because she made a joke about WikiLeaks at the dinner and that&#39;s what was weird about it. I understand the concern, but HRC was technically the first person to mention Wikileaks at the third debate when all Wallace&#39;s question was about was are you a fan of open borders. Yes, she did it to get in front of it and spin it to being about Russia, but she still didn&#39;t need to bring them up. After reading a lot of the Podesta emails, I think her staff is just shit at jokes and humor.  Most of her jokes that night weren&#39;t funny. I guess I&#39;m still not convinced this is a missing piece of the puzzle.</p>

<p>Actualy with military, people are expensive, so they will probably put them into an LSD torture tank for a few weeks and give them a new identity through constant abuse to dissociate them into a new self.  So it&#39;s only the top people who will be shot / hung</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, btw if you actually aren&#39;t CTR and think I&#39;m CTR, CHECK MY POST HISTORY. If you still accuse me of being CTR after checking my post history then I know you are CTR and completely full of shit.</p>

<p>Your post history indicates that you did not give a shit about r/conspiracy prior to this story breaking, kinda guessing you found this on accident and decided to try and keep people&#39;s faith in Wikileaks alive despite all evidence pointing towards Julian Assange and Wikileaks both being compromised. 
Oh yeah, I took the red pill a long time ago, so yeah, at least I sound like conspiracy theorist in my post, you definitely aren&#39;t one to question much and don&#39;t sound like a conspiracy theorist either, besides the general sentiment among conspiracy theorists that something is amuck regarding Wikileaks. Oh yeah, and if you cite that I haven&#39;t been coming to r/conspiracy that long, I kept search conspiracy theory in the front page search box, once I finally tried just conspiracy months later, I found what would become my primary news source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it wasn&#39;t, ever heard of positive reinforcement? everytime you see something that agrees with your theory you only remember that, wikileaks is as harsh on hillary as always, and the difference of tone is easy to explain, assange was kept out from moderating it so it&#39;s skewed toward the other guy, and that shows, but if you look at the posts before there was already this bias (in short pro green) since a long time, just more diluted.</p>
