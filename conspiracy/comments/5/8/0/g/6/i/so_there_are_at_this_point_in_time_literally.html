       I'm appalled at the average American. When I show them undeniable proof of the corruption in this country and they just shrug it aside and go one with their day like I never even bothered to show them the truth, what do we do? I feel like all this information is just trapped in this subreddit, never to be shown to the light. This shit NEEDS to go viral, we need a celebrity or some shit to read some of these wikileaks so that those stupid fucking people will actually listen (just because its a celebrity, lmao. so fucking pathetic when you think about it).
      </p>
      <p>
       I go out of my way and link people numerous videos of how fucked Hillary and the DNC in general is, and they don't even acknowledge anything that's in the video. They straight up just ignore the proof, and go back to rambling about how Trump supporters are unintelligent or about how Trump is a rapist. People are so closed minded it's mind blowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sort of a rant, but I have a serious question. What can we do to convince people? At this point, I just want a copy/paste of a really well formatted comment that absolutely shits all over any Hillary supporter with hardcore facts and evidence. That would be great.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I forgot to say this, but I also hate how being so anti-hillary makes me a Trump supporter. as i've said numerous times over, this election is the election between the lesser of two evils. and with the facts presented to us, trump is that lesser.

       If he was dead, I feel like WL would have done
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       to inform us of that by now. The fact that neither they, the US, Sweden, Britain, or Ecuador has said anything seems like pretty good evidence for him still being alive. All the states have reason to cooperate, but WL has all the reasons not to.

       To be honest, I was a total skeptic, but I watched a couple of videos and one of them shows Hicks and Jones' teeth, side by side, and the resemblance is uncanny. I know how loony it sounds, but if you listen to some of the coincidences, they're pretty damn convincing. They worked with some of the same people, had some of the same friends, had the same teeth, similar facial structures... It's definitely unlikely, but I don't see how someone can be so confident in denying the possibility.

       Yes he would. He is playing a part. An actor.

       Both personas are satanists. They will do whatever they need to do for fame and fortune and to stay alive as they have sold their souls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Hick's stand up revelations. Watch it from a stand point of him being a satanist. Much darker when you look at it that way. Look at pictures of him throwing up the 666 and the devil horns.

      <p>
       His Alex Jones persona does the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same person, your mind simply doesn't want it to be, because of your love for Hicks.
      </p>

       I loved Hicks too, and it's a hard pill to swallow ...

       Sorry, following along this poignant thread to see where the 'discussion' went... Just wanted to say, insane claims require insane evidemce or they are just claims. Most proof of conspiracy is dispatched with and hidden as best as possible. Hence, the conspiracy part. So, asking to unequivocally prove a conspiracy is the reddit equivolent of, 'I know you are, but what am I?'  or something like that. Learn to actually debate! Post sources and real substative responses or quit wasting time posting.

       Your letting your emotions cloud your judgement.

       You have a lot of research to do as your not fully "awake".

       Hicks is a luciferian. They are ultimate deceivers. He sold his soul like many others in the industry. Once you do that, you must do your masters bidding, or you die.
      </p>
      <p>
       His role as Hicks was over and they had him take on the Jones persona.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, watch his after death documentary, it's so full of Illuminati imagery it will make your head spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hicks was a master at controlling an audience. It was only so fitting for him to now be leading a deceptive revolution.

       The thing about people though, is even if they're "dumb", almost every one understands the value of currency and power. It's all in the way we frame things to people. We can talk about corruption all day, but it's such a nebulous concept to most people, and almost every one has accepted that "money talks". Look at countries that have the most issues with corruption, what do they all have in common? They're third world countries where the daily wage wouldn't buy you a frappuccino.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we talk about corruption, we have to put it in terms of what people are losing. Why the hell are we paying people that aren't going to do our governing for us? Why are we letting people that govern us get away with stealing from us, and giving them the power to do so?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to stay strong in our convictions, and explain why corruption is so bad for everyone. We can't give validation to corruption in our government. We can't accept that as American citizens, we're just supposed to accept that there are separate rules for us and the Washington elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can we have a representative democracy if the people we elect to represent us are no longer under the control of the laws of the people? This is the most damaging thing to ever happen to our country. It wasn't a foreign power invading us that killed America. It was corruption, born and bred here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone selling you that Clinton is just another politician doing politician things is an enemy to the democratic ideals our country was founded on. Remind them that people used to not stand up for corruption in this country. We just about lynched Nixon for it, we can be better than our forefathers. Corruption means that the American citizen has no power. It means that government is not representative of the will of the people. I will never condone that. The opportunity this country has provided me to live a prosperous and just life was provided to me by the people that elected leaders to represent them in creating laws that were beneficial to all of the people. Now, it will be special interests writing the laws to help special interests. The people be damned. I will never vote for condoning or normalizing corruption.

       Actually, it is a foreign influence, it's the influence of the zionist cabal, who by nature have no allegiance to America other than abusing it for Israel's own benefits. We have been overtaken by a people who don't give a fuck about the American way, or American values -- that's why they're socially engineering these values out of our culture. Individualism, Christianity, Freedom; these are all American, Western values that are in direct opposition to the Cultural Marxist values that they are pushing upon us. They start us young too, they're teaching this shit in elementary school now. You better believe it's an outside influence, if you don't you have more research to do!

       "They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fuckin’ years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it. And now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your fuckin’ retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street. And you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you sooner or later ’cause they own this fuckin’ place. It’s a big club and you ain’t in it. You and I are not in the big club. …The table is tilted, folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. …And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. That’s what the owners count on. The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes every day, because the owners of this country know the truth. It’s called the American Dream, ’cause you have to be asleep to believe it.” ~ Life Is Worth Losing (2005)

       I can tell you the vast majority of Harvard, MIT and Stanford grads are actively and loudly supporting Hillary. But thinking for themselves has never been high on the priority list of groups that define success in terms of conforming to a system, then working very hard to achieve within the confines of the rules of that system.

       I'm pretty sure it's always been that way. Most people don't want to know the truth, they don't want to be stressed out over "things they can't control". Selfies and football are a stress release from the every day grind. Everyone handles things differently..

       I've known a lot of older people, and done a ton of research. From what I know, people back in the day were simple, yes, but far from idiots when it came to politics. People listened to the news intently because they wanted the knowledge and information. Men read the newspaper every morning at breakfast, and listened to the radio at night. City Council meetings were packed. People discussed purposed local laws and ordinances, and whether or not they were good for the community. People gave a shit. It's completely different nowadays.

       The answer to that is both yes, and no.

       The amount of information available to any one person, almost instantly, is overwhelming. At the same time, from the leaks we see, that information is being manipulated by many different paid groups. It is easy to become apathetic when you see an ocean of despair before you. There wasn't 24 hour news owned by one of 6 major media organizations. There wasn't 6 bajillion websites own by regular people, people wanting to be informed, russian propaganda sources, us propaganda sources, right/left wingnut group, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, any bias in one of the few sources they read from or listened was far more dangerous as it was near impossible to get more of the story. They very well could have been 'well informed' with the latest US.GOV misinformation.

       It's all over the election. Just blame anything "wrong" with the election on Russia. That way if Hillary wins, nothing happens and it gets dropped since she controls the MSM, and if Trump wins, she gets to call cheating on Trump, since he's all buddy buddy with Russia, and that way Hillary wins even if she doesn't win.

       You misunderstood my question, I'm referring to this meme that everyone refers to about how Russian are infamous purveyors of propaganda, yet they can never show me an instance of one. Any actual Russian propaganda was from the Soviet Union, not from now. He referred to Russians actually distributing propaganda, of which I have seen none. I'm sure they have their own Russian propaganda that is in Russian, but I can't see why Russians would bother propagandizing Americans, it makes no sense.

       Oh, that's what you meant. Yeah, I don't see anything like that either. And you're right, they do have their own propaganda, but nowhere near the level we have here.

       We also know our government doesn't care too much about us, because we know Russia has nuclear evacuation drills on a set date, as well as directions to nuclear bunkers, but in America, we don't have any of that. The most we got was the equivalent of "bend over and kiss your ass goodbye".

       It's pretty desperate that the mainstream media is now purveying bullshit conspiracy theories though. I have to say, it's hilarious. They spend so much time attempting to disarm and dismantle conspiracy theories, yet when it fits their own narrative we see them launching into vast hypotheticals about Putin's intentions to disrupt our elections, like he really gives a fuck. He cares about his own country, and he's proven to be a better leader than anyone from the West. A single look at the statistics of Putin's support shows he is more popular than a single American President has ever been at any point in the last half a century. He's recovered their economy, he's been a strong leader and fought on the Russian's behalf against the tyrannical West. It's so pitiful what our country has become.

       There's still circles of politically -oriented couples. They're the ones with the money, who do everything that they can to game the system and protect the status quo. They also fake virtue, so that less corrupt "friends" who came into money can be roped into their causes. The DNC is driven by these people. They're the ones who support Hillary over Sanders.

       I'm an employee at Costco, and besides the entitlement people have walking in, they can be so god damn dumb. I witnessed a brawl between two older men because a cheesecake sample didn't have a strawberry on it and the other one did. What the fuck.

       By the definition of the herd, they will never 'wake up'.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are lazy, comfortable in ignorance until information is handed to them. Inundated with information and choice, always entertained, never bored, they are totally fine with being lied to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think humans are wired this way naturally. Rather the 'herd' has been cultivated. The entertainment industry provided the kindling and embers, lack of self and paternal discipline are the faggots on the fire.

       And yet you choose to insult and exaggerate the supposed 80% while being all high and mighty about it instead of respecting the idea that these are separate lives from yours in their own situations. So what that they have a favorite athlete or partake in duckfacing on social media? That's what interests them, even if it is a system. Why should you be the one who knows best for them?

       So fucking well said!  I am in IT and have been on the internet since the early 1990's and when I see the things that people are doing on the internet (constantly checking in every fucking place they go, posting selfies, snap chat, etc) I am just blown away.  Like you said, we all have access to limitless information.  I personally would rather get stuck looking up stuff on Wikipedia for a full day rather than take pictures of every meal I eat to post on Facebook so my friends can mindlessly like my post.

      <p>
       But she's winning a huge majority of the people who watch cable news every night, and don't really pay attention to politics otherwise. That's a big demographic.

        Yeah, well visible support means nothing. Just like how Bernie had huge rallies and lost anyway. Romney had a huge rally in Florida during 2012, bigger than Obama and lost too. All this means is that visible support and enthusiasm for a candidate means nothing. Clintons folks just don't feel the need to go to rallies. We have jobs, unlike the youngsters supporting Bernie and the trashy jobless deplorables supporting Trumpy.

       I have friends from college who have PhD.s in Chemistry and Neuroscience... They are openly in support of HRC...
      </p>

       One would think that at least someone educated from an elite college would be aware of HRC's crimes, but my God was I so horribly mistaken.

       I also know indoctrinated, er, educated people who openly support HRC. They are exactly the ones who are most likely to rationalize her crimes away as "just politics." They still love Obama, too, think he's doing a bang up job, and want more of the same. Unaware and compliant citizenry, indeed!
      </p>
      <p>
       However, these are the same people who still believe in the crap certification program known as higher education in this country enough to throw massive amounts of money into the letters after their name. Doesn't make them smart, makes them conformist and frankly unable to see through the sham that our "universities" have become. People with advanced degrees have just spent longer in the indoctrination machine, and are usually more deeply in debt for it. Debt creates wage slaves of all collar-colors who don't have the time to think through issues. They are trained like Pavlovian dogs to accept the words of perceived "authority" without question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Higher education doesn't increase intelligence, awareness, or one's ability to think critically. That's not the goal at all. As Carlin said, "they want obedient workers, people just smart enough to run the machines and just dumb enough to passively accept their situation."

      <p>
       Next time he says that I'm going to say "Well, that could be because she constantly has scandals going on, and aside from that, the only stuff that influenced my decision is what has come to light in the past 3-4 years."

       It's called welfare, or other forms of government financial dependency. Many Hillary supporters are bribed with American Tax dollars and are effectively unable to vote against her because they believe it would personally harm them financially. They have become so dependent and for so long, that they literally believe that they deserve the money. Case in point: BLM and reparations. Seriously, 5% of the population owned slaves and yet they believe that 87% of the current population should give the 13% population of black financial compensation. Bottom line, slavery is fucked up and severely hurt the African American communities. However, while it doesn't justify it happening, slavery is the best thing that has happened to Africans in the last 300 years. Welfare,Financial Aid to get free education, Healthcare, sub-subsidized housing, food stamps etc.. Or starvation, disease and every other horrible thing that is a daily occurrence for black in Africa. Barrack Obama's half brother even said that colonization was the best thing that happened to Africa. Doesn't make it right or excuse it, fucked up shit happens. In fact research the Barbary coast, North Africans and Muslims enslaved europeans for a very long time before things flipped. As for the self-deprivating whites who feel guilty for their "white privilege", I am at a loss. Why would you feel guilty for something you had no involvement in. And secondly, nearly every country in the world is more beneficial to the indigenous people

       To be fair, there is lots of evidence that she's intelligent. But she's using that intelligence for nefarious means, so I definitely don't agree that she's fit to run anything.

       And yet the public doesn't really like her. Try to actually find a Hillary supporter outside of a brainwashed College Campus. It's going to be pretty hard. It's one of the reasons she has stopped making public appearances. It's embarrassing to hold a rally an have almost no one show up. Especially when your opponent has lines a mile long outside his.

       I am very anti-Hilary and sway between Pro-Trump and better than Hillary. That said, Hillary is by no means a stupid woman and is intellectually fit to run our country. Her health might be a legitimate concern, but she is highly intelligent. However, she is a rotten psychopath who would use her intellect to benefit herself and the powers that be, and with zero regard for us. She would almost certainly even knowing the risk, make choices that would cause the deaths of as many people as deemed necessary to profit or  accomplish her agenda.

       But I'm not above giving credit where it's due. She has a degree from Yale, in case you didn't know that's kind of a big deal. There are plenty, and I mean plenty of reasons to hate Hillary, but never underestimate your enemy.

       You probably think Bush was an idiot too? He is actually quite smart, well at least smart enough to fool most of the world into thinking he's an idiot so that nobody would suspect he is capable of the criminal act that he got away with. Instead people just got mad at how "stupid" he is, when they should have instead hung him for treason.

       Hillary may be intelligent, on the other hand there's been quite a few cases where it became obvious she's an unpleasant, untrustworthy person. That is not something that should come to light. I think it's a problem for her campaign. That's really how fowl is; even with all the planning, marketing, and gathering the best people around her, they have not been able to hide that from the world.

       Consider also that as she is highly intelligent and resides in her own echo chamber, she may have the belief that she is "too smart to be caught / stopped".  Many psychopaths / megalomaniacs are highly intelligent, have a inflated sense of self worth and think that what they are doing is right "as they know better".   One of her mentors is Kissinger and he rationalized prolonging the Vietnam war by sabotaging peace negotiations.

       True, the thought that the public is being manipulated is unfathomable for many people. "Mind control" is the negative conspiracy theory label that leaps to their mind whereas what the government engages in is the much more palatable term, "perception management".  It's simply

        "The Engineering of Consent"

       . The problem is that the individual cannot see the large scope of the statistical game of numbers - the biggest clue being the demographic target profile.

       I think acknowledging that we are / can be manipulated runs counter to the narrative that we all have free will and make decisions on our own terms.  Along the same lines that "if it was a conspiracy, somebody would have talked" -- it shows how little people understand about "true believers"  / zealots / group think.  Its the same reason that police corruption doesn't get reported.

       Yeah pretty much. I was watching this documentary about sheep, and how after thousands of years of natural selection by humans, the sheep lost their horns, their ears became floppy, and they became more passive and less rebellious. The genes for their brains literally changed over the centuries, and now they are essentially engineered for their environment, being completely passive and beholden to whatever the farmer makes them do, which helps with shearing and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think of this and wonder... humanity has been civilized about 6,000 years or so, and maybe this same type of natural selection has been going on. The herd has been chosen to be passive, the poor and dumb are made to breed while the rich and smart are told to wait. Like idiocracy. It has already happened. But it's not about people being dumb per se, because intelligence can be a very useful asset, but more about them being obedient. So we have people that are willing to put up with absolute nonsense and we have this kind of nation-wide bystander effect going on, because the majority are actually genetically and biologically suited to their condition of being owned through millennia of natural selection.
      </p>
      <p>
       How fucking sad is that. I wish that were easily proven wrong. The "sheeple" analogy is unfortunately way more accurate than I ever realized.

       Yeah i think the domestication of animals/factory farming has a big influence on the psychology of domesticated humans in the 21st century. Everyone knows they basically have the same emotions as we do and feel pain just like we do but people are so fucking cowardly, and they are taught to be like this, that they think "well better them than me" and eventually they pick up rationalisation after rationalisation for what is basically looking at their own slavery in a mirror lol

       What you're talking about in regards to humans sound a lot more like memes than genes. Richard Dawkins first coined the term and its basically how ideas and concepts are replicated and "inherited" by subsequent generations. Here's a good article that explains more about it.

       I think after thousands of years it would not only influence our held ideologies but the genes that shape our brains, just as happened with sheep. People who rebel too strongly are often targeted to be killed in times of war, removing them from the gene pool

       The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.

       You can bring up Wikileaks' track record of publishing things that aren't related to Hillary. Collateral Murder and the like... Plus the fact that no one in Hillary's campaign or in the DNC have denied anything. Debbie stepped down after the DNC leaks. Hillary keeps making up different excuses instead of denying the source. Plus all the metadata from the email headers match up. Specifically, IP addresses in the headers map to the correct organizations' servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Challenge your friends to figure out how massively complicated it would be to fabricate tens of thousands of emails that would hold up to the strictest of scrutiny. Then remind them of how easy it would be for a disgruntled insider to get their hands on this data and leak it, for contrast.

       Do the headers contain DKIM signatures to prove the emails have not been tampered? I'm not joining a side in this fight, I'm just a lowly security engineer that has seen faked emails with organization ip addresses fraudulently added to emails to appear legit

       Indeed they do; another great point that I forgot to bring up. Perhaps not all, I've not checked more than 50 or so, but on all the ones I have there is a DKIM signature. There's a "View Source" tab on the DNC, Podesta and HRC emails. At least for Podesta's set they only serve source for emails smaller than 10KB, but the raw data in the form of a .eml file is available for those exceeding the threshold. Take a look at a few of them if you like.

      </p>
      <p>
       Though, even in the event of the emails lacking DKIM it's worth noting that it would be very cumbersome for Wikileaks, Russia, or any other organization to actually come up with a conversation flow for over (just guessing) 100K emails going back years. It would be a massive operation and a really poor investment - all that work, and the narrative the "fake" emails spun could be destroyed by the parties in question releasing their "real" emails. In my opinion, if they were fake they would already have done this

       Not really. You would have to manually craft a macro-scale story that fits your agenda and then work out all the small interactions and internal scuffles that lead up to it. These aren't like the AI softball reporter stories... each individual is unique in their word choice, style of writing, phrasing and opinions in subtle ways. Automated processes can't produce nuanced documents such as these yet. Maybe in 10 years, if we're being optimistic.

       Hillary was asked about her "politicians need a pubic and private two-faced position" quote from the leaked emails.

       She remembered saying it, which is amazing she remembered anything, and the context of the statement.

       Hillary is going to get rid of Assad because that's the next step in the NWO plan.  She will continue to fund Isis to go into Syria and further provoke Russia.  Trump wants to work with Russia to take out Isis and then leave.

       His position is more complicated than that. I wish people would quit shitting on him with this line. He's for free trade and an opponent of preferential treatment. He's said he would sign the TPP if it wasn't weighed down with cronyism... Which it is.

       I think Gary is of a very skeptical nature. His political philosophy is very resolute, but he seems to hesitate on some specific policies. He tends to leave his options open on policies as such when all the info isn't out there, from what I've seen. I can't fault him for that; I'm the same way. Though admittedly, I don't second-guess myself nearly as much as he does. Not sure if that's a pro or a con.

       I think it has to do a lot with the sheer volume of information. It's like taking a shower in warm water, and then dumping a cup of cold water on your head. You'll feel it immediately, but the effects quickly wear off because of your encountering the new warm water. What we do now, just writing in a subreddit that is against the corruption of hillary, we fill up our own cup of cold water to douse on people. My point being, its a volume game.

       I think it's mostly to do with the 24 hour news cycle. The damn news cycle holds so much power in America. All of this shit through this campaign has been brought up for 24 hours or maybe even 72 hours if we stretch, but then it just gets wiped under the rug. It's the same thing will mass shootings. Everyone grieves and cares for a day but the narrative changes and nobody cares anymore. In my opinion, the MSM has a lot more power in America than people think.

       So the thing you need to understand is it isn't necessarily that people are dumb, in fact when 1-on-1 with the average individual without outside external influences the average person is mostly just unaware.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue that you're facing is brainwashing, and herd mentality. Almost every American brought up by the US education system has been taught to respect authority above and beyond their own thoughts. It starts with teachers, and parents, then works it way to police, and doctors, and then the media. I refer to this as authoritative reasoning, its a form of cognitive dissonance that discourages critical thought. Meanwhile, these people are not only discouraged from their own critical thinking, and reasoning, but they're also discouraged from believing or listening to others who are not state approved authority figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you factor in submission, and the hidden psychological triggers used by the media and politicians to control the masses further and you have a real mess of straight up brainwashing. The more stress people are under, the more susceptible they are to suggestion, and in this case they're mostly susceptible to suggestion through state approved authority like the media. The conditions that make people more open to suggestion include poverty, illness, health, fatigue, to pretty much anything that creates stress. This is why the news is broadcast during the evening, same goes for primetime television. They know the same messaging will be less effective in the morning, and instead push it on people at night when they're tired and more susceptible to suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why it is in politicians best interest to keep the public busy yet unhealthy, uneducated, in poverty, and under stress as it keeps everyone obedient, submissive, and under control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take for example what the media is doing with all these sexual accusations against Trump. Of course, there are now 9 people accusing him, so right there they're using the power of 9's. The same trick that marketers use when pricing products. They're then purposely triggering millions of women who have been sexually assaulted by constantly airing these women's accusations over and over again with generalized statements of how they were sexually assaulted. Then you have Michelle Obama's speech last week, which channeled their stress, and anger against Trump. It was orchestrated brilliantly, and triggered millions of women, and feminists to rally around Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you come along, and show one of these women a video proving Clinton's corruption from some random Youtube channel they've never heard of, they've been programmed to tune it out. They've been conditioned since birth to ignore your evidence, not think about it, and trust Michelle Obama and media figures instead because its safer then thinking about reality rationally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue 90% of people or more are completely unaware of everything I just told you, but these are the forces that govern the masses and why even when you get someone 1-on-1 they fail to see the evidence directly in front of them as it contradicts a life time of conditioning. This applies 2x for Millennials who are second generation brainwashed, essentially they're children of the first brainwashed generation the Baby Boomers. So not only are they conditioned by outside forces, but their own parents are brainwashed and have installed their programming onto their children.

       You are so right, I am a millennial. But I think the parents are actually more brainwashed and unaware. Millennials use the internet a lot, and get most of their news from it. A lot get caught up in the stupid memes and social media bullshit, but a lot are also aware of the shadow government government scheme.

       Wasn't saying hope is lost, I myself only truly woke up a few years ago. I think eventually the Millennial's might be the generation to wake up enough people to really change things, but it's still up in the air.

       I'm still deprograming myself and it isn't easy.

       Exactly!  To both your points! I used to have such little faith in my generation, which is probably a factor of the brainwashing. On top of that, the amount of rebellious kids my age gives me hope. Rebels without a cause...all we need is someone to lead us and give us cause.

       Leaders are going to have to come from within the Millennial generation. Unfortunately, the Boomers, and to some extent Gen X drew a line in the sand and have decided their own children aren't equal to them and do not deserve the same opportunities or standing in today's society, especially in our political system. It's really fascinating to study the propaganda that's perpetuated against Millennial's, when recent studies have shown there is no major difference in work ethic between generations, Millennial's simply get paid less to do the same jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's several factors though with Millennial's that still need to be overcome:
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of them are completely brainwashed, and divided because of it. They literally lack the language and free exchange of ideas to be able to communicate effectively because they're too afraid to offend others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current system and parents discourage growing up and achieving adulthood milestones as quickly as previous generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, they have no political power because they have no money. As Hillary Clinton stated in her leaked emails, Millennial's are children of the Great Recession. While offensive, she's right. An entire generation has been stripped of financial freedom and political power because of her generations banking policies, and politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way Millennial's can over come this is by finding ways to work together, fight the stereotypes, fight the propaganda, and force equal footing with our elders or remove them from power.

       Appeal to authority is a logical fallacy.  My favorite is the ridiculous notion lately that eye witness testimony is so unreliable that you can't even trust your own eyes but must get the story from an authority figure to know what's true.

       Well then eyewitness testimony should never be used for anything, ever, yet it is always used if it benefits an official narrative, and in those cases no one ever says "eye witness testimony is unreliable". It's ridiculous.

       There is a video on this on youtube where a group of people are throwing balls to each others. The video instructs you to count the number of throws between them.

       Only after the video is done you are told to rewatch it and look for the Gorilla. Turns out there is a guy in a HUGE gorilla suit just walking straight through the frame. Most people completely miss it as their focus is elsewhere.

       Gen-Xer here with Millennial children. My parents were fully brainwashed Boomers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public school system is mostly responsible for the brainwashing. I mean, you're unlikely to spawn a free thinker from a family who unquestioningly drinks the Kool-aid (it happens, though, I'm proof), but even in a non-conformist home environment, you're fighting an uphill battle. Get 'em up before dawn, keep 'em still for eight hours a day, make sure there's no way they can get enough sleep, ring bells to make them move from one place to another, teach them to stand in line and wait... it's not just the content, it's the very structure itself that indoctrinates them into "productive citizens" (read: good tax slaves).  My kids have grown up in an environment that strongly encourages them to question authority (to include my own), and yet the one who spent some time in public school has conformed fully whereas the "free" one is exactly that, a free thinker. God help him.

       Absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The structure of the public education system was actually derived from religious institutions. They use the same methodologies used by religions for thousands of years and modeled our modern education system after them. Primarily they used Catholicism methods and principles of "education". Yet instead of pushing religion, they push federally sanctioned authoritative conformity, and even control the language and vocabulary the masses use to limit their ability to work together and express themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally grew up mostly in the public system in a wealthy area, and even attended Catholic school briefly, until I tested out of high school as soon as I could. Luckily, I had a computer and the early Internet to help expand my mind and question the bullshit that was being shoved down my throat. Luckily, I realized early in life that I had to take it upon myself to educate myself, and seek truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even so, I eventually fell into authoritative traps especially in regards to the health care system in the US. For years I took drugs and listened to idiot doctors who just made me sicker. Finally woke up, and found actual solutions to my health issues. It's so easy to get caught up in the systems of control because they're all around us.

       Glad to hear you woke to the western medicine agenda and are recovering. Don't get me wrong, I am thrilled to live in an age with modern medicine, but yeah, the 'well, there's a pill for that' approach to "solving" health problems is not doing anyone any favors.

       There's probably some truth to that, whether or not Trump is in on it. Many of the emails indicate that other Republican candidates were purposely ignored by NBC in favor of Trump in an effort to ridicule the party.

       Very simple. We love our lattes, craft stores, comfy jobs, artisinal whatthefucks, and soul sucking commutes at ass-30 in the am. As annoying as all this shit is, as pointless as getting a job so you can go into debt even further, it is less annoying than having a revolution, or to face the reality of our situation here in the US; we haven't been in charge for a long time.

       The reason why is because most people already have it pretty good in the US so there's no point to risking their lives in political conflict in the streets. What do you want people to do? Vote for a clinton donor and family friend named donald trump, as if that's going to change anything? It's a fake contest, like a football game. Doesn't matter who you root for, the same people are behind the scenes owning the teams, profiting from the game, and controlling the stadiums.
      </p>
      <p>
       This current situation is all part of a rolling evolution of the political situation and the only way things will improve is with a gradual spreading of sentiments -- the same way everything else changed (like abolishing slavery, gay and civil rights, etc.), it all has to come gradually, it can't be won by single "battles". Nothing will ever improve for as long as people keep falling for this football game level bullshit where 2 families pass the highest offices and appointments in the federal gov. back and forth between their own sons, wives, and donors/family friends(which is what Trump is to Clinton, he's Bill's golfing buddy who has been set up to take over his wife's opposition so it doesn't matter who wins). Kind of like Bush II being set up to "run against" his own frat brother, Al Gore.
      </p>
      <p>
       both "parties" have been infiltrated by the same private interests and have been made hopelessly corrupt over the previous decades because they could keep their dirty laundry a secret via an bought and paid for media, it matters not a single bit which frontman they choose, and Trump is just the republican version of Obama, and yet here everyone is, falling for that same scam all over again and completely forgetting how hopelessly corrupt both parties are, just because some random fucking guy says the right things on TV, same as Obama did.

       The idea that people have it "pretty good" in the US is the biggest joke of all. Its one more propaganda point to keep the idiots from revolting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lived in the US for over twenty years and I have lived on four continents in coutries that varied from superpower to 3rd world. Having more "things" is the only point that the US has and its only a significant factor when compared to the 3rd world. Most developed countries only have slightly fewer "things" than the US while at the same time being superior in almost every other possible area of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having a banana holder or a waffle maker does not equal happiness or a better life. I quite honestly would rank the US almost dead last in terms of
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       quality of life, particularly the idea of living life to the fullest.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the US, most people will never even be able to make the comparison because the majority will not even leave the country and a very small minority will
       <em>
        visit
       </em>
       another country. The people who live in the US and abroad
       <em>
        as adults
       </em>
       is so tiny that no matter what I could genuinely tell you about life and lifestyle in other countries, nobody will listen, the vocal majority will diminish my arguments by dragging them through the mud, and they will continue to mumble "we're number one" under their breath as they continue to live one of the worst first-world existences on the planet.

       uh, well, we live better than we would be living during a civil war. want some proof? go compare the destroyed cities in Syria to the cities of the US.    What we have is better than what we would have if suddenly people decided to shut everything down by fighting in the streets, so sane people don't do it, because they have enough good things in their lives to not be willing to risk losing it for any political struggles. The political situation throughout history has improved for the common man over time, and it will likely keep going in that direction
       <em>
        naturally
       </em>
       , without any violent struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       here we are with our indoor plumbing, advanced medicine and clean well-supplied hospitals, hot water, electricity, internet, job opportunities that pay more than 25 cents per day like billions of people slave away for picking garbage and plastics out of landfills or chopping sugar cane or bamboo.
      </p>
      <p>
       not to mention the fact that you can bitch about all this stuff on the internet without being kidnapped by the secret police (like what happened in places like Syria or Saudi Arabia or Eritrea), the good things in america are not just gone because of some corrupt nutcases in politics and business. People have it good enough now to not be willing to risk participating in anything that might change that for the worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are a great deal of good things in the US that aren't available to people born in other places (exceptions being other advanced first world countries), positive change will only come gradually through generational shifts and shifting sentiment, same as abolishing the use of slavery and the random hanging of minorities, it won't come from fighting. The rich folks are 1000% prepared for fighting, and they'd win, because they can pay half the poor to control the other half. Gotta be peaceful social  change.

       There are a number of first world countries who have it great, yet are still 1000x more politically active than the US, consistently hold country-wide protests, and therefore don't have to live with an out of control government with a blank check to terrorize their neutered population.

       Almost every country in the world. Its not the 1800's, its 2016 everywhere. Also "hospitals" is a joke right. Going to the hospital in the US is incomparable to the majority of the world, where life-saving procedures aren't held hostage for obscene amounts of money.

      <p>
       I've been to these countries and guess what? Its incomparable. You cannot say, this person over here only makes this much and we make this much. Places where people are paid so little have adjusted prices that correspond to those wages. Kilos of fresh produce for cents, where in the US we are paying 15-20 dollars for the same things. Those places also have stronger communities where people still farm and trade with each other, no money needed. And they don't need to spend money on ridiculous "permits", so almost everyone has livestock and gardens in their backyards. Also, they have better infrastructures for the community and people don't need cars or gas.

       Like 95% of the world. But, hey lets keep patting the US on the back form not being in the bottom 5%!
      </p>
      <p>
       The US
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be in the
       <strong>
        top
       </strong>
       5% based on our resources, our size, and our ingenuity. But it really isn't. We spread the idea that we are and our media shoves that idea down our throats, but its just one more lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its honestly sad. Our country has been highjacked after WW2 and everything has quickly fallen into disrepair. At the same time, we have been fed a constant brainwashing campaign and the almighty dollar has become a god. The result of that god is a horrible food industry, horrible infrastructures in the majority of the country, horrible education system that leaves people in debt, an extremely corrupt media, corrupt banks, corrupt trading, an automobile and gas-dependent country, and a neutered population with an out of control justice system.
      </p>
      <p>
       And believe me, the average American feels this, the stress and degradation wears away at them. Many pretend not that it doesn't. But all of these things have affected our core values. Things like family and community and enjoying the simple "free" things in life. Travelling and experiencing other cultures, not working yourself to death, not needing to spend a decade getting out of college debt or medical debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things that actually still exist in the majority of places outside of the US, and believe me those people are happier, much happier. Even the ones from the dirt poor places, I've lived with them. Not seen them while I walking by, not visited them for a week or a month,
       <em>
        lived
       </em>
       with them and
       <em>
        lived
       </em>
       that lifestyle, for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       But honestly, I do actually agree with a lot of the things you are saying. I am just kind of an a rampage because I am so tired of the majority of Americans thinking they have it so much better than everyone. Its like an illusion or a castle made of sand. But the rest of the stuff you write in your comments I really agree with. How both sides of the political spectrum are an illusion and how the rich would win if we rose up and we need to be more clever.

       If entertainment is one of the reasons why people ignore the real world issues, then perhaps use it as a medium to communicate. For example, the House of Cards tv show is very popular and Bill Clinton remarked it is 99% accurate. Perhaps using this tv show can convert some people into seeing how corrupt the Clintons are.

       Reality has been becoming more clear as of late. As the truth becomes more available, those who do not believe the truth reject it in sum. So as we can see what is really going on better, they have even more trouble understanding it. They will only see the truth when the world is in shambles.
      </p>
      <p>
       What can we do? Hard to say. I've been grappling with this question a lot lately. Continue spreading the truth in the most clear way you can. The truth is powerful. Don't let people scare you into abandoning it. I almost fell for that today. You guys remind me I'm not alone.

       so looking at all the comments here, it seems that everybody is either brainwashed, they only trust the msm, or they're just retarded. i'm gonna bring up another part of the population: the people who don't give a shit. the people who don't watch the news or pay attention to politics in general. the people who have their own problems in their lives, bills to pay, car problems, 8-12 hour workdays, seven day a week jobs and all the other shit that keeps people from giving a shit about politics. the people who know that it doesn't matter who becomes president, because tomorrow they still have to wake up, go to work, and deal with their own problems.

       for the most part those people are cowardly authoritarians, not saying i'm brave or ahything just an observation from working with them. there's no need to respect someone just for working hard, especially if its purely selfish. that's your brainwashing kicking in.

       See this raises some good points. A lot of adults in the workforce match this. The problem is that they reject that social change comes from the
       <em>
        majority

       standing up. They don't want to stand up for themselves at work or against insurance companies or whatever. They just bend over with their cheeks spread saying "this is just how the world works, cant change it, nothing i can do"

       They've been brainwashed to think there's no other way. As an analogy, these people refuse to stop eating beef because the cows "wouldn't know how to live in the wild", i just had this conversation with my mother who is a smart woman. These cognitive dissonances are put into people's minds on purpose.

       Both parties and both candidates are corrupt. But we, collectively as a society, give them a free pass. For every one person that stands up and tries to make a difference and change minds apart from typing out their opinion on a public forum, a thousand more say that "X is the lesser of two evils", and go about their day as usual.

       If we want the politics to change, we need to change the politicians. Voting X into office because Y is a bigger ass doesn't solve anything.

       Yes, that's true. Whenever I am trying to expose to someone Hillary's crimes, it makes me feel like im just endorsing Trump. And then I think that that doesn't seem right either, because he's also a horrible choice for presidency.

       We need to fix us the people, not politicians. There will always be corrupt politicians.
       <br/>
       How many of us in here actually attend town hall meetings, let alone read meeting notes from town website?  Most people dont even know wtf is going on in their own town yet people think they have judgement to know what is happening in their state/county and pick a right politician?
Garbage politicians come from garbage society. And in turn they make garbage society again, the cycle recycles. We only have ourselves to blame. we are always to quick to blame others first, when in fact the root problem is within ourselves first.

       They still control a large chunk of information control, and they control the education system.  So they have millions of people who will never run across the info, and millions more who if they

       are trained to dismiss it.

       They're not dumb, they're brainwashed. They see the evidence but they're trained to believe if it's true, it'll be on the news. When the news programs ignore it or give it little consideration, they think it must not be important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like WTC 7.  If that had happened on any other day, nobody would have believed office fires. But because the news claimed it was damaged and hot fires and mumble mumble... people are mesmerized into inaction.

       Things change all the time. Don't be a useful idiot, you think a revolution is gonna solve everything? It will be compromised. The CIA has been doing that since it was started. It has to be a gradual evolution and so far it's going ok. Just wait until the real crackdown comes.

       What "crackdown." You guys aren't doing ANYTHING..
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, the NSA deals with the vast majority of the intelligence workload. Not the CIA. This includes screening for prospective political dissidents or any activity that can be deemed inflammatory or subversive to the Union -- they handle more than all of the federal bureaus COMBINED. The NSA is being breached ad nauseum by sources not even they can definitively identify -- whether they be foreign or domestic. Their security is not infallible. Why do you think these entities outsource skills and trades from the people they unremittingly hunt down and indict? If a security system contains any discernible flaws, then sooner or later, someone will come along to exploit those vulnerabilities. The NSA isn't the end-all-be-all of intelligence agencies; they aren't some meritorious paragon for security services everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I don't think a revolution will solve ANYTHING. And would you care to know why? BECAUSE YOU CLOWNS DON'T WANT TO BE LIBERATED.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard the old addage: "These hoes don't want to be saved." WELL, YOU PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE FREE. You want something you can't have. You are some of the most unqualified, inept, pusillanimous people that plague the internet. If shit hit the fan tomorrow and everything crumbled to dust and detritus -- every government, every society, every appreciable human settlement -- you think people would be jumping in joy and paralyzing ecstasy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like "YES! FINALLY! These 1% billionaire autocrats  who have surreptitiously had their foot to our throats for all these centuries are gone. AT LAST, WE CAN REBUILD!!!111"
      </p>
      <p>
       You people would lose your fucking minds and piss your fucking dresses. You're like a bunch of helpless babies; you wouldn't know what the fuck to do, even IF a coup proved successful. Half of you clowns can't even name our three branches of government -- you think you people would know how to rebuild our government from scratch?? For the better?? LMFAO. You need to be enslaved. And I think on some level, you all know that to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think a revolution would be fruitless? In 1776, an army of ill-trained, ill-prepared and unqualified part-time citizen-soldiers waged war against the greatest military power in the world and emerged victorious.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1944, a resistance militia comprised of Jews and other undesirables under Nazi law waged war against Germany. They fought for a month before they were finally neutralized. In that time they destroyed hundreds of artillery pieces and killed over 10,000 German soldiers. An underground resistance that was also ill-prepared, unqualified, and ill-trained to surmount the deeply entrenched occupying powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       History is replete with democracies going tyrannical or usurpatious and inciting democide against their own populace. It is also teeming with instances of rebellions against those tyrants, both successful and unsuccessful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outcome isn't important. What is important is AT LEAST
       <strong>
        trying
       </strong>
       to combat the entity YOU ALL agree is on the precipice of systematically and uniformly enslaving this nation and industrially slaughtering any undesirables that may exist post-reformation. For our future and for our children.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be the one to explain to all posterity how you sat on your lazy ass and spread awareness on this pitiful subreddit, with Cheeto dust sprinkled on your neckbeard as the 1% unscrupulously plotted to financially enslave our nation and bastardize the values and ideas our Founding Fathers toiled to preserve. But until then stop bitching and moaning about something you aren't going to do shit about.

       You can try to control your revolution if you want, i think it will burn out or be hijacked like most. I'd rather people think and play the system over the long run as self-aware individuals. All i can do to achieve that is talk to people. I don't believe people need to be herded into a mass movement, but i know that people will use them.

       They don't want to hear about it. It's the same way good people do nothing when the junta comes for their neighbors.  Thinking about it turns there stomachs so they turn a blind eye and live in self imposed ignorant bliss.  And a lot are just straight up dumb drones that do as they are told.

       Just go to the politics subreddit and have a look at what's going on.  It's literally ALL pro Hillary or anti-trump. They claim to have 3.5 million subscribers (but only 6k browsing in off hours).
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to go there once and interject some pro trump comments and my comment was shadowbanned without warning or reason immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       A scroll through the comments section through any of the threads will be nothing but how bad Trump is and, to a lesser degree, how Hillary is going to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, imagine going to the politics subreddit with the intention of getting news and you're immediately sucked into a vacuum of propaganda. The anti-trump info is so total that you would feel odd having anything but pro-hillary thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you go to conspiracy and you see here a more natural discourse. Almost everything here is about the corruption of Hillary, the DNC, the FBI, attorney general, government in general and while there is a more fair representation of Trump, he still has some detractors here.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       is a 100% psyop FOR Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then keep in mind that a lot of people find worth in their ideas only when they're widely shared and understand that that mentality naturally keeps them out of a place called "conspiracy" and all the connotations that conveys.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, lastly, people are stupid. Even redditors. The majority of them  probably can't find independent information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen such complete propaganda on any forum as I've seen on politics.

       A lot of people I talk to seem to understand that the government is corrupt, but they just don't care. If it's out of sight, it's out of mind and they can go about their day in peace. But these same people are offended at the notion of a Trump presidency because he is loud and he is bigoted and the media is constantly shoving him in all our faces.

       It is called domestication. No other justice system is so brutal in locking up people for the smallest crimes, taking away the voting rights in the process. No other police force is so trigger happy to execute on the spot everyone who does not bow over.

       When this goes on for hundreds of years you end up with those voting and reproducing who are the least capable of original thought and just mindlessly follow what the gov't says. The definition of sheeple.

       They elect people to make the big decisions for them. Unfortunately the people they entrusted with the power to enforce the laws that should apply to every individual, including those elected to power, have no respect for the positions they hold or the trust that the people gave them. There is no other way to explain it. It's not the fault of the people, it's the fault of the men and women who chose not to do the hard thing, even though it's the right thing. They will go down in history as the cowards and weasels they are.

       It's called sorcery(JK, not really, but what is magic if not a trick of the mind?), and when all of a state's media is owned by several billionaires, it gets disseminated to the masses via news, facebook, google search results, and hollywood. Spells of illusion across networks of media that converge to deceive. An example of this is the trending topics on FB. Notice how downplayed all the wikileaks are on Hillary? Then some memes start going around, depicting Hillary as some rebel badass for basically storing classified material on her private server, which is a blatant insult to those who cite wikileaks, and then the obvious Trump bash.  I could go on, I think we all get it. I do disagree with the lesser of two evils. George Carlin said it right, there's an illusion of choice, this country is owned.

       This is mostly speculation; i'm not a psychologist, politician, economist, i don't work for the DNC and i am not a federal agent either so bear with me when i say that i am just a philosopher in my own mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corruption in the DNC, yes. However the corruption is multifaceted and it encompasses more than just the election. That being said, with the election, take for instance that the entire thing basically boils down to he said she said. This is propagated by news media on both sides in their portrayal of the election as a reality TV show (let it be known that newscasters speak like hypnotists); that alone is pretty corrupt in itself and to people like us it triggers a gutwrenching feeling of "damn, something is wrong here". Keep in mind that independant journalists and news groups are also guilty of this and are largely only liable for confirmation bias by picking a side; true mediators are far and few between unfortunately. In light of this, how anyone can actually pick a side in this political theater at this point is far and away completely beyond me. I am beginning to think that the way people beat their chests and defend their chosen politician's shitty ideals to the extreme is some MK shit. The ideals they defend are not theirs, and their thoughts are not their own so what gives? It isn't like we haven't experienced this before in other elections but for some reason the circle jerking and inane deprecation is much more emphatic this time around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking on the DNC thing; thank god for Julian and his recent work, really really. It doesn't seem like a lot of people talk about it but believe me when i say many have come to know that everything is well and truly fucked through the illumination of certain emails and such. The distraction for others i think comes from the pavlovian response in the he said she said thing. Hillary said something about Donald, everyone loses their shit. Donald rebuts against Hillary, everyone loses their shit ad infinitum. The back and forth for whatever reason is a lot more interesting than what is happening under the hood. Not only does it distract from the issues in DNC, so too does it distract from all of the blaringly obvious and shady geopolitics going on in Europe right now. I have had to explain why the entire world is poised for war to many people when everything is just in the open waiting to be scrutinized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also every corner of the US is steeped in dark occult symbolism, but that's a corruption for another time i think.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what can we do? Manly Palmer Hall, esoteric philosopher who wrote the master works "Secret Teachings of All Ages", "Lectures on Ancient Philosophy" and "the Secret Destiny of America" has stated that we must become the reflection of what we wish to see in others. So bring it up conversationally with people you know, or just anyone. Form a dialogue with people that they can learn from, and present yourself in a manner that is easily understood. Maybe you'll get chastised as a tinfoil hat toting neck bearded basement dweller, but honestly i have not encountered this so much, and if you were to encounter it who cares? Words are like water, don't let yourself steep in them, just let them wash off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sort of a tangent here but it must be said. Truth is objective. Our representations of truth are either right or wrong; truth is not created by us, truth simply IS. In order to find truth, one must put themselves in the objective mind frame and correlate information received in a manner that can be picked over and sifted through without one's own emotions getting in the way, which would make it seem more of a subjective or relative matter. As an object being a key phrase here, and why would an object give a fuck about what you feel about it? If i described an apple as a banana i am objectively wrong, and no matter how strong my perception of the apple as a banana is i am still wrong. A modern scientist and a peasant from a thousand years ago describe a mountain very differently, but the mountain has not changed from a mountain, merely the way in which we describe it has changed. Truth exists outside of our perception in other words. Work with it, take what you hear from any source with a grain of salt, and practice introspection religiously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let adversity dishearten you friends, those who ignore natural law are hopefully very soon going to get the shaft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I would pontificate to the OP that it really is no longer a game of lesser evils. Barack Obummer was perceived to be a lesser evil, and yet he seemed very diligent to continue the work of his predecessor with things like drone programs and proxy wars. Hillary and Trump are two sides of the same coin, Trump for years was a registered democrat and a friend of Bill's. This is just word of mouth, but i heard he also helped Bill with his own campaign funding; so Trump and the Clintons are in cahoots at the very least.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as the final final edit can we all please just keep in mind that the president is only a glorified spokesperson, and the face of the country? He can veto laws but if congress decides not to give a fuck they can veto the veto, its fucking dumb. Not a true law maker, not a true power outside of being commander in chief, and thats really the only point in being pres these days, to start wars for people with $$$$$$.

       What can we do to convince people?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't but then you can. Here's why. Humans are self-interested. To cut to the chase and save you a philosophical discussion, you can only convince someone about something when shit hits the fan and threatens THEM personally and panic ensues. Take climate change, lack of resources to feed people, overpopulation and the like. People won't really believe you or be convinced and act until these events are PERSONALLY threatening THEM. Get it?
      </p>
      <p>
       So about the election. It's the exact same principal. The entire thing is rigged from the bottom up, rich people controlling governments, controlling puppets like Hillary, controlling the mainstream media like CNN or literally anything else anti trump at this point. Then what we have are the masses. Your average joe in his/her own world with an infinite set of a fuckton of stuff to take care of (family, money, jobs, food, you name it). When joe turns on the television, phone, car radio, or newspaper and is fed the superfluous bullshit by same self-centered humans who control everything in the first place to protect themselves and then sugarcoat it by having puppets called the government and presidential candidates who represent order, respect, law and all that bullshit jazz that pleases our self-centered human nature to think that everything is fine. Joe won't be convinced, especially by a bunch of loonies like us on r/conspiracy lol posting on reddit's biggest subs like r/politics and the like which are controled by the highest bidder if you didn't know, nah. Joe will be convinced though, until shit hits him in the face, when something in his little world is threatened to the brink of destruction, then he will act.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr, humans = their own little worlds and as long as everything's in sync, nothing will change. else, boom.

       I had a co worker tell me, "..but how do you know that WikiLeaks, isn't well, just made up?". My head almost exploded! The average person just believes everything that's on the news and more so if its on the Daily Show, John Oliver, or Colbert. Drives me so crazy.

       Most people were never all that well informed in the first place,  and right now the social pressure by their in group is to go along with the DNC corruption out of fear of Trump as the monster he is portrayed as.   Of course Trump is somewhat of a monster,  so its not too hard to filter his image for a corrupt corporate media.

       You're right about many Hilary supporters, but there are persuasive arguments to elect her to get more favorable policies. For those that follow politics, the SCOTUS has made some very bad decisions regarding campaign finance and voting rights. Democrats tend to favor more working class interested policies. Now, many of them are just corrupt and pretend to support these policies as they work against them, but that is still a more favorable game for workers to play with than having those who openly speak against working class benefitting policies occupy the legislature.

Workers want high wages and benefits, effective worker, customer, and environmental safety regulations, and social safety net programs to help them when their life situation goes to hell, by being fired, injured, or not being able to adequately save for retirement. These are the self-interests of workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Owners have different self-interests. They want maximum profits. Perhaps you are a worker and an owner of stock. Don't you want maximum profits too? OK, profits can be maximized by minimizing the cost of labor. That means lower wages and benefits. Also, lower taxes help owners keep more of their profits, from internal company fiscal efficiency as well as when getting paid back from the stock. So, having lower taxes helps owners reap more benefit. Big owners don't need social safety net programs, because they can cover costs themselves. They don't see a benefit from them, but they see the burden on the government requiring taxation. So they generally work against these programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The former paragraph describes the publicly stated focus of the Democrats, to fight for working class interests. The latter paragraph describes the publicly stated focus of the Republicans. The left vs right conflict plays out similarly in other countries too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, there are so many here that are just pavlovian fools, like the dog drooling upon hearing the ringing of a bell associated with food, they rail against anything politically left because of the programming against communism or socialism. It's sad how we pride ourselves as more informed than average people, yet don't rise high enough to see the eternal class conflict. I gives me serious doubts about the perceived self-superiority of this community. I mean, if you are a big owner and don't care about workers, then fine, vote Republican or right wing to further your own self-interests and at least in that case you have your bearings straight. Workers that want to make their own lives more difficult so more money flows to owners are just blatantly ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect a lot of flack for this comment, because as much as we see ourselves as above the fray, so many of us are followers and fools that don't check facts on our own.

       Your right. It's the lesser of 2 evils. However, it's not Trump. It's the party he supports. The GOP are wrong on everything. I don't support either candidate by any means but I'll be damned if that backwards party of the 1950s gets any more power than it has. Trumps a crook. Clinton's a crook. They all are. It doesn't matter.

       he's just facing up to the maggot-riddled underbelly of american policies foreign and domestic. AMericans love to have some flag-waving shit shoved down their throats 'freedumb n demockery, r2p etc'.

       Because Donald Trump is running for President. We have two equally terrible candidates for president stacking each other's dirty laundry on top of their own hoping whoever's gets left on top before the timer runs out will lose, but the other side keeps finding more and more. Can't investigate your side's dirty laundry when you're too busy looking for more of the other's. Everybody's confirmation bias went up 10 points

       You know how when you hate someone, every single thing they do pisses you off? This is what y'all are like. Every anti-Clinton story comes up, you believe it, because you hate her. If you actually stick with any of the huge stories about Hillary being corrupt it rapidly unravels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Benghazi became entirely about emails because there's no evidence of wrongdoing of any kind as no wrong was done by her in relation to that event. The email stories die because there isn't any smoking gun that signifies illegal actions. All we get are out of context bits that someone frames as being proof, which gets the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       subscribers believing, and then the moment someone rational looks into it they find context. Context that completely nullifies the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g. the "wet works" nonsense. Why would anyone use a "code" that literally everyone knows? No, in context it is clear that it was character assassination being discussed. Just normal everyday political crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       So once again I tell the crazed anti-Hillary brigade: if you drop the crazy, people might listen to you.
       <strong>
        There are plenty of reasons to dislike her without having to resort to "SHE SMELLS LIKE BRIMSTONE" and "SHE'S BEEN HAVING PEOPLE KILLED FOR DECADES".

       Some of us hate Bill, personally i hate Bill so much I could never vote for his wife. Bill made a back door deal with NATO to drop bombs on civilian &amp; municipal targets (including my house) in Serbia after the ceasefire and disarmament treaty was signed. (76 days of bombing) Those bombs contained depleted uranium giving many people, like my uncle, cancer from the radiation exposure. No Iraqi would vote for a Bush, just like no Serb will vote for a Clinton. That's just my $0.02, but dont fucking play like Hillary is innocent. Clintons are both corrupt as fuck.

       proof is in the wikileaks releases. If you actually are not a shill, you'd sit your ass down and read up. If you're just a typical sackrider/shill/CTR then as usual, you'll claim it's all fake, never read them yourself and try like hell to defend her no matter what.

and again, Comey already stated in his testimony the proof of her crimes. He just refused to prosecute them because "she didn't mean to" which is not a valid reason, but it is a political one. His testimony was the topping on the cake as to how corrupt it has gotten.

       already have. You're just unwilling to accept it because you're so wrapped up in defending her and your side to the point you ignore everything.

       Comey himself gave that proof in his testimony. You keep ignoring that either because you're an idiot, a shill or just too scared to face reality.

       How can you prove that they have done nothing illegal? Can you prove it either way? You CAN'T because unless you're a part of it, you have to go by what is reported to you. The MSM has been known to inflate everything they report.

       And yet the public doesn't really like her. Try to actually find a Hillary supporter outside of a brainwashed College Campus. It's going to be pretty hard. It's one of the reasons she has stopped making public appearances. It's embarrassing to hold a rally an have almost no one show up. Especially when your opponent has lines a mile long outside his.

       Yeah pretty much. I was watching this documentary about sheep, and how after thousands of years of natural selection by humans, the sheep lost their horns, their ears became floppy, and they became more passive and less rebellious. The genes for their brains literally changed over the centuries, and now they are essentially engineered for their environment, being completely passive and beholden to whatever the farmer makes them do, which helps with shearing and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think of this and wonder... humanity has been civilized about 6,000 years or so, and maybe this same type of natural selection has been going on. The herd has been chosen to be passive, the poor and dumb are made to breed while the rich and smart are told to wait. Like idiocracy. It has already happened. But it's not about people being dumb per se, because intelligence can be a very useful asset, but more about them being obedient. So we have people that are willing to put up with absolute nonsense and we have this kind of nation-wide bystander effect going on, because the majority are actually genetically and biologically suited to their condition of being owned through millennia of natural selection.
      </p>
      <p>
       How fucking sad is that. I wish that were easily proven wrong. The "sheeple" analogy is unfortunately way more accurate than I ever realized.

       Appeal to authority is a logical fallacy.  My favorite is the ridiculous notion lately that eye witness testimony is so unreliable that you can't even trust your own eyes but must get the story from an authority figure to know what's true.

       It's called welfare, or other forms of government financial dependency. Many Hillary supporters are bribed with American Tax dollars and are effectively unable to vote against her because they believe it would personally harm them financially. They have become so dependent and for so long, that they literally believe that they deserve the money. Case in point: BLM and reparations. Seriously, 5% of the population owned slaves and yet they believe that 87% of the current population should give the 13% population of black financial compensation. Bottom line, slavery is fucked up and severely hurt the African American communities. However, while it doesn't justify it happening, slavery is the best thing that has happened to Africans in the last 300 years. Welfare,Financial Aid to get free education, Healthcare, sub-subsidized housing, food stamps etc.. Or starvation, disease and every other horrible thing that is a daily occurrence for black in Africa. Barrack Obama's half brother even said that colonization was the best thing that happened to Africa. Doesn't make it right or excuse it, fucked up shit happens. In fact research the Barbary coast, North Africans and Muslims enslaved europeans for a very long time before things flipped. As for the self-deprivating whites who feel guilty for their "white privilege", I am at a loss. Why would you feel guilty for something you had no involvement in. And secondly, nearly every country in the world is more beneficial to the indigenous people

       You are so right, I am a millennial. But I think the parents are actually more brainwashed and unaware. Millennials use the internet a lot, and get most of their news from it. A lot get caught up in the stupid memes and social media bullshit, but a lot are also aware of the shadow government government scheme.

       Dude, please keep spreading this viewpoint. I've tried so hard to get Americans to accept thia line of thinking and they get so mad. So many adults in our country want Millennials to slave away like they did for "the greater good" or whatever while completely ignoring that fact that we actually find our planet interesting and fun.

       See this raises some good points. A lot of adults in the workforce match this. The problem is that they reject that social change comes from the
       <em>
        majority
       </em>
       standing up. They don't want to stand up for themselves at work or against insurance companies or whatever. They just bend over with their cheeks spread saying "this is just how the world works, cant change it, nothing i can do"

       Luckily my in laws are voting Trump, but only because they hate Hillary.  I wanted to show them how to look at wikileaks on the internet, but they are too computer illiterate.  I would really like them to be more knowledgeable so they could share the info with their friends.

       uh, well, we live better than we would be living during a civil war. want some proof? go compare the destroyed cities in Syria to the cities of the US.    What we have is better than what we would have if suddenly people decided to shut everything down by fighting in the streets, so sane people don't do it, because they have enough good things in their lives to not be willing to risk losing it for any political struggles. The political situation throughout history has improved for the common man over time, and it will likely keep going in that direction
       <em>
        naturally
       </em>
       , without any violent struggle.

       here we are with our indoor plumbing, advanced medicine and clean well-supplied hospitals, hot water, electricity, internet, job opportunities that pay more than 25 cents per day like billions of people slave away for picking garbage and plastics out of landfills or chopping sugar cane or bamboo.
      </p>
      <p>
       not to mention the fact that you can bitch about all this stuff on the internet without being kidnapped by the secret police (like what happened in places like Syria or Saudi Arabia or Eritrea), the good things in america are not just gone because of some corrupt nutcases in politics and business. People have it good enough now to not be willing to risk participating in anything that might change that for the worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are a great deal of good things in the US that aren't available to people born in other places (exceptions being other advanced first world countries), positive change will only come gradually through generational shifts and shifting sentiment, same as abolishing the use of slavery and the random hanging of minorities, it won't come from fighting. The rich folks are 1000% prepared for fighting, and they'd win, because they can pay half the poor to control the other half. Gotta be peaceful social  change.

       Gen-Xer here with Millennial children. My parents were fully brainwashed Boomers.

       The public school system is mostly responsible for the brainwashing. I mean, you're unlikely to spawn a free thinker from a family who unquestioningly drinks the Kool-aid (it happens, though, I'm proof), but even in a non-conformist home environment, you're fighting an uphill battle. Get 'em up before dawn, keep 'em still for eight hours a day, make sure there's no way they can get enough sleep, ring bells to make them move from one place to another, teach them to stand in line and wait... it's not just the content, it's the very structure itself that indoctrinates them into "productive citizens" (read: good tax slaves).  My kids have grown up in an environment that strongly encourages them to question authority (to include my own), and yet the one who spent some time in public school has conformed fully whereas the "free" one is exactly that, a free thinker. God help him.

       Sorry, following along this poignant thread to see where the 'discussion' went... Just wanted to say, insane claims require insane evidemce or they are just claims. Most proof of conspiracy is dispatched with and hidden as best as possible. Hence, the conspiracy part. So, asking to unequivocally prove a conspiracy is the reddit equivolent of, 'I know you are, but what am I?'  or something like that. Learn to actually debate! Post sources and real substative responses or quit wasting time posting.

       Same here. Haven't met a one. Haven't even seen a sign for her anywhere. Plenty of Trump.

       The only person I've met that support Hillary is my english 101 teacher, and he says the reason nobody wants hillary is because of "30 years of constant propaganda against her".
      </p>
      <p>
       Next time he says that I'm going to say "Well, that could be because she constantly has scandals going on, and aside from that, the only stuff that influenced my decision is what has come to light in the past 3-4 years."
      </p>
      <p>
       He will probably ignore it though.
