<p>Im well educated on all these and their intricacies.  It takes a lot to shock me in terms of what TPTB will do.  </p>

<p>But I&#39;ve sat with my mouth open all week.  </p>

<p>This conspiracy involves possibly Pamela Anderson, the government assassinating or torturing a patriot and whistleblower, A secretary of State traveling to london to threaten Equador, a massive internet blackout perpetrated by the US government and blamed on Russians/Wikileaks, the government posing as Wikileaks and trying to honeypot people into leaking info to them, a CS gas attack at London airport, CNN suggesting reading Wikileaks is illegal and Obama suggesting any information on the internet must be &quot;vetted&quot; and run through him first.  And all of this is blamed on Russians interfering with the election  </p>

<p>All the while TPTB are orchestrating the Trump plant conspiracy.  </p>

<p>I knew they were capable of some sick things, but if this all pans out true and Julian is dead, and they did all this, that they silenced him and that its all a false flag operation to get us to invade Russia.  </p>

<p>I am stunned.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty impressive sum up, sir.  Not to derail your valid points, but I wonder why people venerate Assange as any sort of &quot;hero&quot; when Assange wouldn&#39;t be Assange if it wouldn&#39;t have been for where he got his first information from - the <em>real</em> hero in all this:  Manning - who&#39;s been rotting in prison with pretty much <em>no</em> public support, interest, or outcry from the citizenry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point.  I think a large part of it is the public doesnt care about an issue until its in front of them.  Julian is in the news right now because of the election and how the media and the government suggesting he is ruining our democracy and is working for putin.  Theres many cases of suspected terrorists whose cases were made famous after 9/11, people were upset for awhile and they still are languishing in gitmo.  Have been tortured for who knows how long.  And theres no protest or outcry for them either.  The public seems to get involved late in a lot of cases, but when they finally do, usually it forces the issue to resolve.  The activists fighting to free the WM3 for decades and then them being free only when public pressure as a result of the documentaries made the WM police department a living hell.  Making a Murderer, Avery is still in prison, Branden Dassey spent years in prison, a nobody, people didnt care at all about him, until that documentary and people demanded he be freed.  And on and on.  </p>

<p>I hear you though.  Manning should be free and celebrated.  </p>

<p>It seems that the real factor as to whether the public does or doesn’t care about an issue, then, is whether the MSM pushes it or not.  While I don’t doubt that this is true…it’s extremely disheartening where it regards critical thinking because much of what the MSM pushes is pure propaganda designed to benefit TPTB at the <em>expense</em> of the masses...and yet that&#39;s exactly what the masses eat up as &quot;important&quot; or not regardless of whether it should really be regarded that way or not.</p>

<p>Yep.  No extended and ongoing MSM time, and the people went “meh”.  smh</p>

<p>Either way, thanks for the very intelligent response.  Cheers,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange offered up an extradition of himself to gain Manning his freedom! </p>

<p>Assange, I believe, feels entirely responsible with incredible grief for Manning!</p>

<p>It is my understanding that by the time Wikileaks received Mannings <em>dump</em> that Manning had been held <em>incommunicado</em> on base, then in Kuwait and then shipped to Virginia. </p>

<p>Being quite <em>early</em> in the Wikileaks, with such horrific footage of the Slaughter of Innocents Wikileaks pulled the trigger and didn&#39;t take enough steps to Legally Further Protect Manning...I honestly believe this haunts Assange to the marrow!</p>

<p>Having said all that, Greenwald allegedly sits on thousands and thousands of documents (procured by Snowden in much the same manner) that belong to All The People and he&#39;s making millions off them and looks down his nose at Assange with every turn!</p>

<p>We get into Saturation Melt Down and forget the nuanced bits that are the Human Factor!</p>

<p>If Assange falls, there&#39;s little hope for Manning! Asange isn&#39;t a Hero, he&#39;s The Messenger! Quit shooting barbs at him!</p>

<p>Manning belongs on it 10/10 more than Assange, yet the public has ignored and abandoned him.  Put some of your faux &quot;righteous indignation&quot; there - where it truly belongs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some are posting hysterical concerned queries, others are inciting hysteria.</p>

<p>My apology, I didn&#39;t mean you, personally. You&#39;ve been in here a long time, please hear me out: I place him on no pedestal but took to heart, his sincere desire to see Manning set free and that he would take his place! That Assange has accepted his failure in protecting Manning, I would guess weighs heavily on him. </p>

<p>In a knee Jerk Moment, perhaps they all thought this was so Inexcusable that there was no way ANY Court or Tribunal would Hold an Innocent Man for Exposing such a Horrific Crime! </p>

<p>I sat and shook that day, in grief and shame in my safe home! </p>

<p>That one lone soldier scooped up that child and Manning broke with him, as did I and thousands of others, all finally got to see on MSM the Shame, Horror and the TERROR, TERRORISTS and it WAS US!</p>

<p>Finally! Somebody is exposing the Shit Show! </p>

<p>We forget these <em>bits</em>!  </p>

<p>Right now, show me any other Person able and willing to trade their life to free Manning, to exonerate Manning. None have stepped forward except Assange. </p>

<p>None of those Military persons have been Charged in the deaths of the BBC reporters, the native men cut down like dogs...the children! There&#39;s no one left to testify on Mannings behalf! Assange knows where the information came from and he can prove that Manning Witnessed and Recorded War Crimes!</p>

<p>&#39;Oh, yeah don&#39;t bring your children to the battle...herp derp.. heard over the radio chatter!</p>

<p>Meanwhile one lone fucker is loosing his shit with a gut blown child in his arms! He&#39;s screaming for a Medical Evac!</p>

<p>Yep. Assange is a glory seeking freak show of entertainment after all these years. You know, he&#39;s known for years that Hillary really wanted to DRONE Strike HIM. Knowing how Obama killed an innocent American kid...Assange should now be put on the list, and Manning can die of severe deprivation!</p>

<p>Assange and Wikileaks are damned near the last bastion fighting for Manning! </p>

<p>His attorneys suck Obama/Clinton/Bush balls! </p>

<p>Assange isn&#39;t a Hero he&#39;s a Messenger. He&#39;s a Life-Line. </p>

<p>He&#39;s pissed you off. Not knowing how to diminish your anger or anxiety can you just trust that one other person believes so strongly in the innocence of Manning and his right to Expose War Crimes that I would, if I could, stand in his shoes!</p>

<p>I cannot! I&#39;m nobody!</p>

<p>Assange is Mannings best hope!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t blame Assange entirely by himself.  I blame the MSM for propping Assange up and ignoring Manning to the extent that they have…and I blame the 99% citizenry even more for <em>buying</em> it all and allowing themselves to pretty much entirely ignore what’s happening to Manning.  It’s absolutely unconscionable.  It’s horrific.  And we’re not doing anything about it.  We’re turning a purposeful blind eye to someone who’s risked their life to expose the truth.</p>

<p>And no.  I&#39;m not talking about Assange.  It’s Manning who&#39;s done that.</p>

<p>People just have to ask themselves:  Whose shoes would you rather be in?</p>

<p>1) Manning&#39;s?</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2) [name any other “whistle blower”]?</p>

<p>Everyone will pick “2”.  Every time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s pissed you off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  He hasn’t pissed me off at all.  The public’s ignorance where it regards who the REAL hero is in all this (Manning) is what pisses me off.  People getting emotional over the possibility of Assange being hurt - all the while they don’t even bat an eyelash over the fact that Manning’s been literally TORTURED for years pisses me off.  People ignoring who the <em>real</em> hero in all this is as the MSM keeps milking Snowden, Assange, and Greenwald is what pisses me off.</p>

<p>So essentially Manning has no legal leg and will soon be (if he&#39;s not already) dead.</p>

<p>Fucked up world.</p>

<p>And, with regard to dreams...I actually had a <em>very</em> interesting dream last night, as a matter of fact.  I dreamt that I was in a school class and was taking a &quot;finals&quot; test &quot;for all the marbles&quot; kind of thing.  It was a &quot;real important&quot; kind of test.</p>

<p>And the test was <em>full</em> of DNC propaganda and shit that you &quot;had&quot; to &quot;answer in favor of Hillary&quot; kind of shit. lol</p>

<p>And I remember just laying it all out in the answers, saying stuff like &quot;this bitch is as corrupt as they come&quot;, etc, etc.  I was answering every question truthfully, but in what I knew was the exact <em>opposite</em> manner that &quot;tptb&quot; wanted.</p>

<p>So the teacher comes up to me to begin looking over me and my test and question what I was doing...and who was the teacher?</p>

<p>Fucking Hillary fucking Clinton. lol.  Crazy.</p>

<p>It was cool though because even in the dream I still faced her and didn&#39;t back down and didn&#39;t change my answers or my stance even though she was threatening me with that PC smile still on her face.</p>

<p>I was like &quot;Nope.  Don&#39;t care.  Here&#39;s your test.  I&#39;m done.&quot; knowing I would likely &quot;fail&quot;, but knowing my answers were right.</p>

<p>lol.  So I wouldn&#39;t entirely say my dreams were &quot;great dreams&quot;, but they were certainly interesting.  :)</p>

Why? because what&#39;s <em>really</em> happening (not &quot;in theory&quot;, but what&#39;s <em>really</em> happening) is very confusing and very obfuscated by TPTB who don&#39;t want any plebs really knowing about what they&#39;re really doing.</p>

<p>So yeah.  I have a lot of theories as to what the larger picture is.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to say that any of them are currently of sufficient import for me to waste your time posting them here though.</p>

<p>I would not disagree with this one bit, sir/ma&#39;am.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t doubt that one either, but it&#39;s more about various very powerful factions all vying for position.</p>

<p>I think TPTB are still working under the old paradigm of propping up a puppet to covertly control the masses - i.e. a president.  A lot of the 99% are still going for that paradigm, but the point is that a large minority of the 99% are starting to wake up to that ruse and are realizing that it&#39;s all full of shit.  Problem with that is that TPTB are <em>still</em> working under that same shit paradigm, and we&#39;re in a transitionary period right now where there is a battle going on between TPTB who are still trying to keep that same &quot;1% ruling over the 99%&quot; paradigm going on the one hand, while the 99% are beginning to finally wake up to it and are beginning to <em>push back</em>.</p>

<p>So why are they pushing Clinton so bad?  Well, because TPTB are simply trying hard as hell to still sell the same shit narrative that they&#39;ve been using for generations prior.  Old habits die hard kind of thing.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because those &quot;regular ways&quot; don&#39;t work anymore, and too many of us are starting to catch on and wake up to those old &quot;regular ways&quot;.  Too many of us are calling them on their bullshit false flags way too quickly now, so no sooner do they concoct their next ff than the public immediately begins punching holes through the shit narratives.</p>

<p>So TPTB are simply losing ground on their manipulation.</p>

<p>The manipulation still exists in droves, of course, but it&#39;s not hardly as effective as it was before, and it&#39;s starting to make TPTB being to panic a bit here and there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The simple answer is war with Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  They&#39;re working hard at pulling out big stops...because the small stops (the Sandy Hooks and the Oklahomas, etc, et) aren&#39;t working anywhere near as well as they wanted them to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interesting times friend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We as a citizenry have to keep informing ourselves and being critical thinkers and simply absolutely KNOWING that tptb are <em>not</em> on our side.</p>
