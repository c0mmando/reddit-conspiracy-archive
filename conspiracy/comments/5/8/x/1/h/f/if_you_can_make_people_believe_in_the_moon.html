        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What if we were meant to uncover the truth about the moon landings? Like they planned it that way from the beginning. Disregarding the fact that it&#39;s taking an embarrassingly long time for people to wake up.(And they&#39;re laughing about it, I assure you.)</p>

<p>They are waiting for the population to wake up collectively. Lets be real here. 
The moon landing hoax is pretty damn obvious for anyone with half a brain. Apparently, most people are working with less.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t feel clever for &quot;uncovering&quot; the truth. Because once the moon landings are finally blown open for the farce they are, that&#39;s not the true deception. And it&#39;s not the all the other dominoes that fall with the moon landing hoax, like the mountain of countless other lies that have been perpetuated for decades.
No that&#39;s not the decpetion. And people may feel special and prideful for getting the truth out. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what they want people to think. But they are one step ahead of you all. Those conspiracies are in the shallows. The real deception is much deeper.</p>

<p>Its all a distraction from the real game they play.</p>

<p>You think your a free thinker? You think you have it all figured out? </p>

<p>They fucking made it easy! They want you to figure their bullshit out. They want you to blow it open. They are getting impatient with the stupidity. Figure it out already! they are saying. They want to get to the next stage of their game. The fact there are people alive today who still believe the moon landing happened is the epitome of stupidity.</p>

<p>Even the tiniest bit of research into the Apollo program blows the hoax wide open but the sad thing is that</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People dont WANT to see that</p></li>
<li><p>National pride and human pride cloud their ability to be objective</p></li>
<li><p>The people who realize it was likely fake cannot talk about it because our peers fall into the other 2 categories</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I get that. And I believe you are 100% correct. I was just pointing out most people, even here, wont even accept your first point.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the biggee picture has something to do with alien life either currently living on our planet (possibly for centuries now) or controlling our planet from outside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up at the night sky. There are a billion trillion suns out there and they all have planets.</p>

<p>Look at us on Earth, we are already fucking with space and we arent even that ancient.</p>

<p>Not to mention the millions of reported alien/UFO sightings since the dawn of man.</p>

<p>But above everything, I saw something very convincing once with my own eyes. Not in space or far overhead in the night sky. It was about three stories up, I could have hit it with a rock. It looked like a thousand glowing gems all vibrating and moving like a herd, like each one was aware of its own existence. I will talk about that night on my deathbed, no joke.</p>

<p>None of those sightings have been proven because there is no tangible, physical evidence like a piece of spacecraft or an actual alien. You can say the Roswell crash is proof but there still is no physical proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I was on hard drugs, I obviously would have factored that into the sighting. This isnt amateur hour, as much as you need it to be to convince yourself that I didnt see something that night.</p>

<p>Either way, there is no way to convince anyone who wasnt there. Luckily I wasnt alone, or else I would probably be close to lying myself out of it. Even then though, I would be &quot;close&quot;, because I know what I saw. Even if I had been alone, I know what I saw. Dead sober and eyes wide open.</p>

<p>They went there for sure. Not the way they told you though. Nasa&#39;s public explanation for how they got to the moon is a fucking joke. Nasa is a joke. Nasa is cover sham organization. They don&#39;t actually do any real space exploration.
Other groups do though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wiki has two sections, without Nasa involvement and with Nasa involvement. Click on the without section and what do you see? Its all quite weak, various organizations from around the world that claim to have picked up Apollo signals. Sounds good until you realize that Nasa ran multiple simulations, saved the data, and could have very easily beamed that data back to Earth, from the satellite they put into orbit before the first Apollo mission. Especially since they knew the Russians would need such evidence  or they would call BS.</p>

<p>Another bit of &quot;evidence&quot; is apparently photo renders from data collected in the 2000&#39;s by various foreign missions. Funny how nobody can even show us a single actual photo of moon remnants. With all of our telescopes and Hubble and those missions that flew past the moon. Not a single real photo.</p>

<p>Just a couple pictures showing a couple blurry pixels with some arrows pointing at them. Seriously, show me a picture that isn&#39;t blurry pixels and arrows!</p>

<p>Now, I do think some, not all, of the footage is faked for various reasons. Mainly because NASA wanted to present a product to the people and wanted it as polished as possible. Thus when they needed a particular shot and the actual footage was inadequate or didn&#39;t exist, they fabricated it.</p>

<li><p>Thats not proof it happened, at all.</p></li>
<li><p>You cannot say we had the capability because the only proof thay we had the capability is that we went. Whether we actually went is exactly whats being questioned.

<li><p>There is plenty of credible evidence out there. I guess at the end of the day it boils down to your definition of &quot;credible&quot;. If you only see Nasa as a credible expert on the subject of space, then I guess you have no choice but to believe what they say, since they hold all the trump cards. Everything they say about the Moon and the journey there could be made up, there is no way to check their work. </p></li>

<p>And they absolutely know this. Even if everything they say is true, the fact remains that you have to take whatever they say on the subject as truth whether it is or not.</p>

The only &quot;proof&quot; I have seen that refutes the fact that we went is choppy video taken out of context which doesn&#39;t definitively prove anything.

<p>It&#39;s meant as a generalization to describe the person or people that pioneered this movement. The reason it says writes a book or makes YouTube videos is because any time I&#39;ve asked for evidence or proof of the outlandish claims at the heart of the argument I am referred to a book written by some idiot with no firsthand knowledge or some poorly edited out of context YouTube video. There is nothing that proves we didn&#39;t do exactly what we say we did. The only possible logical reason for disagreeing with the official story is that you don&#39;t feel the proof that we actually went is solid enough. To that I disagree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and secondly, I already told you and made it clear as day that if you believe what others tell you without thinking critically upon it and doing your own research then you are so easily manipulated and lied to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because someone or a group of people tells you something it doesn&#39;t automatically make it false. As a matter of fact the more people that tell you something increases the likelihood that it is actually true. In the case of the moon landings we aren&#39;t talking about a few hundred or a thousand people, we are talking about tens of thousands involved in the projects surrounding these missions. We are also talking about highly decorated pilots and astronauts who carried them out. Not to mention the millions watching live around the world. This all in an era where our video manipulation technologies are nothing compared to present. Surely you cannot believe that all of these acclaimed scientists and decorated heroes are all lying to pull the wool over your eyes. Furthermore, not only are you insinuating that they are all liars but that they are such good liars and so organized that in the 50 or so years since this happened not one iota of verifiable proof has surfaced? Please.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is glaringly obvious that they lied about a great many things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please do elaborate. Every shred of &quot;proof&quot; I&#39;ve ever gotten has been some unfounded accusations passed off as facts or some video/audio taken out of context.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are only scientific theories. There are no facts, because man&#39;s understanding is limited. No man has all the answers and knows all the secrets of nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a philosophical argument. There are things that we can say with reasonable certainty that we call scientific facts. We are not talking about the birth of the cosmos or whether or not there is a God. We are talking about one of the most well documented and established events in our history. It is something that the scientific community, historians, academics, and the world as a whole agrees on. Established fact.</p>

While there are many countries with some form of space program, there are only 3 that have sent their own cosmonauts into the space, that I&#39;m aware of.

<p>You can&#39;t travel in space with explosion technology. You have to use implosion.</p>

<p>They launch into space with rockets. Massive dildo looking ships, appropriately.  the reflection of a male force dominated society. They make a huge explosion out the back end. Loud, violent, aggressive.  Not exactly elegant. This is not how nature operates.</p>

<p>Nature operates on the female side. Implosion force. This is the force of life. This is the energy that frees people.
Explosion energy is the force of death and destruction. It is used to control people.</p>

<p>All of our technology is explosion based. And this is why the world is the way it is now.</p>

<p>Indeed. it did happen many times. and whole lot more happened far beyond your imagination. But see, the government doesn&#39;t want anyone to know about that.

    <div class="md"><p>That wiki has two sections, without Nasa involvement and with Nasa involvement. Click on the without section and what do you see? Its all quite weak, various organizations from around the world that claim to have picked up Apollo signals. Sounds good until you realize that Nasa ran multiple simulations, saved the data, and could have very easily beamed that data back to Earth, from the satellite they put into orbit before the first Apollo mission. Especially since they knew the Russians would need such evidence  or they would call BS.</p>

<p>Another bit of &quot;evidence&quot; is apparently photo renders from data collected in the 2000&#39;s by various foreign missions. Funny how nobody can even show us a single actual photo of moon remnants. With all of our telescopes and Hubble and those missions that flew past the moon. Not a single real photo.</p>

<p>Just a couple pictures showing a couple blurry pixels with some arrows pointing at them. Seriously, show me a picture that isn&#39;t blurry pixels and arrows!</p>
