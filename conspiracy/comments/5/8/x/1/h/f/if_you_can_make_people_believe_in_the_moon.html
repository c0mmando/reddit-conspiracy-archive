       What if we were meant to uncover the truth about the moon landings? Like they planned it that way from the beginning. Disregarding the fact that it's taking an embarrassingly long time for people to wake up.(And they're laughing about it, I assure you.)
      </p>
      <p>
       They are waiting for the population to wake up collectively. Lets be real here. 
The moon landing hoax is pretty damn obvious for anyone with half a brain. Apparently, most people are working with less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't feel clever for "uncovering" the truth. Because once the moon landings are finally blown open for the farce they are, that's not the true deception. And it's not the all the other dominoes that fall with the moon landing hoax, like the mountain of countless other lies that have been perpetuated for decades.
No that's not the decpetion. And people may feel special and prideful for getting the truth out.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what they want people to think. But they are one step ahead of you all. Those conspiracies are in the shallows. The real deception is much deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all a distraction from the real game they play.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think your a free thinker? You think you have it all figured out?
      </p>
      <p>
       They fucking made it easy! They want you to figure their bullshit out. They want you to blow it open. They are getting impatient with the stupidity. Figure it out already! they are saying. They want to get to the next stage of their game. The fact there are people alive today who still believe the moon landing happened is the epitome of stupidity.

       You are absolutely right, dont mind the people who wont get it. Plenty of people do, just not
       <em>
        most

       people yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the tiniest bit of research into the Apollo program blows the hoax wide open but the sad thing is that

       Oh, I get that. And I believe you are 100% correct. I was just pointing out most people, even here, wont even accept your first point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think the biggee picture has something to do with alien life either currently living on our planet (possibly for centuries now) or controlling our planet from outside.

       Look up at the night sky. There are a billion trillion suns out there and they all have planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at us on Earth, we are already fucking with space and we arent even that ancient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the millions of reported alien/UFO sightings since the dawn of man.
      </p>
      <p>
       But above everything, I saw something very convincing once with my own eyes. Not in space or far overhead in the night sky. It was about three stories up, I could have hit it with a rock. It looked like a thousand glowing gems all vibrating and moving like a herd, like each one was aware of its own existence. I will talk about that night on my deathbed, no joke.

       None of those sightings have been proven because there is no tangible, physical evidence like a piece of spacecraft or an actual alien. You can say the Roswell crash is proof but there still is no physical proof.

       If I was on hard drugs, I obviously would have factored that into the sighting. This isnt amateur hour, as much as you need it to be to convince yourself that I didnt see something that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, there is no way to convince anyone who wasnt there. Luckily I wasnt alone, or else I would probably be close to lying myself out of it. Even then though, I would be "close", because I know what I saw. Even if I had been alone, I know what I saw. Dead sober and eyes wide open.

       The biggest lie to me is the monetary system, which in essence is the current social control mechanism like religion was in the old days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around ten families control the money system. They print notes with no backing whatsoever. Lend it to nations at interest. And then claim they own everything.

       It can actually hurt to change your mind about something you believe to be true.  A lot of smart people will argue all day long with moon hoaxers. Ralph Rene, author of NASA Mooned America, found intellect was no barrier to blind faith in the moon landings when he discussed the subject with his Mensa buddies.

       I never said I was offended by such things. 
And I invented no lies. Use your brain to come to your own conclusions on where the lies are.
In fact I know that we've had the capability to travel through space and already have been to all the planets.
But that technology is not allowed to be known to pee-ons.

       No you got it wrong.

       They went there for sure. Not the way they told you though. Nasa's public explanation for how they got to the moon is a fucking joke. Nasa is a joke. Nasa is cover sham organization. They don't actually do any real space exploration.
Other groups do though.

      <p>
       The technology to travel space is not the primitive explosion technology. That technology is used for waste in order to perpetuate a sense of limitation in scarcity based economy, so that there can be exploitation of an idiotic population of pee-ons.
      </p>
      <p>
       To travel space and beyond you have to go the other way. You have to work with nature, not against it. Not toward expansion and disintegration and death. But toward integration, compression and self organizing life.

       That wiki has two sections, without Nasa involvement and with Nasa involvement. Click on the without section and what do you see? Its all quite weak, various organizations from around the world that claim to have picked up Apollo signals. Sounds good until you realize that Nasa ran multiple simulations, saved the data, and could have very easily beamed that data back to Earth, from the satellite they put into orbit before the first Apollo mission. Especially since they knew the Russians would need such evidence  or they would call BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another bit of "evidence" is apparently photo renders from data collected in the 2000's by various foreign missions. Funny how nobody can even show us a single actual photo of moon remnants. With all of our telescopes and Hubble and those missions that flew past the moon. Not a single real photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a couple pictures showing a couple blurry pixels with some arrows pointing at them. Seriously, show me a picture that isn't blurry pixels and arrows!

       I can't buy into the moon landing didn't happen conspiracy for a few reasons.

        <p>
         The secret is too huge. There are too many players involved to keep them all quiet for this long.

        <p>
         I can't find any credible evidence that contradicts the official narrative.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Now, I do think some, not all, of the footage is faked for various reasons. Mainly because NASA wanted to present a product to the people and wanted it as polished as possible. Thus when they needed a particular shot and the actual footage was inadequate or didn't exist, they fabricated it.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You cannot say we had the capability because the only proof thay we had the capability is that we went. Whether we actually went is exactly whats being questioned. If you broke down this argument it would look like this "I can prove we went, here is the proof = we went". Thats not how logic works.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is plenty of credible evidence out there. I guess at the end of the day it boils down to your definition of "credible". If you only see Nasa as a credible expert on the subject of space, then I guess you have no choice but to believe what they say, since they hold all the trump cards. Everything they say about the Moon and the journey there could be made up, there is no way to check their work.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       And they absolutely know this. Even if everything they say is true, the fact remains that you have to take whatever they say on the subject as truth whether it is or not.

       First off I never claimed to have proof. What I said was I don't buy it. It's enough for me that NASA and the entire scientific community says we went. All the astronauts say we went. We literally brought pieces of it back with us  The logistics of keeping thousands and thousands of scientists from spilling the beans is mind numbing. The only "proof" I have seen that refutes the fact that we went is choppy video taken out of context which doesn't definitively prove anything. If you or anyone in your movement had any actual proof there would be no containing it, nations and scientists not friendly to us would line up to get behind it.

       Someone else told me? It's common knowledge scientific fact. This isn't something a few guys did and said oh look at this. The entire world watched. Tens of thousands of scientists were involved in the project. The real question is how come there is all this evidence that we went, all these tens of thousands of people say we did, millions and millions watched it live, and some jack ass, who wasn't even involved in any capacity, writes a book and makes a few YouTube videos and that's proof for you? Wake up. There are actual conspiracies going on. Actual people doing nefarious things behind the scenes and fucking you over and your sitting here arguing the moon landing. If anything they want you to think the damn thing's fake so you keep talking about it an ignoring the real issues

       Use your own brain. Think critically. Stop relying on others to inform your beliefs and knowledge.
As far as the moon landings go, just fucking think about it. Look at the photos and videos and ask some very basic questions. It is glaringly obvious that they lied about a great many things.

       It's meant as a generalization to describe the person or people that pioneered this movement. The reason it says writes a book or makes YouTube videos is because any time I've asked for evidence or proof of the outlandish claims at the heart of the argument I am referred to a book written by some idiot with no firsthand knowledge or some poorly edited out of context YouTube video. There is nothing that proves we didn't do exactly what we say we did. The only possible logical reason for disagreeing with the official story is that you don't feel the proof that we actually went is solid enough. To that I disagree.

       Just because someone or a group of people tells you something it doesn't automatically make it false. As a matter of fact the more people that tell you something increases the likelihood that it is actually true. In the case of the moon landings we aren't talking about a few hundred or a thousand people, we are talking about tens of thousands involved in the projects surrounding these missions. We are also talking about highly decorated pilots and astronauts who carried them out. Not to mention the millions watching live around the world. This all in an era where our video manipulation technologies are nothing compared to present. Surely you cannot believe that all of these acclaimed scientists and decorated heroes are all lying to pull the wool over your eyes. Furthermore, not only are you insinuating that they are all liars but that they are such good liars and so organized that in the 50 or so years since this happened not one iota of verifiable proof has surfaced? Please.

       This is a philosophical argument. There are things that we can say with reasonable certainty that we call scientific facts. We are not talking about the birth of the cosmos or whether or not there is a God. We are talking about one of the most well documented and established events in our history. It is something that the scientific community, historians, academics, and the world as a whole agrees on. Established fact.

       Russia didn't drop their space program. There is no glory in getting to the Moon second, especially after the US has been there several times. Russians had the first satelite, the first man in space. After that they concentrated on developing and building MIR so once again they had a win - first permanent space presence.

       There's only so much you will get from exploration of the moon at certain scientific development level. As I said, the USSR once again one upped the USA by establishing permanent space presence. As you might have noticed, since you are an expert on global elites, appearance is everything, especially in politics.

       Yes. and science constantly evolves and technology constantly develops, which would make exploration and research of the moon a constantly developing scientific endeavor.

       But, oops! Nope! Russia never went to the moon. And, no one explains why. Nor has ANY other nation ever been to the moon. Nor has the U.S. ever returned to the moon.

       You'd think that with our highly developed scientific understandings and technological advancements since the moon landings 40 years ago we would be making trips to the moon constantly. I mean we made it to the moon so easily back then.

       What's you obsession with going to the Moon?
While there are many countries with some form of space program, there are only 3 that have sent their own cosmonauts into the space, that I'm aware of. Smaller countries simply cannot afford the expense of it. There are still a lot of research going into the moon with probes and orbiters and whatnot, just look it up. Because nobody sends people there (mind you the US went 6 times so they definitely returned) it doesn't mean that Moon programs have been abandoned.

       Just because someone doesn't do what you think they should do doesn't mean it's a conspiracy or some sinister plot.

       They said they went to the moon and made a sensationalist media frenzy out of it. 
Going on past forty years later and not a peep about ever going back to the moon from any country, despite the incredible development in technology since then.
Many things don't add up about the whole thing. Something stinks.

       Except now they're talking about going to Mars. Do you think they just faked the Moon landings and then they thought "let's wait 40 years and then start talking about going to Mars and fake that one too"? To what end?

Explosion energy is the force of death and destruction. It is used to control people.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of our technology is explosion based. And this is why the world is the way it is now.

       So what you are saying is that having practice flights to the moon is completely unnecessary and all preparations to fly to Mars can be done right here on Earth? Makes sense, it's also heaps cheaper.

      <p>
       Reality seems to be proving you wrong. People do travel to space in big dildoes powered by explosions out of their rear ends. I'm sure if someone could build a ship operating on implosion it would already have happened or we'd be getting close. There is such a thing as the EM drive being developed right now - those won't be powered by explosions.

       Indeed. it did happen many times. and whole lot more happened far beyond your imagination. But see, the government doesn't want anyone to know about that. Nasa still uses the dildo rocket ships as a publicity stunt. people like to watch explosions and light shows. it is very easy to fool the public. they enjoy filling up their gas tanks, and paying their electric bills. The government cashes in on people's stupidity.

       real space flight technology is silent and inconspicuous. nothing dramatic about it. in fact, it's all around us and no one notices.

       The moon landing hoax was needed for national pride during a time of unprecedented domestic uncertainty. Russia was winning, Vietnam was going bad, hippies, etc. We needed a win.

       That wiki has two sections, without Nasa involvement and with Nasa involvement. Click on the without section and what do you see? Its all quite weak, various organizations from around the world that claim to have picked up Apollo signals. Sounds good until you realize that Nasa ran multiple simulations, saved the data, and could have very easily beamed that data back to Earth, from the satellite they put into orbit before the first Apollo mission. Especially since they knew the Russians would need such evidence  or they would call BS.
      </p>

       Another bit of "evidence" is apparently photo renders from data collected in the 2000's by various foreign missions. Funny how nobody can even show us a single actual photo of moon remnants. With all of our telescopes and Hubble and those missions that flew past the moon. Not a single real photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a couple pictures showing a couple blurry pixels with some arrows pointing at them. Seriously, show me a picture that isn't blurry pixels and arrows!
