        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is my theory, that I&#39;ve said in a few places here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a theory that the Eastern Orthodox Church (Russia and co) are behind Assange and Wikileaks. Snowden is more of A Vatican (West) front. Both are fighting with each other, in a way in which neither is truly called out or destroyed. We&#39;re entering a great Awakening, and instead of the flood gates being opened, they are being dripped (leaked) in a controlled manner... Just a little pet theory of mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>General.. More in depth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay. So my theory states that JA is a front for the Eastern Orthodox church in England (Russia and ME/East countries), Snowden is a front for the Vatican in Russia. Both are at war with each other. Each person is releasing information, but tame information via &quot;leaks&quot;. JA is releasing info to turn people on the West. Snowden is leaking info, merely to scare the West back into compliance. Think what Snowden actually released, nothing but confirming what we&#39;ve known for a very long time. Panopticon. Self censor, all seeing eye.</p>

<p>Each side knows we are entering a great awakening, and it will affect their power (they&#39;re also diametrically opposed to one another). They cannot destroy each other completely, but they can throw blows, while they remain in the dark and retain control. This deals with astrology and the esoteric. Like I&#39;ve said many, many times, the end of the Mayan calendar was the Great Unveiling of truth. Each side needs to control the awakening. What better way to have control mechanism on both camps &quot;leaking&quot; truth. Like I said, cannot let the flood gates open, got to control the exposure of truth as much as possible.</p>

<p>Like I said, just a pet theory of mine...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve just been made aware:</p>

</ol>

<p>Eastern Orthodox Church Russian Patriarch Kirill visited queen Elizabeth in England on the 18th.</p>

<li><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/18/ecuador-cuts-julian-assanges-internet-access-after-hillary-clint/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/18/ecuador-cuts-julian-assanges-internet-access-after-hillary-clint/</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Same time frame Ecuador cuts JA&#39;s internet and he goes dark, following infiltration rumors, and odd occurrences  involving wiki leaks, and now their sub is completely a cluster fuck...</p>

<p>My theory is that the heat was getting too hot, so their man was rescued. What has Snowden been upto? I&#39;m not saying here or there, but it&#39;s some oddities that have been brewing in my mind, and I thought it was imperative to post this. Thanks to those (you know who you are , who lead to me to certain leads). </p>

<p>Internet, do your duty. This cannot be a coincidence. I do not believe in coincidences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This week ROC has lost a third of its money (and that&#39;s a lot, they are rich) because the bank where they kept it went bust (foul play).  I wanted to present this as the reason Kirill was not behind anything Assange-related since he was busy with other things, but now I want to see how you work it into your theory.  Perhaps Assange is subcontracted to locate the money or people responsible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though you&#39;re kinda seeing some flak in this thread, I appreciate your theory and I actually find it to be plausible.</p>

<p>To me, it is absolutely naive to think that a blackop couldn&#39;t have went in and rescued him with no fanfare, no news of it, no witnesses....that&#39;s why it&#39;s called a blackop.... </p>

<p>On the flip side, the very same could be said for a blackop going in and capturing him. I&#39;m not sure whether he has been captured, or rescued, but I honestly believe the DDoS attacks and the evacuation of Heathrow were a part of it one way or the other. I&#39;m leaning towards he has been captured, Heathrow was evacuated to get him out unseen, and the internet went down to stop the flow of information and initiate a takeover of wikileaks. </p>

<p>Either his allies rescued him, or his enemies got him. Whichever the case, I no longer believe he is at that Embassy. </p>

<p>Quite honestly, I&#39;m not sure what the fuck to make of it right now. My brain is damn near melted from keeping up with, and researching all of this. I&#39;m having a tough time discerning the events of the past few days. </p>

Just proposing something, and tbh, what I&#39;m saying actually helps his cause in the broader picture. I hope he is ok and not in a CIA black site. I don&#39;t know what to make of any of this either, and a few good people here (I talked to) pointed me in a possible direction. So I posted. Man, I knew I was hated here, but shit....

<p>I think I am one of a few here who actually enjoys nearly every post or comment you make. Your thinking outside the box and viewing it all as 3D chess is why people have hatred for you. Your words force people to think and look deep inside, and for some that thought and process is terrifying, me? I welcome it, no matter how much it may or may not rattle my inner being. </p>

<p>That kind of thinking is what&#39;s needed for us to grow...intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually. Far too many have become complacent and refuse to continue their own personal growth for whatever reason. </p>

<p>Any discussion which could bring forth knowledge and other viewpoints should be welcomed, not chided. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you wont look into what I said because of fee fees? Sorry, I don&#39;t give two shits about your fee fees. Look into it and educate yourself or stay ignorant. You&#39;re just another ignorant person on the internet spouting: Rothschild, Rothschild, Rothschild! I&#39;ve been there, done that... I don&#39;t give a fuck... If I wanted to educate those kinds of people, I may try Youtube. Maybe go back there? If not, you&#39;ll fail here because of ignorance. Some of us know what the fuck we are talking about. I gave you enough. Too-da-loo..</p>
