        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tin-Foil is a go:</p>

<p>Why was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/europe/london-city-airport-evacuated/index.html">London Airport shut down</a> at the same time as the DDos attack? They claim it was because of a &quot;Chemical Incident&quot;, but as CNN (Puke) reports: &quot;No elevated readings were found and the building was ventilated, searched and declared safe.&quot;</p>

<p>Trying to move something through the airport without even security around? The speculation could end there, but stay tuned for the real Cold War shit:</p>

<p>Dyn, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2016_Dyn_cyberattack">the DNS provider to many of the worlds most heavily trafficked websites including Twitter, Reddit, and CNN had been on the recieving end of a DDoS attack</a>. Now Dyn, whose website encourages clients to <a href="http://dyn.com/">&quot;manage the internet like you own it&quot;</a>, has just welcomed their <a href="http://dyn.com/blog/dyn-announces-colin-doherty-as-new-ceo/">new CEO, hired Oct. 6th of this year</a> to replace their former CEO and founder who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/11/jeremy-hitchcock-steps-down/">left his job the day after gaining 50 million dollars</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/dyn-series-b/">series B funding</a>. The company was clearly performing well, why would they can the CEO? He said himself that maybe he wasnt cut out for the job. But was it his decision or Dyn&#39;s new investor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LetterOne#Pamplona_Capital_Management">Pamplona Capital Management</a>? </p>

<p>Well who is Pamplona anyway? It is headed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Knaster">Alexander Knaster</a>, Russian Billionaire (this isnt a Clinton hit piece I swear, if you doubt that just look at my history, yes it is short but I got banned from <a href="/r/redacted">/r/redacted</a> and made this account). Here are the board members of Pamplona&#39;s parent company, LetterOne (giant Wikipedia TL;DR incoming but the hyperlinks are to the sources - mostly):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Khan">German Kahn</a>, former director of TNK-BP (<em>that</em> BP) and current boardmember of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LetterOne">LetterOne</a>.  Net worth: 9.9b</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Fridman">Mikhail Fridman</a>, Co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa-Bank">Alfa Bank</a>, the largest private bank in Russia and also the Chairman of LetterOne. His net worth of over <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/mikhail-fridman/">14.2b makes him the second richest man in Russia</a>. What makes him dangerous to Western Interests, or other billionaires? Maybe when he said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.milkenreview.org/articles/searching-for-growth-in-an-unstable-global-economy?IssueID=10">Last year I wrote an article in the – &quot;Tricks of the mind turned oil into gold&quot; – in which I said that the oil price had remained high because people perceived there was a shortage. I said that we <strong>were probably facing a new phase in which people would not fear the end of oil</strong>. Today, it&#39;s more or less clear that this is so.</a>, Emphasis mine.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Aven">Pyotr Aven</a>, Also on the board at Alfa Bank and LetterOne. But far more interesting is his time <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=12663877&amp;privcapId=241771164">working as personal advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev</a> and later became Russia&#39;s representative to the G7. <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/wilson-center-to-honor-petr-aven-and-susan-carmel-lehrman">Aven received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship from the Smithsonian, in recognition of his contribution to corporate and public service to U.S.-Russia relations and &quot;building understanding&quot; between Russians and Americans during his career</a>. Net Worth: 5.1B</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So we have Dyn, a company that specializes in defending its clients from DDoS attacks, itself becoming a victim of such an attack that took out a substantial amount of the internet today while under <em>brand new leadership</em>. Simultaneously we dont know where Assange is with any certainty at all. And the London City Airport being completely evacuated for unsubstantiated concerns when, (roll eyes here), &lt; 20 people start coughing.</p>

<p>How does this relate to Pamplona? LetterOne, Pamplona&#39;s parent company, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/business/under-political-pressure-russian-billionaire-sells-energy-assets-in-north-sea.html">purchased North Sea oil interests for just shy of 6b dollars from a German company in March 2015. However, the British government refused to accept the Russian company as the new owners which forced LetterOne to sell for that acquisition for a mere <em>$750 Million</em>.</a>. Ouch. That might be what has pissed Russia off enough to &quot;meddle&quot; into american politics or at least to expose american hypocrisy.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with <em>anything</em>? Consider <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/us/politics/biden-hints-at-us-response-to-cyberattacks-blamed-on-russia.html">Joe Biden in a recent statement intending to reprimand Russia&#39;s alleged involvement in the DNC Leaks</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re sending a message,” Mr. Biden told Chuck Todd, the show’s host. “We have the capacity to do it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shut down Russia&#39;s internet through Dyn, nab Assange, take him to some black site via a shutdown airport in the heart of London?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“He’ll know it,” Mr. Biden added. “And it will be at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh shit. The greatest impact, as in, when we could be looking forward to the most damning emails?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Todd <strong>asked whether the American public would know</strong> if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent.</p>

<p><strong>“Hope not,” Mr. Biden responded.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I certainly wouldnt want the American public to know that the US government is capable of their own Great Firewall, and are actively using it.</p>

<p>TL;DR: UK bilks Russian billionaires for 5 billion dollars prompting them to get involved in the DNC primary and leaking info to Assange who then gets targeted by the US, who shuts down an airport and shuts down the internet to secretly extract Assange&#39;s body and bury him next to Hoffa and the new Cold War started at the latest, last year and America has implemented the Great Firewall.</p>

<p>/tinfoil</p>

<p>Poke holes in the story and tell me where im completely full of shit. I dont work in media, i make a hobby of speculating the dramatic and dont take it too seriously. But I am 100% interested in truth. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Not the public - the public don&#39;t really care of the Vienna convention - but countries with embassies in the UK do care.</p>

<p>The Chinese embassy (for example) have no reason to be concerned so far. UK intelligence would need this &#39;messy charade&#39; to keep it that way.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a shit ton of manipulation here, even more voter and &quot;play it down coment&quot; manipulation in the last 72 hours for sure. However, I still get the feeling there are many good forces working the same side of Assange, to clean this rotten system out from its core.</p>

<p>Nope, not even remotely.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what it is, completely with the typical of such: zero evidence.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>My reasoning for why:</p>

<p>1) The people pushing this so hard expect us to believe it without providing a shred of fucking proof.</p>

<p>2) Russia would likely just leverage behind closed doors not &quot;leak to Wikileaks&quot;, if they did have such material. E.g., what <em>probably</em> happened when Russia thankfully defused Obama/Hillary&#39;s planned invasion of Syria based on the false-flag sarin attack.</p>

<p>3) All actual signs point to someone close to the Hillary campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I don&#39;t know shit about planes or airports but anyone knows all it takes to end any speculation about the entire integrity of everything currently being released, is for Assange to simply make an appearance, stand on the balcony that he has stood on 100 times before, let a trusted friend or lawyer take a photo with him, let him get on a video stream to say something. Recently he has been on mainstream media outlets being interviewed and giving press conferences in public. So let&#39;s just see him and we don&#39;t have to keep pestering their twitter account asking for verification. It&#39;s easier than responding that Julian is ok and safe and happy ten times. </p>

<p>With that said, I could think of a few dozen better ways to transport a person rather than shutting down an airport.</p>
