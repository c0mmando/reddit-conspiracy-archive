       Maybe, just maybe the polar opposite sides have more in common than they think?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I see some truth in both sides.  Hillary's corruption seems to be limitless, while the fact that The Donald has made it this far in the political process is a joke in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is this notion that if you criticize one if their darling candidates,  you automatically support the other.  Some of us are able to look at things objectively, which is what this whole "conspiracy theorist" thing is supposed to be about.

       It's amazing how long people have been using divide and conquer and that shit still works because people are totally ignorant of it!
      </p>
      <p>
       The divide isn't even right left IMO but urban vs rural. Rural laws do not make sense in urban places and vice versa. The sooner urbanites stop trying to force their rules on rural people, and vice versa, the sooner we can move forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       If my nearest neighbor is an acre away, I don't give two shits about noise, guns, whatever. In an densely populated urban environment you better believe there need to be more rules dictating behavioral norms.

       Good points, but my hometown is a small city with extremely tough gun laws and an extremely high murder rate.  They sure could use some more responsible gun owners there.  It's a city with a population of 85k that has 30-40 murders per year.  From the outside looking in, it seems like a war zone but in reality, the majority of the people living there are good people.  It only takes a couple hundred crazies to ruin a small city.  More good people on the streets with guns is a positive IMO.

       Whaaaaa?  Who's my candidate?  I think there's a misunderstanding, the only thing I called you out on was the fact that you said a producer and owner are the same things.  Wasn't trying to imply you were a right wing nut job, that was more of a jab at many of the other people on this sub.

       Big news in what is considered the "leftist" media at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people ignored right/left divide and conquer and just focused on corporations vs people or profits vs people we could build a much larger movement. (Profits aren't bad but if a company is making 15% profit in America with middle class jobs and environmental protections, moving it to a developing nation for 200% is not ethical and is selling us all out).

       That was the moment for me also.  I posted something about this.  I'll tellyou the specific moment on his show. The news had announced Bernie proposed a bill to federally legalize marihuana [sic], and the next day on Maher's show (live mind you), he made
       <strong>
        <em>
         absolutely no mention of it
        </em>
       </strong>
       .
       <em>
        Big time self-proclaimed potsmoker Bill Maher makes zero mention
       </em>
       .  But instead, in his opening monologue, he said, 'oh it's a bad day for democrats...bad day...medical pot legislation fails in ohio"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was ohio...some state that sucks and doesn't matter because they didnt' legalize pot.

       Chrome really hates these long post titles. I cannot drag/drop this URL to a folder, the filename is too long and nothing happens. Gotta fire up the Fox and do it.

       Male circumcision also injures public and it is legal. State = opinion with a gun. That's all legal means. It does not mean moral. Also, morality is relative. If you think that killing 4 yo children is immoral, then you ought to believe that killing pigs is immoral as well.

       I excuse Bill Maher from his hate of Trump simply because Trump did try to sue him for a ridiculous reason. If Trump had tried to sue me for something that stupid I would probably hold a grudge too.

       I feel like I'm stan in the ass-burgers episode of south park and everything just suddenly went to shit almost over night. Granted I'm a bit less cynical and wise enough to find mediums that arnt "shit" per say. I just can't fathom why everything in the lime light sucks so hard. Music, movies, politics, business, geopolitics, news, social media... It's all just shit.

       Big news in what is considered the "leftist" media at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people ignored right/left divide and conquer and just focused on corporations vs people or profits vs people we could build a much larger movement. (Profits aren't bad but if a company is making 15% profit in America with middle class jobs and environmental protections, moving it to a developing nation for 200% is not ethical and is selling us all out).
