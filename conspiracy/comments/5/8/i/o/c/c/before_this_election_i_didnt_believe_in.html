    <div class="md"><p>9/11 for me, and I&#39;m sure for many others as well. Now nothing can surprise me. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t even about the fact that something was obviously fishy with the whole thing; that part didn&#39;t really surprise me. What did was the unhesitating willingness of the American people to go along with the rhetoric as we spiraled into this current pit of an invulnerable oligarchy. It worked so well that true patriots don&#39;t even have any reasonable way to enact positive change anymore. Complete control. Occupy Wall Street was investigated and thwarted as a terrorist movement and was doomed from the very beginning. The recent, absolutely massive campaign finance protests in Washington were only covered in the media when celebrities got arrested, and even then, only in passing. They flew Stingrays over the Baltimore shooting protests and gobbled up all the identities of anyone who would, in the future, have the balls to get out on the street and stand for something.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s only getting worse my friends. Soon it looks like we&#39;ll have Internet fact-checking curation to look forward to; the resilient, hard-headed success of Correct The Record showed them that all it takes is shoving the appropriate information down the throats fast enough so that no one has time to breathe. </p>

<p>We are quickly approaching the need for a system of communication where we can talk publicly, but privately. </p>

<p>Interesting times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It made me really realize how bad the propaganda was and is. Also it makes you realize how brainwashed people are and how easily they can fall into believing this propaganda.  I was a liberal until this election comma, I mean bleeding heart liberal.  Now I see how they all work together. The Liberals say that Donald Trump is going to create fascism, but the only group that&#39;s being fascist is the Democrats by censoring and working with the media as well as paying people to entice violence at one of his rallies and then blame it on Bernie and Trump supporters. I can&#39;t even say that I support Trump because the backlash that I would receive is ridiculous especially from my female friends. I do not need the media telling me how I should feel about Donald Trump saying the word pussy. The media biased against him has created a vacuum where you can&#39;t even say  positive about him or his campaign without being criticized as racist, sexist or what other buzzword the liberal media is using. It&#39;s a full-scale attack on American people and the American public doesn&#39;t even care to notice.</p>

<p>The myth that people in the Middle Ages thought the Earth is flat appears to date from the 17th century as part of the campaign by Protestants against Catholic teaching. But it gained currency in the 19th century, thanks to inaccurate histories such as John William Draper&#39;s History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science (1874) and Andrew Dickson White&#39;s A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896). Atheists and agnostics championed the conflict thesis for their own purposes, but historical research gradually demonstrated that Draper and White had propagated more fantasy than fact in their efforts to prove that science and religion are locked in eternal conflict.</p>

<p>If you notice, it&#39;s why Podesta (formerly on Obama&#39;s team) is now on board with Clinton.</p>

<p>And moreover, Podesta has been working with Soros on the &quot;big picture&quot; idea in the US, which is to promote progressives into office (as a way to further the &quot;open borders&quot; globalist agenda, but Podesta&#39;s specific role is perpetuating that via Dems).  </p>

<p>Also, Neil Degrasse Tyson is not really a researcher, that&#39;s true, but it&#39;s because he&#39;s much more of a communicator and educator - an even more important role. He&#39;s an incredibly smart guy. Most do not have the talent at effectively communicating science to the public that he does.</p>

<p>There are many thousands of scientists worldwide doing deep cutting-edge research. There are very few who can tell people about it in ways they will understand as well as he can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though, based on this reply, I&#39;m doubtful that there is any chance what I write will matter (also, this subreddit is probably an inappropriate place for this reply, but oh well), I&#39;ll just say that I think you&#39;re being far too suspicious, to your own detriment.</p>

<p>It is not true that the science community is out to deceive you or indoctrinate you. Moreover, as someone who has worked on the cutting edge of both physics and mathematics, I have never observed anything except for honest, careful, precise and from-the-heart commentary from Neil Tyson. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what particular experience(s) instilled this view in you, but I&#39;m sorry for whatever they have been.</p>

<p>With regard to religion and science, I agree with you. There is no incompatibility between religion and science. The fundamental hypothesis of all good science is that every guess you make about the world is <em>wrong</em>. All you can do is improve your guesses, to better predict the future.</p>

<p>Science, by definition, studies the natural world - the world that can be observed - and nothing else. Claims about God that do not manifest physically are supernatural by definition. Science has nothing to say about metaphysics or the supernatural.</p>

<p>The only interfaces between scientific thinking and religion are in (a) examining the effects of religious thinking on real society (a deep subject) and (b) the application of heuristics like Occam&#39;s Razor to realize that it is not <em>necessary</em> to assume the existence of God in order to explain the universe around us (but, Occam&#39;s Razor says nothing about truth).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s awesome (that you are doing physics and mathematics).</p>

<p>So now I&#39;m curious, what, precisely, are the experiments and calculations that you have done that have resulted in this statement: &quot;I don&#39;t even believe in the physics I was taught...&quot;?</p>

<p>I replied to your post reading this as an implication that you had learned some physics and then not done much more physics, but if that&#39;s not correct, then that&#39;s awesome - science is both fun and important.</p>

<p>Any academic researcher can publish freely to arXiv, and anyone at all can publish freely to viXra otherwise. Have you published these findings? If you&#39;ve demonstrated problems in some of our better-understood physical knowledge, I&#39;d absolutely love to read about them - that&#39;s the most exciting and powerful part of doing science, after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Claiming to have figured out some mysterious knowledge and then refusing to tell anybody about how it works is the tactic of a sideshow mystic.</p>

<p>You can publish anything that you like, to a blog, to arXiv/viXra, to a journal if you can get it accepted. It is completely useless to claim to have knowledge and then to refuse to share it. This was the philosophy of Newton and nearly cost the world probably a hundred years in delay in acquiring understanding.</p>

<p>I have no clue, for example, what this statement even means: &quot;The quantum world has been mislabeled and used as a weapon, intentionally.&quot;</p>

<p>Or this one: &quot;We are dealing with a closed and incomplete system, and it has been fucking obvious. Everything we know is a special case of a larger system that has been made inaccessible from modern teaching&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, there is a lot that we don&#39;t know about physics. That is pretty much the point of doing scientific research: To learn more about the things we don&#39;t yet know much about. This is not because it has been &quot;excluded from teaching&quot; by some intentional process, it&#39;s because nature is deep and complicated.</p>

<p>I see that you are very convinced of this perspective, but you have said nothing useful or precise about why you are so convinced of it, that I can tell. I invite you to do so: </p>

<p>Tell me an experiment to do that will expose a controversial problem that you have found in our purported physical understanding! </p>

<p>Maybe I am just not intelligent enough to understand though, that&#39;s also a possibility.</p>

<p>Lastly, &quot;Have you seen Interstellar? We&#39;ve similarly been trying to solve this shit with our hands tied behind our fucking back.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, I have seen Interstellar. It is a science fiction movie. I don&#39;t know what the &quot;this shit&quot; that we&#39;ve been &quot;trying to solve with our hands tied behind our fucking back&quot; is supposed to be though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my experience is the vast majority of alien cases involve people being on drugs. That&#39;s not to say they are just hallucinations because there are distinct similarities between the experiences, it seems like it&#39;s something else.

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t think they can move here at will. That&#39;s kind of the main point of it, things can cross over but only by our own will is it possible. If you are tripping hard on dmt or lsd and start to open your mind to the other realities it starts to manifest those realities and give them materialization here. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll essentially see spiritual context to everything if you go far enough but the human mind is definitely not designed for it. We seem designed for having babies and making those babies into decent human beings, that comes much more naturally than tripping the veil. It&#39;s in my opinion incredibly dangerous and people should avoid the dissociative chemicals entirely, focus on the here and now and worry about the other dimensions after life.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like in the Matrix when Neo opens the door into the hallways, opening your mind to the spirits essentially opens the door on your portal to the other dimensions and lets in everything. There&#39;s no real filtering what comes through and that&#39;s why it&#39;s dangerous. Yeah we have dmt in our brains but it&#39;s moderated naturally and we need some connection to the other dimensions because that seems to be where reality is created, like an outsider holding things together that wants us to ignore it because the link between the two is so powerful that messing with it is dangerous. We live in a world of watts, joules, and degrees celsius. The physics calculations put the reality of other dimensions at extreme levels of energy with trillions of watts of electrical power and physics that do not behave in such a way as it does here. So powerful that we are obviously best served not breaching whatever is linking the two. Especially considering the emotions surrounding horrific deaths seems to linger very closely on the surface and the souls of the tortured are the most prominent to come back because they don&#39;t accept death. So you open up that portal and you essentially are opening up to the most tragic souls floating around that live in a realm of extremely unstable energy reactions.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t getting the insight from Einstein and Tesla, your grandma isn&#39;t sending you happy love messages it&#39;s more likely you&#39;re being duped/used/preyed upon and you&#39;re best just to completely isolate yourself from the bridge until death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Started 15 years ago when 9/11 happened, I was obsessed with the news and every night I would go to bed listening to the radio and one night I tuned into Coast to Coast radio on accident and during that time was nothing but 9/11 conspiracy. That then got me into many other conspiracies ranging from the popular Illuminati and Moon landing hoax to lesser known and discussed theories.</p>

<p>As I got older and went to college, I wasn&#39;t as big of a &quot;nutter&quot; as some would say, but I attended a university that was known for its leftist ideology and has had history of protests occur on campus and even while there, I attended some rallies and one even got violent. Anyways at this uni is when I got into politics as I took a Poli Sci elective and learnt about the history and comparing it to modern state etc. This then took me down the path of researching and trying to connect the dots to show people how fucked this world is and how 1984 we have become (even back in 2004-2006 it felt a little Orwellian to me).</p>

<p>Well that phase passed as I graduated and looked for a job. Of course once in the work force I didn&#39;t speak of about my views and kept my mouth shut about all the conspiracies I think have a high probability of actually being true. Well, until recently, I just couldn&#39;t hold it back anymore and now everyone i work with and on Facebook thinks I&#39;ve lost my mind and have become a Trump supporter (for the record, hate Trump, just hate Hillary and what she represents more).</p>

<p>So there is my origin story. Been on Reddit for over a few years, lurked this sub pre-election occasionally but more now as it is way more active and has content I&#39;m interested in again during this election season.</p>

<p>PS. Great refreshing thread here, enjoy reading about everyone&#39;s path to coming to same/similar conclusion as me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This election definitely opened my eyes to how hypnotized and stupid the average voting American has become due to the influence of the mainstream media and powers-that-be. Whether it was rigged or not, I can see why Obama was elected.  People really wanted a change from war and financial despair.  Of course, they didn&#39;t get it after 8 years.  Yet, in spite of the Wikileaks revelations and all the books written, people now think Hillary is the new beacon of hope for change.  You gotta be kidding.  Something is definitely amiss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here.  The framing of Assange and the blatant false stories with just a tiny bit if digging in the women accusing Trump.</p>

<p>Rape is horrific.  Sexual assault is horrific.  Pedophilia is horrific.  Using false accusations to destroy someone&#39;s reputation is just as horrific.  It&#39;s beginning to go mainstream as there is little social or legal backlash for doing it.</p>

<p>This election has changed my entire outlook on conspiracies.  And the horror of casually destroying reputation with social buzzwords turned into weapons.</p>

<p>I said since watching all of the primaries back in Thailand that trump was a troll.  But  fighting against the narrative and taking all of the stones and arrows that would destroy my reputation and still pushing forward and fighting back is inspirational.</p>

Syria is actually about an oil pipeline and Zionist, Saudi, western regional dominance against Russia, Iran, maybe china.
The american election system is controlled by two parties, the GOP, and the DNC, they both serve the oligarchy that actually controls this country while pandering to their bases for vote, the politicians are globalists who want to destroy borders, peoples, art, culture, just to get better trade deals.
The media is owned by whatever billionaire or corporation owns them, there are only 6 major media companies that control everything, they all server the interest of the globalist elite.
Racial, sexual, gender, conflicts and identity politics are used to divide the lower class and distract them from the the people who actually control things, the ceo&#39;s, the land owners, the corporations.
The liberals themselves have been transformed into good little globalists, demanding more minorities on the idiot box, while their reality deteriorates, they are in massive debt and live with their parents but more blacks are on the star trek wars...
They champion mass immigration though it only benefits the capitalists who need to lower wages through cheap labor  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome to reality as it&#39;s; opposed to as it&#39;s perceived. Check out my post and feel free to ask any questions or present any debates.</p>

<p>Excellent Topic. No matter what your stance on Hillary Vs Trump, at least as a result people are waking up. That&#39;s a huge win in my book.</p>

<p>To answer you question, No it doesn&#39;t surprise me. Although, In lieu of the DNC leaks and video of Hillary I have started to once again believe that voting does make a difference, though the game is clearly rigged and most of the 2 party candidates are not really too different from one another. Trump however may potentially be an exception.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to be born with the rational empirical gene (joke) and have questioned everything from a very young age. At age 5, I challenged my parents by saying I didn&#39;t think Santa Clause could fit in our chimney and there is a screen blocking the top. At age 7 I hid in my closet(no pun, lol) and used clothes to fill out my bed to entrap the tooth fairy. An at age 10 I asked questions that got me kicked out of church. My problems is relating to people that are able to keep their eyes shut in lieu of the overwhelming evidence present with so many &quot;beliefs&quot;. </p>

<p>This exact scenario has been anticipated for years. That it has even come this far with no one held accountable is a testament to how fucked up this country is. Don&#39;t forget the banks, corporations, and the media are all not only complicit, they are scrambling right now to protect what they&#39;ve stolen before the whole thing crumbles - leaving only those at the top untouched.

    <div class="md"><p>It is a <em>little</em> surprising, the amount of stuff coming out or even just being talked about. It doesn&#39;t go anywhere near as far as it should, of course. But the direction its taking seems good, and momentum is building.</p>

<p>The American people lack courage and clear-minded resolve. It&#39;s too easy for them to blow off criminality in high places, rationalizing that it doesn&#39;t really affect them, or that there&#39;s really nothing that they can do about it. If they could think more clearly, they would be more resolved. And if they had more courage, a lot could be done in a very short time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Swede here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been sure of a left-wing media conspiracy in Sweden, since the media blacks out everything that is on the right-end of the political spectrum. And if they were to report on it, it&#39;s always in a negative light.</p>

<p>I was sure there were SOME of it in the US also, but after the last week, I feel so sorry for the American populace.</p>

<p>You are supposed to be the face of freedom. Yet you have so little, it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not so much to be honest. I don&#39;t think most people who are well read in politics or philosophy and have a good understanding history will be too surprised by much of this. I think the waters do get muddied however by those who have a stake in the game and are very invested in the system. As an example just try raising a not mainstream school of thought on an economics board. No matter how minor it may be even if it slightly disagrees or questions the dominant paradigm it will be seldom be discussion but more over suppressed with dogmatic rhetoric. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was too young to know there was a conspiracy surrounding the 2000 election at the time, but I used to read 9/11 theories while I was in high school (05-08ish). Never really got into anything else, nor did I 100% believe 9/11 was an inside job back then; I just thought it was really interesting to read about and made me think deeper. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Uqk3fxFEs">This song</a> (EDIT: Sly Fox is pretty outdated in some of it&#39;s lyrics now, it still made/makes me think) came out in &#39;08 and really made me start looking into other conspiracies, still I never got crazy deep into any of them. After that, I&#39;ve tried to keep my eyes open and form my own opinions rather than take TV news at face value; and year by year, I&#39;ve become more and more skeptical and certainly believe in many of the theories posted about here. This election was just the absolute icing on the cake that sold me to large scale corruption and lack of compassion the most powerful have for the majority of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always had a strong bull shit meter and that at times has brought me to conclusions that were conspiratorial in nature however the past year has fully exposed and proven to me that our government and the media are in complete collusion with each other.

    <div class="md"><p>The campaign also knows Obama did it, too. It&#39;s to the point that I wonder if Clinton&#39;s team knew, but agreed to keep quiet about it knowing it would in fact be &quot;her turn&quot; in 2016... and that she&#39;d want to use those same tips and techniques.</p>

<p>If you notice, it&#39;s why Podesta (formerly on Obama&#39;s team) is now on board with Clinton.</p>

<p>And moreover, Podesta has been working with Soros on the &quot;big picture&quot; idea in the US, which is to promote progressives into office (as a way to further the &quot;open borders&quot; globalist agenda, but Podesta&#39;s specific role is perpetuating that via Dems).  </p>
