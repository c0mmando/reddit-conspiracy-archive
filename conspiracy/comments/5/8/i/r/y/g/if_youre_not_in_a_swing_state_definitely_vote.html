       this swing state argument is a waste of time. Best way to percede is to vote ur conscience regardless where u live. The 2 party system got us into this mess and its not going to get us out.

       Fair enough, but it's worth repeating to people that if you're not in a swing state there is
       <em>
        literally no reason
       </em>
       not to vote your conscience. Like literally zero reason at all.

       If you're a Libertarian, then you believe that the government's sole role is to protect the rights of individuals. If you want to advance that platform, then you should vote for Gary Johnson and help move the party on to the big stage next year. Even within his camp, they understand that they're not running for office. They're running for recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you agree with Jill Stein's platform, which is built from a collectivist/obligationist viewpoint, then you're not an American Libertarian. However, Libertarian Socialist schools of thought do exist.  If you'd like to explore those ideas more,

       Theoretically I'm all in for libertarianism, but Johnson has vocalized support for TPP, which undermines individual liberty and national sovereignty. Ever read The New Libertarian Manifesto? It discusses whether this party-based approach to reclaiming liberty ("partyarchy") and whether liberty can be realistically be achieved from it.

       Free trade is very Libertarian. He said he supports a free trade agreement, but not in its current form with all of the corporate fuckery in it.

       I'm so sick of having to say this over and over again to people. The only time the MSM takes any time to talk about Johnson, it's to remind people that he didn't know what Aleppo was (nor did 90% Americans before that story) or that he is pro-TPP.

       Agreed. The continued existence of corporate personhood completely undermines any attempt at libertarianism. Humans can't compete with transnational, undying, liability-free groups with all the same rights.

       I don't agree with the socialist policies, however some of Jill's platforms aren't terrible as I'm the demographic she's trying to cater to.

       Wholeheartedly, I'm a libertarian. I just like Jill better as a person. Same with Bernie. At this point I'm leaning towards Gary since he is poised best of the two 3rd partiers.

       So if you want Hillary to be President just cast your vote for her and save yourself the trouble. If you dont want her to be president you vote Donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its that fucking simple. WHo cares what you belive. its bigger then you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ask yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you want Hilary Clinton as your next President? If the answer is NO there is only 1 vote you can cast

       I'd rather it be hot out then to be locked away in a FEMA because of something I typed on the internets thanks our Queen. Although if we're going to be realistic, both will be the likely outcome.

       You want to know what the obvious flaw with your idea is? You're determining which states are swing states based on a controlled media outlet's flawed polling and projections.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the poll in Arizona that shows Hillary up 5 points that asked 45% Dem, and 20% Rep? Not a swing state, so, by your logic, "Vote 3rd party guys!!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       You absolutely CANNOT base your voting on polling. If you do you're willfully being controlled.

       Look at the leaks. All the chairs that the president assigns are basically decided by the corporations funding him. So why would I care? I don't think Dems or republicans will be assigning anyone that will address issues that are important to the American ppl. They align their public opinion with us, but in private will continue to stab us in the back. This is y i say there is  NO reason.

       Can't answer the question about war but I do have a pretty good idea about why some people are against $15 minimum wage. From a very general overview it is because they believe that people should earn what they make, someone flipping burgers does not deserve to earn the same as an intern at an engineering firm. That and the fact people making the current minimum wage still make enough to survive if they live within their means. Now for the slightly more complicated economic viewpoint.
So for this argument we look at the U.S. as a closed system and we make some assumptions about humans, 1) people will act rationally and in a way that will benefit them most, 2) people obey the law, pay taxes, don't steal, etc. and 3) people will act morally. Companies will do what is in their best interest, keeping costs down by hiring workers for as little cost as possible in order to make more profit, but they will do so legally thus paying employees  minimum wage. They will also hire the least amount of workers possible. Now, in the whole system (i.e. the U.S) there is a certain supply of possible workers. In an ideal economic world the supply of workers would equal the demand of jobs available, a scenario in which an equilibrium is reached. Capitalists believe that, left to its own devices, the market will reach this equilibrium naturally and on its own. Now here is where the government comes into play. When the government sets a minimum wage they are forcing companies to pay employees more than the company believes they are worth, thus, in order to continue to make a profit, companies hire fewer workers and there are more workers available than there are jobs. This means unemployment rates increase. Also, since companies are paying more than they believe to be fair they will increase the prices of their products and services, thus increasing cost of living and causing inflation. So now someone makes $15/hour instead of $7 but instead of paying $3 for a gallon of milk they pay $5. That is the jist of it. This graph shows exactly what I'm talking about and is taught in microeconomics courses around the country:

       Just more socialist bullshit ignorant of what's going on. This rise of socialist consciousness really concerns me. It pretty much always precedes the collapse of a nation. It can work to some level in a homogeneous culture. This idea that diversity is so great and the ultimate goal is just social engineering propaganda that liberals have swallowed, hook and all.

       We need a president that will cut government programs by about 75%. The choices of women shouldn't be subsidized by anyone. I don't want to pay into a system that allows women to kill children as a consequence of their mindless promiscuity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout all of these panels and debates and blah blah blah all I hear about is "women's rights." Women in the U.S. are far and away the most privileged class of people walking the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to hear a candidate talk about Men's rights. If women have sovereign agency over who lives and dies, men should have at minimum a right to choose to assist them.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Can my husband make me get a job after divorce?" "Can I go after my husband's IRA after divorce?" How can I legally rape men?

       Federal government in general needs to be shrunk by massive swathes.

       I would like to see a 50% decrease in military spending. I would also like to see more severe penalties for aliens trying to hide here. I would like to see federal taxes going into roads, bridges, schools and things like that that benefit everyone regardless of race or gender.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need micromanagement OUT of federal government. That's what NONE of these candidates are talking about. And not too many candidates are talking about at all. The only politician I know of who has talked about it with any meaning is Ron Paul.

       I think this is a great post, and it reflects my thought processes recently. Trump should easily win in my state, which makes it easier for me to follow my conscience and vote third party. However, I would be torn between Trump and third party if I lived in a swing state.

       Same here but i'm not taking any chances. Hillary is too dangerous, and there is already enough Democrat vote fraud going on that I feel every Trump vote counts. If I thought this was going to be an honest election with no fraud I would consider it.

       Under game theory, we'd all commit to vote for ONE of the 3rd parties this election cycle and the other 3rd party next election cycle. As it stands, the 3rd parties will be cannibalizing each other's chances of getting to the 5% threshold.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, 100% agree and tell your neighbors. If the election isn't close in your area, vote 3rd party.

       What if they
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       get over 5%? It's very possible. 19% of people voted for ross perot in 1992, that's more than enough to get 5% each for two third parties. That would be the ultimate power play, imo. It would really show people are looking for other options.

       It'd be great, but I don't think there's been enough chatter on it to make it happen by election day. You'd really need a groundswell and tremendous momentum to make it enough of a thing to hit 5% for both. Candidly, it's on so few people's radar, we'll be lucky if either of them hits 5%. I think a lot of disenfranchised people just plan to stay home. Or vote for whoever is their traditional party candidate out of fearmongering.

       Didn't realize Johnson had those stats already. I hope that holds true. Even still, we should talk up the concept, so people are sure to turn out. If it's cold and rainy on election day, it's a lot harder to get off the sofa to go vote for someone who's going to get their ass handed to them. People need to think they can win something. Even if that something is convention funding in 4 years.

       If you ARE ina swing state it doesn't mean that you should automatically throw in with the D or R circlejerk. It just means that you have a tougher choice.

       In uncontested states there is absolutely no reason to vote D or R.

       I never said it's a fix-all, or to do nothing else. It's just a lever we have to pull to influence the situation, one of many, and so we might as well pull it and do it intelligently. That's literally all I'm saying with this post.

       You want to know what the obvious flaw with your idea is? You're determining which states are swing states based on a controlled media outlet's flawed polling and projections.
What about the poll in Arizona that shows Hillary up 5 points that asked 45% Dem, and 20% Rep? Not a swing state, so, by your logic, "Vote 3rd party guys!!!"
You absolutely CANNOT base your voting on polling. If you do you're willfully being controlled.

       Seriously? My entire point (you don't even have to read between the lines) is that NOT to base your vote off of ANY map. I just said that, clearly, in my first comment, so why then would you turn around and ask for a
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       map? That's plainly stupid. They're all based off polls which, at best, are flawed, and, at worst, are used as propoganda. My God...I just get done explaining how retarded it is to use any map as a guide for your voting, and I started out by explaining how even your premise (using maps to guide voiting) is flawed, and you ask me for A BETTER MAP...!? I just blew your premise out of the stratosphere!

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When the Republican National Convention begins in Cleveland on Monday, it will be the first time in four decades that a major political party’s nominating convention is underwritten nearly exclusively with private cash—funneled in from the same billionaires, corporate lobbyists and Super PACs whose influence over politics Trump has enthusiastically lambasted from the stump.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The RNC’s near total dependence on private money is the direct result of a series of recent federal rule changes that eliminated public funding for conventions and made it easier for parties to rake in unlimited sums of private cash, with no extra oversight.
The new rules, which passed with little fanfare in 2014, allow individual mega donors to give ten times more to national parties they they could in 2012. They also fail to close a loophole allowing corporations, lobbying firms, Super PACs, and special interest groups, which are formally prohibited from giving to the parties’ conventions, to give unlimited amounts through special, non-profit committees, which are not bound by normal disclosure rules. As a result, the public won’t find out who the major corporate funders are to either the Republican or Democratic conventions until sometime in the fall.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       So the federal government eliminated the law that would've given millions towards funding a 3rd party convention.

       you can make a difference with a third party vote, I do it all the time and have seen the parties I support rise to have more and more members and power. Politics listens when people get votes.

       Are people still buying into the Trump is a shill/plant theory? Shit. I gave it some credence towards the beginning but he's won me over with his recent speeches. Y'all do what you feel, but swing state voters have the most power and we need to keep Clinton out.

       Are you talking about Hillary paying people to disrupt his rallys?  I'm sorry but that is proven correct.  You can trace the people who were disrupting to the payroll.  They were paid to be there and disrupt.  They were paid in Chicago to shut it down.  They were paid in Arizona to block the highway, it is not a conspiracy.

       That is, if that is what you are referring to with 'shill/plant' theory.

       you misunderstood I know all of that, which is exactly why I'm voting Trump. Some people think Trump is on all of this and he's part of the same machine somehow. At this point if people still believe that I don't know what to say, they've clearly been demoralized over the years, conditioned to believe that no change can come through voting, a self fulfilling prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exactly what you brought up proves my point, why would you need to pay agitators to try to shut down Trump if it doesn't matter to them who gets in?

       Ok then we are completely on the same page, I know what you are talking about now - I went in a different direction, sorry about that.  I, too, have read articles about Trump being a false candidate in order for Clinton to be elected.  If this is true, Donald Trump is one of the smoothest truth fabricators alive.  He has a following unlike anyone has seen in their lifetimes and his supporters are extremely passionate.  I remember reading that FBIAnon thread not too long ago that said Clinton will win the election, but fraud will be proved and it will turn out Trump won.  As long as he doesn't concede that sounds possible.  I see 2004 all over again.

       If this is true, this would be the only rational explanation I have heard to vote for a 3rd party.

       Unfortunately this election is too close to allow even a chance that this treasonous criminal remains in control of american tax dollars. Vote for the businessman who understands how to restart the economy first, then change the 2 party system second. None of this matters if Hillary destroys the economy with new taxes and globalist trade deals.

       Trump will drag us in to international wars all the same and will do the bidding of the military-industrial complex because he's a sellout, that's how he became a billionaire. He sells out to the highest bidder, and that is the military-industrial complex and central banks, and they want a war in Syria. He made that clear in his AIPAC speech.

       Please. Trump is was the only person in that second debate who DID NOT want to start war with Russia. Hillary, and both moderators were goading him into it an he refused. He even threw Pence under the bus on it. If you don't want war. Trump, and Jill are the one's currently talking about it being stupid to antagonize Russia.

       Not outright. Read his AIPAC speech highlights though. He's clearly on board with the Zionist ideological agenda. Which involves a war with Syria. These people call the shots, not him. And he's beholden to those people and willing to work with them
      </p>
      <p>
       He may not want it now, but once they wave a billion dollars in his face, he'll agree to it. It's not like he's shy from being militaristic.

       Trump is a Zionist war monger. Him and Clinton will both lead US into a war with Syria. I applaud Russia for standing up to the Zionists. Without Russia, there is no balance of power.

       While I am 100% against Trump - this is not the place. The OP's point is valid for both Clinton and Trump supporters: if you state is already spoken for one of them - check

       Look at the leaks. All the chairs that the president assigns are basically decided by the corporations funding him. So why would I care? I don't think Dems or republicans will be assigning anyone that will address issues that are important to the American ppl. They align their public opinion with us, but in private will continue to stab us in the back. This is y i say there is  NO reason.

        I'm so sick of having to say this over and over again to people. The only time the MSM takes any time to talk about Johnson, it's to remind people that he didn't know what Aleppo was (nor did 90% Americans before that story) or that he is pro-TPP.
