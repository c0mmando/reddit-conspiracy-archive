       Bernies "defeat" was the biggest Heartbreak ever, especially because besides a few recounts he never called them out for all the shit they pulled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in sports, if you find the athlete or team guilty of cheating after the event, you're still going to take the points and trophies away from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dun' get how they can just follow this media narrative, instead of the logic that you shouldn't accept the other party cheating.

       She doesn't need to "cheat" to win.  The electoral college is set up to act as a failsafe in the case of actual democracy.  This shitshow you're watching is just the circus part of bread and circuses.

       Forget the electoral collage. The primaries are run by private entities that have nothing to do with the constitution. They could disregard the vote and nominate whoever they want.

       Their are a few reforms I want. Removing the political parties power from the nominating process would be a step in the right direction.

       I don't think the issue lies in political parties, I think that the issue resolves from our voting system. We need to move away from "first past the post" and into something like the "alternative vote" so that we are no longer dominated by two parties.

       The electoral college was actually set up by the Founding Fathers. They just didn't see the potential for abuse like with a lot of other loopholes in the Constitution. It needs to be redone and modernized IMO and carefully pored over to reduce as much possibility for abuse. That would require revolt and a new government though.

       Actually the college was setup because they considered the average Man uneducated an unworthy of really voting. Same reason for a while only landowners could vote. I think it's changed over time only because the less say you give the majority the higher the chance they get screwed, and want to revolt. Which is what were seeing now with the current economy only benefiting big corporations.

       The founding fathers were concerned about tyranny.  that's why they were careful about democracy.  the electoral college was a way for them to control the outcome and stave off "the tyranny of the majority", in a sense.

       We'll have the electoral college up until they find a way to ensure they can rig a majority vote, then they'll do away with the electoral college and sign in majority vote overnight like they did with gay marriage. Every idiot will cheer and think they've won and Democracy got a little better, but really we'll just be falling for a deeper trap.

       Seriously so true. Mitt Romney had more of the population vote than Obama and yet the electoral college put Obama into office. It is literally all just a big interactive show to let Americans feel involved. We don't have Democracy, we have a Republic and people fail to realize this. Just because you can vote doesn't mean it counts for shit.

       regardless of what happens this election has opened people's eyes to the political realities facing the US, and to the existence of subversive/criminal elements of our society that are trying to maintain power under the guise of 'democracy' and 'elections' that they decide with their electronic voting machines, owned by private companies who have strong stakes in which 'candidates' their machines allow to win.

       How you can actually stand this nonsense is astonishing. It's self-evident that Bernie Sanders took it bending over backwards when it's obvious that Hillary Clinton cheated -- everybody knew that, and still does. Remember, Megan Brija? Remember Kim Ashley? We do not deserve it for Trump too -- and this is why we fight. That fact that some of you don't see it (or don't want to) is just laughable on it's face. We are going to protest in the streets if Trump loses. You bet we will, and more.

       Is it not possible for Trump to lose fairly? He has alienated a huge chunk of the electorate because of how he's spoken about different races, women and immigrants. Will you plan to protest if he loses no matter what, or only if you sense fuckery about?

       He is not even a stupid bigot. That's a narrative crafted by his opponents. He has said he wants to help Hispanics/Blacks get more jobs. What he is against is Illegal Immigration, and dangerous unvetted Muslim Immigration. Which is perfectly reasonable but goes very much against the agenda of the ruling class atm so they spin it to be "divisive".

       That's a big IF.  There are already lawsuits that have shown evidence that Hillery cheated. At the debate, they tried to corner Trump into allowing them to cheat without a challenge. Trump
       <strong>
        must
       </strong>
       challenge the results and people
       <strong>
        must
       </strong>
       support him. Or Hillery will be a bigger problem than the appointed Bush Jr. who only started little wars.

       And both prosecution and defense experts are unbiased as well when they conduct their analysis... they just end up with completely different conclusions even though they started with the same facts. Its funny how their conclusion is always helpful to the side that hired them, I guess they just have unique viewpoints

       you're either an idiot, or you arent paying attention if you actually think raising taxes on the rich will do anything to help the debt. Hrc spews her stupid fucking nonsense about making the rich pay their "fair share" of taxes cuz fools like you eat that shit up. the top 1% pay aprox. half of the taxes as it is. they can also choose to move away and outsource jobs if the govt tries to bend them over anymore.
      </p>

       just because its a plan dosnt mean that it will ultimately work. and do you honestly think that the majority of the 1 percent will leave the US if they get taxed more?? her plan taxes large corporations and also involves spending less money on the military and rerouting it t things like medicare , which trump by the way wants to abolish. Do you honestly think that giving tax breaks to the rich in the name of trickle down economics will work? you just have to look at the past 30 years to see that that dosnt work

       They can leave. And they can also hide more money in accounts safe from taxes because they have the means. Hrc will raise taxes on corporations just like obama closed guantanomo. And lets be real for a moment. "trickle down" economics does work when it means small businesses are taxed less. It allows them to hire more people and pay those people better. If you think that is what has been going on for the past 30 years as you say, then your head is buried in the sand. Hrc wants to push a welfare state. she also wants to abolish borders (podesta emails) how the fuck do you propose thats going to work out?? No soverginity, plus excessive "free money" for people who send remittinces back to their home country, plus more people who dont pay taxes (under-the-table-paid illegals) while consuming an enormous amount of tax revenue (public school, food stamps, ER visits that they never intend to pay for) is all an equation for a fucked economy and a non existant middle class.

       People talk shit on Obama all the time for not being a tough leader, but then when Clinton suggests things that would be in opposition to Russia's desires, suddenly it's bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you listened to the debate, what she said about the no fly zone in Syria she wants implemented was actually
       <em>
        somewhat
       </em>
       reasonable and coherent. She wants that to happen, and wants to accomplish by communicating with Russia and making it know what the US intends to happen in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       She did avoid directly answering whether she would allow Russian jets to be fought down upon encroaching into the no fly zone, which I found disconcerting, but everything else she said made her sound, regarding that specific topic, as if she was a reasonable, competent, and tough leader. Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be in favor of Putin and his tactics. Do we need another leader that, among myriad other reasons he is unqualified to lead our military, will practice appeasement of one of the few truly dangerous men in the world?

Work with All Countries by exchanging new tech &amp; products in mutually beneficial - Flexible - goals for trading.

         The US is not targeting the Syrian Army of Russians in Syria. They are targeting ISIS in Syria. This is a separate issue from whether or not the US, or groups acting on the US's behalf are funding efforts against Russia or the Syrian army in the region.

         Again, arbitrary. You can't just say "war crime". It would be arguably, an act of war. The purpose of the proposed no fly zone is at least ostensibly to protect the individuals on the ground that are not fighters who are by far the biggest victims of the conflict. It's fair to say there could be ulterior motives to this, of a myriad nature, but I think it'd be asinine to say that the protection of civilians is not also a real motivating factor.

      <p>
       That is very vague, but if I'm understanding you correctly, you are saying a couple things here. One, that literally everything she said is part of some deceitful ploy with sinister motivations. Two, that not one word out of her mouth was what she actually believes, nor would it be something that she will actively try to make happen. Three, that you personally totally see through everything she says somehow. Four, that there is something to be seen through in the first place.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        If by "if you are referring to Putin" you mean when I said this:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        one of the few truly dangerous men in the world?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then yes, I absolutely mean Putin. Ignoring the man himself and his policies, he is absolutely one of the most dangerous men in the world by nature of the position he holds. That alone is enough to be cautious of the man. The same can be said about Obama surely, but Putin in general, and I think you'd be hard pressed to disagree with this, is much more cavalier with his actions than any presidential contemporary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM definitely plays up the fear mongering side of conflicts between the US and Russia, but conflict is there nonetheless. I don't predict escalations of a serious, i.e. nuclear, nature, but it is a possibility with Russia. Which makes the leader of that country
       <em>
        dangerous.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, on a more personally directed note:

      <blockquote>
       <p>

       if you listen to the way she speaks compared to the way donald speaks, in the debates then you will hear that she is appealing to a much smarter audience by the way that she actually backs up what she is saying with facts and information , where as donald just speaks nonsense, he literally spoke for like 2 minutes and all that came out of  it was that he is a great business man and that business people are whats needed to fix the debt. his plan to fix the debt will instead add billions of dollars to it.he wants to spend money on increasing america security through war and bigotry. I am under no elusion that hilary is corrupt, but so is donald, therefore we have to pick the better of the two, and its clearly apparent that hilary is the better choice for all the reasons i have stated.

       You are right. I would just like to add that it was not the time to fight this fight with Bernie in the primaries. Repubs disliked him as much as Hillary at the time and that means approx. half the population. With the POTUS, every single American should care if it's rigged and we all get stuck with someone we don't like

       The options suck, but the last shred of democracy will be wiped out if he loses. They already want to federalize the elections. You think that will be less corrupt than it is now? 
Obama wants to federalize elections:

       Not to mention if Hillary really goes for broke, and pass Amnesty/TPP then America as we know it is pretty much over. Some don't get this. There are far more than 20 million illegals here. You pass Amnesty an over night they all get welfare. And they all vote for more of it. That's why Trump is taking the stance he is taking. The USA is being transformed into just another socialist Latin American state. Which is the next step before they do the full on American Union treatment. It really is do or die time if anyone actually wants to keep the USA as we know it.

       I don't think the 2nd amendment is the best path if Trump is denied the presidency. If the electoral college gives it to Hillary then Article 5 is the part of the Constitution we need to fall on. It outlines how to amend the Constitution, and while congress is never going to help us the founding fathers left us with the ability to amend it ourselves. If 3/4ths of the states ratify an amendment it becomes official. If Trump could harness our support into passing amendments to reform our electoral process and clean up corruption I think it would be a way better way to spend our energy than attempting an armed rebellion is.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need 38 states to get on board with a theoretical election reform amendment. The good news is that 33 states are entirely controlled by Republicans, who unlike those that made it to Washington, still have to answer to the Republican base. And with Trump leading the Republican base and immense preexisting public support for abolishing the electoral college and eliminating first past the post voting I think he really has a good shot of making America great again with or without the presidency.

       Your exact sentiment is what I refer to as "Slave Think". "Don't worry about your so called leaders going against the wishes of the electorate! Don't worry even though your constitutional rights are being eroded each year! What are you some psychopath whose going to hit the streets just because your country is falling apart? Don't worry, in 4 years you'll get to go through this all again with a different fraud! The beauty of democracy!" Ugh, you people don't understand the problem at all. The entire government is corrupted to the core, you cannot just wait something like this out. It is an octopus with it's tentacles in every facet of your life, at some point the people have to man up and deal with it. Hard enough that we must do all of this, but then we have cowards like you asking us not to rock the boat.

       Or maybe, maybe, the country that just voted in Obama twice is just left of center now and Hillary hasn't offended every single group in the country on the national stage with everyone watching. Nearly every poll in the country has had her ahead the entire time, his strongest supporters are jumping ship, his campaign team can't wait to be rid of him, he purposely told his debate prep team to screw off all three debates, every group that's assessed his proposals have come back saying they are awful policies, oh, and his vp is a religious zealot that champions social regressivism. Could that be it?

       lol, did you just say Hillary hasn't offended every single group? Because the polls show otherwise, she is hated globally. Everyone fucking hates her, and the only reason you don't is either because you're uninformed or you're paid. It's simple.

       Lmao yeah I wish I got paid to talk shit about that egomaniac. She's viewed unfavorable but trump is shown to be viewed even worse. And no, throughout this cycle she hasn't offended really anyone with her words. She hasn't had to do any damage control that wasn't about emails. Meanwhile trump has ostracized women, minorities, non Christians, Christians, the gay community, disabled people, the military, the middle class, the inner city, I mean seriously, who has he not offended? If you honestly can't see why trump is losing in most every single national poll and even Republicans are acknowledging he's most likely not going to win then you're not in touch with reality and the rest of our society. I didn't say if you're voting trump btw, I said if you can't see why. Big difference... also gop controls the voting in something like 35 states so if there was rigging they'd have to be in on it. And if you're going to rig an election, you don't make it by 12 percent for obvious reasons.

       This is what the constitution is for. What do you think they said in 1776, We don't want our freedom from England because some people may die and get hurt? This is the reason our government is fucking us harder and harder every chance they get. This mentality of peaceful protest and demonstrations. A peaceful protest would not have gotten this country anywhere in 1776.

       pretty sure he didn't threaten any violence, but we can be sure that any of the americans protesting will likely have violence used against them by state-sponsored gangs of gun thugs known as "security"/Wackenhut/G4S/etc., just like they always do, from Kent State to OWS to Ferguson to the Pipeline protests.
      </p>
      <p>
       you take "and more" to mean violence when it could just as easily and more logically mean legal action and other forms of dissent toward the subversive elements of society who are passing the highest offices back and forth between their own wives/sons/donors (which is incidentally what Trump is to Bush and Clinton, donor and longtime family friend, it doesn't really matter who wins but it sure will be good to see all the trumpers freak out when the vote gets tilted "51/49" by the proprietary IP software in the e-voting machines and then passed off as 'the result of a democratic election'.)

       What were they supposed to do when their own leader was surrendering? Whether he was forced to surrender or not the fact was he surrendered. You can't blame his followers for moving on. Trump so far on the other hand doesn't seem to be willing, and good for him. If he has proof of vote fraud he could probably legit lead a revolution.

       TPTB would then have been given ample time to replace Clinton with another puppet. By waiting this long, it put Bernie second in line to run in the event that she is kicked out of the race, or drops out willingly. At least that's my understanding. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

       Will you wake up when Donald Trump concedes and pretends like it's no big deal?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's been practically throwing the election. He's backstabbed Pence (one of the most conservative forces in the country), he's got Paul Ryan practically getting Bernie's campaign kicked off again, and it seems like every time someone says "Well Trump would never say X, he'd lose supporters" - he does it the next day or within the hour on Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       He funded O'Keefe's latest video - a guy who admits he is a radical leftist who makes videos that get republicans laughed at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump praised Obama and Hillary aaaaall the way up until... what, 4 years ago suddenly changes his tune and becomes a hardcore conservative republican and starts going to Church and boasting about his bible collection?

       You think it's OK to hold a gun to someone's head and say: "Pay for my kids school"? Cuz that's what socialism is.  Please don't threaten my life because YOU want direct access to the fruits of MY labor.

       Notice he couldn't define socialism.  Because he doesn't want to say the truth: government has ultimate power. And it's a roll of the dice if that government is "benevolent" (takes your money at the point of a gun) to put other people's kids through school and provide other people's healthcare or if it's malevolent and takes your money at the point of a gun to enrich itself.
      </p>

       He cites past iterations of Venezuela as points for socialism "working". When has Venezuela ever competed with the likes of the United States?
      </p>
      <p>
       The humanist report guy talks Sweden and Denmark one of which has highest rates of depression, the other gained enormous wealth BEFORE it turned in the socialist direction -- and both of which practice exactly what I said:
      </p>
      <p>
       The government holds a gun to your head and demands the fruits of your labor for the benefit of someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Height of immorality.  Initiating violence against a peaceful person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other better ways to help people get what they want and need.  He admits a free market is part of it.  Freedom is ALL of it my friend.

       Please visit the Tom Woods show on YouTube - keyword "socialism".

       These people don't really know what socialism is. I can tell by your name that you understand that there are many who would die to prevent our country from becoming a socialist state, that is everything we stand against as Americans. My generation thinks socialism is Switzerland or Norway, it is not. My generation doesn't understand that the more power you give a government, the more they will abuse it and the more they will take. They think that the big enemy is "Big Bad Corporations", when super corps like Monsanto wouldn't even exist without government allowing the economic conditions that led to Monsanto cornering the market in the first place. They think if you take power from corporations and give it to government, that you solve the problem, when in reality you make it worse.

       No you just blamed your misfortunes on white people (racist), rich people (class warfare much?), &amp; "those corporations" (spooky huh). You were duped into supporting a commie nice guy who never drew a paycheck until he was 40 years old. &amp; What did Bernie do when he had a chance to stand up for his movement? He took it the ass and sat down. Some hero.

       Because the peaceful transition of power is literally the heart of american democracy. It's the great american experiment and we were the first country in the world to pull it off. It's why so many countries followed our lead into democracy, because we showed it could be done and you can't have democracy without it.

       No, the peaceful transition of power happened in plenty of other countries before it happened in the US. And the peaceful transition of power is NOT essential to a democracy. If there is reasonable suspicion that the votes have been tampered with, the only way to preserve the democracy is to contest the results. This doesn't imply that there will not be peace, there will just be a waiting period between the day of the election and when the results have been reviewed to confirm the winner. I really don't see why everyone is going crazy over this. I don't care for Trump at all, but that is no excuse to ignore any legitimate concerns due to a false sense of what is important to a democracy.

       if you refer to the biting, I thought suarez got a 6 month ban with no football at all. 
Which I actually found a little too excessive a punishment. 
But I got in to heated arguments on that, and accept that some think he should have gotten more.

       If it's obvious that she stole it then Trump should lead his,and Sanders supporters to occupy the Capitol building or the lawn of the WH.

       The SS does not have the man power to stop 100,000 people from camping in the Lawn of the WH. Clinton is not that likeable anyways.

       Maybe if it's so obvious then perhaps he should demand a 2nd round of election voting? He could compensate the voters for not coming into work to vote again with a 2 thousand dollar stimulus check if he's found to be the actual winner.

       If he or anyone were to perform any kind of action that was deemed as hostile to the President the military would be called in immediately if the SS couldn't handle it, not to mention all the other branches of law enforcement. Ultimately, it would be spun by the MSM to be an act of violence by a splinter group targeting the President. Which would lead to even more regulations if not outright martial law and disarming of the public.

       If you were to do something like that it would have to be MLK level peaceful. With special consideration made to not seem in any way threatening. Furthermore the organizers would have educate participants to identify and successfully deal with agents provocateur as there will be plenty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Peaceful but firm protest is the key. But to be honest, that won't work either. The solution to our country's problems is much more involved than a protest regardless of the size.

       Like it matters in a rigged election when both are puppets.
If you are still invested in this election and you want real change you need to shift your focus away from the staged performance and put it on the people that are controlling the election. Until we do that we are wasting our time even focusing on election results.

      </p>
      <p>
       I am not going to predict what Trump does,  but what the candidate does affects how the followers react.    No one can follow Bernie or the Bernie movement when Bernie is obviously compromised.

       I find it odd that the polls all say Hillary is ahead.  I travel in my job and when I talk to people, most, but not all, prefer Trump.  So either MSM is really trying to throw things with the polls, their not polling people as they should, or it is rigged.

       This is called an anecdote, children. There's good reason why it's not considered evidence of anything but jack shit. And that's our story for the day.

       You're correct, from a limited point of view.  But an "anecdote" is an amusing/interesting story about a person.  However, when talking to many people it becomes an informal, albeit unscientific, poll.  So, really even the MSM polls are a set of "anecdotes" about who you will vore for.  Just an addition to your "story of the day.'

       Your personal experience of talking to people, unless you've asked a specific question and recorded responses, is by definition anecdotal evidence.

      <p>
       From wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Anecdotal evidence is evidence from anecdotes, i.e., evidence collected in a casual or informal manner and relying heavily or entirely on personal testimony. When compared to other types of evidence, anecdotal evidence is generally regarded as of limited value to a number of potential weaknesses.

       I feel about the same. Though I don't support either candidate. I think voter fraud is plan b. He's been crucified the entire election by the media and propaganda on this scale is very effective. Even FOX news couldn't find very many nice things to say about him.

       pretty sure he didn't threaten any violence, but we can be sure that any of the americans protesting will likely have violence used against them by state-sponsored gangs of gun thugs known as "security"/Wackenhut/G4S/etc., just like they always do, from Kent State to OWS to Ferguson to the Pipeline protests.
      </p>
      <p>
       you take "and more" to mean violence when it could just as easily and more logically mean legal action and other forms of dissent toward the subversive elements of society who are passing the highest offices back and forth between their own wives/sons/donors (which is incidentally what Trump is to Bush and Clinton, donor and longtime family friend, it doesn't really matter who wins but it sure will be good to see all the trumpers freak out when the vote gets tilted "51/49" by the proprietary IP software in the e-voting machines and then passed off as 'the result of a democratic election'.)

       Your personal experience of talking to people, unless you've asked a specific question and recorded responses, is by definition anecdotal evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       From wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Anecdotal evidence is evidence from anecdotes, i.e., evidence collected in a casual or informal manner and relying heavily or entirely on personal testimony. When compared to other types of evidence, anecdotal evidence is generally regarded as of limited value to a number of potential weaknesses.

       Your

       , is not useful or indicative of the current situation in the US. My own anecdotal evidence tells me that Trump supporters are much more likely to let it be known who they support, and the occurrence of supporters for each candidate varies wildly by region.

       The options suck, but the last shred of democracy will be wiped out if he loses. They already want to federalize the elections. You think that will be less corrupt than it is now? 
Obama wants to federalize elections:

       im not talking about Hilary's analysts , they are unbiased when they calculated the outcomes. and no they cant come up with any outcome they want, if they could then no one would use them because they wouldn't be accurate.
