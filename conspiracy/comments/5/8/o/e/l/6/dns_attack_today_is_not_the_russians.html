        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Consider for a moment if we accept the premise that the Podesta hack was the work of the Russians.  That information being revealed relies primarily on a functioning internet in order for it to spread and continue.</p>

<p>If you were Russia, would you attack internet infrastructure while trying to spread information?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re Russia and the Podesta emails are simply a leak, as Wikileaks has alluded to, but they certainly are to your benefit.  Would you attack internet infrastructure preventing that information from coming out?  </p>

<p>In whose interest is it to break the internet currently?</p>

<p>I posit that this DNS attack is the work of the USA government, directed by Barack Obama, attempting to slow the release of information from Wikileaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Far fetched (or not?) but Battlefield One was released today and it&#39;s not uncommon that script kiddies with access to botnets run a DDOS just because their E-penises are short...</p>

<p>By attacking DNS servers they can down EA, PSN, Origin etc at the same time. (and also everyone else on the same DNS servers)</p>

<p>Then copy-cats with equally short virtual appendixes might have joined in on the fun.</p>

<p>There might be something more sinister at play but it&#39;s almost expected to have a global DDOS when Battlefield, CoD or similar AAA game releases and it might be this simple?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know much about the gaming world, but based on a recent perusal of articles on gaming sites, it seems that you are indeed referring to a very real phenomenon. This actually sounds like the most plausible theory so far, compared to the other possibilities. There isn&#39;t much evidence of any theory in particular, but the Russians, US, China, Anonymous, etc. theories just don&#39;t seem to make sense. This one however, does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>usually when an attack like this happens i just go to norse corps attack map and all my questions are answered.  however it appears their attack map is down, probably related to the recent outage.  </p>

<p>however, the nature of these attacks as well as the scale strike me as a state actor.  and no im not talking about russia.  on the global scene russia is small potatoes.  this is probably a probing attack by state actors in china.  btw, have any of you eaten at wendys in the past 6 months and used your debit card?  if so, get a  new one because the clearing house wendys uses has been compromised, so your card is compromised.  </p>

<p>what do todays attack and the wendys thing have in common?  china.  its fucking china.  again.  </p>

<p>im not entirely computer literate, but ill try to explain how it is that they pull off attacks like this all the time to the best of my ability:</p>

<p>basically they have been taking the long way around to do this.  by using common attacks on regular ass peoples PC&#39;s, examples like phishing etc as well as data gathered from hacks like the time they hacked that big insurance company, they combine all this data to guess things like passwords and answers to security questions.  so they get into peoples emails or onto their computers and apparantly download some kind of malware that, when the time is right, help to DDoS a target of their choosing.  </p>

<p>it apparantly takes a long time to do it this way, but the results are more powerful because you have more sources DDoS-ing.  however another thing about all this is the fact that china has been doing this for over a decade now at least.  its scary because they dont hack things like our infrastructure, redlights, power compaines or whatever.  they hack the people that control these things, find out everything they can about them, and use that data to hack into critical infrastructure, redlights, power companies etc.  all the while just fucking with shit along the way like DNS&#39;s.  </p>

<p>another target, apparantly, is they look into the US&#39;s ability to seamlessly tap into our privatized transportation for military purposes.  you know how in times of dire need the military can use things like cabs, commercial jets, subways, semi trucks etc for their own use an purposes.   for some odd reason, the chinese are almost constantly looking into how we do this, how fast we can do this, and how completly we can do this.  if you have any idea as to why they would do this please tell me because im stumped.</p>

<p>im not trying to sound like an alarmist asshole.  i genuinely dont think china and america will legit go to war with eachother.  we rely on eachother far too much.  but i will say that all this just goes to show you that you just cant trust the damn chinese.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider the possibility it may be state-sponsored, and probably not from Russia. Going over the evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Affected sites were widespread, from social media, streaming entertainment, news, gaming, even programming sites (github). These targets have consistent, daily traffic and are likely to be noticed by the largest audience. In contrast to financial institutions, etc. The attack was meant to affect the sites the general public actually uses.</p></li>
<li><p>Hacking groups love to stamp their name on their achievements, thus far I&#39;ve read that back in September, PoodleCorp claimed they were going to target EA when Battlefield 1 was released (today). No update from them recently, and that wouldn&#39;t account for the rest of the ddos targets. The fact that no one has owned up to the attack is a little suspicious. It&#39;s possible someone else timed the attack to match their claim for cover.</p></li>
<li><p><em>cui bono</em>: Who benefits? I suppose an anarchistic hacking group wouldn&#39;t mind disrupting all these services, but usually a group would claim it (see above) with a boast or message to go along with it. The US gov would benefit by producing another news story to smother unfavorable news and garnering support for stricter internet policies they&#39;d like to push through the US and the UN. Russia? I doubt they care about disrupting our shit show, nor would they get anything out of it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>DDoS attacks are simple enough that it doesn&#39;t require state-sponsored resources to pull off, which makes it a good move if above said state wanted to make it look like the attack came elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a suggestion online that this is a preliminary cyber attack, and that somebody wants to create a much more massive cyber outage that would disrupt the elections. That gives me the creeps because with all the election nastiness from both sides, not to mention international discord, I could just SEE that happening (shiver).</p>

<p>It won&#39;t cost me a cent to hit the ATM and get some cash out tomorrow, and to fill my gas tank and get some groceries. Even if nothing happens, I&#39;ll eventually eat the groceries and use up the money and gas too. Is it too paranoid and tin-hattish to do this? Probably but who cares what people think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even know who O&#39;Keefe is?</p>

<p>Literally everything he has done in the past was debunked. He&#39;s someone who calls himself a radical leftist. </p>

<p>And with his latest video, he is refusing to release unedited footage? Why? Because when he inevitably does, it will (once again) make everyone who believed in them look like an idiot.</p>

<p>I am amazed that everyone keeps giving this guy attention. The fact that Trump funded Project Veritas is more evidence that Trump is intentionally throwing the election against himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I do. Past indications aren&#39;t indicative of future success. You&#39;re using ad hominem as an attack and it&#39;s a logical fallacy. Try harder. Plus there&#39;s further evidence in the leaked emails that tie these people together further! Let me know if you&#39;re interested and I can do an info dump for you.</p>

<p>Why would <em>anyone</em> cause a nation-wide outage? It&#39;s impossible to say without knowing who is profiting off it, but I refuse to accept &quot;it was the Russians!&quot; ever again. Or at least not until my own government once again has credible transparency.</p>
