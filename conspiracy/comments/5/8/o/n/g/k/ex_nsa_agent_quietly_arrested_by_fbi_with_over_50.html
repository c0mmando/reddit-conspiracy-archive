He was quietly arrested by the FBI less than 2 months ago in possession of 50 TB of NSA / intelligence data. He is now being charged with the espionage act.</p>

<p>NSA whistleblower William Binney claims the NSA already had all of these Wikileaks emails captured on their servers. He asserts that Wikileaks source is most likely not Russia but a disgruntled intelligence community employee. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While spooks are customarily psychopathic, they&#39;re also usually smart.  Given the amount of chaos that&#39;s been going on lately, I suspect a few of them are starting to realise which way the wind is blowing, and when the time comes, they probably want to be able to say that they were on the winning team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if Martin was leaking NSA docs to Wiki-Leaks then they would be releasing much more interesting material than they have been.</p>

<p>The &quot;leaks&quot; have been exclusively political in nature for the last many months, no reason they would need Martin of the NSA for that.  Furthermore:</p>

<p>1) Wiki-Leaks doesn&#39;t pay well for information, if they pay at all.
2) Martin does not strike me, or anyone who has reported on him so far, as being ideological or strongly motivated by politics and morals.
3) He has been hoarding these documents for up to 20 years.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t think Martin had a clear-cut plan for his stolen documents.  I think it&#39;s likely he was building himself something of a retirement fund and was planning to cash out when the time was right.</p>

<p>If true, sounds like taking after J.E. Hoover and keeping blackmail documents on his co-workers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good to consider what&#39;s going on here...nice post!</p>

<p>Here is the NYT&#39;s article on this situation.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/us/harold-martin-nsa.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/us/harold-martin-nsa.html?_r=0</a></p>

<p>It seems this Martin was highly patriotic but not political at all. I don&#39;t get the impression he&#39;d leak anything, and so far the investigation seems to say he didn&#39;t leak stuff.  Of course they are all talking about the hacking tools that ended up for sale online. The guy had 50TB of info. That&#39;s equivalent to 50 million books!!! I just can&#39;t imagine that much secret gov info in one guys garage.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a small cardboard box full of data. No garage needed.</p>
