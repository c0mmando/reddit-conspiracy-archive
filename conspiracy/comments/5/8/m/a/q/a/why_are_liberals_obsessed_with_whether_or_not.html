And perhaps they&#39;re trying to condition the public that he should immediately accept the results, so if/when the evidence that they committed fraud to win arises, and Trump starts to raise hell, they can then go, &quot;We&#39;ve been telling you for weeks he would do this! See, we told you he would be a sore loser!&quot; And perhaps millions of sheeple, instead of looking at evidence of voter fraud, would go, &quot;Shit, they did tell us he wouldn&#39;t accept the election results if he lost, and they were right!&quot; Maybe this is a little far-fetched, but why else would they be so obsessed with this? If there&#39;s no voter fraud, then of course he would accept the results should he lose. Why wouldn&#39;t he?</p>

Yes,  I know his legacy is already a treasonous criminal,  but still,  when was the last time you can remember when the day following the rigged outcome of a federal election (Hillary announced as next president) that there was bloodshed in the streets being a likely outcome?</p>

Typically the anger &amp; hate is saved for when the president leaves office. So why, why would we have such an unliked candidate in? Is it because s/he must do something so heinous that a typically liked person would never do such a deed or that we are in for such a (planned) bad collapse that the world will never be the same  .... ever? What ever is planned post-inauguration, it does not look beneficial to the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It truly frightens them when anyone points out the obvious... that the system is rigged. Because that is one frightening slippery slope, or tipping point, for the establishment. If the masses come to realize how badly it&#39;s rigged against them, things will have to change. Possibly (likely) violently.</p>

<p>Both establishment parties are used to the idea that the system is rigged, and the loser always bows to the winner. Gore walked away from further challenging Bush Jr, because that is what they do.</p>

<p>This is a different scenario in that sense. Trump isn&#39;t establishment. Neither is Sanders. Or Rand and Ron Paul. etc. There are enough disenfranchised Sanders and Trump supporters, as well as current and past third party candidate supporters that are now very well versed and fully cognizant on how their candidates were squashed by the rigged system. We are that much closer to a critical mass for a revolution.</p>

<p>They really need to nip this in the bud as much as possible. It&#39;s desperation time. When the masses realize how rigged the system is, the establishment parties are screwed.</p>

<p>For the establishment, failure is simply not an option. But winning against Trump and Sanders and third party candidates, this year, is exposing their rigging of the system to many new tens of millions of voters.</p>

<p>Trump and Sanders got 27 million votes between them in the primaries. Add third party supporters to that and we have at least 30 million, and those are just the people who participated in the primaries. It could be as high as 40 or 50 million or more who now know unequivocally that the system is rigged. 125 million voted in the last presidential election.</p>

<p>So imagine half, or likely much more than half of all voters in the country coming to the awful realization that their vote meant nothing. That the system is really and truly rigged. That their democratic system is utter bullshit. Imagine the whole country, the US of A, land of the free, realizing that they do not have a functioning democratic system.</p>

<p>The realization and recognition of this establishment power conspiracy is no longer limited to the fringe, it is entering the mainstream. And every time Trump repeats it, more people hear about it.</p>

<p>How does a country fix this? The establishment will not go quietly into the night. They have to win. They HAVE to win. Meanwhile, we the people, can&#39;t sit still anymore. We have to do something. </p>

<p>But the powers that be will not just hand over the power quietly. They worked hard to get into these positions. Dictators do not become dictators by just giving up and walking away. They will never have this power again, if they walk away from it. They will have to fight for it tooth and nail with all the resources they can muster. Which are considerable. And very frightening.</p>

<p>We, the people, will have no choice but to wrest this power from their cold dead hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why ask a question if there is only one answer you will accept? It should have been phrased as a directive, ie:</p>

<p>&quot;Despite evidence that the DNC screwed Bernie Sanders, and will probably do the same to you, we expect you to accept the outcome of the vote, regardless of how suspect the totals. We expect you to play along and act as if we still have free and fair elections, so we can continue to dupe the population.  Is that clear?&quot;</p>

<p>That is what Chris Wallace was really saying. And the MSM doesn&#39;t like it that Trump essentially answered, &quot;No, it&#39;s not clear. I&#39;ll evaluate and decide at the time.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re clearly trying to make the notion of election fraud an absurdity. Most often, I&#39;ve seen references to how rare voter fraud really is.</p>

<p>But not ONE of these mainstream articles has mentioned the electronic voting machines. They&#39;re acting as if the only concern is people going in to vote more than once, when that is FAR from the biggest concern. You can send in tens of thousands of voters multiple times, but it will have zero impact if the machines simply change the votes at the time of counting. Especially in the states with no paper ballots.</p>

<p>Russia was blamed for the DNC hacks and for meddling in the &quot;election process.&quot; I&#39;m not sure how hacking DNC e-mails hurts the integrity of our election process, but by saying so, they&#39;ve implied that elections are indeed hackable. If that&#39;s the case - then why not just use paper balloting? They would rather risk starting WWIII with Russia than just using an electoral process that can be re-counted and proven?</p>

<p>The whole narrative is counter-intuitive, and how one couldn&#39;t see through it, I have no idea. This election day will certainly be interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it undermines our democratic process, and sets a dangerous precedent for future elections. I still can&#39;t believe voter fraud is still something we are discussing, the amount of voter fraud needed to sway a presidential election would be unprecedented and is unrealistic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a liberal by the way so maybe I&#39;m not qualified to answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IF the amount of voter fraud needed to sway a presidential election would be unprecedented and is unrealistic, then why do Democrats even bother helping illegal immigrants obtain ID&#39;s and pay stubs so they can register to vote? And why are they constantly fighting to abolish the need to have to show ID at the polls? And how often do politicians win in a landslide? Most often, people only win by a small margin. So getting illegals to vote, getting people to vote multiple times, getting people to vote under the name of someone who is deceased, etc, can most definitely have an impact on an election. And if electronic voting machines occasionally &quot;malfunction&quot; and switch people&#39;s votes, that can have an impact as well. By the way, did you not see the Veritas videos?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this sub just another right wing nut job sub? Liberals aren&#39;t scared of Trump. It&#39;s very obvious he will lose by a landslide because he&#39;s a moron.  Hillary is a corrupt piece of shit yet Trump manages to be even worse. If you required heart surgery and only had two options, a surgeon with malpractice charges, or the manager of McDonald&#39;s, who would you choose?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What he said is an assault on democracy itself... the idea that an election result is binding on both sides is fundamental to the democratic process. He cannot say he&#39;ll only accept the result if he wins... that is the beginning of a fascist dictatorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems very trivial to me. He&#39;s only hinting that he won&#39;t accept it if there is evidence of voter fraud, in which case, he shouldn&#39;t accept it, and neither should we. There is evidence that Hillary herself is paying people to rig elections with voter fraud. THAT is a huge threat to democracy.</p>
