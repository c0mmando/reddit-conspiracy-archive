       There's hardly any. Nazi Germany was national socialist and actually tried to get OUT of the globalist capitalist international banking cabal. Completely the opposite of the US

       Very true, in National Socialist Germany all war profits were required to go back to the state thus killing war profiteering, I don't think anyone would ever disagree with such a policy. Unfettered capitalism is just as bad as communism in some respects.

       Same? No not same. Similar. Plus communism is a pipe dream, socialism however is achievable.
And anyway current problems of EU are not even really due to economy. Some of the problems sure but the socio-cultural bomb is far more serious

       Some people perceive the earth is flat. Does that make it reality? To them maybe.

       It's simply a fact that WW2 was Nationalism vs Global financial powers. I never even said it was as simple as good guys vs bad guys, there's never an innocent party in any war. If that's how the guy interpreted what i said he's too far gone for me.

       Well, if you consider a globalist corporation being in the Kremlin winning, then im not sure who you think is in charge here. Yes, they're surrounded but they're making more moves every day. They were even discussing moving nukes to Cuba again. It's not as cut and dry as you'd think, especially when Americas entire way of life is propped up on a crippled economy like the USSRs was before collapse.

       It was called national socialist party, but hitler's politics were far from socialist. It's this impression of socialism that the US capitalised on to get the population to be scared of socialism, like it did with communism in the USSR. Unfortunate really. But at least bernie could lift the veil for some people on socialism during his run before hillary fucked him.

       People have a natural tendency to want to impose their standards onto others.  That creates most of the conflict we experience.  They do not even realize, or care, they are doing it.

       You are right.  We just want to be left alone so we can lead our own happy lives without being bothered by the assholes.  The assholes have a weakness where they are hollow inside, and can only derive a feeling of satisfaction by controlling others.  They lead a pathetic existence, but we have to deal with them.  I could be working in my garden, hiking, fishing, etc. instead of wasting my time dealing with the assholes.

       They actually funded Hitler, and were doing very nicely until the little Corporal thought to open up two fronts.  Germany declared war on the US, not the other way around.  FDR wanted to declare war on Germany before Pearl Harbor, but he was prevented from doing so.

       yup, its a vicious cycle: spend TONS of money building up army, driving debt up and requiring more manipulative monetary policy (like quantitative easing) to cook the books enough for the public. As a result, using our money becomes less appealing to the rest of the world (cuz they don't get the QE money as directly) and more of them start talking about using something less manipulated. So we threaten to use, or in some cases actually use, our massive military to get them in line, thus driving a need for more military superiority, taking us back to step one.
      </p>
      <p>
       now just consider the huge difference between the dollars being spent on defense and the effectiveness to achieve actual defense it buys, caused by all of the corruption and no bid contracts and cost plus contracts because of the completely "above the law" atmosphere surrounding the DOD as a result of the above situation, and you've got our situation right now.

       Libya was building up for the 'Afrodollar', and eventually an 'EU' of the Africas, it would have enabled them to start to throw off the western imperialism that chokes African development.
      </p>
      <p>
       western economists and statisticians under the sway of politicians always claim Africa is overpopulated, a gross lie unless you want to genocide any remaining Africans...
      </p>
      <p>
       they have the biggest land mass area, the lowest population density and massive undeveloped mineral resources and massive arable land potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       the overpopulated bit just is a sly reference at Africans doing things for Africans not Westerners.

       It's not a thousand year event. Human generations run in a cycle like the seasons of the year. The only thing that can prevent history from repeating itself like clockwork is a universal lockdown straight out of 1984. Which was, interestingly enough, the entire reason why the inner party did what they did. The high want to stay high forever, the middle want to overthrow the high, and the low want everyone to be equal.

       Well yeah, we are all stuck in it. We need our scrip to buy food and shelter. Hell, I can't even leave my job where I haven't had a raise in 2 years because nobody else is hiring and we have no real social safety net to speak of. In America, for the working class, abject poverty is always a possibility. Play along or starve. Or get shot and called a terrorist or rioter by the media, or simply disappeared by a 3 letter agency, should you decide to fight the system.

       I am just fine with the whole thing collapsing - which can happen easily if everyone gets on the same page of starting over and disregards their debts and use of usd. The people I am referring to as stuck are most likely people with children; who might be willing to risk their own life, but wouldn't dare to risk their child's or even separation from said child. Everything you use as an excuse for being stuck is actually you just being lazy and not wanting to start over from scratch. An 8th of the country is public blm land - which doesn't even count the national forrests. The majority of it contains edible plants and plenty of animals. You have another option than playing along or starving, but you are comfortable and lazy.

       The government is not going to allow you to freely live on public land. If you want to live off the grid unmolested, you have you own the land, and that is not foolproof, see Waco TX or Ruby Ridge.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... to prepare for any collapse you still need to work within the system. You still need money (land and supplies aren't cheap), and to get money you need to make money and you can't do that unless you live near a place of employment, which there are very few out in the middle of nowhere, so again, it has been made prohibitively difficult to get free of this system.

       If you lived in a rural area you would realize that there aren't people policing the forests aside from the tourist/camping areas which have road access. I tell you this as someone who has walked upon gigantic pot grows year after year in the same locations.

       Hell, recently in my neck of the woods, a hiker went missing. During the search of the woods for him, a SAR member was shot by an unknown person. As a result, helicopters from 5 or 6 sheriff departments using infra-red/heat sensing, swat teams, and an armored personnel carrier were used for 3 days - 24hrs/day. They pulled out after 3 days because none of the cops were physically able to hike the woods. 3 of those searching for the shooter had to be air-lifted out due to hurting themselves. They never found him.

       What I'm saying is: The government only has the resources to patrol in area's of high population density. But based on your replies, you seems like someone who hasn't even thought about the idea of providing for yourself - you 'still need money and job'.  Which begs the question, as someone who 'see's it', how do you feel about continuing to support 'it'?

       Bitcoin was never supposed to be untraceable. The entire concept is based off of a public open ledger.

       You might know but maybe others dont. It goes well beyond money. They are unimaginably rich. What this comes down to is war and conflict. These (not all) families are commanding national armies against one another. You could liken it to a board game, where they feel like they are playing God. It's a power trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money and the defence contractor companies making war machines is just a by-product or necessary set of tools for their sick games. It goes beyond this too, but I'll hold off on that narrative until more evidence is released.

       There is no direct proof that the Rothschild's own these Central Banks.  It is important to know that all these banks operate under the same Monetary system called the Basel Accord.  The Basel accord is put out by the Bank for International Settlements, which is basically the world reserve bank, or Central bank of Central banks.    So, the Rothschild's don't directly own any of those Central Banks, but it is very likely that they exert a lot of control over BIS policy, which in turn effects the Central Banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschild's don't "own" the world in the sense of owning property.  But you can thank them and a bunch of other old banking families for enacting this parasitic banking scam on most of the world.  Every country that joins the Basel Accord very quickly begins an unstoppable debt spiral due to the compounding interest they have to pay on their budgets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really wanted to follow the money to the "owners" you'd have to find the largest government bond holders, who "own" the debt a government has to pay back at interest.  The bond market is huge and for-profit, which is the crux of the whole dilemna.  Some of the largest holders of Government debt are large financial institutions, holding companies like Blackrock, private individuals, and other countries like China.

       This is a hoax that was started around 2005.

      <p>
       The truth is almost the opposite. There are actually only eight countries with central banks that have
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       form of private shareholders, and those have many restrictions: Belgium, Greece, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States.

       When you get to the bottom of it, if you care to, consider that the last two countries on earth who tried to initiate a gold standard currency were Iraq (in 2001-2002) and Libya (2004).

       I understood that Iraq stopped using the petrodollar as the first step toward a gold backed currency for the middle east. However, I can only find info pertaining to his rejection of the petrodollar right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lybia for sure was initiating a gold backed currency. It was referenced in the Podesta emails, even.

       It only doesn't make sense because everyone has been conditioned to think that the Federal Reserve and it's Chapters are crown corporations without actually saying that. What proof do you want, Jacob Rothschild to say it on national TV? Ain't gonna happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       You and
       <a href="/u/r1ddler">
        /u/r1ddler
       </a>
       should check out "Creature from Jekyll island". This author researched the fact that JP Morgan, Rothschild's great grandfather, Warburg and one or two others co-signed the Fed into existence (part ownership in other words), and then they got the president at the time to create the income tax laws as well, around 1913. From there, their sons and daughters have been trading various national assets (most countries, not just US based) and companies like monopoly game pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
       ANOTHER tidbit, you think the UN represents international interests? David Rockefeller (richest man alive in the late 1800's, steel magnate) bought and donated the land that the UNs headquarters sits on. Tit for tat as they say. It's shocking but true.

       It's not privately owned, it's just overly complicated so people will try to simplify it by saying one person or one group owns it. There's seriously a lot to it, which is understandable since it's the biggest financial institution in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it like a spiders web. Some strands are controlled by private groups, some are controlled by the government. It's big and sticky. Is there corruption involved? Probably. Is it just one giant conspiracy? Probably not.

       If by "Call Shenanigans." you actually mean "Revolt.", then yes.  It is a pretty simple solution indeed.

      <p>
       And by "Revolt.", I don't mean be stupid and unintelligent and violent and chaotic.  Absolutely not.  I mean be smart, come together, move away from state propaganda that divides the populace racially, politically, etc, and all support one another as everyone moves together against the shit system.

       Keep spreading the word about
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       hating each other and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       falling into negative, racist perspectives, and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       vying toward stupid, divisionist propaganda.  At the very least, be a beacon of what you want to see - and if others are around, they’ll see it as well and be directly or indirectly influenced by your actions.
      </p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It’s definitely difficult - especially when you’re dealing with certain people who are so very ignorant that they really cling to racist mindsets.  However, the best you can do, it seems to me, is to - again - simply be the change you wish to see in the world.  That is the best influence you can have on others and on the world around you.
       <em>
        Be
       </em>
       what you want/what you feel - be that “right action” regardless of what others are doing or thinking around you.

       Absolutely wrong. You think the value of the paper a $100 bill is printed on is worth $100? USD is backed by consumer faith in its value, nothing else. We have been off the gold standard for a long time.

       The scam of money creation is if only the "principle" is created then how can we ever pay off the added interest on top. We cant. Money is Debt. The insidious exploitive nature of interest has dug our oblivious infinite growth capitalist society into a $152 trillion whole that just insists on solving inflation with more inflation while denying its consequences in its disparities. As a result, the dollar has been debased 96% in the last 70 years.  Thus why poverty and unrest will drastically increase and the already small pockets of wealth will begin to slowly recede. Money is "legal tender", it's value is contrived as with all of economics.

       I'm not talking about production cost, but the material itself.
The coin has to be worth the value of the material.
If the coin itself costs significantly more than the material/metal that is built of, then someone can make machine that will stamp/copy the coins using the metal as an input. And nobody can stop you or detect you since there's no serial number or other tricky stuff as in cotton (paper) money.
      </p>
      <p>
       And vice-versa, if the metal costs more than the coin, then you can melt the coins and make a profit out of them selling the material.

       Yes, 100 pennies contains $2.50 in copper iirc. But defacing currency is a crime, and you'd need a lot of pennies to make it with while. And need to sell to someone who doesn't ask questions. While also getting the zinc out.

       Pennies are the only ones more expensive than their worth. Unless I'm mistaken, you're saying to take/buy pennies, and sell them for material value.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you'll be caught because you'll need to do it in bulk to get profit from it. You'll be the guy going to banks asking for pennies. Like, you'll need thousands...

       <em>
        see

       whats happening, in a really simple way. Not preach about how its a farce, just show people how it works. Eventually, people might look into it a little more, or at least ask questions... I mean; I over-heard people talking about the Earth being flat the other day!?!?! Some crap on Facebook. So if that can spread, why not a message about "how money is made"

       Bit different. Science has told us the earth is not flat. The banking system and how it works is only told to a few, and to those that try and find out. In school (age 3-16) you will be taught the world is a sphere, without the need to go out and actively hunt for the information, you will not be told how central banking systems work.

      <p>
       Laying the system out in a simple manner

       just spark conversation on the subject. With any luck, it will catch on, and people will take the time to think about it and then research it

       Exactly... from age 3-18 you were indoctrinated into the idea that the world is a sphere by a system that "did the experiments and just knows". So you don't even question it or want to question it because it sounds plausible and widely accepted and people "smarter" than you vouch for it so why even question it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The same system indoctrinates the population to believe that their only way to get ahead in life is borrow money to get an education to get a job to pay off their debt and hopefully save enough over the years to retire someday. People don't want to question it because it's almost exclusively accepted by the population and a plausible system that seems to works because people "smarter" than them vouch for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the possibility that the earth is flat a fat chance.. yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it plausible based on observations and evidence.. yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But people laugh it off without a glance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a possibility that the banking system could be comprised of a massive conspiracy meant to fuck anyone but the 1 percenters .. yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it just as equally a fat chance.. yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why it's important to consume ALL available info unbiasedly and come up with your own conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolute truths are rare, if not impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't think that any topic isn't worth investigating (in an unbiased light) before coming to your own conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't think that any "reputable sources" can be trusted without the same unbiased investigation.

       Yeah I can see what you mean, on your other comments too.

      <p>
       On a side note; what can we do and hope for? Even if we could get a few million people to look at this situation, would it change? New process and systems would need to be created, and the people who create them wouldn't want a change. Feels like an endless circle until we/the majority just give up and stop. E.g.; majority of people declare themselves bankrupt, majority of people just stop paying and creating debt. Perhaps change would have to come once enough people just give up and get off the hamster wheel in unison.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the alternative to what we have now? Trading skill for skill? Make everything free and aim to automate/use technology for the jobs people do not want, and allow the people to work on the things they love? Once the idea of money changes, what can we replace it with, if anything? (Not expecting you to have the answers lol, I'm just interested in hearing people's alternatives)

      <h2>
       Great reply. I love your point of view.
      </h2>
      <p>
       Sorry in advance for the rant.
First off, I like you u/action_turtle.
You have a sense of curiosity and patience for the opinions of others that most people (Read: Americans) lack these days.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       My opinion:
      </p>
      <p>
       Look to history.
Look to history for all/every answer.
Look at the constant slave culture continually forced upon the masses. Not just in American History, (which has been SEVERELY overplayed) but throughout all of history. Slavery was formed well before color segregation. Black African rulers are the ones who sold off their people knowing damn well what they were doing. Social class has dictated individual rights throughout history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before that it was about war. Tribe A slaughtered Tribe B which, by societies rules of the day, forced Tribe B's citizens into slavery (Yet hardly resembled the institution of slavery we have grown up learning about.). Slavery has been a part of human nature as long as human nature itself. Just think about how the classic high school geek/bully relationship would have played itself out 1500 years ago (or 3000 years ago).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Yet today, we act like in this age the world has somehow suddenly changed from the history we've been taught to some "Magical 21st Century land, where everything is just peachy!" We think the 21st century is somehow different, that people are less barbaric and life is less violent/.chaotic. For those of you that boarded this coo-coo train, let me tell you, your life has (and is) been censored for generations. Outside of LALA fairy tale land, the world has remained the same, violent, chaotic, and perverse as ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       So tell me, if slaves are no longer held in chains in this new, revolutionary day in age, yet the history (especially great multi-century societies) of the world proves societies have been built upon slaves, then who's been filling that void for the past 100+ years?
The greatest trick the Devil evil pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Hmmm???
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's examine the tactics used by repressive societies, both past and present, and see if we can apply it to today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast quantity of slaves that Egyptians oppressed were routinely worked to death, yet it was one of the most revolutionary civilizations in history. (How high is the US retirement age now?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how about the vast majority of North Koreans that would, TODAY, undoubted admit to being a free(er) citizen (than you) with the GODLY privilege to be ruled by the greatest leaders of ALL TIME. ("MURICA IS #1! BCAUS FK U THTS Y!")
      </p>
      <p>
       'Just feed them, clothe them, and make sure they enjoy being entertained more than they hate being slaves."
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and how slavery has evolved. The rest of the shit the poor maggots bitch about just works itself out on it's own when they realize fighting the bureaucracy is more energy than just living how we tell them to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the beauty of this is: we have more food, clothes, and entertainment than any time in 'recorded' history! The poor are so content with their belongings and ease of life that they pay no attention to those forces manipulating the "Actual world around them".
      </p>
      <p>

       Look at the reasoning's behind (not just the actual propaganda) the mainstream agendas they feed to the public on a daily basis. Why do they choose to bombard you with certain ideas, while never even mentioning ideas of equal or greater importance?

       Read 'Eastern Standard Tribe: by Cory Doctorow.
      </p>
      <p>
       It by no means will blow your mind, but it's a fun read and is a great representation of society today...
      </p>
      <p>
       My favorite passage:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       "Western medicine is based on corpses, things that you discover by cutting 
up dead bodies and pulling them apart. Eastern medicine is based on living 
flesh, things observed from vital, moving humans," ...
      </p>
      <p>
       "The difference between Eastern medicine and Western medicine is the 
dissection versus the observation of the thing in motion. The difference 
between reading a story and studying a story is the difference between 
living the story and killing the story and looking at its guts. School! We sat in 
English class and we dissected the stories that I'd escaped into, laid 
open their abdomens and tagged their organs, covered their genitals
 with polite sterile drapes, recorded dutiful notes
       <em>
        en masse
       </em>
       that told 
us what the story was about, but never what the story
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       . Stories 
are propaganda, virii that slide past your critical immune system and
 insert themselves directly into your emotions. Kill them and cut them
 open and they're as naked as a nightclub in daylight."

      <p>
       So to give some insight to some of your questions, I only really see 3 options:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Make and implement a better system with the mass majority and a plan to implement it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Live within the system as an ignorant, but 'happy' slave.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Find your own way to live outside the system. (My personal fave)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       TL;DR
      </p>
      <p>
       The world has run the way the world has run for thousands of years. You can choose smarts and dissect the way the system works, or choose happiness and follow the rules the system lays out. But to think a revolt or call for change in the system will end in anything more than a propagandized form of the very same system would take more than any hypothetical I've ever been able to think up...
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it, you're right on track. Money and debt is an abstract construct based on the faith of the populace. It would take a unified effort to make any real change. The only way I see it is replacing the system all together. The means by which, I could only speculate.
      </p>

       Sorry for the late reply, family weekend. thanks for the nice words and response.

        Slavery was formed well before color segregation. Black African rulers are the ones who sold off their people knowing damn well what they were doing. Social class has dictated individual rights throughout history ... forced Tribe B's citizens into slavery (Yet hardly resembled the institution of slavery we have grown up learning about.) ... The vast quantity of slaves that Egyptians oppressed were routinely worked to death, yet it was one of the most revolutionary civilizations in history. (How high is the US retirement age now?)

      <p>
       Interesting you pointed these bits out. I have been watching a lot of pyramid building documentaries (they amaze ever since visiting them). One theory was that the 'slaves', as we call them, were actually working as a form of taxation. Pharos gathered people from around the lands to come and work on the project, and then sent them back home once they had worked the tax off. Age didn't really play much of a role, "if you can lift, you can work", attitude. Made me chuckle, as I think of how we have now come full circle, and are effectively doing the same thing today. Another reason this money system is hard to break, perhaps the idea of owing to those above us is baked into us, as a humanity? Cleaner version of sacrifice...
      </p>

        We think the 21st century is somehow different, that people are less barbaric and life is less violent/.chaotic. For those of you that boarded this coo-coo train, let me tell you, your life has (and is) been censored for generations. Outside of LALA fairy tale land, the world has remained the same, violent, chaotic, and perverse as ever.

       Spot on, this is a huge problem in this world. The view that we are now "civilised" drives me crazy. We have not changed as a species, we just have methods to hide it.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here is why it took me so long to see the problem, perhaps others struggle with this too. Who cares?
       <em>
        I'm
       </em>
       happy, have homes, cars, clothes, food, gadgets and everything I want ("need"). I'm playing the game, i hate the rules, but i'm currently "winning", so just carry on. What made me question it? - I visited the USA, stayed in Hollywood/Beverly Hills, did all the tourist things you would expect. But I was taken back by seeing the homeless, then after walking a few minutes down the road i'm outside a store with $4,000 hand bags, see Ferrari's and Bentleys cruising the street, people walking dogs with little coats on that looked fancier than what most people wear... So, I asked myself how? How can these people have such different lives. Where does the money come from? How are people getting this wealth? How am I getting my wealth? How can I borrow money for houses and why should I? Why are the interest rates like they are? How do stocks and shares work? Whats Forex? What does the Bank of England actually do? And down the rabbit hole I went, so to speak...
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate your 3 options, 1 would be my preference. I feel people cannot live off the grid, we are way too reliant on others. We need a system of trading that allows people to swap something. Basically money, but in a new system. Less false. Perhaps link back to sliver and gold? Not sure (let down, i know lol). But the money / object we swap needs to have true value... Its so hard to explain, but as we have slipped into a world where people can no longer survive without others help, we need something to barter with that not skill based. I build websites, I cannot trade that for a car, I have to trade it for something else that I can then trade for a car. Of course, thats money, but money is no longer issued in a sensible way, which is the real issue. We could argue that i don't need the car, which is true. But then, what am i doing here? We need to do something in this short life, and why not have something nice that you enjoy?
      </p>
      <p>
       So brings be to the sad final point; Would the earth handle another system? Do humans
       <strong>
        need
       </strong>
       this now false hierarchy? With all the tech and advances in life we have, is money the only thing we have left to say who's "better" (shit term, hate saying it, but people really do think money = better)? Are we that shallow that we need to see who's got more stuff to understand who's the best, and who's not? Is this why money, in this daft format, is still hanging around? Can we ever change the system, when the inner-self of the majority love the system they are in? Perhaps this is what I find the most frustrating and disappointing about our current situation...

       It gets MUCH worse than that. When you die you will be pulled into the "Fake Heaven" which is actually an Astral Holding Area. After a period you will be judged by the "Archons". They will then say you must return for "More Lessons" and to remove "Karmic Debt". Both are complete scams. Your memories will be erased and you will be reinserted into this hellhole. We are used over and over as "Energy Slaves". The Archons are Parasites, and the Earth Global Elite work for them..  Google: 1)Archons White Light 2)Archons Reincarnation 3)Archons Lords Of Karma 4)Archons Reptilians 5) White Light Trap 6)Gnostics Archons 7)Illuminati Archons 8)Illuminati Lords Of Karma 9)Reincarnation Memory Erase. If you take them time and google search all these, you will come across a large amount of information..

       No, they aren't. But they do have security teams that rival the detail around the President.

       I am starting to think that they should be removed somehow. Either by your method or some other. It seems like their continued existence is to the detriment of the rest of us and our planet.

       Well beyond the President's Secret Service. When they need them, these are the people that use "super soldiers". If you've ever heard of this, these families are basically their employers, but the soldiers probably don't even realize it. All actions, intel and decisions at that level are completely compartmentalized. And everyone thinks they are in the top level, no matter how low they are.

       If you were serious, you wouldn't be here. There's a chance I could be wrong, but statistically...I mean typically, according to patterns I've seen, I am choosing to deduce that, you aren't serious, which means you are here to push people to say and admit things, such as them agreeing with you. You could, say, have someome come in to agree with you, and see who upvotes and who downvotes.
You want to know what i think? That's why I am just laughing at you. I already say what I think on my blog. Maybe check there. You probably know where it is. Just google my name. Joshua Ray Jongema.
Have a nice day ;)

       I didn't mean to imply that the current chapter of human history is a direct following chapter in a book, but one that follows the plot of a chapter that was last written several chapters and a thousand or so pages (years) ago.

       Debasement of the value of a unit of currency is not a new thing; I highlighted Rome as an example for those gathering cliff notes.

       yup, its a vicious cycle: spend TONS of money building up army, driving debt up and requiring more manipulative monetary policy (like quantitative easing) to cook the books enough for the public. As a result, using our money becomes less appealing to the rest of the world (cuz they don't get the QE money as directly) and more of them start talking about using something less manipulated. So we threaten to use, or in some cases actually use, our massive military to get them in line, thus driving a need for more military superiority, taking us back to step one.

       now just consider the huge difference between the dollars being spent on defense and the effectiveness to achieve actual defense it buys, caused by all of the corruption and no bid contracts and cost plus contracts because of the completely "above the law" atmosphere surrounding the DOD as a result of the above situation, and you've got our situation right now.
