        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In reading the Wikileaks and Guccifer docs outlining the technologies in place for the voter ID system, I&#39;m beginning to believe a citizen database exists--it holds the following details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Name (census/passport/driver&#39;s license)</p></li>
<li><p>Age (census/passport/driver&#39;s license)</p></li>
<li><p>Address (census/driver&#39;s license)</p></li>
<li><p>Race (census)</p></li>
<li><p>Income (census/IRS)</p></li>
<li><p>Party affiliation (voter registration)</p></li>
<li><p>Voting activity (voter registration)</p></li>
<li><p>Picture (driver&#39;s license/passport)</p></li>
<li><p>Marital status (IRS/marriage records)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>All of this information is already stored in the DNC&#39;s voter database.</em></strong></p>

<p>But what I <em>also</em> think is happening is private corporations merging <em>their</em> information with this database. As we all know from the ToS that nobody reads, your data belongs to them. Not you. If corporations share such details, this database can include other things like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Social media handle</p></li>
<li><p>Email address (which if you&#39;ve ever been spammed by a politician, they already bought from <em>somewhere</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>Political involvement </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We see some companies agreeing to social media campaigns and integrating such data into NGP VAN. This is witnessed in RFPs in the Guccifer Docs, specifically, with Blue State Digital.  </p>

<p>This firm &quot;Blue State Digital is a digital strategy and technology firm that specializes in online fundraising, advocacy, social networking, and constituency development. It was founded by former staffers of Howard Dean&#39;s 2004 presidential campaign and provided digital strategy and technology services for the 2008 and 2012 Barack Obama presidential campaigns.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition, &quot;As a full-service new media agency, Blue State Digital develops and executes multi-platform digital marketing and online engagement campaigns for nonprofit and advocacy organizations, political candidates and causes, and brands and businesses.&quot;</p>

<p>This org managed the DNC&#39;s site and Obama&#39;s. </p>

<p>But also keep in mind that a huge feature of NGP VAN is the ability to &quot;data swap.&quot; This means, hypothetically, that companies interested in obtaining hyper-specific data (say, women age 50+ living in Wisconsin) can buy the data from the DNC and as part of the agreement, share their data in exchange for a discount. </p>

<p>Now, the DNC knows exactly how many women age 50+ watch Fox news at least 3x a night. </p>

<p>Per the Wikileaks emails, the DNC already data swaps with unions. This was in exchange for them going door-to-door and gathering voting preference details on what was estimated to be 56,000 voters. </p>

<p>Lastly... <strong><em>don&#39;t forget the NSA.</em></strong> Per the PRISM program, they have extensive info from social media sites like Facebook, Google, etc. If the voter ID files have your address, and the NSA has your ISP address, then putting those two together... the database may also have...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Consumer/purchasing habits</p></li>
<li><p>If required, browsing activity</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The government very likely has a comprehensive civilian database that can be tapped into at any time. </p>

<p>With Google&#39;s cozy relationship with Clinton, it&#39;s likely this database is being used for predictive modeling regarding the population&#39;s sentiments about political actions, statements, events, legislation, etc. The CIA claims they can already predict political instability 3-5 days out, so it&#39;s not a stretch to believe this database is being used for similar monitoring purposes about all kinds of issues. </p>

<p>Questions I don&#39;t know: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Who/which officials can access it</p></li>
<li><p>Why</p></li>
<li><p>How often</p></li>
<li><p>Under what circumstances</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And there&#39;s my theory. </p>

<p>remember the fear of RFID chipping people back in the 90&#39;s, well now we carry it around religiously, let it listen in on us, track our movement, get us to take pictures everywhere we and we fucking  charge it for them.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t dorget webcam video, voice, location/activity from mobile, social media activity, etc. It is also possible to measure, and also wIth this data PREDICT attitudes, preferences, moods/emotions, and behaviours. All sorts of other things are possible too, e.g., lie detection.</p>
