       I have gotten to the point where I don't really care who wins this election anymore... Our political process is a ridiculous shit show circus... I am currently only interested in watching this fucked up corrupt system burn to the ground.  GREED and CORRUPTION destroyed Rome and it will destroy America as well...

       Who knows?  However, the first step to curing this CORRUPTION is to raise awareness of the problem... Will people be outraged enough to fix it?  I doubt it...

       We just have to start putting corruption in terms people can understand. It's inefficiency, and it's money wasted. If I was a smarter man with more time I would make a nice info graphic showing how countries with high levels of corruption lead to lower wages and overall health of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every one understands the value of currency and power. It's all in the way we frame things to people. We can talk about corruption all day, but it's such a nebulous concept to most people, and almost every one has accepted that "money talks". Look at countries that have the most issues with corruption, what do they all have in common? They're third world countries where the daily wage wouldn't buy you a frappuccino.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we talk about corruption, we have to put it in terms of what people are losing. Why the hell are we paying people that aren't going to do our governing for us? Why are we letting people that govern us get away with stealing from us, and giving them the power to do so?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to stay strong in our convictions, and explain why corruption is so bad for everyone. We can't give validation to corruption in our government. We can't accept that as American citizens, we're just supposed to accept that there are separate rules for us and the Washington elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can we have a representative democracy if the people we elect to represent us are no longer under the control of the laws of the people? This is the most damaging thing to ever happen to our country. It wasn't a foreign power invading us that killed America. It was corruption, born and bred here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone selling you that Clinton is just another politician doing politician things is an enemy to the democratic ideals our country was founded on,  but they're doing it out of fear more than anything. Remind them that people used to not stand up for corruption in this country. We just about lynched Nixon for it, we can be better than our forefathers. Corruption means that the American citizen has no power. It means that government is not representative of the will of the people. I will never condone that. The opportunity this country has provided me to live a prosperous and just life was provided to me by the people that elected leaders to represent them in creating laws that were beneficial to all of the people. Now, it will be special interests writing the laws to help special interests. The people be damned. I will never vote for condoning or normalizing corruption.

       probably not, but it is entertaining to watch the corrupt bastards squirm a little bit.

       If I remember right from physics class, everything tends toward entropy.  So change will happen no matter what, in all things.

      <p>
       Not trying to sound like a smartass, but it was the thought I had thinking about your question.  I'm ready for change also, almost no matter what it brings.

       It really is dark humor.  Especially this election.  I do however feel anger that we are meant to believe their bullshit.  It's insulting.

       It's almost like the whole election is being produced like a reality TV show for our entertainment. I still put it at 50/50 that Trump is a Hillary plant, which gives us three possible terrible outcomes: 1) Hillary wins and the shadowy elite behind her campaign can grow and consolidate their power and corruption even more; 2) Trump wins but it turns out he was part of that same power cabal all along, so we get the same result; or 3) Trump really is standing on his own and manages to win, in which case the power cabal comes after him in every way imaginable. I see them instigating riots and unrest, international incidents, just constant fires for him to try to put out while they go about their shadowy dealings in the background and we're too caught up in the drama (reality TV-like experience) to notice.
