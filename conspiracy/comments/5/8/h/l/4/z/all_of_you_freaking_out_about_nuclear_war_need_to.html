<p>They WANT you to be fearing the possibility of being scorched daily so that you don&#39;t ask the hard questions.</p>

<p>The Cold War lasted 46 years.. no nukes.</p>

<p>They are all working together, the governments. They&#39;re in the same clubs, eat at the same restaurants, and fuck the same sex slaves.</p>

<p>The biggest thing you have to worry about is your conscience, which IS being carpet bombed daily by media, social pressures, and drugs (including but not limited to sugar and caffeine).</p>

<p>They want you alive, your much more valuable as a slave or energy for their machines then rotting in a nuclear wasteland.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen brother.  </p>

<p>I doubt any of those massive piles of nukes are even real.  More likely the trillions of dollars went to funding secret projects for a breakaway society we are now learning about.  Dr. Michael Salla is an expert on the subject and his website is here:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you remove a bandaid, do you slowly tear it away, ripping and rupturing skin? Or do you rip it off with such force that the shock to your cells forces them to quickly heal the affliction? </p>

<p>Two sides of the same coin my friend. </p>

<p>I&#39;m ready for the truth, I have had a glimpse of it for years and it is truly astounding. The universe is a magical place. </p>

<p>I can certainly understand why someone would be afraid to tell all of the &quot;mindless sheeple&quot; the truth. (These are human beings, not cattle; no offense to cattle; we treat animals as sub-beings when we shouldn&#39;t). </p>

<p>But that mindset, in my opinion is fearful and selfish. I&#39;m no better the ants beneath me feet; I just happen to be bigger, live longer, and think for myself. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all life. Life is precious. Each individual human MATTERS, and we have to fight for their right to true knowledge and understanding. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t just keep waiting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your on the money but your giving the elite far too much credit. They can&#39;t do ANYTHING unless it&#39;s done in secret, or based on a well put together lie.</p>

<p>We are on the rise, consciousness is exploding. Not just human consciousness but the planet itself and the flora and fauna; everything is reacting to what is being done. </p>

<p>The truth is we are NOT slaves and we can never BE slaves. It&#39;s all a prank on your soul. Your taking it very seriously right now, because you feel cut off from your soul, and that&#39;s the game. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t give them power, they have already enjoyed enough; take some power for yourself; and I really mean just think better about yourself and try to think more positively. </p>

<p>Visualize the world you want to see and dwell on IT! Not on being a &quot;wage slave&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cold war lasted 46 years because WWII was still fresh in the minds of the people. It wasn&#39;t until the late 80&#39;s that the propaganda machine started pushing for large scale war.</p>

<p>It is true that they are all working together. But in order for those in power to keep their oligarchy intact it requires culling of the herd periodically. Otherwise they eventually will have their heads removed through insurrection.</p>

<p>Slaves are valuable, that&#39;s true. But a slave who knows their true masters is dangerous to the established owners.</p>

<p>The elite play a different game than the slaves. They are looking at the long game and know that sacrifices must be made in order to preserve the ruling class. The world has been cast into dark ages many times before in order to keep the population in check.</p>

<p>These idiots in charge Do&#39;Bama and Hillary have screwed up the political landscape so much that Russia and China are moving AWAY from American Dollar as the World&#39;s Reserve Currency.

<p>If they were gonna do that they would have already. </p>

<p>A few examples.. </p>

<p>A) Russian invasion of Georgia 2008</p>

<p>B) Russian &quot;invasion&quot; of Crimea 2014 </p>

<p>C) Syrain Civil War 2011-present </p>

<p>Yes tensions are high, but they&#39;re also a facade. China is our biggest customer and we&#39;re THIER biggest customer. The last thing anyone wants is a war. Human beings are good like that, we&#39;d rather see our fellow man succeed than suffer. </p>

<p>They prey on our good will by scaring us with the prospect of war. How many soldiers mutinied or spoke out against the Iraq War? Thousands. </p>

<p>How man will mutiny if we invade Russia and start World War III just to keep our economy afloat? Millions. </p>

<p>Give humanity more credit. The bankers and politicians and CEOs may have tricked us but hey ultimately fucked themselves too, were all connected to this planet and severing our connection with it will be catastrophic for EVERYONE.</p>
