       West arms and funds rebel groups in Syria. Russia funds and arms the Assad government. Huge civil war breaks out. US and Russia bomb Syria. Millions of people dislocated. Go to Europe and USA. Break down social structure and foment hatred to create divisiveness and chaos. People are mad. Government harnesses that anger and points it toward Assad and Russia, all the while continuing to escalate things in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are dumb if they vote for warmongers like Clinton or Trump, because it will only escalate the problem. And yes, Trump is pro-war because he's pro-Zionist ideology and they're the ones who designed this war.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/581jvu/proof_trump_is_a_zionist/">
        Just read his AIPAC speech.
       </a>
       Stein is literally the only anti-war option. But she's being ignored, because people don't understand how this conflict works, and they're too busy laughing at her for minor faux-pas while we vote for a war to kill hundreds of thousands.

       One correction.

      <p>
       The war in Syria is not a civil war when the majority of the opposition forces are in fact foreigners.  It was an invasion of terrorists through a NATO country.  This alone should be absolutely reprehensible.

       Good point. I only say civil war because that's the way it's framed. It's really a proxy war, with Russia on the Syrian government side, and the US funding and arming the other sides, which includes the use of mercenaries

       I don't think Syria was intended to be a proxy war at all, rather, it is a part of a grand scheme to restructure the political landscape of the Middle East region.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia did not become involved in Iraq, and I think that their keen interest in Syria came as something of a surprise to the US, Israel, and other actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main thrust began with the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, but that was only phase 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just prior to the US assault on Iraq, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon publicly stated the broader scope of the "mission":

         Sharon Says U.S. Should Also Disarm Iran, Libya and Syria
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said yesterday that Iran, Libya and Syria should be stripped of weapons of mass destruction after Iraq. "These are irresponsible states, which must be disarmed of weapons mass destruction, and a successful American move in Iraq as a model will make that easier to achieve," Sharon said to a visiting delegation of American congressmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sharon told the congressmen that Israel was not involved in the war with Iraq "but the American action is of vital importance."
      </p>
      <p>
       In a meeting with U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton yesterday, Sharon said that Israel was concerned about the security threat posed by Iran, and stressed that it was important to deal with Iran even while American attention was focused on Iraq.

      <p>
       I agree they expected to overthrow Syria much more easily than it's been, they didn't expect Russia to stand up against them so strongly. But I don't think anyone involved in making this policy is at all surprised it turned in to a proxy war. It's just like Afghanistan in the 70s. They knew there was a good chance it would go like this, and they were prepared to arm and fund the "moderate rebels"  to overthrow assad, and I'm sure they were not suprirsed to see Russia do the same on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they want the war to end, they want to overthrow assad, but I also think the proxy war thing is not very far outside the original plan. That's just my 2 cents.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is of course a long-term plan to create "Greater Israel" which involves all the countries you listed, as well as Syria and Jordan and Lebanon and Palestine, and Iran. So I expect to see once they have completed military action in Syria, they will move on to Iran as the next step, because they want to overthrow that government again, like they did in 1954 but then lost it in 1979.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say the proxy war thing is
       <em>
        integral
       </em>
       to their plan to re-shape the political landscape of the middle east, rather than an unintended side effect. However they want to win sooner rather than later, I won't debate that. They're more interested in winning than war for the sake of war, but the instant they win they start another war because 1/4th of the US economy is the military-industrial complex and the war machine must keep rolling to keep the economy afloat.

       You are correct. The operation in Syria was planned by outsiders, intended to be a coup, disguised as a "revolution".
      </p>
      <p>
       On live French television, Roland Dumas, former Foreign Minister of France, provided a candid explanation of how the whole mess in Syria began, along who planned it and when. He also identifies the primary political beneficiary.

       I keep being told "I can't believe you're voting for Johnson.  Don't you know a vote for him is a vote for Clinton/Trump?!"  I won't have my vote held hostage on the fear of who is worse.  We need to break this cycle of shit (not just POTUS) candidates.  Everyone complains about politicians until it's time to step up, and they all fall in line, as expected.  I'm not a great fan of Johnson either, but there's a lot of slag to pull out of the pool before we get to the good stuff.

       That's funny, this election year has really affirmed for me how little voting actually changes things.  And we are in the middle of civilizations-wide emergency with climate change that isn't going to tech-fixed, especially now that the methane is leaking from the Arctic.

       My whole thing is this: Voting 3rd party won't change anything in this election as it wouldn't provide a big/strong enough 3rd party for any near future change, plus there is no chance of any 3rd party victory in this current election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings is down to the last 2 people, and of both of them, it is clear via logic/reason, research, and conscience that Trump is the way to go compared to a globalist sellout murderer crooked liar.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I am all for a massive 3rd party and if there was someone who had a chance and was in the 3 debates and was on point for what I stand for, I'd be all for it. Fortunately seeing a number of repubs be against Trump show's me that he's really not part of any party

       You're right, there is 0 chance for 3rd party to win, but if enough votes are cast for them, then perhaps they can be legitimized.  Maybe...just maybe every voter being fooled by game theory will begin to think, "we do have a chance."  The reason 3rd party doesn't get elected in our shit First Past the Post ballot, is because they're too afraid of the other candidate they like even less actually winning.  This is bullshit.  Ideally, it would be great if we could cast an alternate vote candidate.  Shit in 1 hand, wish in the other.

       This needs to happen outside of this election though. It needs to get organized, grow, pull in massive numbers and be organized into a well funded committee like you see with the DNC/GOP, instead of one person like Stein or Johnson.
      </p>

       When you are organized like that, then you force a massive change in the 2 party system

       Agreed, its specifically designed so that you only have 2 shitty choices, both of which are either puppets, or if one isn't (like I don't think trump is) then you spew shit about him through a dnc-controlled MSM propaganda machine to better your chances.

       Of course the machines are already rigged and there is massive voter fraud going on as we speak by the DNC (Bussing in people to vote under various names by the thousands across counties, destroying paper and mail in votes, and other scams). So Hitlery it is and votes don't even count because of the scams

       The realistic goal of voting 3rd party is to get their names into the public sphere.  If a candidate gets 1% this election, they will stay at 1% for future elections.  If a candidate goes gets 10% people who would have never considered voting 3rd party start to wonder "should I try something new."
      </p>
      <p>
       Vote 3rd party now.  Hope for results 10-15 years later.  Destroy the 2-party system from the outside.  They sure as hell are not going to reform themselves.

       Honestly I don't know how Stein would play out in the white house, but I can imagine it would shake things up quite a bit. It at least as a potential of righting the course of this country for the better.

       If they just pull one over and bring in Hillary anyway, then no amount of voting will change that. In that case nonviolent sit-in protests for election reform would be a good step

       trump winning however, gives an idea that maybe its ok to have non career politicians to be in such positions. that maybe we can dispense of them, and those funding them can simply take the seat themselves instead of by proxy. maybe in the hopes of arrogance they will.

        Drugs as Weapons Against Excerpt Re: Zappa &amp; Edgewood Arsenal
       </a>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Given that Zappa was, by numerous accounts, a pro-war, rigidly authoritarian control-freak, it is perhaps not surprising that he would not feel a kinship with the youth movement that he helped nurture. And it is probably safe to say that Frank's dad also had little regard for the youth culture of the 1960s, given that Francis Zappa was, in case you were wondering, a chemical warfare specialist assigned to - where else? - the Edgewood Arsenal. Edgewood is, of course, the longtime home of America's chemical warfare program, as well as a facility frequently cited as being deeply enmeshed in MK-ULTRA operations. Curiously enough, Frank Zappa literally grew up at the Edgewood Arsenal, having lived the first seven years of his life in military housing on the grounds of the facility. The family later moved to Lancaster, California, near Edwards Air Force Base, where Francis Zappa continued to busy himself with doing classified work for the military/intelligence complex. His son, meanwhile, prepped himself to become an icon of the peace &amp; love crowd. Again, nothing unusual about that, I suppose.

       Perot was so close in the 90s, he got 19% of the national vote, but people got scared after that because it split the vote and caused Clinton to win. After that election they essentially changed the debate rules to exclude third parties from the debates, which is a big part of why 3rd parties died off. The media treats them as irrelevant. But things are changing, because people are starting to treat the
       <em>
        media

       as irrelevant.

       I'd like to vote 3rd party, but Hillary is just too dangerous. Not worth the risk, to me anyways. Maybe if the 3rd party would push hard for 4 years to get enough votes together to win I might change my mind.

       Unless you're not in a swing state, then it doesn't matter anyway. You should vote your conscience if you're not in a swing state. If either 3rd party gets 5% of the vote, they receive a federal grant in the next election to fund a convention.

       was not aware of this fact. This should be publicized! And touted or whatever! This is not an election so much about elexted one terrible person or another, but instead one voting for more parties to have a voice. A vote against the two-party system seems like the best option.

       Yeah :/ tbh it's hard to want to organize or contribute when so many posts are aligned with bigotry and ignorance. This is about honest non filtered information allowing you to make your own choices. Not posting bullshit that you're looking to hear. That's no different than the system in place.

       You sometimes can if you use unconventional rules within the system. Popular demand
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       have an effect. Not-participating isn't going to get you anywhere, that's for sure. And this also does not preclude action outside the system, of course

       I didn't mean for us to do nothing. I just meant that it doesn't make sense to try and vote 3rd party in the system we currently have because powerful interests who have taken control of the voting process illegally and covertly will just fix the results so that the 3rd party option loses. Then they pat you on the back for participating and continue destroying the country under the guise of "you voted for this person" or "you wasted your vote on a 3rd party". We need a new system entirely.

       If large enough percentages are gotten though, it indicates public unrest and the parties will feel obligated to at least partially absorb the 3rd party platforms to regain votes in the next election. They can rig it like 5-10%, but they can't rig it like 50%, people would notice and there would be riots, and stability of government is their core virtue because it's how they retain their power

       You're not going to upset the system by voting. The only thing that truly upsets the system is to replace it with something that works better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, the system is set up in such a way that it views any form of replacement as a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that leaves the option of sitting back and watching the current system collapse after it rots from within.

       This is exactly why third parties upset the system. Because they never expect them to actually get any traction. Did you know China technically has 8 political parties? It's just that the other 7 never get enough votes to go anywhere, so the party continues to rule.
      </p>

       I think your attitude is too defeatist to do anyone any good. Once it rots it needs to be replaced by something, so we might as well get started on that now.

       Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say you vote for Jill Stein (as an example). If you're familiar with politics in other countries, you'll notice a pattern. We could use the UK or Canada as examples since they seem to have a bit more political diversity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Canada, there is a party called the NDP. Essentially the NDP is (was?) a left of center socialist party. They like to support health care, education, labor unions and stuff like that. They way they support their political platform is to tax and spend.
      </p>
      <p>
       What tends to happen with the NDP is as follows.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         No chance of getting elected... make all kinds of promises.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Election seems possible... promises get toned down.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Election seems very likely... promises start to sound a lot like the other political parties.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So I would confidently predict a similar pattern for Gary Johnson, Jill Stein or whoever else. They make plenty of sense right now because they truly are outsiders. They're thinking the same way we do because they are trying to make a change.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the real people in power aren't elected officials. Elected officials work for these people. Supposedly they work for the public, but in the real world, they work for the wealthiest 0.001% of the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why they say things that don't really make sense. This is why they break election promises and lie so often. They can't afford to tell it like it is because maintaining the illusion is part of their job.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as Jill Stein, or whatever 3rd party candidate, starts making some serious gains... they'll begin to sound just like all the career pols from the 2 party system.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can call that defeatist if you want. I prefer "realist" myself.
      </p>

      <p>
       In my view, we need to identify the true source of the rot and make that our target for change. The target is easy. It's the corrupting influence that money and people with money are allowed to have on the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money corrupts the election process, the legislative process and even most regulatory agencies. If you want better government, this is what has to change. If you think that voting for whatever candidate is going to make a difference, you're entitled to that belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't think that the rich people or their hired politician friends are ever willingly going to give up such a cozy arrangement.

       It's our right.  Probably the single most sacred tradition, established since the founding, is our right to vote.  It exemplifies freedom of speech, protest, and choice of leadership.  Such a shame it has been perverted so.

       You sometimes can if you use unconventional rules within the system. Popular demand
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       have an effect. Not-participating isn't going to get you anywhere, that's for sure. And this also does not preclude action outside the system, of course

        I think your attitude is too defeatist

      <p>
       Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say you vote for Jill Stein (as an example). If you're familiar with politics in other countries, you'll notice a pattern. We could use the UK or Canada as examples since they seem to have a bit more political diversity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Canada, there is a party called the NDP. Essentially the NDP is (was?) a left of center socialist party. They like to support health care, education, labor unions and stuff like that. They way they support their political platform is to tax and spend.
      </p>
      <p>
       What tends to happen with the NDP is as follows.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         No chance of getting elected... make all kinds of promises.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Election seems possible... promises get toned down.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Election seems very likely... promises start to sound a lot like the other political parties.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So I would confidently predict a similar pattern for Gary Johnson, Jill Stein or whoever else. They make plenty of sense right now because they truly are outsiders. They're thinking the same way we do because they are trying to make a change.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the real people in power aren't elected officials. Elected officials work for these people. Supposedly they work for the public, but in the real world, they work for the wealthiest 0.001% of the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why they say things that don't really make sense. This is why they break election promises and lie so often. They can't afford to tell it like it is because maintaining the illusion is part of their job.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as Jill Stein, or whatever 3rd party candidate, starts making some serious gains... they'll begin to sound just like all the career pols from the 2 party system.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can call that defeatist if you want. I prefer "realist" myself.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Once it rots it needs to be replaced by something
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In my view, we need to identify the true source of the rot and make that our target for change. The target is easy. It's the corrupting influence that money and people with money are allowed to have on the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money corrupts the election process, the legislative process and even most regulatory agencies. If you want better government, this is what has to change. If you think that voting for whatever candidate is going to make a difference, you're entitled to that belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't think that the rich people or their hired politician friends are ever willingly going to give up such a cozy arrangement.
