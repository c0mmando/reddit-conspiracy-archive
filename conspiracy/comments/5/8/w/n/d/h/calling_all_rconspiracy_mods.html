       So, r/wikileaks is clearly in trouble and has suffered the same fate as r/worldnews, r/politics and other subs whose mods have been "talked to" and/or replaced altogether. Now there's evidence of banning at 4chan for submitting a name, and who knows what other text or strings.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It would be enlightening to hear your opinion on the influence of Reddit admins or outside forces concerning their "manipulation" of subreddit moderators towards favoring agendas and banning/shadowbanning/deleting accounts of those who speak out against those agendas. Most of it is pretty obvious and can be deduced, but any new information from any of you could be enlightening, especially about the recent developments mentioned above.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Since Reddit is part of a corporation, there can really be no assurance of "free speech," but why has r/conspiracy remained
         <em>
          relatively
         </em>
         free to voice opinions and post articles that are clearly against the current mainstream narratives pushed by government and media? We deal with downvotes, shills and trolls constantly, but we have learned to live with that and have had only minor, fleeting problems with moderators here. What would change that for you? What would turn this sub into r/politics, or now, r/wikileaks? Is it useful for TPTB to keep r/conspiracy as a panopticon for their lists of soft targets and detainees?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How free do you feel to tell the truth about any of this yourselves – or the issues that are commonly at play here? You are infrequent commenters and posters, from what I can see. U/axolotl_peyotl was an exception to that, but haven't seen much lately.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This sub has, and continues, to attract new users, people who know something is wrong and want insight. There are many other websites that provide information, but none that gather such diverse topics for such a wide audience in the same way as this community – largely because we're a sub-community of one of the most popular websites in the world. So, from that standpoint, what the fuck to we expect? From another standpoint, those of us who have been here a while understand the importance and uniqueness of this sub, its history and its current role.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I would love your opinions on this, while you still may have an unpaid or unthreatened opinion at all.
      </p>

       Thank you for any time spent responding.

       Because instead of taking this sub over, they have turned public opinion against it. Anything that comes from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is immediately laughed at and shouted down.  Just as good as taking it over.  Probably better, in fact, because you don't have to waste resources managing it.

       True, and upvoted. Since I visit here more than any other site on the internet, I'm pretty myopic about that still being a common perception. I don't get out much.

       the sleepers have been trained to knee-jerk to any mention of "conspiracy theory" we are painted as outsiders on the fringe of the herd (and acceptable society) and a wee bit crazy and who wants to be that right!

       You're right in that they have turned public opinion against the sub. However, it is unwise to think that they haven't already infiltrated the subs. This place is a hotspot and it is unlikely that there isn't manipulation of articles and
       <strong>
        especially text posts
       </strong>
       offering new opinions on the political events.

       I've been working on it for a few months now, after seeing what's happened over the past few weeks I've been ramping up development.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently signup/log in is done, sub creation is done, post creation is pretty much done. It's also fully mobile responsive. I just need to iron out a few kinks in commenting and get upvotes working and It's good to go small scale.

       I think it's in the better interests of TPTB to (mostly) leave this sub alone. Conspiracy theorists are thought by many to be tinfoil hat crazies, so corralling certain discussions into this area gives them a nearly automatic, desirable taint to their credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I do think this sub has its plants and shills, and I think the good ones have been around for a while, posting just enough plausible material that when it comes time to divert and obfuscate (when TPTB decide that the truths being tossed around hit a little too close to home), people trust them. PSYOPS programs are forward-thinking and clever, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really know that anything can be done about it. Trust your intuition, I guess, and try your best to filter the truth from the half-truths and outright lies.

       I was going to make a post for this but I'll start here... What do
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/Wikileaks">
        /r/Wikileaks
       </a>
       have in common? Moderators! Or one at least, and they happen to be involved in the spectacle at
       <a href="/r/Wikileaks">
        /r/Wikileaks
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Today I got banned then unbanned from
       <a href="/r/Wikileaks">
        /r/Wikileaks
       </a>
       , went back and saw
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/58w83z/with_regards_to_the_free_flow_of_information_the/">
        this stickied post
       </a>
       by
       <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">
        /u/AssuredlyAThrowAway
       </a>
       claiming they have removed the new mods.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/about/moderators">
        Since this is a lie
       </a>
       , and they've instead added even more new mods (ironically
       <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">
        /u/AssuredlyAThrowAway
       </a>
       is one of them), I made
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/58wjup/requesting_accountability/">
        this thread
       </a>
       asking for some accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thread was deleted by another mod - one of the new additions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I know
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a pretty transparent sub and I think the moderators here have done a great job.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we need answers as requested above. And I wouldn't mind an explanation from
       <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">
        /u/AssuredlyAThrowAway
       </a>
       as to what his level of involvement in the situation at
       <a href="/r/wikileaks">
        /r/wikileaks
       </a>
       is, since they're also one of the newest moderators here.

       to do oversight of their mod team and ensure the free flow of information is upheld as the driving ethos behind all moderation decisions on that subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, from what I understand two moderators had resigned from the team as I was being brought on a few hours ago. But one of the mods who tendered their resignation has yet to leave the team. As I am the lowest person on the mod team, I do not have the ability to remove the mod on my own and will have to wait for a more senior mod to become active tomorrow.

        /r/ConSpiritOrs

       ... awful name, I know.

       So far, I am the only Mod. I am looking at taking on new mods, but it will be under a vetting process.

       The sub has the same guidelines and protocols as
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       . Literally, I copied and pasted their guidelines onto my sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I set it up as precautionary in case this sub does get hit hard by shills, CTR, or if the mods become compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone is free to join in on the discussion over there, but I am warning you, the place is a bit of a wreck and is a ghost town (as of now). I am not the best with building subs (I have never been a moderator before) and the format does need some sprucing up.
      </p>

       I am not trying to replace
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">

       Although we are being spammed by endless disinformation and distraction,  The mods here are a notch above the rest.  They say that only two types of people can tell the truth,  comedians and conspiracy "theorists" or I prefer conspiracy seekers.  Keep your tinfoil hats on and wear them proud.  r/conspiracy remains a bastion of truth in a world of illusions.  Be safe everyone.

       Exactly, I mean how else are we going to prove that the earth is flat. Just kidding. We are one of the last few places with very intelligent people who are permitted to freely discuss and pursue truth. 
We must continue to fight like the mighty Spartans , no matter how the odds are stacked, we mustn't go down without the fight of our lives because we might not ever get a second chance

       Serious Question.

      <p>
       What is our fail-safe? Like all sacred knowledge, if we don't create backup plans, it may be lost forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps we should Create an anonymous  email account and share it with people that you value and respect on here. 
Or We could create our own website and if this gets shutdown we all meet there?

       Hi =)
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't speak for the other
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       mods, or for any other subs, but in my experience the admins rarely interfere with affairs here, and when they do it's generally pretty reasonable (PI etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       remain consistently fascinated at the number of shadowbanned users that still continue to post without even being aware of their situation. I always make sure to inform these poor souls of their predicament, but I feel like it shouldn't be my job to let them know.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        why has r/conspiracy remained relatively free to voice opinions and post articles that are clearly against the current mainstream narratives pushed by government and media?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's all in the brand. Say what you want about the CIA and the stigmatization of the "conspiracy theorist," but the perception of the word "conspiracy" itself has changed dramatically in our collective consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this stigma has helped
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Language is really powerful. If this sub had any other name maybe things would be different.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       by the "mainstream" requires a mass shift in consciousness regarding the word "conspiracy" itself. Until then, anything that comes from the realm of "conspiracy" is immediately compromised, ironically giving us certain freedoms in an otherwise increasingly restricted environment.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What would change that for you? What would turn this sub into r/politics?

      <p>
       There's not much incentive to buy off or infiltrate the mods of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Even if the sub grows and becomes more influential, as long the information is associated with "conspiracy" it will never be a threat in a society that has been conditioned to reject all things conspiracy.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Is it useful for TPTB to keep r/conspiracy as a panopticon for their lists of soft targets and detainees?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        identity
       </em>
       of individuals is probably largely irrelevant...again, when controversial things that threaten TPTB are exposed, it helps them to have a significant community like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       discredit their exposure by merely associating the word "conspiracy" with the controversy.

       I've learned a great deal from my time on reddit (almost a decade now, yikes). While I'm definitely concerned about the direction this is going, and I'm painfully aware that this website is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       meant to be a bastion of free speech, I do have a great deal of faith in and respect for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and what we've been able to accomplish.

        U/axolotl_peyotl was an exception to that, but haven't seen much lately.

      <p>
       I definitely have needed some time to reflect and explore other pursuits, but I can't help but always be observing and speculating. And things have been so damn juicy that I can't help but be inspired to rejoin the fray...

       No offense to the folks here at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       but I used to look at this sub as 99% garbage and 1% valuable. Since
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       has been taken over by CRT I find myself coming the the fucking
       <em>

       subreddit to dig for unbiased information. Sure, there's still a lot of garbage - but it's slowly becoming what

       Upvoted because those are great questions, and they should be answered irrespective of the situation at r/wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should know, all of the new mods except julio08 are from r/DNCleaks and r/Conspiracy.  You're literally asking the guy that got added as a mod in r/wikileaks in the past 24 hours about the new mod situation in r/wikileaks...
      </p>
      <p>
       They certainly handled the whole situation ass-backwards, but I don't think the subreddit is compromised (regarding wikileaks twitter, however, I'm still skeptical, and will remain skeptical until I see proof of life).

       Conspiracy has an energy of its own.  And it's essence cannot be negated. Rather, it expands always. What you are seeing is attempts to contain it. It is not even accurately described by the word conspiracy. But I am sure you know what I mean and can identify what the energy of it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last attempts to contain, and the charades and control mechanisms themselves become more apparent and lend more to conspiracy. The more they try to contain the more they end up validating the conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, we are close to critical mass. They don't want you to know that, how close we are. They are trying everything to prevent it.

       If I were a mod, I'd be having a pretty lengthy email discussion with the other mods right now, since it's on the front page. It could take a while, but crickets wouldn't surprise me either.

       Today a moderator warned me for calling an obvious shill account a shill. First time ever and I've been on this sub for years on other accounts. If you can't call out shills in /r/ conspiracy something is wrong. I have rustled their little narrative about wikileaks being compromised heh.

       Rule 10 exists because otherwise virtually every argument ends up with a knee-jerk "shill" accusation. You could call it Shillwin's Law,  the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       variant of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law">
        Godwin's Law
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills exist, the mods are acutely aware of that, but actually proving someone is a shill (as opposed to the
       <strong>
        far more common
       </strong>
       useful idiot) is virtually impossible in a semi-anonymous environment like reddit. The word shill has therefore become a meaningless accusation that merely sets off pointless shit-slinging matches.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you, or anybody else, has actual evidence that another user is a shill (ie a paid disinformant) please message the mods and we will take action.

       I get that, but at the same time these people are taking over the sub with bullshit posts, the same comments on all posts, and now calling them out results in a warning from a mod. So what do we do? Let their narrative control the sub? What people don't understand is they want engagement. They want you to argue their point, because as long as people are riled up arguing about some manufactured story, it makes that story more legitimate. I have called out a few people before in other subs who actually ended up deleting their accounts. I researched before accusing and found out who they worked for. I remember both of their names. So I'm well aware of shills and how they operate.

       this sub is considered important because they can release disinfo here that eventually filters out and changes perceptions. You need the fringe of society in order to muddy the waters of truth. There is truth here, but there is also lots of untruth and half-truth. Separating those is insurmountable for most people.

       I endorse what
       <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">
        /u/axolotl_peyotl

       has said earlier, but will give my own responses too.

         I am not aware of the admins ever attempting to influence the mods of
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         . Certainly, no instructions have been given to me, or restrictions imposed on me by either reddit admins, or by any of the other mods.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We can thank the fact that the "top mod" (first name in the modlist) has allowed the active mods free rein to run the sub as a free-speech platform for discussing any and all topics in the conspiracy sphere. Ultimately, if the top mod had a change of heart and replaced all of the other mods, the sub would likely become something very different. Is
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         allowed to exist because it is a pressure-release valve for conspiracy-minded people and a forum that can be observed by...whatever nefarious entities like to observe these things? I don't know, I hope not, but is there an alternative that is provably neither of those things that we could migrate to instead? Not that I'm aware of.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I think most of the active mods are genuinely interested in conspiracies, but we don't all believe the same conspiracy theories. What we do agree on is that we will maintain the ethos of this subreddit, and that means we don't curate content at a meta level - ie no conspiracy theory is off-limits. The userbase decides what gets to the front page, and what doesn't. I believe there's a paradox, here, in that if we were ever to ban unpopular subjects (eg Flat Earth) because some people complain "it makes the sub look bad", such an intervention would destroy the integrity of the sub.

       I really enjoy this sub, and thought the same thing myself ... I'm still "new" here, but have been on message boards for about 15 years.
       <br/>
       This sub is the first place i have ever seen people
       <em>
        breaking down
       </em>
       other people's posts ... I thought I was the only person who did that crap?! (The influx of short "weird" posts upsets me)

       Hopefully enough of the original members hang around here for me to read and enjoy their posts.

       You're right in that they have turned public opinion against the sub. However, it is unwise to think that they haven't already infiltrated the subs. This place is a hotspot and it is unlikely that there isn't manipulation of articles and
       <strong>
