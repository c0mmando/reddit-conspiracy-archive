       That this or some regulatory form of this has not happened speaks to the two party hegemony over the national voting systems. Neither party seems to want it bullet proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Electronic voting has absolutely been shown to be vulnerable to hacking and there has been sworn testimony by people hired to alter code for nefarious purposes. And that was following the 2000 elections. Here it is 16 years later and we're no better off.

       Releasing the source code would actually make the machines easier to hack because everyone would know exactly how they work and how they could be exploited, there would be no guesswork. So releasing the sourcecode would only add to the problem.

       That I tell you your voting machine can't get hacked, or that someone else besides me tests that for you? because if only I am allowed to test it, buddy, I have such skills in my back, tremendous skills, my voting machines are unhackable.

       Security through obscurity only works in situations where the payoff is small enough. A reverse example of that is vegas.

       I just want the same standart for voting machines. I want someone to go around, and see if all these milliuons of dollars the US or other countries pump into voting machines got you anything more then "hot promises".

       And I am well aware that perfect security is impossible. but I want it checked that "we made sure, to the best of our abilities, to fix every bug we encountered" does not mean "we sat on our asses twiddling thumbs. "

       Possibly, but thousands of experts will be going over that code and would quickly find any foul play or backdoors/cheats that have been added.  Right now the software could be full of tools to change votes and we'd never be able to tell.

       You don't need the source code. Actually having the source means absolutely nothing in terms of determining security as patches can be made post-compilation, among many many other things. What you need is a live dump of memory and a compiled binary to reverse engineer as well as probably just direct access to the machine while it's running.
