    <div class="md"><p>That this or some regulatory form of this has not happened speaks to the two party hegemony over the national voting systems. Neither party seems to want it bullet proof.</p>

<p>Electronic voting has absolutely been shown to be vulnerable to hacking and there has been sworn testimony by people hired to alter code for nefarious purposes. And that was following the 2000 elections. Here it is 16 years later and we&#39;re no better off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would you like more? </p>

<p>That I tell you your voting machine can&#39;t get hacked, or that someone else besides me tests that for you? because if only I am allowed to test it, buddy, I have such skills in my back, tremendous skills, my voting machines are unhackable. </p>

<p>Security through obscurity only works in situations where the payoff is small enough. A reverse example of that is vegas. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>the software for all gaming machines is known to the comission. </p></li>
<li><p>there are regular cheks if the correct version of the software that is on the books is running. </p></li>
<li><p>to block these checks, or to deny access, means effectiely getting your license to operate pulled. </p></li>
<li><p>every casino knows and agrees that if one of them gets caught cheating, all of them loose. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I just want the same standart for voting machines. I want someone to go around, and see if all these milliuons of dollars the US or other countries pump into voting machines got you anything more then &quot;hot promises&quot;. </p>

<p>And I am well aware that perfect security is impossible. but I want it checked that &quot;we made sure, to the best of our abilities, to fix every bug we encountered&quot; does not mean &quot;we sat on our asses twiddling thumbs. &quot;</p>
