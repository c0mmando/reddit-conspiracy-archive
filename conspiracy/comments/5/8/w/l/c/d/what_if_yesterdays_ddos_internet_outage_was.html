So what are the chances they had Ecuador shut his internet, waited a few days then picked him up when the internet was down so there was no immediate ramifications?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He gave administration control of ICANN to UN, that&#39;s it.  DDos has nothing to do with that.  Anyone with a botnet can flood a website with packets, and probably do it by IP anyway, which precludes anything to do with ICANN, since it avoids name resolution (getting numerical address from a website url)</p>

<p>The media seems to be conflating DNS with DDOS and it also seems to be conflating Wikipedia with Wikileaks.  Very likely taking their media scripting from Podestobama</p>
