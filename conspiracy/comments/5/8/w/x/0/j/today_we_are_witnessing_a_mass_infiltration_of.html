       It is obvious to those who can read between the lines and dig deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is safe anymore? Who is safe anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange is missing with no word to his safety.  MAJOR changes in WL staffing and Twitter responses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can WL be trusted anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think in the next couple weeks we will see blatant false email releases from WL, it already started today. That will prove to discredit any past posts, or at least draw into question the authenticity of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not think it would be wise to trust anything posted by them in the last few days.

       Nothing digital has ever been safe. Take everything you see, hear, and read on the interwebs with a grain of salt. Glean what you can from it, apply it to what you already know, and discard it. The murkier the waters get the more you have to rely on your own research to stay informed. Diversify your sources and try your best to not rely too heavily on any particular one. There is a war raging and it has raged behind the scenes for quite some time. Trust no one.

       eew: The Internet can be controlled to any degree desired by those powerful enough to demand it. The proletariat shall be corralled within a deliberately limited and 'sanitised' Internet.
       <br/>
       The issue is not whether the Internet can be controlled but rather how to go about assuming control. The technological details are straightforward. Real cleverness lies in the social manipulation necessary as precursor to implementing technological boundaries to Internet use. That is where the devious wealthy elderly win hands down in contest with the idealistic young."Details are fairly scarce, but these groups are likely to have shared
data on how educational messages affect the behaviors (sic) of  ..."

       That was a lot of fancy talk. What I got from what you said. The youth act impartially to the truth and the old gain from experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what I believe I have, experience.  And what my experience tells me. Something changed, something has altered the behavior of a known news source. That is big news, considering it was WL that was changed.

       Theoretically ... imagine if a bunch of paid shills (like
       <em>
        those guys
       </em>
       who are screwing this place up NOW) were to present their work so far to a higher (richer) power?
       <br/>
       And say ... they asked for more help, as the community here was harder to manipulate than originally thought.
       <br/>
       But you don't want to hire more people, right, as people make mistakes, need days off, are needy ...

      <p>
       My solution, if I could get a 7-8 figure influx of capital ... get me two of IBM's Watson Computers! They run about $3mil each, but will work 24-7, figure out the median reply in each sub and generate a history on their own, as they also (flawlessly) generate new identities and use them to push up posts, in the same manner that you can bury a result in a google search!

       I dont know man. When things change at the worst time, its never good. If this happened After we knew he was safe, sure. Business as usual. This is most def not business as usual.

       Believe me, I am suspicious as hell, I agree shit is very strange right now. But I wouldn't discredit them until we have conclusive evidence that they're compromised. Otherwise we could be doing more harm than good.

       If your friend started talking and acting completely different, would that not be rise for concern. With everything happening all at one time, says to me. This is more than a coincidence.

       I'm not saying it's a coincidence. Or that we shouldn't be concerned. In fact I said it's suspicious as hell. Just don't discredit them until we're sure. You could be doing damage to the best voice we have right now.

       Ive never raised concerns for WL or the content they have released. That being said. A dead mans switch should have went off the second he was unable to prove he is safe, it was set for a specific time. "3days, correct me if i am wrong". He went missing. 3 days after, when theoretically people would hear one way or another if he was safe. The web site changed. Mods here on reddit changed. 4chan changes. Twitter changes.

       Speaking in generalities,  WL is not my friend.  But i have followed them for years, like most of us. Its obvious something is happening, just don't know what. And after he goes missing of all times

       Add this sub to the list. Why isn't the latest debate one of the top posts? Why isn't the al smith memorial dinner video a top post? What happened to like 90% of the discussion that was happening 2 weeks ago. This sub is dead.

       Well vote Trump then.  Obviously they don't want us doing that.  Or it's a double blind op and that's the end goal.  Either way we're fourteen steps behind as cattle should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       My belief is we have to start pulling on the threads.  Go for a candidate that is vocally opposed to infringement of free speech.  Donald and stein.  Donald wants to enact libel laws against the dishonest media corrupting people's brains that haven't looked into things themselves and vote the majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baby steps because it helps us stay calm and sane.  Let's not take on all the possibilities of a failed trump administration when we have no basis.  That's fear.

       I'll be really honest - I'm an actual sceptic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't trusted Wikileaks since they had an agenda. You can say what you want about it all, but face the reality - when Wikileaks started choosing WHEN to release documents for maximum effects, it became an organisation with an agenda.  Giving out raunchy headlines about how you are going to do a release to bring down and expose Clinton is not what Wikileaks should be or was about.

       Im right there with you, also a sceptic. I do understand why they release the way they do, every time they have a "shocking" release, their sales go up. They are a business, I get that. Playing the cards they have at the right time is crucially important to them staying relevant,  if they dumped everything they had 10yrs ago, we would not be speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that said. What is going on in the last 72hrs is way beyond standard operations.  Almost like someone else has taken the role of WL head...

       And perhaps that's why - I'm sure things will become more clear in the coming days.

       Personally, I think Assange has started to lose the plot and the goal posts have shifted from "the place to leak information", to, "we release information we choose to, to get the response we want".
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, those of you who suggest that wikileaks is some sort of neutral force in the world are misguided, at this point.

       Nothing new about infiltrating an enemy or trying to curb dissent by sabotaging the dissenters from within.

       Specific to WL, they have always guarded sources, and part of that bargain is that we have to trust they've always done adequate due diligence on the docs and source(s). The trust arrangement is not ideal, and at any point in their history, they could've been infiltrated or given forgeries or limited hangouts. The best gauge for authenticity of their propagated documents are cases like Chelsea Manning and Assange's predicament. WL has never been a "safe" arrangement or an ideal, totally trustworthy source.
