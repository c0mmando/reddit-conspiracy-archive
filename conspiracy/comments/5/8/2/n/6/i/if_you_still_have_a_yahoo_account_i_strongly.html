        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey,
I wanted to make sure you are aware about the massive security breach at Yahoo. Recently it was leaked that Yahoo compromised the security and privacy of hundreds of millions of users by installing a secret program that searched all incoming emails at the request of US intelligence officials.</p>

<p>If you have a Yahoo account, I strongly recommend that you delete it immediately.</p>

<p>This is what we know so far:</p>

<p>Sometime last year, the US government served Yahoo with a secret order asking them to install a program that would search all of its users incoming message for a specific piece of information called a “selector.” It is unclear what the exact selector was, but the New York Times reports that the US intelligence agency was searching for a “signature” tied to the communications of a state-sponsored terrorist organization.”</p>

<p>There have been conflicting reports about what kind of program was installed, with initial reports stating it was probably just a modified version of Yahoo’s existing scanning system that searches all incoming email for malware, spam and images of child pornography. But sources have since told Motherboard that the program was more like a “rootkit,” or a piece of malware that grants a hacker nearly complete and undetectable control over the infected system.</p>

<p>Rootkits generally allow an attacker -- or in this case the government -- to take complete control over a computer or network in a manner that is difficult to detect. This also suggests that the government had much greater access to Yahoo&#39;s data than was previously reported. A rootkit could grant total surveillance capability over all data coming into or out of Yahoo&#39;s servers.</p>

<p>Delete your Yahoo account, now. </p>

<p>This is an absolutely unprecedented privacy violation.</p>

<p>Surveillance experts and former government officials are saying they have never seen such a broad demand for real-time digital surveillance.</p>

<p>Even former Yahoo Chief Information Security Officer, Alex Stamos, is appalled by the program. When he found out about it in 2015 he immediately resigned his position, telling coworkers that he had been excluded from the decision to implement the program. He also cited flaws that seriously endangered the security of user data and left the program vulnerable to hackers. </p>
