        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Given the recent merger of Monsanto and Bayer AG, I think that GMO foods and agri-business should come under the microscope. If you browse Reddit regularly you&#39;d be certain that 90% of the readers endorse GMO foods and can&#39;t get enough of them. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97567">Opinion polling</a> shows otherwise. You know those eco-hippies that want labels on GMO food? Guess what, that&#39;s about 93% of the population. People are aware of the risks associated with GMO foods and prefer to avoid them if given the choice. </p>

<p>2 weeks ago there was an excellent thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/55kvcx/my_research_on_glyphosate_roundup_brain_dump/">glyphosate</a> use and how Monsanto is doing what it can to downplay any harms associated with this herbicide. This is of course the same company that brought you Agent Orange, the defoliant that led to countless birth defects in innocent people that were exposed.</p>

<p>They wrongly say that these foods are required to save the world. Nothing could be further from the truth. Planting hybrid seeds or heirloom varieties instead could feed the world just as well. The fact is that GMO seeds are designed to sell chemicals - Roundup ready soybeans for example. Is it a coincidence that one of the largest seed distributors is also one of the largest chemical companies? No, and their products reflect that. Without glyphosate the roundup-ready crops are not as productive. Their terminator seed technology ensures that the offspring are not viable. Farmers will thus need a constant supply of GMO seed and chemicals. Successfully planting traditional crops on soil that has been contaminated by glyphosate is very difficult and remediation takes time. So switching back isn&#39;t exactly easy either.</p>

<p>Lastly, do you want your food to be sprayed with herbicide very generously? That&#39;s the main concern with GMO crops, is the contamination of the final product. Of course they (the government) say it&#39;s safe to eat. If a lobbyist paid enough money to the FDA I&#39;m sure they could get glyphosate listed as an essential vitamin.</p>

<p>Organic food, which used to be known simply as &#39;food&#39; is the wave of the future. It was a mistake to try and play god when there&#39;s such an abundance of natural diversity in genetics to work with. It&#39;s our own sense of hubris and self-importance that makes it seem like genetic engineering is necessary for food production when in fact it makes the whole system less stable and resilient. </p>

<p>The main goal has been the same as it ever was: make more money for the shareholders. Monsanto or Bayer is not in the business of feeding the world, they just want to corner the market on seeds and buy out any of their competition. Leaving the consumer with a costly inferior product that&#39;s dependent on their toxic chemicals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think anti-GMO activists should rebrand themselves as more specific protesters, for example, glyphosate protesters. &quot;Anti-GMO&quot; is ridiculously broad. I&#39;d rather see a label saying that a product may contain traces of glyphosate than one that warns me about genetic modification. How about the endangered status of honeybees and the likely role glyphosate is playing in that tragedy?</p>

<p>Admit that the possibility exists that genetic modification has the potential to advance agriculture if executed properly (I&#39;d plant tomatoes that are fully resistant to Verticilliurn or squash that didn&#39;t attract vine borers if the modification didn&#39;t pose a threat to my own or my soil&#39;s health). I mean, all agriculture ultimately relies on generations of genetic manipulation - high fructose teosinte syrup isn&#39;t really a thing. </p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s issues beyond glyphosate, take Bt corn for example. Studies on what a diet full of Bacillus thuringiensis is going to do to a mammal&#39;s gut biome are few and far between. And then there&#39;s that huge elephant in the room, the patenting of life (seeds) that has been allowed to occur. Protest the destruction of open pollination for profit. But specifically, and loudly. Make people understand the exact nature of the problem rather than lumping under &quot;anti-GMO&quot; or &quot;Monsanto Kills&quot;.</p>

<p>The other elephant in the room is industrial-scale farming. Clearly a destructive system and intertwined with GMOs, but one better protested in it&#39;s own right. The opposition has been very effective in lumping all of these issues under one umbrella and that makes it easier to discredit detractors in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve known since the 70s that genes can code for many different proteins through alternative splicing.</p>

<p>This debunks the idea that a gene taken from organism A and implanted in B will produce the same protein.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so many GMO shills all over Reddit.</p>

<p>We just wrapped up a unit on food in my class. One of the debate topics was GMOs. I did my best to present the pros and cons of GMOS and not try to influence my students with my views.</p>

<p>We had a Socratic discussion on the topic a few days ago. Out of 70 students, only 1 supported GMOs. 1.</p>

<p>It shows you that it doesn&#39;t take much to realize there is just something not right about genetic modification, and my students can sense it. I asked them how they felt about the people who disagreed with them, and they said they simply weren&#39;t looking deep enough at the issue.</p>

<p>For the shills who inevitably come to these comments, my argument is that there is already enough food to feed the population of the world without GMOs. Our issues with food have a lot more to do with class and power than a lack of food. It all goes back to who is in control, as it always does.</p>

<p>All of you shills have similar writing styles. I am going to start saving all of the comments. Here are the similarities:</p>

<p>1) They ignore my main point and twist and stretch my words. I am not indoctrinating children. They were allowed to come to their own conclusions after research from credible sources. They all were able to see the pros and cons of GMOs.</p>

<p>2) The comments are insulting. Attacking somebody is not a valid argument. Ad hominem is a argument fallacy.</p>

<p>3) They are usually exaggerative and aggressive. No, the world is not going to end if I teach my students some stuff about GMOs. Calm down. Also, your aggressive tone is tiring. Try to have an actual conversation with somebody.</p>

<p>4) They go in circles. You will ignore what I say and probably attack me again.</p>

<p>Please find something better to do than shill. If you want to have an actual conversation with me, then you can. However, you really just appear to want to attack.</p>

<p>You have no business in academia, especially when people are putting their trust in you with their children. You shouldn&#39;t be teaching them that any information that doesn&#39;t agree with the nonsense you&#39;ve fallen for is coming from paid shills. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not teaching that.</p>

<p>And like you want me to give you my lesson plans or something? I provided students with sources from .edu websites and universities that were credible.</p>

<p>First, we did a basic &quot;What is genetics?&quot; Investigation for a few days.</p>

<p>Then I had them do a lesson where I broke down the steps of genetic modification in crops, and they had to title each step. The student who got closest to the title got candy.</p>

<p>Then, I actually had them watch a documentary with Bill Nye, which seemed mostly pro GMO.</p>

<p>Next, they did research for a few days on the pros and cons of GMOs. I gave them criteria for credible online sources. I also I introduced the word bias.</p>

<p>Finally we had a socratic discussion on the topic. A socratic discussion isn&#39;t really a debate and isn&#39;t necessarily about being right or wrong.</p>

<p>This was all part of a larger unit on food, which was part of a larger thematic unit on conflicts. We have been studying the classical conflicts (man vs. Society, man vs. Technology, etc.)</p>

<p>I really felt  I did a good job of excluding my biases.</p>

<p>Anti GMO beliefs don&#39;t come through &quot;socratic&quot; discussion, and invoking  the shill gambit is as anti social, anti socratic, anti critical thinking as it gets. You literally use it to poison the well for <em>anyone</em> who&#39;d dare challenge your anti GMO talking points. </p>

<p>I am actually not anti-GMO, at least when it comes to food. My argument in my original post is that we have enough food to feed the whole world without GMOs. That is the issue that makes me question the whole issue on a deeper level.</p>

<p>From years of trying to distribute &quot;extra&quot; food(and supplements), we know the logistics of it are too difficult to overcome. </p>

<p>The breeding related  benefits of the past green revolution were passed onto the developing world. Now those in the privileged first world are campaigning against passing the latest tech to the developing world using the argument you&#39;re invoking - &quot;we have enough food to feed the whole world without GMOs&quot;.</p>

<p>A better solution for those in the developed world is to give them the tech  you don&#39;t understand and  take for granted. </p>

<p>Are you capable of doing anything other than spouting ignorance and calling people shills?  </p>

<p>Unlike yourself, I don&#39;t consider money to be so important that through my quest for it I actively spread nonsense to unsuspecting children, sacrificing the basic morality of making the world a better place in order to pepper the world my own ignorance.</p>

<p>I almost feel compelled to send letters to every school board in the country warning them that people like you are actively dumbing-down the children, presenting anti-intelligence as a viable way to make a living, perpetuating the problems that plague America.  It&#39;s deplorable.</p>
