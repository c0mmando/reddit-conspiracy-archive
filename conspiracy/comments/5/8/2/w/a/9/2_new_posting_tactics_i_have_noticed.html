       So posters who may or may not be monetarily compensated have been employing some pretty lame tactics lately, more so the last couple of weeks:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         saying, "I don't like (insert cunt's name here) either, BUT....."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trying to convince people to not vote and "voice" their opinion by abstaining.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Fuck that, vote and vote with your heart!  Full transparency, I'm voting DJT, I'm not happy about it, but it's my most educated guess.  It may all be a farce, but whatever, I don't care if you vote Donald, Jill, or Gary..just get out and vote against that traitorous scumbag, for whatever good it may do.
      </p>
      <p>
       BONUS:  They are really trying to discredit O'Keefe, it is beyond ridiculous, he may or may not be an unsavory character, BUT, I have seen a lot of "smoking guns" over the last decade, but not since WTC7 have I seen anything as "holy shit" as this video.   It truly has the power to wake up the "normies."
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: So far the comments in this thread consist of two posts trying to squelch the idea that voting matters and one insinuating I am a shill.  Awesome.  I love catching flak fuckers!!!!

       Simply because we all know why things are so messed up.  Unlike most people though, I feel that urging people to take a proactive stance, no matter how impotent it may be is far superior to just sitting at home and bitching about things, that accomplishes even LESS than voting.  Not to mention, people need to get out and vote in their local elections because that is where real change happens anyway.  Feel free to sit this one out, it is your right, i just don't respect you for it.

       ipso facto, yes.  But at least I know I tried no matter the outcome.  You are so good at this, I can barely resist spending five seconds to type a response.  I'm done now though, have a nice day/night.

       What are you talking about, seams you are assuming things left and right here. I said what I said since I don't share your opinion on voting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And legit, you missed that account's can be bought? can't really trust any account's any more. And I'm not saying you have bought yours so keep those feel in check please. I'm not trying to discredit you, I just observed a "You must vote" post and I don't think voting is going to help our world as it stands right now. Voting is only another form of control over the population for those in control.

       You are right, I think the worst thing CTR has done is divide us, hardcore.  Here's the deal, I know voting is most likely pointless, but it can affect change at the local level.  Do you think TPTB give a shit if we bite off our nose to spite our face and not vote?  No, that is even more what they want.  You and me may see things differently, but I do not take kindly to being called a shill, even if it is insinuated.  I have maintained a consistent account for 8 years, why would I sell it.  Also, I am just an advocate for voting, it is clear I am anti-HRC, but who here isn't?  I am just encouraging people to get out and vote against her by picking whomever is to their liking.  I just want people to be active, because sitting at home sure as hell ain't gonna do shit.  I have nothing left to argue, I'm done.

       I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for causing any discomfort for you, and you have some solid point's even with me, specially the couch. Watching your election cycle this year is more concerning to me, then who's going to win. They both seam like terrible candidates for me. And for me I lost hope in your process along with GWB..
      </p>
      <p>
       The only ting that can bring about a quick change is a nonviolent mass protest, since if the current regime is topple by violence the cycle will only end up with more violence, and we have the same thing all over, like it has been for a long time. So until that day all I know to do is to speak up and voice my opinion and perhaps it will wake at least one person up to critically think about what's actually happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you said it best with "dividing us", you know divide and conquer and all that, here's the flip side tho any generation, ours or those to come can choose to unite and prosper instead, that's what they are really afraid of. Since if we have each other they(tptb) will become obsolete.

       Voting is pointless; Plain and simple....Smartmatic/Diebold machines WILL tell you what the results are. Your vote does not matter to them because they rig all of the votes with those machines at the end of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though 80% of voters voted for Trump and 20% for Hillary (Which is very likely true), the MSM and Voting Machines CAN and WILL find a way to make Trump a 50% and Hillary a 51%.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would work if the votes are paper bills and the voting council ACTUALLY counts the votes by hand; But when the voting mechanics are electronic deities that tell you what the results are and the ballot boxes look like paper shredders, it does not matter because this is NOT a democracy; But a religious ritual.

       There is absolutely NO risk in voting, so what words am I heeding exactly? I am well aware of how stacked the deck is.  I still think people should TRY to affect change every way they can, though different avenues will have varying levels of success.

       Voting is the only thing that is keeping people involved. It's all we have left to fight with until something major happens within US government.

       They still have to account for the votes! If nobody voted, Clintons election fraud would be invisible. The more people keep voting the more difficult it is to steal elections. Corrupt criminal politicians would love it if everyone stopped voting...it would be so easy for them!

       Question dodging: the intentional avoidance of answering a question. This may happen when the person questioned either does not know the answer and wants to avoid embarrassment, or when the person is being interrogated or questioned in debate, and wants to avoid giving a direct response.

       You're an asshat. Voting is the most important right we have left and should exercise as often as we are able. Even if the top slot race is an embarrassing dog &amp; pony show that makes us cringe to be Americans, we all know that change -real change- rarely emanates top down. Fuck the POTUS election, sure because lets be honest how much effect will the result of that race have on your day to day regardless of the victor. Here's the thing though... change starts with us on the ground floor at the grass roots level. Its in our hearts, and it's on our minds. I'm sure there is a laundry list of local measures on the ballot wherever you live. You know, shit that has direct impact on your world and your experience in it with noticeable, palpable effect. Help shape local policy and build the community. Be the example. Make a difference. Put your phone down. Back away from the screen. Get involved.
