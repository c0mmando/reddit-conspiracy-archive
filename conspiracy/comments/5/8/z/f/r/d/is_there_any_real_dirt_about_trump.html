<p>For fucks sakes people, according to the horses mouth himself.</p>

<p>Trump inherited $50,000,000</p>

<p>Trump posted a loss on his taxes of $950,000,000</p>

<p>Where do you think he got 900,000,000 million to pay off his debt. </p>

<p>News Flash: he didn&#39;t, Trump owes interest as well now he&#39;s billions in debt and like Hillary, doesn&#39;t even want to be doing this whole election charade but has no choice, they have both been on a leash from the start. I have a clip from CNN where they interviewed one of the head persons from a bank he owes money to where he literally said &quot;Trump is worth more to us alive than dead, he&#39;s a good salesmen, he can sell his character real well.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there&#39;s someone out there researching this stuff, and they claim one of Trump&#39;s Russian mob connections provided girls to Epstein (I&#39;m assuming flight/island/party girls, not Epstein&#39;s daily girls that he sourced from the local high school; but also assuming not the only ones because there are the owners of the other modeling agencies that procured, like Brunel). There is a HUGE can of worms behind Trump&#39;s modeling business (that supporters think he means A WORD he says on immigration after his own business practices is sad) and this is how you know the fix is in and they&#39;re all involved in this trafficking and underage prostitution business: neither the Republicans nor the Democrats will touch it despite there being multiple witnesses going, &quot;Oh yeah, that&#39;s well known&quot; and multiple articles out there about it if you go digging.</p>
