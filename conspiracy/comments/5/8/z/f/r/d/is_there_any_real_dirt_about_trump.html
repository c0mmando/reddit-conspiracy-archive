       The only real dirt I've seen are his divorces and reputation of being a ladies man.. so typical alpha male behavior. Apparently some projects of his have tanked and it caused people not to be paid - but that happens in business.. Not every venture is a success and you can use the system to cut your losses.

       Trump inherited $50,000,000

       Trump posted a loss on his taxes of $950,000,000
      </p>
      <p>
       Where do you think he got 900,000,000 million to pay off his debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       News Flash: he didn't, Trump owes interest as well now he's billions in debt and like Hillary, doesn't even want to be doing this whole election charade but has no choice, they have both been on a leash from the start. I have a clip from CNN where they interviewed one of the head persons from a bank he owes money to where he literally said "Trump is worth more to us alive than dead, he's a good salesmen, he can sell his character real well."

       He is a snake oil salesman. He made his money catering to the elite, while shortchanging the little guys.
He greenmails people to get his way.

       Hey u/captaincarb if Trump is such a "hard hitting"  truth machine, why doesn't he bring up the Clinton's past relationship with convicted child rapist Jeffrey Epstien? Maybe because they have the same connection?

       Can't answer the question can you, if Trump has nothing to do with the fact, then why can't he bring it up?  It's all documented, no way for the media to spin it against him right? And what would be more hard hitting than pointing out the Clinton's connection with a convicted child molester.

       So there's someone out there researching this stuff, and they claim one of Trump's Russian mob connections provided girls to Epstein (I'm assuming flight/island/party girls, not Epstein's daily girls that he sourced from the local high school; but also assuming not the only ones because there are the owners of the other modeling agencies that procured, like Brunel). There is a HUGE can of worms behind Trump's modeling business (that supporters think he means A WORD he says on immigration after his own business practices is sad) and this is how you know the fix is in and they're all involved in this trafficking and underage prostitution business: neither the Republicans nor the Democrats will touch it despite there being multiple witnesses going, "Oh yeah, that's well known" and multiple articles out there about it if you go digging.

       Um, got plenty. Anyone who isn't a willing dupe is deluged with it on a daily. Or remembers it from the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 00s. Good luck voting for a child rapist buddy of Bill and Jeffrey who's lying through his teeth about he wants to do for "you." The things he said just years ago he was adamantly against. Running against the Clintons now, he's still on their side and you've been duped. Don't say you weren't warned, half a minute's Google and you'd see the truth - but you'd rather be deceived. Weak shit and pretty damned sad.
      </p>
      <p>
       He told a porn star she'd get a part on Dancing with the Stars and she fucked him because she believed him. He told you he'd build a wall and kick out all the Mexicans (that he actually depends upon for his own sad livelihood, wake the fuck up), and you work your ass off for him because you believe him. I get the porn star's naivete, I don't get yours when you have all the world's information at your fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy's going to fuck you up the ass because you asked for it, nay, begged for it...because you were too faithful to open your eyes even halfway. Sad.

       Um, got plenty. Anyone who isn't a willing dupe is deluged with it on a daily. Or remembers it from the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 00s. Good luck voting for a child rapist buddy of Bill and Jeffrey who's lying through his teeth about he wants to do for "you." The things he said just years ago he was adamantly against. Running against the Clintons now, he's still on their side and you've been duped. Don't say you weren't warned, half a minute's Google and you'd see the truth - but you'd rather be deceived. Weak shit and pretty damned sad.

       He told a porn star she'd get a part on Dancing with the Stars and she fucked him because she believed him. He told you he'd build a wall and kick out all the Mexicans (that he actually depends upon for his own sad livelihood, wake the fuck up), and you work your ass off for him because you believe him. I get the porn star's naivete, I don't get yours when you have all the world's information at your fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy's going to fuck you up the ass because you asked for it, nay, begged for it...because you were too faithful to open your eyes even halfway. Sad.
