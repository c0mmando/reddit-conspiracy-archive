    <div class="md"><p>He will not allow Trump to be president by default or to win fair and square.  When you read those podesta emails, you find out Obama has been in on it too.</p>

<p>Which means what?</p>

<p>It means that the entire security state has been in on it.  It means they are a den of snakes.  They&#39;ve ALL stole the election and we have direct proof of the intelligence community having stolen the election.  A problem with our system; and a problem with key people.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t just steal it though.  They got you to love it.  They got you to think it wasn&#39;t.  They used the media to screw up your psychology.</p>

<p>Do you know how many older people are going to see psychologists or psychiatrists over this election?  </p>

<p>Do you have any idea how much fear and anxiety this has created?</p>

<p>The damage to america is incalculable.  Stress causes medical problems.  People have lost their lives.  Their jobs.  Their capacity.  Everything they swore to us they were protecting, they were actually divesting from underneath us.  They sold the very ground underneath us and we&#39;ve fallen into a void.</p>

<p>We can quantify this injury if we tried.  If the United States did NOT have sovereign immunity, we ought to class action lawsuit the shit out of the government for 10 trillion dollars.  </p>

<p>You might think: that&#39;s stupid, they get money from taxes.  Oh no: we&#39;d make them sell all their deep state toys.  There goes prism right there, to russia.  And Echelon.  We sell their stupid UFOs and holograms.  There goes 20 billion dollar satellites to india.  There goes some nuke sales to france, spain and germany.  We&#39;d make them sell their precious fucking toys that they extorted throuhg our taxes, then we&#39;d line up the topmost people and shoot them to death as an example of how not to steal from america, sell our secrets to the &#39;alleged&#39; adversaries, create false wars and kill 4M innocent people and disfigure 250k US soldiers just so you can sell drugs in our country and lie about it while putting otherwise blameless black people in jail and continue to lie and continue to psychopathologize and continue to peddle crap and drugs and poisoned drugs and nonsense to the american people for decades and think you can get away with it.</p>

<p>yes I&#39;m flipping the fuck out right now!</p>

<p>These people are criminal gangsters and need to be deleted immediately from our userspace!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were rumors there would be leaks from within the FBI if Clinton didn&#39;t get justice. Maybe all of the leaks from Guccifer 2.0 to DCleaks to Wikileaks all came out of the FBI. Hmm, personally, I think Seth Rich was probably the source of the DNC emails given what Assange has said about Rich on Wikileaks&#39; behalf, but maybe this recent stuff Wikileaks has given us is from the FBI? </p>

<p>Or it&#39;s the case that I was right that there is no laws in effect due to the COG being active.</p>
