He was yelling close to the top of his lungs about how corrupt the Clintons are, how Haitians would burn his ear off talking about them when he was living in south Florida, and even about how you could follow the blood trail leading to them. Not only did my professor basically scream about her corruption and also bring up all the recent scandals MSM hasn&#39;t been reporting, but nearly the entire class of close to 30 people were chiming in on it too. There were only a few in there who still were supporting the bullshit. Everyone is starting to wake up and I fucking love it</p>

Marxist scum that made me a fan of Pinochet. And I&#39;m not talking about courses that would be appropriate to discuss politics, rather English and History teachers. Ultimately, It drove me into justifying spending 50k a year in Private education where at least if the teachers are conservative they will encourage debating their opinions and welcoming accept opposing ideas and defend their beliefs with ration and logic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fucking Pinochet? Really? You need a bit more education, then - especially if you&#39;re going to call yourself a conservative and not a fascist. Read Hannah Arendt, conservative political philosopher, (&quot;the banality of evil&quot;) - On Fascism. It lays out how Terror as government (Pinochet, Pol Pot, Stalin, or Hitler -left and right meet on the far side) doesn&#39;t work - it&#39;s inherently corrosive to the integrity of people. Even if you agree with the dictator, you have to watch over your shoulder because dictatorial systems are easily abused by people within them for self advancement. The value of life is cheapened to the point where your neighbor can denounce you to the Gestapo for being a commie because he thinks you&#39;re stealing his mail and have you carried away. The only defense against accusations of disloyalty is an evangelical devotion to the state, which leads one to be less critical (lol sheeple /s) and angrier at its enemies, which leads to more violence. In the end everyone in the entire country, top to bottom, ends up being driven by terror. Even the conservative pro-party father taking his kids to school has to speed past the executions in the street because he doesn&#39;t want his daughter to see the blood. &#39;Daddy what did they do to the man?&#39;. Eventually the whole thing collapses as trust disappears at the highest levels. The &#39;FEGELINE!&#39; scene from Der Untergang is the best dramatic example I know of if you&#39;re not a reader. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t respect individual liberty, you don&#39;t get to call yourself an American conservative. That&#39;s at the  heart of everything they do. Even COMMUNIST SCUM - if they are lawful, they have a right to their persons, to be free from unjust search and seizure of property, imprisonement and fucking execution without fair trial. I hope you&#39;re at a school good enough to teach you that. The day <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a> started FAVORING secret police and praising fascists is the day that irony died.</p>

<p>PS -  Advocacy for political candidates in a professional context or use of state university resources for political parties is illegal under California law. You could have complained to your school. It does actually make a difference (Full disclosure: California academic here, but I&#39;m still waiting on my first check from CTR  ;) ). </p>

<p>Edit - This message was sent from a private computer on personal time. Weird that I needed to say that, random <a href="/r/t_D/">/r/t_D/</a> poster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Schools -especially government-run schools- cannot be allowed to become places of political indoctrination. This is not just pro- candidate indoctrination, but anti-candidate indoctrination. Unless it was directly related to your education (i.e. applying critical theory to Clinton&#39;s claims or life) it really has no place in a classroom. It would be punishable (wrist-slappable, unless you just can&#39;t stop yourself) at most state run schools - I saw this relating to Bush II at in my department back in the day. Even though I agreed with all the claims - well not the christian jihadi ones, but you get the idea -  I still took this position.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just the moral dubiousness that&#39;s problematic, it&#39;s also damages the student-teacher relationship. Imagine how those few pro-Hillary students felt - during class for which they were presumably graded, they had to try to defend against fiery political attacks from their professor. Even if he acted with perfect integrity afterwards, they now have reason to fear otherwise- that they may be punished for dissenting opinions. They also, depending on how self-assured they are in their own politics, have lost respect for their professor&#39;s merit as an authority figure by engaging him as a peer on a matter of opinion/values.</p>

<p>Teachers shouldn&#39;t talk politics - it reeks of indoctrination and undermines the classroom. Any transitory gain you might see in attacking a bad candidate is totally overwhelmed by the structural damage to the system we rely on to produce adults capable of actively and critically participating in society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you get that the Democrats are falling into Marxism? I&#39;m to the left of Obama (Bernie Sanders-ish), and those of us over here are actually deeply disappointed with the drift to the middle in the Democratic party since Clinton. Do you feel, y/n, that the current administration is to the right of FDR and the New Deal? I&#39;d say almost certainly yes. Even Obama&#39;s nominally most socialist project - Obamacare - ends up being government-subsidized neo-liberalism (what you might more fairly call corporatism) as opposed to a command-economy based health system. </p>

<p>All these words have meaning. You can&#39;t just pick a political soup of phrases by your mood of the day. The differences between a Clinton Democrat and a Sanders Democrat, Between a Social Democrat and a Communist, between a Marxist and a Maoist are bigger than those between Rand Paul and Donald Trump, who are nominally in the same party. Imagine if I started mixing the two. Donald Trump wants to end international interventions and Rand Paul wants to expand our military to be better than ever. Because of this, I don&#39;t know if I trust Donald to defend our country! </p>
