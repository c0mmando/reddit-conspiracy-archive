        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There was a civil rights activism thingy. It was a tiny political party about communism and freedom and anarchy and antifa and feminism. There was a guy can memorize books just by reading 1 time, he was looking 3 years older than me he told 3 years younger than me. He showed me he is carrying 50 cards for entering to many countries and companies. Another guy told me he is vampire and they need my blood. Than 50 cards guy stole blood from red cross and gave it to them. They locked door. They told me they drinked blood. I have seen they drink blood from another guy and than hypnotised him and he runaway. They wanted me to join ISIS, said ISIS need soldiers. They acting like vampire, telling me they vampire and told me they will kill me. Than 13 of them suddenly disappeared. My friends told me, if this is secret dont talk about it and dont disturb me.</p>

<p>All of this things real. Many different supernatural beings living at Earth. And they really assassinating people. This happened at Turkey Istanbul.</p>

<p>Illuminati have 500 million members they located mostly Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Israel, America, Canada, UK, Finland, Norway, Deutchsland. They eating humans at Mexico, China, NK, Russia, Arabia.</p>

<p>All technology created by aliens and spiritual dimensional spirits. They coming from Saturn, Venus, Uranus, spiritual dimension. Demons can live in animals and humans. Aliens can be everything, they have technology and aliens not joining to olympics that humans compete. I am lazy and i will not write more. I am working for god of Earth and we hate humans, they are asexual. 333MEW8blueWolf</p>

<p>You have no argument. You are wrong.</p>

<p>Sure do. <strong>A Harvard study done for ten years involving over 26,000 people.</strong></p>

<p>Harvard professor of political science Robert D. Putnam conducted a nearly decade long study how multiculturalism affects social trust. He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that–when the data were adjusted for class income and other factors–the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust. People in diverse communities “don’t trust the local mayor, they don&#39;t trust the local paper, they don&#39;t trust other people and they don’t trust institutions,” writes Putnam. In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that “…we hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us.</p>

<p>Even Halyard knows this is all a pile of “feel good” shit. Like a religion, it relies on persecuting those who don’t agree to keep itself mainstream thought. After the study was released, Putnam was intimidated and harassed because he was accused of helping racists. He later came out and gave a very vague statement saying diversity “had problems but was worth it in the long run” to keep these morons appeased. This statement gives no indication of the “long run” and, in fact, is not quantified by anything. </p>

<p>According to conflict theory, distrust between ethnic groups rises with diversity, but not within a group. Putnam describes people of all races and socioeconomic statuses, ages, and both sexes as “hunkering down,” avoiding engagement with their local community–both among different ethnic groups and within their own ethnic group. Even when controlling for income inequality and crime rates–two factors which conflict theory states should be the prime causal factors in declining interethnic group trust–more diversity is still associated with less communal trust. Lowered trust in areas with high diversity is also associated with:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Lower confidence in local government, local leaders, and the local news media</li>
<li>  Lower political efficacy–that is, confidence in one’s own influence</li>
<li>  Lower frequency of registering to vote, but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups.</li>
<li>  Higher political advocacy, but lower expectations that it will bring about a desirable result</li>
<li>  Less expectation that others will cooperate to solve dilemmas of collective action (e.g. voluntary conservation to ease a water or energy shortage)</li>
<li>  Less likelihood of working on a community project</li>
<li>  Less likelihood of giving to charity or volunteering</li>
<li>  Fewer close friends and confidants</li>
<li>  Less happiness and lower perceived quality of life</li>
<li>  More time spent watching television and more agreement that “television is my most important form of entertainment”
Putnam’s study was published in 2001. Genetic cluster analysis of the micro satellite markers produced four major clusters, which showed near perfect correspondence with the four self-reported race/ethnicity categories. Of 3636 subjects, only 5 (0.14%) showed genetic cluster membership different from their self-identified race/ethnicity. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15625622">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15625622</a></li>

<p><em>Good Fences: The Importance of Setting Boundaries for Peaceful Coexistence</em></p>

<p>We consider the conditions of peace and violence among ethnic groups, testing a theory designed to predict the locations of violence and interventions that can promote peace. Characterizing the model’s success in predicting peace requires examples where peace prevails despite diversity. Switzerland is recognized as a country of peace, stability, and prosperity. This is surprising because of its linguistic and religious diversity that in other parts of the world lead to conflict and violence. Here we analyze how peaceful stability is maintained. Our analysis shows that peace does not depend on integrated coexistence, but rather on well-defined topographical and political boundaries separating groups. Mountains and lakes are an important part of the boundaries between sharply defined linguistic areas. Political canton and circle (sub-canton) boundaries often separate religious groups.</p>

<p>Where such boundaries do not appear to be sufficient, we find that specific aspects of the population distribution either guarantee sufficient separation or sufficient mixing to inhibit intergroup violence according to the quantitative theory of conflict. In exactly one region, a porous mountain range does not adequately separate linguistic groups and violent conflict has led to the recent creation of the canton of Jura. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that violence between groups can be inhibited by physical and political boundaries. A similar analysis of the area of the former Yugoslavia shows that during widespread ethnic violence, existing political boundaries did not coincide with the boundaries of distinct groups, but the peace prevailed in specific areas where they did coincide. The success of peace in Switzerland may serve as a model to resolve conflict in other ethnically diverse countries and regions of the world.</p>
