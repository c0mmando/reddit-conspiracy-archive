    <div class="md"><p>So the MSM and establishment political types can make broad sweeping statements like &#39;the election is not rigged&#39; and yet they jump on those who say it is.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be the first to admit perhaps &#39;rigged&#39; isn&#39;t the best word but to even imply there are no shenanigans, manipulations, schemes etc is ridiculous. </p>

<p>If the MSM was doing their job and reporting on news good or bad we would see the reports on the incidents of voter registration and vote fraud. The only place I&#39;ve seen stories of dead people voting is on the internet, might be from some msm subsidiaries/locally owned stations but it fails to make the national msm.</p>

<p>There are also those in denial and don&#39;t want their patriotic self esteem hurt. &quot;Not here, were not one of THOSE countries&quot;. Also if the establishment politicians and msm media admit there are voting and/or election issues like &#39;rigging&#39; or fraud they feel it might hurt their credibility then their job. So it winds up about being careers and not justice.</p>

<p>Throw in a biased msm colluding or enabling the status quo in the election process and world of professional politics and politicians we&#39;re screwed. </p>
