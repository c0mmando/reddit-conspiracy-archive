       It's propaganda. Devalue an individual as a whiner so they won't associate themselves with research and evidence of a rigged election. That was my search term for this post: 'rigged election' so anyone searching that today is conditioned as such to not be a whiner. You know they don't want anyone to actually think it's rigged.

       Interesting analogy. It triggers a dimly lit and creepy recollection in my experience of that type of controlled depravity.

       So the MSM and establishment political types can make broad sweeping statements like 'the election is not rigged' and yet they jump on those who say it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be the first to admit perhaps 'rigged' isn't the best word but to even imply there are no shenanigans, manipulations, schemes etc is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the MSM was doing their job and reporting on news good or bad we would see the reports on the incidents of voter registration and vote fraud. The only place I've seen stories of dead people voting is on the internet, might be from some msm subsidiaries/locally owned stations but it fails to make the national msm.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also those in denial and don't want their patriotic self esteem hurt. "Not here, were not one of THOSE countries". Also if the establishment politicians and msm media admit there are voting and/or election issues like 'rigging' or fraud they feel it might hurt their credibility then their job. So it winds up about being careers and not justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throw in a biased msm colluding or enabling the status quo in the election process and world of professional politics and politicians we're screwed.
