    <div class="md"><p>I am willing to believe that Trump did grab those women&#39;s tits. But, I also know that there are lots of girls who are down for that from a rich guy like Trump. The most important fact is that they said nothing at the time, and suddenly it comes out now before the election. It tells what is important here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Timing is everything. Honestly, if the worst thing a president does is grab a little ass... I mean look at Kennedy. Probably the biggest womanizer in presidential history and somehow no one has a problem with him. If he were still alive and heard about the Trump groping &quot;scandal,&quot; he would be like &quot;...yes? And...??&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because Kennedy left them begging for more, trump on the other hand left them pukeing and crying in the shower..</p>

<p>If Kennedy was a hobo he still would be able to pull amazing tail, on the other hand if trunk only owned a house, few cars and had 100k in the bank he would struggle to get a handjob in a brothel </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno. There are women out there who would be just as turned on by Trump&#39;s bank account. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say that women are okay with groping so long as it&#39;s done by a handsome man.</p>

<p>Bottom line: if the only dirt that they can dig up is that he talked about groping a woman a decade ago, then BFD. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t implying the Kennedy groped anybody against their will. I was implying that Kennedy knew the moves and was good looking. Meanwhile trump seems to significantly lack those skills so he has to fall back on his fathers wealth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically, the behavior that women will tolerate can be summed up by: &quot;Be attractive and don&#39;t be unattractive?&quot; Again, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair to women. Also, again, I think there are just as many women who could give a fuck about the looks would in fact be just as ok with groping because it&#39;s coming from a rich man. If you think Trump has to rely on his wealth to get women, fair enough, but again tale as old as time. And it doesn&#39;t make it less yawn-worthy that that&#39;s literally the only thing the media can find to grill him about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. There are plenty of women who would find Trump attractive enough. He is big and tall with blond hair, and when he was younger, he had better skin too. He also has the rich entitled pushy New Yorker type A personality that women adore. </p>
