       I've been watching the talk escalate about who or what you can trust. Single platforms have always bothered me since the power to censor always rests with the owner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's time to look into or create a decentralized forum system. A place where every user has control of all posts on their own system or server but share as collated data in a single forum. Much like reddit the data is voted by the masses but everyone still has access to banned and deleted info.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would still need some basic moderation to keep it on track and that's the part I can't figure out how best to implement. If the masses can vote for moderators then a takeover would be possible. Moderator keys could be provided by a trusted source (but who do you trust?).

       That's a pretty interesting idea, do you mean it's set up kind of like a torrent where everyone hosts a small amount of data but then it's formed together to form a website?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess with what you talk about with it being run by trusted moderators you could have a few basic rules which are the only thing that they're allowed to enforce. For example you could have "no sexual images, gore or hate speech" which is what a moderator has to enforce, a log can be kept of what they remove and if they remove anything other than those three categories they get removed as a mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, you could have a process where each mod has to have their actions approved by another mod chosen by random. This would make it so that a mod could only be corrupt if every other mod was too.
      </p>
      <p>
       To stop it from becoming bias (for example only being used by people from one side of the political spectrum) you could prioritise counter-arguments in the comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would have to abide by the law with it for it to become popular though, a site like Piratebay struggles when most countries block it and try to close it down. To make volunteers host the site you could offer incentives like being able to customise posts more or having their posts approved on priority.

       Yep, torrent style for the data was on my mind. But instead of everyone having little pieces I would let everyone have the option of keeping everything.
Instead of having to rely on screenies of deleted threads or links to hopefully archived info each user would have 'bins' those files get dumped to. And then if enough users deemed it shouldn't have been deleted or banned they could resurrect it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as reddit isn't completely sold out to the corporate masses it's hard to beat this platform. But there will come a day and I'd rather be proactive now then scramble later.

       I have been watching the slow decline of reddit for the past 6 months so have been developing my own reddit-esc site. It's not de-centralised, but it's something. After seeing what's happened over the past few weeks I've been ramping up development.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently signup/log in is done, sub creation is done, post creation is pretty much done (Just need upvotes). Top level commenting is done. It's also fully mobile responsive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just need to iron out a few kinks in replying to comments and get upvotes working and It's good to go small scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't share the url yet because I'm doing live development. But here are a few SS.

       Any talk about 'decentralization' or splitting up of this sub is an attempt to fracture communities. That's exactly what the establishment wants.  They've succeeded in breaking up this sub several times with poor alternatives.  Voat, steem, and 2 others although I can't remember their names.  One was like an alt facebook and it was bad but it trended really quickly then died.  edit: with steemit I already proved there was censorship, worse even than here. I've been battled on this, but screenshots and 3+ witnesses don't lie
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of creating a new sub or a new reddit really misses the point of what you're trying to accomplish, which is to have an uncensored discussion with 'real' people who aren't simply living 'advertisements' for hillary or for the nsa or for big agribusiness / pharma
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of better ideas on how to have a psychological counterinsurgency and or a rights-loss-prevention-management programme
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just going to say, I love this sub.  I love the people here.  I'm not leaving.  Not here not the other subs.  I'm standing my ground like trayvon martin

       I agree.  Wanting a more resilient architecture isn't a form of weakness.

       Nope, I'll be a redditor until it's finally sold out to corporate interest. But seeing how everything else eventually is compromised makes me think it will happen here. Once it does just moving to the next platform is just a waiting game until it happens there.

       I like the idea. I would definitely have a client app. The app would need zero or close to zero permissions. I don't install apps that want information.

       I don't like any programs or apps that require registry entries or permissions. A good coder can write self contained programs and let the user decide if they want to give extra usability.

       There are many projects working on networks that would easily support this.  Ethereum, maidsafe, storj, IPFS are perhaps the next version of the web.  It's too soon now, but the next couple of years will be interesting.

       Tip: add a 'premium subscriber' option @ $10 per month, to help cover operation costs. Give something trivial for subscribers, like a 'subscribers only forum', avatar option, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as it's up I'm ready to subscribe - I'll buy a year subscription up front (assuming it's legit).

       EDIT: another idea just came: charge businesses $25/ month for
       <em>
        business
       </em>
       accounts, which allow them to place links to their web pages in the footer of their posts.

       Is it possible to set up a system that penalizes you for mass amounts of downvotes? And for there to be rewards for citing credibility to the post (in the comments)?

       Yep, torrent style for the data was on my mind. But instead of everyone having little pieces I would let everyone have the option of keeping everything.
Instead of having to rely on screenies of deleted threads or links to hopefully archived info each user would have 'bins' those files get dumped to. And then if enough users deemed it shouldn't have been deleted or banned they could resurrect it.

       As long as reddit isn't completely sold out to the corporate masses it's hard to beat this platform. But there will come a day and I'd rather be proactive now then scramble later.
