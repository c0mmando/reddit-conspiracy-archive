       When the theory was first invented by globalists....They say that we have a decade. Nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they said that we have only a few hours in Copenhagen. Nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       THEN they said that 2015 is our last year (And it was our favorite zionist globalist degenerate pope francis who said that). Nothing ever happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now guess what? A global warming propaganda film played in my television (I am not watching it; The guests in my home were, i have activity outside of internet too, if they eat the lies let them eat them) right now. I can just smell "Fear Propaganda" right off the bat when i see that show. That show also mentioned "excess population" and "water shortages" which are also lies as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how they say to act now yet constantly change their timeframe once nothing happens in that year.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like this is how they silence and scare the gulible into accepting the NWO, a phony-green dictatorship that consists of mass improverishment for "nature".

       There is an overwhelming body of evidence that climate change is happening. The only debate is about how much human activity is contributing to that change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The positions range from one extreme to the other - from we contribute 0% to we contribute 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly 0% is not the case. Deforestation, agriculture and burning fossil fuels are all known factors and they are all human activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       And 100% is also not the case. We know the planet has been through numerous ice ages and has had periods of increased volcanic activity for example - and they were happening long before we appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is going to be somewhere between the two extremes.

       I too believe it's happening, but it's not entirely man made.  It's just being used for control and profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were several articles awhile back that stated climate change was happening on multiple planets within our solar system and the changes were likely solar.

       For fuck's sake, the climate is a dynamic system, and it and always has been changing. So what? That's the way it should be. It's the natural order of things.

       well i disagree, i live in Canada and you might not notice it where ever you are, but the last few years have gotten steadily warmer and drier. im in my 30's and i have never seen it as hot and dry as this past summer. something sure as hell is changing you may disagree with the why or how, but it is definitely happening at this point.

       Living in Sweden, I definitely believe in global warming.

       Winters have been super-weird lately.

       Either we don't get any snow at all during the winter months, and get a little in February/March (beginning of Spring), or we get insane blizzards that fuck with our infrastructure a lot.

       even here in Ohio things have changed since I was a kid. Winter never used to start this late in the season. We use to get snow by every christmas each year, now half the time its 45f or warmer and some days hit 60 in december. Winter stretches out in to april with snow now as well.

       You realize that global weather patterns shift over time, and that their shift is cyclical? Just because it's warmer at Christmas where you are does not mean the average global temperature has gone up. It doesn't even imply that. Be thankful that you are getting milder winters, because fewer people and animals die when it is mild, and less money is spent by communities.

       eh, milder winters also let more bugs survive and come back next summer. id rather have my cold and snow honestly. if I didnt want cold winters id move somewhere warm. I get that its cyclical, just seeing such a drastic change in my short life time so far seems extreme to me. Maybe im wrong, but just seems pretty quick of a change. Also id be fine with the deer population not ballooning up from mild winters as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I mean, the heat has increased for sure, this year again has been the hottest on record, I think its the past 12 have consecutively broke the previous years record.

       Yeah, which would fit the narrative. I'm in the southern hemisphere though, and it should be hot as fuck by this time of year where I'm at. I was wearing my flannelette jammies last night. Guess this man made climate change horseshit only works correctly up North. Either that, or anecdotal "evidence" of climate change is completely fucking worthless huh?

       well i look at it this way, is it more likely that the massively rich oil companies with a limited supply of fossil fuels would spend trillions of those dollars to lobby heavily against the idea of global warming?
      </p>
      <p>
       or that 100's or 1000's of overly educated, underpaid, scientists and professors would lie to you for zero personal financial gain, just to dismantle a multi-trillion dollar industry for a purpose i can not even think of?
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean really? now the idea of a carbon tax maybe eventually getting to the point of taxing your exhaled breath, is plausible in a very very distant future, i guess... but frankly i dont see the motivation for all of these fairly intelligent people to lie to you with no personal financial gain to be made.

       There are very few independently funded scientists.  If you want funding you toe the line or you massage the data to meet the expected outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't doubt there is climate change, I believe humans should learn to live in symbiosis with this planet.  We should manage finite resources and place a proper value on the true environmental costs of necessary but toxic industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, our military is spread all over the world spewing toxic waste and carbon dioxide.  We are bombing infrastructure and killing people in the name of freedom while arming, our enemies.  We destroy the soil with pesticides and herbicides.  Our own population is being manipulated and poisoned with food additives and plastics, pesticides residuals, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure TPTB don't care about the climate, the people, or the animals that are affected by the climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about control of the populace and huge money in carbon credits.

       You really don't see the dynamic that forces scientists to support the AGW hypothesis, regardless of their true opinions? Are you blind?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any scientist who dares to deny any of the major points of the AGW screed is immediately attacked and mocked by the press, the general public, and his peers. He becomes a non-entity in his field of study. Nobody wants to work with him. No university will hire him, because he is a pariah. He can't get a book deal, or get on television to promote his book. More than this, he will be fired from his teaching position, or his position in a major corporation. This has nothing to do with actual AGW facts and absurdities, it is due to social pressures. If you can't see these social pressures at work all around you, you must be blind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why almost all the distinguished scientists who have attacked the AGW scam are retired. Think about it! Retired means they can't get fired. Retired means they don't need to worry about research funding, or about getting a new job. It frees them to
       <em>
        speak the truth
       </em>
       which 99% of scientists will not dare do.

       Their gain is of course more money to themselves from poor countries like Africa or South America, and very soon us using their Agenda 21 lifestyles which invetably ends up with mass improverishment.

       One of the general goals of those who invented the man-made global warming scam is to force Westerners to use less energy. This is completely ass-backwards when it comes to growth of the economy and greater wealth of the individual. More energy use per individual translates into a better lifestyle. The idea that more energy use, in itself, is somehow evil or destructive is absurd, yet that is exactly what the AGW alarmists maintain. Energy is effectively limitless, and there is no upper cap on how much an individual human being should use.
