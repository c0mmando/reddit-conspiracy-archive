       The video is heavily edited, and it could be hypothetical scenarios. I'm not trying to discredit this, but money is now part of the equation of the video so it would be good to figure out what's going on.

       Most videos are edited are they not. He has the raw footage and there are frame counters on it too. Did he make Creamer visit the white House so many times..

       That's true, everything is heavily edited, but extraordinary claims deserve extraordinary proof imo. Whether or not we'll get it is another story but I think it's worth trying. Not just this but everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there anywhere where all of the evidence is compiled together? Like Creamer visiting the White House along with whatever else ties this all together?

       I feel you! At first I thought Trump was in on it too, it just seems he is. At the debate he appeared to strike a nerve when he brought up Bill and she called him a puppet... that is suspicious to me because of how it went down.

       I think the creamer white house is actual visitor logs (probably publicly available, but doesnt matter, as even CNN and other dem-backed media outlets aren't refuting that).. I agree, raw footage would be ideal, as far as I know, the video creator has more footage he's releasing on monday/tuesday :)

       They could've asked them, "What would you do if you wanted to cause trouble at a Trump rally?" Then took out the question while framing their scenarios as reality. I admit I only saw it twice, maybe I'm missing some definitive proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't doubt much that they did do it, I'm just wondering if anyone could find any proof because then I'll go out and defend it like no other.

       What's the problem? The more money spent on revealing the dirt of at least one gang the better. Better than pay the corrupt MSM. Clinton's posse could have done the same. Too bad they missed their chance.

       No editing deflection will change the condemning nature of the videos. Nice try though.

       I'm simply here to exchange ideas and read ideas to consider, thank you for yours! The only issue I see is when money enters a situation then nine times out of ten it no longer is for a moral mission but an agenda, that's all. If they successfully infiltrated the people in the video that is awesome! If something can be shut down with the truth then it should be.

       I'm going to preface this by saying that I'm not voting for Clinton (or Trump)
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it fascinating how stuff like this is getting downvoted. It's like people refuse to believe that both sides are doing the same thing. I think it was Rubio who gave a speech saying that the Republicans shouldn't be touting Wikileaks so much because their moment under the spotlight is yet to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's position of "If the system is rigged in my favor of course I'm going to take advantage of it" seems to be the exact same attitude that the democrats have allowed all the corruption that has recently been exposed. Trump just hasn't had the experience as a political figure to amass that kind of paper trail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we really think Trump's OpSec is so good that it's what's been keeping these sort of leaks from happening to him? There is some force (I really doubt it's Russia, but who knows) that is leaking all this Clinton stuff in order to damage her chances or winning. This is not happening to Trump. People who don't take this into account are being manipulated by some completely unknown force. To what end? Who benefits? What is
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       master plan?

       I understand your criticism, but are you even remotely aware of how shillary hillary is? She is willing to say anything to get elected. There are tons of videos exposing (in some cases, really badly exposing her) her of lie after lie. Trump is hard to catch in a lie. Did he support the iraq invasion? Youtube it.. He is obviously against it in every video i've seen. One video he says "Yeah.. i guess so..." but check out how he says it..

       Part of the reason it's getting downvoted is because it's MSM that's saying this, currently their proof is nul in a lot of people's eyes. I can understand that. The Washington Post's proof isn't necessarily reputable because it looks like a scanned page, someone could've typed it up, printed it, and then scanned it to look legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's position definitely is that, I agree! He'll take advantage of loopholes if he can, he has.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's Russia either, Trump doesn't have anything worthwhile to offer Putin. Hillary's got hacked because she's irresponsible and wants things her way, it turns out her way is not secure (which is one huge reason she should not be running a country). I could picture Trump paying loads of money to ensure his privacy, not to fit his personal preference of comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea wtf is going on this election. They did do the leak of that tape, maybe Hillary's campaign don't have the resources to access his stuff? I'm not sure what to think about all of this right now which is why I posted here, to have some ideas thrown around. Thank you for your contribution!

       Assange hinted at the recently murdered 27 yr old DNC staffer as the source of the dnc leaks. People leak stuff out of moral responsibility.. Not every time is it an agenda. Hillary represents more wars, more loss of civil liberties etc..

       thats what I dont get, it doesnt matter what horse you support in this race, the fact is both sides are doing shady shit. I dont understand it either honestly. Last time I saw something about Trump on here, people were saying since politics is so anti-trump to keep his conspiracy stuff there.

       It's in the middle of the page. It doesn't look credible though, anyone could've made it. There's no original source.
