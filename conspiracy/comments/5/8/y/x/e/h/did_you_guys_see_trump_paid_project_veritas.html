<p>I&#39;m simply here to exchange ideas and read ideas to consider, thank you for yours! The only issue I see is when money enters a situation then nine times out of ten it no longer is for a moral mission but an agenda, that&#39;s all. If they successfully infiltrated the people in the video that is awesome! If something can be shut down with the truth then it should be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to preface this by saying that I&#39;m not voting for Clinton (or Trump)</p>

<p>I find it fascinating how stuff like this is getting downvoted. It&#39;s like people refuse to believe that both sides are doing the same thing. I think it was Rubio who gave a speech saying that the Republicans shouldn&#39;t be touting Wikileaks so much because their moment under the spotlight is yet to come. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s position of &quot;If the system is rigged in my favor of course I&#39;m going to take advantage of it&quot; seems to be the exact same attitude that the democrats have allowed all the corruption that has recently been exposed. Trump just hasn&#39;t had the experience as a political figure to amass that kind of paper trail. </p>

<p>Do we really think Trump&#39;s OpSec is so good that it&#39;s what&#39;s been keeping these sort of leaks from happening to him? There is some force (I really doubt it&#39;s Russia, but who knows) that is leaking all this Clinton stuff in order to damage her chances or winning. This is not happening to Trump. People who don&#39;t take this into account are being manipulated by some completely unknown force. To what end? Who benefits? What is <em>their</em> master plan? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your criticism, but are you even remotely aware of how shillary hillary is? She is willing to say anything to get elected. There are tons of videos exposing (in some cases, really badly exposing her) her of lie after lie. Trump is hard to catch in a lie. Did he support the iraq invasion? Youtube it.. He is obviously against it in every video i&#39;ve seen. One video he says &quot;Yeah.. i guess so...&quot; but check out how he says it.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason it&#39;s getting downvoted is because it&#39;s MSM that&#39;s saying this, currently their proof is nul in a lot of people&#39;s eyes. I can understand that. The Washington Post&#39;s proof isn&#39;t necessarily reputable because it looks like a scanned page, someone could&#39;ve typed it up, printed it, and then scanned it to look legit.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s position definitely is that, I agree! He&#39;ll take advantage of loopholes if he can, he has. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Russia either, Trump doesn&#39;t have anything worthwhile to offer Putin. Hillary&#39;s got hacked because she&#39;s irresponsible and wants things her way, it turns out her way is not secure (which is one huge reason she should not be running a country). I could picture Trump paying loads of money to ensure his privacy, not to fit his personal preference of comfort. </p>

<p>I have no idea wtf is going on this election. They did do the leak of that tape, maybe Hillary&#39;s campaign don&#39;t have the resources to access his stuff? I&#39;m not sure what to think about all of this right now which is why I posted here, to have some ideas thrown around. Thank you for your contribution!</p>
