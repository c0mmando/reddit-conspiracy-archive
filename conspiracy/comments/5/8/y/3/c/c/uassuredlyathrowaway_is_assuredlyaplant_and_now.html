<p>I still remember when they made this guy a mod here. That was about when all the anti-semitic rhetoric started pouring out all over this sub, in an effort to detract legitimacy from valid discussions and turn a huge influx of newcomers (at the time) away from further investigation. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not at all surprised he&#39;s recently been modded at <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a>. It says he&#39;s only been a mod on this sub for 9 months, but that&#39;s not true, he must have been re-modded. The guy has been heavily involved in this sub for years.</p>

<p>Annnnd my ban is now imminent. Hope a few people see this though, that guy is shady business and always has been. Check the mod logs folks.</p>

<p>That is a lie. Why do you keep ignoring our actual questions?</p>

<p>The only matter left to resolve is not that 1 mod still hasn&#39;t left the team. It&#39;s that <strong>6</strong> new mods are rampantly censoring people there, and <strong>you&#39;re one of them</strong>, self professing to &quot;oversee it&quot;. You&#39;re welcome to remove my ban again to try prove your good intentions BTW - but why are we being banned?</p>

<p>SO the question is, <strong>why are you complicit in the takeover at <a href="/r/Wikileaks">/r/Wikileaks</a>?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why are the abusive mods still on the list, as overseen by you?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why were you brought on to &quot;oversee them&quot;, but have done nothing to stop them?</strong></p>

<p>You&#39;ve very much a part of the process over there and you claiming that you&#39;re helping doesn&#39;t cut it for us.</p>

<p>*Please don&#39;t circumvent my questions again, I&#39;m out of patience with your fuckery</p>

<p>I have no opinion on the topic of this post, but this statement reflects a structural problem with moderatorship and Reddit. </p>

<p>Admins don&#39;t have the power to lockout a crazed moderator?  Not to mention the lack of democracy &amp; accountability in mod membership.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a recipe for a poisoned tree when mods are appointed to permanent posts &amp; there is no mechanism for impeachment.</p>

<p>This is not an attack on AssuredlyAThrowAway.  It&#39;s a comment on his/her comment.  The clever firewall against impeachment of mods is a naked fatal flaw in Reddit.  And DOD&#39;s best friend.  But by the time Reddit recognizes this &amp; organizes a backlash, the damage will be long done.</p>

<p>Why would <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> gain 5 mods, right after the huge backlash of just gaining 2 more mods? 
You are one of the 5 new mods, and people are saying that Wikileaks is compromised just like Bernie sanders discussion when the &quot;new mods&quot; kept deleting everything good about Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>TL;DR: My question is: Are you for, or against wikileaks? Who are these other mods besides you, and why were they added with you at the same day?  Do you have any idea what the other mods intentions are at this point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand, the traffic spike in <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> was entirely unexpected so the head mod decided to add a few new mods. The original two mods who were added seemed to have a pro-Clinton bias and the community chased them off.</p>

<p>In response, 5 new mods were added (this time from <a href="/r/dncleaks">/r/dncleaks</a>) as a way to address community concern regarding the prior two poorly-vetted mods.</p>

<p>I was added because I mod <a href="/r/dncleaks">/r/dncleaks</a>, and tasked with providing oversight of the other moderators by way of my firm commitment to the free flow of information. To that end, I have long been a supporter of wikileaks and other whistleblowers, and have always advocated for their inclusion among the ranks of other journalists. </p>

<p>Aren&#39;t your tactics suspicious in light of someone, just yesterday, attempting to manipulate irc logs to libel my reputation? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As the old saying goes: as above, so below.</p>

<p>If we find that the people in power at the highest ranks on earth (politics + banks) are generally a bunch of fucking conscience deprived assclowns, we can start to wonder whether people in general who seek out and work towards obtaining power/control over other people (be it as a corporate CEO, or even a reddit moderator) could be at least MORE LIKELY to be sociopathic/narcissistic in nature. They get off on that shit, control. You will notice those things go hand in hand, if you investigate. </p>

<p>Thus, someone who seeks to mod...how many subs does this guy mod...? SEVENTY something, several very big subreddits? Plus the way the guy speaks in IRC.. Like others are beneath him, intellectually and fundamentally. Why the fuck does this guy need to moderate 70+ SUBS? Is he a professional fucking reddit moderator? What is going on here? I&#39;ve explained that. Either he is disinfo, or a narcissist/sociopath bent on control, Either way, not the person you want moderating fucking wikileaks right now especially.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surprise, surprise, it&#39;s the microcosmic equivalent of exactly what this sub is fighting against. This is why human&#39;s can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t hold power directly over other humans, it&#39;s why power will always be abused, and it&#39;s why we need to keep fighting, because with enough incentive, humans will always betray their comrades. It&#39;s fucked. Just like with the American election, we&#39;re always going to lose when the question is who should we elect to control us. We need to change the question to what will we do to better control ourselves. Because I don&#39;t know about you, but I am an adult and I do not need a leader, I need to be left alone and have my rights respected. Fuck leaders. Voluntaryism is the only way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You get it man. Microcosm is bang on. Some people have not made that connection yet. If the people in power in politics are corrupt and abuse it, and the people in power in business/banking are corrupt and abuse it, why would the people in power on reddit just so happen to be so peachy in comparison? Because it&#39;s &quot;just a website&quot;? No, this is a pattern of human behaviour that repeats itself on all different scales. </p>

<p>People who seek out power are generally not great people, not the type of people you&#39;d want making decisions for you. Yet because of their nature, they are MOST inclined to seek it out, and MOST inclined to stab anyone in the back to get what they want. This means there are FAR MORE sociopaths/narcissists in power positions in all realms that allow for advancement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why I say it&#39;s pointless. Myself and many others at the time literally watched from the sidelines for months as this whole website got taken over from the moderation perspective. I still visit because it&#39;s still an entertaining site and useful for many things, but the site is a corporate and political tool now. If you don&#39;t think this particular sub is already subverted, i dunno what to tell you. This sub has been controlled for a long long time.</p>

<p>As a vehicle for social opinion shaping and the like, Reddit is absolutely gold for entities with nigh-unlimited resources and time. You can make any opinion look like a popular opinion here, if you want. Anything. You can also snuff out any opinions you don&#39;t want seen. It&#39;s an extremely powerful and useful tool for those in control of it. This is a hub for worldwide discussion, where sentiments and focus extend far beyond, to other social networking sites, news sites, etc. </p>

<p>No, there are no &quot;decent&#39; mods anymore on the big or important subs. There just aren&#39;t. Logically speaking, &quot;they&quot; (for lack of a specific group to name) want full administrative control here. Much like &quot;they&quot; have full administrative control over, well, the fucking world. That means moderation as well on the subs they consider dangerous to their lines of rhetoric. In this case, wikileaks is #1 at the moment, so it should quite obviously raise eyebrows when 5-6 brand new mods are put in place there within the past few days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking as a mod, I accept that the subscribers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (of which I have been one for many years) like to sound off at the mod team, and posts like this will often generate plenty of enthusiastic traffic. </p>

<p>You are entitled to your views, but I think you have gone way beyond what might be classed as good-faith, constructive criticism. I think your attack on <a href="/u/assuredlyathrowaway">/u/assuredlyathrowaway</a> looks like a witch-hunt, and your derogatory comments about the mod team as a whole are unjustified.</p>

<p>What are you trying to achieve, exactly? </p>

<p>The mods of this sub will always face criticism because we allow free discussion of issues that certain people hate and/or want to close down. As far as the mod team is concerned, no conspiracy is off-limits on this sub. It is the users who decide what gets to the front page and what does not, and it will always be that way. </p>

<p>As has been stated many times, in the interests of transparency, all actions by the moderators of this sub (approve/remove posts or comments, ban/reinstate users etc) are available for scrutiny in the mod log - link in the sidebar. What&#39;s more, any decision by a mod can be challenged by a user, and the other mods will re-evaluate that decision. </p>

<p>For those who are confused by the purpose of Automoderator: this is a bot which automatically filters all comments from brand new accounts. These comments must be manually approved by a human mod before it will become visible to ordinary users. The reason for this is that this sub attracts a large number of trolls/spammers who create a throwaway account just to post drive-by insults. Automod keeps this tsunami of drivel at bay, with the drawback that genuine new accounts do get caught in the filter. If this happens, send a message to the mods to alert us, and we will approve your comment. </p>

I will say however that he could shine much more light to the crap that goes on in some of the other subs he moderates, but to be fair it&#39;s possible and plausible he does it with throwaways hehe.</p>

<p>edit: i went to the sub to check it out and found this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/58w83z/with_regards_to_the_free_flow_of_information_the/">thread</a>, what&#39;s not to like?

It&#39;s up to individuals to read through this and decide for themselves, like always.

<p>Its the same reason high level corporate types use business speak.  They want to sound like they&#39;re intelligent and they know what they&#39;re doing, but they can&#39;t reveal any of their actual agenda/behind-the-scenes happenings.</p>

<p>Its rampant on reddit.  Just like cops, once you start modding its suddenly you vs them and you&#39;re suddenly part of the &#39;in&#39; crowd.</p>

<p>And lighten up.  The conspiracy mod team was captured years ago and top mod is just an empty security measure.  Theres no reason to freak out like this, nothing has changed...you&#39;ve just realized whats going on.</p>

<p>What exactly makes <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> &quot;the last bastion of free speech&quot; on the internet? THE INTERNET IS FUCKING HUGE MAN. There are surely METRIC SHIT TONS of websites and forums that support free exchange of information. This is a purposeful hyperbole you&#39;re using in defense of corrupt moderators. This is a hyperbole that is supposed to make people cling to the idea that all the information here is legit, but it shouldn&#39;t, no, CAN&#39;T be trusted anywhere else. Certainly not, this is the last bastion of free speech! Seems a very good mindset to cultivate in readers if you want them eating everything on this sub up as gospel. Which is what you want to do if you&#39;re in control of it, spreading disinformation. </p>

<p>If anything, this website and this sub have so many eyes on it, it logically must have been very high on the list of &quot;dangerous truth movement&quot; sites, in the eyes of those in power. That means they started working on how to deal with this site and this sub a long time ago. And they did, and they will continue to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they must allow this sub to exist. From their perspective, they can&#39;t fully censor/ban a conspiracy sub, that&#39;s bloody obvious. </p>

<p>The best they can do is position themselves within it so that they have some manner of control over what&#39;s presented. Be that moderating, vote rigging, watering down the flow of content with flat out lies, etc etc. </p>

<p>If you think that&#39;s a difficult proposition on an anonymous website with instant registration, for a propaganda machine with unlimited time and resources, I again don&#39;t know what to tell you. You&#39;re not being logical in that case, so your opinion shouldn&#39;t be regarded as valuable. This sub has been and is constantly under disinfo attack, because the information shared can be dangerous to powerful people/entities. Those people/entities spend money on working against that. To claim anything else is to out yourself as either incapable of adding those simple few things up, or a shill.</p>

<p>Edit: the commenter <a href="/u/spasticbadger">/u/spasticbadger</a> knows his comments are meant to antagonize. Let&#39;s all take a moment to reflect on the rules of this subreddit. <a href="/u/spasticbadger">/u/spasticbadger</a> calls me out as a 12 day old account, yet I follow the rules of this subreddit. </p>

<p>why is <a href="/u/spasticbadger">/u/spasticbadger</a> trying to antagonize me? is it because he knows that if I call his words out I could be banned? I&#39;d rather not play his games</p>

<p>E2: &quot;You realise that accusing someone of being a shill is a bannable offence?&quot; <a href="/u/spasticbadger">/u/spasticbadger</a>, in this thread, to another user.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, spasticbadger, some people like myself are just outright better at logic than you are.

<p>I find it interesting that these days, asserting that someone is a shill in this sub can get you a ban. How very convenient this kind of reminder coincides with irrational antagonizing in defense of corrupt moderators... the very type of behaviour that would push someone like me to label an obvious shill a shill</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea... &quot;respectable&quot;. Cause this sub wasn&#39;t subverted years ago. Cause this sub isn&#39;t the definition of controlled opposition. </p>

<p>It is a rudimentary step of logic to go from &quot;Reddit, as a platform for the free and open exchange of information, is a danger to those whom are hiding important information&quot; to &quot;They are probably going to try to hijack that shit, so that they can control what&#39;s visible/whats being shared&quot;. </p>

<p>A 15 yr old kid in his moms basement can hack high profile sites, iphones, or program basic bot nets. And we&#39;re talking about all the money and the best minds and manpower in the world against the disorganized, anonymous common-folk here. Reddit was most definitely subverted years ago, this sub went with it. This is one of the most dangerous subs for them, for obvious reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it isn&#39;t. The dream reaction would certainly not be that people wake up to the imminent subversion and get wise to it, forcing them to verify his safety and that the accounts aren&#39;t compromised. If that&#39;s true and it gets out, they&#39;re worse off. They would much rather do it discretely and fool everyone, but good luck doing that online. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. It&#39;s very easy to confuse and deceive online, everyone knows this. It boggles my mind when people take this sub and this website at face value. Basic logic should eventually lead you to presume that it is controlled like basically all other popular media these days. </p>

<p>It has to look real. They have to employ tactics like the above (Claim you&#39;re under attack by your own users, ban them for demanding answers) or... posting a picture of hitler on the sidebar, with an obviously controversial documentary to boot, on a 9/11 anniversary, when 9/11 conspiracy talks are certain to arise, which leads to people thinking about conspiracies, which leads to new people visiting this sub. Which leads to people who are just maybe about to step out of their little bubble for the first time... seeing a picture of hitler on the sidebar and thinking &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are nazi apologists. It has nothing to do with the content of the doc, or the discussion about the doc, it was posted on 9/11 to deter new onlookers immediately because they aren&#39;t ready for that touchy of a subject. Yet it&#39;s the first thing they see, during a time of huge influx? Come on.. </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe there is some truth to these 9/11 conspiracies... wait, the fuc? Nazi apologists? Forget it, these people ARE crazy&quot;. It doesn&#39;t matter if the doc is legit, it could be 100% true. The problem is, people on the fence/newcoming &quot;truthers&quot; are simply not going to accept it, period. It&#39;s off-putting, that&#39;s the whole point. You can&#39;t really attack it either as I am trying to now, because again, the content could be legit, true even. You might look like you have a closed mind, I don&#39;t. Mods can defend it, saying it&#39;s a totally legitimate doc and it&#39;s right to question. But again, it&#39;s not about the doc and whether or not the content is legitimate. It&#39;s about the timing, in this case. </p>

<p>I mean, this is brilliant work when you observe it for what it is, albeit disgusting, it is brilliant social engineering. Every move they make like this serves multiple purposes to their benefit.</p>

Apparently this comment is in fact being monitored by CTR paid shills and their &quot;mod&quot; CTR tools. If you watch for page for a few minutes, you&#39;ll notice that each comment re-tracts to the original vote-value that was recorded by the CTR tool the mod uses when the mod started their program. The concept itself is simple... but talk about the ultimate height of deception! As he said, well played George Soros! Fb?! Twitter?! Instagram?! No problem! :)

Maybe this was the plan all along.
They incite violence at rallies and on the streets to create this tension among Americans. The election happens and one of the candidates wins. Which may or may not matter. Riots may happen. I&#39;m not going to say they are definitely going to happen. I don&#39;t know that.
This could be the final straw that brings out the Martial Law.

I think the Tweet that stated he was alive was actually an announcement to all the players involved that JA was dead. The airport near the embassy was evacuated at the same time due to a &quot;chemical spill,&quot; but more likely was to safely evacuate JA&#39;s corpse from London. Also, the attached map had what could be construed as blood stains/blotches on the United States.

<p>Assuredlyathrowaway is not a real user, or if he is, he&#39;s just a total shitstain who censors and is not for free speech at all, he uses his position of power to promote his own perspective. Either way, he has no business being mod of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a>, yet there he is. </p>

<p>Sorry folks, reddit ain&#39;t free and open. Reddit is highly monitored and controlled, it was depressing to see it unfold as it happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I have no desire to spend hours compiling that info for you in an effort to persuade you. This is how it is in my opinion, based on my personal obseravtion.  If you want to do the investigation for yourself go for it. This is my opinion, nothing more.</p>

<p>I remember when the sidebar was changed to flaunt an anti-semitic rhetoric documentary during a period of time where the public was beginning to wake up to conspiracy theories. The perception was beginning to change from tin foil hat lunatic, to &quot;hey, maybe these guys were on to something&quot;. A lot of people were beginning to browse <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> at the time. I honestly can&#39;t remember the topics of debate at the time, just that I ended up leaving this sub when I saw the standard subversion tactics being employed here as I&#39;ve personally seen before. As we know now, thankfully the idea that we might have been right was investigated enough that it held, notice how you almost never hear the term conspiracy theorist anymore? </p>

<p>Anti-semitic fringe shitposts are huge when it comes to subversion, at least they were a couple years ago. How better to make a group of people look insane than present your uncertainty over the holocaust, nay, your PRESUMPTION that the holocaust didn&#39;t happen, as your front-page?</p>

<p>As I said, all I remember was this guy instantly being recognized and upvoted a lot, he was all over this sub back then and that was around the time the quality of the sub turned to shit. Now he&#39;s mod of <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> along with 5 other new mods, during a critical time for wikileaks. It&#39;s just.... strange...</p>

It is extremely difficult to differentiate fact from fiction anymore, I think we are all starting to recognize that. </p>

<p>If there&#39;s a huge push on something that seems totally irrational/unreasonable/crazy/outlandish, that you think the average critical thinking individual would be put off by, there&#39;s probably a potential it&#39;s being used for exactly that purpose. It serves multiple purposes, mainly that it floods the flow of info with trash, making it difficult to sift through and find valid posts, and simultaneously makes users here look crazy, as if that is &quot;everyones mandate&quot;. This generally turns newcomers off at first glance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The anti semetic postings started a hell of a long time ago, like, when bipolarbear0 was around. Then we had jcm and the conspiratard crew before they fractured when that sub was a meta hell. After the snowden postings we got more government tools being activated and used, as the bots became common place for flagging content. Started with business applications for online persona management firms, but when the fusion centers went online during occupy wallstreet, damage control and subversion became the norm on the web as the filters caught more keywords and it was no longer Monsanto shilling.</p>

<p>Some of the mods here have been put through a lot of pressure, promoted their own content, had the petty squabbles. This happens. They&#39;re human. I&#39;ve been here, lurking in the shadows for years as a regular user. Aata isn&#39;t bad, nor does he censor. The rules have been enforced more in the past two years, but that&#39;s been due to the rise in disruptions and hate spam from places like is conspiracy racist baiting folks. Aata has been dramatic at times, but he isn&#39;t the cause of the stupidity around here. We had been infiltrated by the alt right two years ago when some of the racist sub&#39;s moved to voat after being shut down here. They are mostly organic, the movement was co-opted however (around Ferguson) and funded by soros, just like blm. Most of the idiots from that batch trying to make this place look bad moved on, I still see a few folks who where from the racist sub&#39;s here, but they tend to discuss things and just happen to have opinions that aren&#39;t politically correct. That&#39;s fine. The sidebar thing was poor taste, but it happened around then, when the division of an attempted race war was being instigated. Can&#39;t say I fault any one of the mods who chose to put that up at the time due to the high tensions. </p>

<p>Just wanted to clarify a bit about the timeline since you said you haven&#39;t really been around much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my hypothesis on why they do not censor as much on r/conspiracy as r/politics or r/worldnews. It is a point of legitimacy of where the info comes from. If the only subreddit saying Hillary&#39;s political team kill Americans then everyone thinks it is just a conspiracy still. So the truth is disseminated but the uninformed people don&#39;t believe. Some actually go as far as denying the truth that comes out of this subreddit simply because this is &quot;r/conspiracy&quot;
I think some people are catching on thoughand have switched to getting their news from this subreddit. I expect the moderators to do something about this to discredit this currently great subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not censored because that would immediately out them as disinfo. They can&#39;t censor or ban or block out conspiracy forums willynilly, it&#39;s obviously going to get called out. To say &quot;nothing really gets censored here so its all good&quot; is a terrible argument in this case. A disinfo agent would not be able to do that in this situation, moot point.</p>

<p>Plus, the more insanity that flows through here, the harder it is to discern whats true and what isn&#39;t. They likely don&#39;t even touch actual truth, because how on earth are you supposed to be able to know for SURE that it&#39;s true? Theres endless theories and claims here.. You can&#39;t really tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the problem for the shills here. I don&#39;t play into subversion traps and logical fallacies. I know the game, I&#39;ll gladly keep replying until they can&#39;t respond anymore without making it blatantly obvious they must be a shill, because shills almost always rely on flawed logic that can be easily defended and outright exposed if you just keep the conversation logical. They also can&#39;t very well delete this submission or ban me without raising immediate flags. The only option for them right now is to just wait for this to fade into obscurity and carry on with the rest of the disinfo in the meantime.</p>

<p>If they push too far against someone who is wise to what&#39;s going on, they&#39;re left with few options to discredit you without becoming obvious. Either they become illogical, at which point most people will realize they&#39;re being deceitful, or they just disappear entirely which is another classic indicator of deception in online forums. Hit and run.</p>

<p>Logic favours the truth. Shills rely on brute force confusion and diversion. It is defensible. Is this making a difference? Is there a point in the end? Maybe not much, but I do like to put a little pressure on these people now and then. If all I did was make a couple shills feel a bit uneasy today, burst their little ego-bubble for a moment to remind them how unfortunately rotten they ended up on the inside to achieve and maintain their fleeting power, I&#39;m okay with that. </p>

<p>Some want to say I&#39;m ranting because I&#39;m calling these people sociopaths, or narcissists. Call a spade a spade. If I believe what I&#39;m saying, and I really do, the only reasonable explanations in my mind for that type of behavior are really narcissism or lack of a conscience, either way they are self/ego oriented, motivated by control and thirst for power seats, not for the good of all. No average, good hearted individual would do these kinds of things. This is a special kind of heartless, the same variety as any two-faced politician, banker, or a nestle CEO. Frankly, it is not their&quot; fault&quot;, it must be genetic or nurtured to some degree, but it still should be noted and exposed as this type of behaviour hurts everyone for their own benefit. I try my best not to judge these people, and simply view them as anyone else. Products of their (randomly distributed) nature/nurture experiences. This type of behaviour is obviously advantageous to the individual. It could even be seen as an evolutionary advantage in the modern age to be so cold, deceitful, conscience depried. It obviously reaps great benefits for many of the rich and powerful. Perhaps that is part of it too.</p>

<p>Yes, we will be taking a hands-off approach to moderation for the time being; although we will, of course, be actively moderating any attempts by CTR, et al to use said free speech policy as a way to forum slide with nonsense distractions.</p>

<p>What&#39;s ironic, and very frustrating, is that the very people complaining about yesterday&#39;s mod problems are, themselves, unwittingly playing a pawn for CTR, et al by distracting from the actual content of the leaks/Julian&#39;s health.</p>

<p>is a brilliant documentary that challenges the official narrative of World War 2 and all the bullshit claims made by the establishment.</p>

<p>Can you show me the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/about/traffic/">traffic stats</a> for that day to support your theory?</p>

<p>Not forgetting that the documentary in question is an excellent one</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, that you stooped to such lame arguments to combat mine (&quot;emotion,&quot; really?) means you aren&#39;t going to agree with me and have a vested interest. You&#39;ve shown your hand, so there&#39;s no real reason for me to do your own homework for you.</p>

<p>By your comments here, I judge you are not in the least bit curious and have no issue with our community being purposely marginalized, so this comment is more for anyone else curious.</p>

<p>My comments stand, for others to read and form their own opinions. It may also behoove those curious to wonder what was posted here the week of the weird anti-conspiracy conspiracy video and what that was trying to cover. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve long since given up on regular users here being able to change this technique (maybe the newer mods might, should it happen again, I know we&#39;ve got some good eggs), but there&#39;s not much we can really do except keep participating and allowing visitors to see that there&#39;s good stuff here, good content, and good people: and the infiltration is just that - infiltration. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll never truly be rid of it, such is the nature of intelligence and corporate ops to marginalize our viewpoints. We just have to realize it for what it is, and work within it because I suspect the true purpose is to push us out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well.. he posted the connection several times, you continue to ignore it or ask for even further proof on that proof. There was a large conspiracy related thread on the front page that generated huge traffic towards <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Suddenly, Hitler. I distinctly remember logging in that day and seeing that sidebar, and remember that there were a shit ton of users visiting that day due to the aforementioned front page post. Do we need traffic numbers and logs to put 2 and 2 together here? No. It was an easy way to scare new users off before they dug deeper, it&#39;s bloody obvious.</p>

<p>What you are doing here is trying to pressure this person off a legitimate observation, by asking for less and less valid, more and more difficult to produce bodies of evidence. This is a simple connect the dots, you&#39;re asking for proof where it&#39;s not required, because what he&#39;s explaining is obvious to anyone with a functional brain.</p>

<p>But go on and continue asking him for further and further and further clarification, down to the website in its entirety on the day of, in binary, if that suits your shillin&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pointless. These people (Him and other users/groups sharing control of individual accounts) are highly trained professionals. They are masters of deception, and they have an unlimited amount of time to concoct their responses to this type of statement. </p>

<p>Not only that, it IS rather impossible to prove such a statement, and they know that. No post is made on any of these accounts that might compromise the &quot;presented identity&quot;, they are consistent. Not to mention the plethora of &quot;regular user&quot; accounts they can pop in to appear to be defending them/whatever it is they need the accounts to say.</p>

<p>Take it in good faith that the flow of free, rational information online is a dangerous thing and that it is and has been under attack for many years. If it&#39;s too obvious, it will be recognized and it&#39;s even worse than if they just didn&#39;t meddle at all.

<p>Can you show me the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/about/traffic/">traffic stats</a> for that day to support your theory?</p>

<p>Not forgetting that the documentary in question is an excellent one</p>

<p>You have offered your opinion and that is it</p>

<p>I am saying it was posted to marginalize us during a time of peak traffic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the very fact that he is a mod on wikileaks is cause enough for alarm. </p>

<p>Go have a look at what another brand new mod just posted there, a &quot;survey&quot; for subscribers to &quot;set the new guidelines&quot;. It is blatant data mining. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/58xzuz/evolution_made_easy_direct_voting_for_social/">Go have a look.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think all one can do is keep a critical mind.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of ironic.. We have always considered the internet to be the common mans greatest weapon against those in power, I have for many years.. But more recently, I&#39;m starting to think it&#39;s actually their greatest weapon against us. The level of disinfo and social engineering online is absolutely staggering lately, and very refined over the years.</p>

<p>Why were you vote manipulating for yourself? </p>

<p>Why is it that so far, I ask and answer questions, while all you do is ask questions and then deflect my own with further questions? Because there are no viable responses to what I&#39;m presenting, you&#39;re a narcissist, you&#39;re deceitful, you&#39;ve been outed many times before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched this same crew trying to witchhunt AAT for years.  He was a lone mod doing a lot of good work over at worldnews for a while and the snoonet crew have led these campaigns against him every few months since.</p>

<p>It looks like it&#39;s pretty easy to rile up some of these young nihilists over here, and there are a handful of people who use that against certain mods on this sub.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m for a degree of mod &quot;censorship&quot; here if it&#39;s done in a transparent manner and by thoughtful moderators. these guys are pretty obvious when they pop up.</p>

<p>• vaccines prevent major diseases from spreading so it&#39;s important for people to get vaccinated</p>

<p>• contrails are not chemtrails, there is nothing special about contrails as they are mostly water vapor</p>

<p>• the earth is a sphere and believing it&#39;s flat means you lack deductive reasoning skills</p>

<p>• space isn&#39;t some made up thing, there are people on the International Space Station right now. They even have a live stream so people like you will eventually figure it out.</p>
