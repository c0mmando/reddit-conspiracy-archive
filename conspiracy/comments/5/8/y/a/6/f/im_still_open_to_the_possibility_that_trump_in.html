    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and Obama said he would run the most transparent administration in history. We need to stop taking what they say they are going to do seriously and look at the big picture. A criminal enterprise has infiltrated and subverted the American government. Americans need to accept that it has happend and do something about it. Right now it seems like Americans are in severe denial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I&#39;m sure bringing in bills accusers, one of which he admitted to under oath to the second debate was going lightly.</p>

<p>A very small percentage of Americans see wikileaks favorably going all out on the wikileaks agenda would of made him seem like a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>If you look at his al smith dinner speech he went all in.</p>

<p>What would you have wanted him to bring up from wikileaks? he could have only used emails actually sent by clinton. </p>

<p>a plant wouldn&#39;t want to audit the Fed and impose congressional term limits</p>

<p>Trump is in play to further smear critical thought among the college &quot;educated&quot;. </p>

<p>If I was playing a long game I&#39;d put Trump center stage for four years to further demoralize and demonize anyone exercising critical thought. I&#39;d accompany that with manufacturing a severe economic crisis to rid future generations of the &quot;conservative prosperity&quot; meme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel has committed multiple war crimes against the United States, crimes that have never been answered to,  keyly the USS liberty and the theft of nuclear weapons information by Israel. Yet Trump calls them our greatest ally. </p>

<p>Let me repeat that,  <strong>Isreal bombed the USS liberty and tried to blame it on Egypt. They murdered US citizens and were never held accountable for it. Trump calls them our greatest allies</strong></p>

<p>You can keep focusing on things that happened 50 years ago, but in the geopolitical climate of today they are our only non muslim ally in the area and they&#39;re a nuclear power.  Having an ally in the Levant  with access to the Mediterranean is something empires have fought over for thousands of years. On top of that they share a border with Iraq and syria do I need to explain how that&#39;s advantageous?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay then, how about Israeli ties with 9/11, is that recent enough? And frankly I don&#39;t give a shit if it was 300 years ago when it happened, the point is they were never held accountable. </p>
