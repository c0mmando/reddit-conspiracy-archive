Still, for every instance of her looking like she has at least another decade to look forward to, there&#39;s a video of her looking like she&#39;s ready to keel over. In fact, there&#39;s video of her literally keeling over. So, who knows? Maybe there are enough drugs in the world to prop her up for a full term. And it is just awful of me as a fellow human to feel unadulterated glee at the thought of her taking her daily dose of rat poison.</p>

<p>She&#39;s not going to win. You think she was disliked before? Well eight years later she is absolutely reviled, except by the hardcore Democrats. The country knows she is garbage as a human being. The informed voters know what she is really about. We&#39;re not going to vote for her.</p>

<p>Through proxies she&#39;s been able to dig up old tape of Trump and associate Trump with racists - all without being seen as actively participating in any of it.</p>

<p>Also, the wikileaks emails have revealed that her camp focused on Trump and legitimized him because they wantex him to win because in their words, they thought their candidate was so flawed she couldnr beat a real candidate. They also had GOP plants in the media (louise mensche) to lead Reps to Trump. Lastly an email out today shows one of their propaganda writer Budowsky wrote an &quot;is trump a plant&quot; article to foment the concept you are spouting.</p>

<p>Trump isnt a plant, not wittingly, but the Hillary camp did push and manipulate for him to help her win.</p>

<p>I thought like you and was going to vote third party, now that I believe he isnt likely in on it, he gets my vote. Never another Clinton, or Bush.</p>

1. She&#39;d be in jail
2. The media would be investigating in the slightest
3. She would actually have to have a press conference because of this, at the least.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of a campaign in modern American history where a candidate has so thoroughly disappeared from the campaign trail. Even if you want to push the definition of modern back to the era where candidates campaigned from their front porches, the media still had many times more direct contact with the candidate.</p>

<p>With so many people knowing so much, with so much money moving around, and with so much media complicity, with so much fraud, deceit and double-dealing, I&#39;m really confident there have to be charges applicable to a large amount of these people. This whole thing wreaks of a giant criminal enterprise.</p>

<p>the rich folks ran this scam using Obama on the dems and now they&#39;re running the same scam on the idiot republicans.

<p>it&#39;s the <em>exact</em> same scam that was run using Obama 4-8 years ago. Every time some reason people forget that the other party is just as corrupt as the one they&#39;re &quot;against&quot;. It works every time.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, I don&#39;t know how people couldn&#39;t understand that Trump was nothing but controlled opposition.  The man, after saying he would be the only one tough on ISIS, complained and whined about being made fun of on SNL! Why would he do that? Because he talked and appeared a little too tough so he had to off the crazy wagon again.  Cry about SNL.  Every time he gets ahead he finds a way to sabotage himself.  So either Trump is an idiot, or he was never in it to win it for real.  </p>

<p>Honestly, thing about this on a grander scale.  Nearly every republican candidate met the requirements for being President better than Trump.  Trump had zero plans during the primaries and people like Kasick who had detailed good plans, were ignored by the media.  He has a long history of lawsuits silencing dissent against him, lawsuits against him for stiffing contractors, and a long stories womanizing history.  He was literally the only one of the candidates with enough baggage to sink him a million times over.  But he some how won handily.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe Americans are really so shallow that a crazy yelling man was enough to get his vote.  The fix was in from the beginning.  A few &quot;true believers&quot; mixed in with plants and Trump was in and thus so was the fix.  The second Trump was clearly going to be the nominee, I knew the DNC would be putting Hillary in office, even as she was tied with Sanders.  They undercut Sanders, made sure crazy Trump got in, and thats that.  Look for Trump to keep finding ways to make him look crazier and less competent in the coming weeks just to make sure there are no surprises.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, I literally predicted everything exactly how it has happened based on the way I view things.  It going exactly like it is only goes to prove my point.  Trump is not, and will not, win.  He was never meant to win and he never intended to win.  Hillary was in from the beginning.  The only true vote for freedom is voting outside of the rigged party system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol.  Right.  The rich and powerful don&#39;t want another person who is rich and powerful, who has made his money by cheating the little guy under him by stiffing contractors and filing bankruptcy when it is beneficial to him, in office.  This is the same blind bias that got us into this situation.  He was put there to lose.  He knows it.  They know it.  Hillary knows it.  Thats why he deliberately keeps doing stupid shit like crying about SNL.  Gotta make sure he doesn&#39;t win, thats the deal.  And in the end, he&#39;ll be back sitting and sipping cogniac with his old Clinton buddies again once this is over. </p>
