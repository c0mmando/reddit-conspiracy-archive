<p>Lol, this is probably the easiest way to go about it.  No expensive giant hologram systems.  No need for fancy CGI on TV.  </p>

<p>The Dallas shootings went down the same way.  Just a bunch of unverified information being thrown out by the media:  </p>

<p><em>There are 5 shooters on buildings!!</em>  </p>

<p><em>Now the four shooters are on different spots!</em>  </p>

<p><em>An hour later we report the three shooters have moved again...</em>  </p>

<p><em>Five hours later, the police have cornered the one shooter and blew him up with a robot in a drywall made parking garage.</em></p>

<p><em>It&#39;s been over 12 hours since the shooting rampage last night.  Police have now stated there were no shooters at all, it was just an out of control police robot.  Police suspect the Russians hacked the robot....</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most frustrating aspect of that is that it has actually been in the news that the news has lied to us, for example with the Iraq war barely any journalists seriously challenged the government&#39;s lies even though plenty of people knew the truth that there were no WMDs and the evidence was there, everyone knows that now. And everyone knows that our media has not only lied, but has broken the law and done things like hacking peoples phones or covering up paedophile rings etc. People KNOW this, yet still when you tell someone the truth about something, even if you can provide links to documents with evidence, they say you are acting like a crazy conspiracy theorist and just dismiss it. Seems like the only thing they won&#39;t believe the news about is the news that the news lies and protects the powerful from the consequences of their crimes and corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a time when the American dream was a real thing. When a guy could work a factory job and be able to own a home, a new car and support a family with a stay at home wife. Or start a business and make a really good living. Nowadays most factory jobs don&#39;t pay enough to support a single person, let alone being able to buy a house or car. your lucky if you can cover your rent for your shitty outdated apartment, and your bills, food becomes a luxury at times. Not to mention most factory jobs treat you like a literal slave and try to make you work 16-20 hours a DAY, then fire you for &quot;production issues&quot; because you ONLY work 14 hours a day. This country is fucked. Pretty soon im just going to start looking to move outside of the US. </p>

<p>EDIT: this actually happened to me. Was working a factory job was asked to work 16-20 hour days. I refused and ONLY worked 14 hour days and was let go due to &quot;production issues&quot;.</p>

<p>All of our freedom&#39;s aren&#39;t quite gone yet, but we&#39;re currently in a plutocracy-style of government. Sorta of a transition phase.</p>

<p>TPP will help finalize that transition. It&#39;ll allow the Saudis to further rule the US through proxy servants like Hillary Clinton. It&#39;s why Hillary is so hostile to Putin and Russia: Russia is a direct energy competitor with the Saudis.</p>

<p>If you know a thing, then you <em>know</em> it.  “Pretending” not to know is just…well, stupid really.  If you know, you <em>know</em>.</p>

<p>And once you understand that ignorance is not now nor will it ever be “bliss”, then it&#39;s simply a thoroughly self-defeating thing to want to actually <em>continue</em> living in ignorance.  Pretty basic concept really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>im not sure why its so hard for you to wrap your head around the concept of enjoying day to day life and not being burdened with foresight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you understand the simple, basic concept of cause and effect - and that actions have consequences - then it would simply be ignorant to continue doing nothing but keep trying to <a href="http://www.relatably.com/m/img/meme-faces-happy-crying/Happy-Crying-Face-Meme-01.png">&quot;live in the present because ignorance is bliiiissss!&quot;</a></p>

<p>Again, once you understand that ignorance is <em>not</em> “bliss”, then you’d be pretty stupid to want to continue down that path.</p>

<p>But whatever.  Knock yourself out if that’s the kind of life you want to live.</p>

<p>Everyone learns and figures it out eventually at their own pace I guess.</p>

We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.”</p>

<p>The point the quote is making is people in NK or USSR were/are fed propaganda and have/had no means of getting the real truth of news/the inner workings of government so most of them went along with it and many took this propaganda as truth. In other words both populations could not get a real unpropaganized view of their country until the regime fell/will fall.</p>

<p>With the current world, people are getting fed (not to the same degree) propaganda from news stations and media that are pushing their narratives and agendas. What makes us different is the internet age and such things as wikileaks have given us multiple insights and raw facts to base our opinions on rather than just absorbing what the media/newstations tell us the story is (ie. see CNN reporter talking about how looking at Wikileaks is illegal so the only way to see it is through the media, which is false). </p>

<p>Even with the influx of resources/unbiased facts/differing viewpoints, people are <strong>WILLINGLY</strong> continuing the believe the media&#39;s views on such things. There are normal people accepting these narratives and even going to lengths to call out/silence people who don&#39;t believe them. The government doesn&#39;t have to do a thing, the people doing their work for them. You could argue under NK and USSR the people were much more &#39;brainwashed&#39; but what choice did they have to get any information that wasn&#39;t propaganda? If the people in Stalin&#39;s Russia or Kim&#39;s NK got their hands on the kind of facts we have available, would they turn a blind eye like many are doing today? Would they continue to believe the propaganda? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>naw, the point is that 4chan focuses on popular topics where it sprouds its often reactionary agenda while maintaining some bullshit &quot;that is the truth!&quot; propaganda. </p>

<p>To go a step further: 
Stalinist Sovietunion found a few dandy ways to build their narrative - they published fake information, did hold fake trials and went as far as to delete unwanted persons from pictures and destroying the original (e.g. Trotzky and Kamenev <a href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/%7Ehick0088/classes/csci_2101/false.html">http://www.tc.umn.edu/~hick0088/classes/csci_2101/false.html</a>)</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t so much hiding the truth as rather establishing a certain narrative and part of this narrative was diminishing the efforts of jewish intellectuals during the revolutions - a narrative (nwo under the hands of jewish bankers!!!) which is sadly popular with 4chan/ this channel.</p>

<p>And now let&#39;s take a look at the claim that you can be &quot;instantly be spoon fed actual truth&quot;:
First of all you have no way to verify information found on boards like 4chan.
Secondly the information you get by using search engines is preselected/filtered - there is a very real possibility that you end up in your own bubble / in the bubble of a small community. The only difference to the &quot;truth&quot; of the &quot;mainstream&quot; (*) media is that your narration is out of touch with the intersubjective truth of the rest of the society.</p>

<p>(*) There is a massive difference between outlets like NYT,NZZ,Guardian and e.g. the daily mail and yet there is always &quot;the mainstream media&quot; to complain about.. -.-</p>
