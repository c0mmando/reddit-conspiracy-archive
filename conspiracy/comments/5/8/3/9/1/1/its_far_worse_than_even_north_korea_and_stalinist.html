       This is all because of 'the news' here in uk literally90% of people won't believe anything if it's not on the news. You say anything remotely conspiracyish to them and their first reply is almost always 'oh well I haven't seen anything about that on the news'.

       Makes me wonder how far you could push that narrative.  Like if the news starting showing Godzilla attacking a major city, what percentage of the population would start jumping out of windows:  25%, 50%, 75%?

       People were freaking out.  You could probably Project Blue Beam aliens on TV without the use of holograms.  People would believe anything the news tells them.

       The news could then tell the sheeple to get on train cars to these
       <em>
        safe facilities

       with barbed wire around them.  Shit, 75% or more would willingly get on those train cars if Anderson fucking Cooper told them to.

       The Dallas shootings went down the same way.  Just a bunch of unverified information being thrown out by the media:

       <em>
        There are 5 shooters on buildings!!

        Now the four shooters are on different spots!

      <p>
       <em>
        An hour later we report the three shooters have moved again...
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Five hours later, the police have cornered the one shooter and blew him up with a robot in a drywall made parking garage.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        It's been over 12 hours since the shooting rampage last night.  Police have now stated there were no shooters at all, it was just an out of control police robot.  Police suspect the Russians hacked the robot....

       To make matters worse you have mainstream media news outlets fracturing into propaganda tools for the Republican and Democrat agendas while masquerading as news services with some sort of journalistic integrity. (Think of Fox News "fair &amp; balanced" fully right wing, and CNN a.k.a. the Clinton News Network).

       Having their opinions legitimized and reinforced by TV "news", people stay in the echo chamber and rarely listen to opposing views which adds to the polarization increasing the dogmatic opinions.

       That's the best thing about the election in the US: everyone is disgusted with the media. it's very easy to convince people that their main preoccupation is shaping opinions against the truth.

       The most frustrating aspect of that is that it has actually been in the news that the news has lied to us, for example with the Iraq war barely any journalists seriously challenged the government's lies even though plenty of people knew the truth that there were no WMDs and the evidence was there, everyone knows that now. And everyone knows that our media has not only lied, but has broken the law and done things like hacking peoples phones or covering up paedophile rings etc. People KNOW this, yet still when you tell someone the truth about something, even if you can provide links to documents with evidence, they say you are acting like a crazy conspiracy theorist and just dismiss it. Seems like the only thing they won't believe the news about is the news that the news lies and protects the powerful from the consequences of their crimes and corruption.

       And THAT is what is insane, not the people who question everything.

       Then many of us must not be human then - because a
       <em>
        lot

       of us aren't responding with cowardice and denial.  I know I'm not.

       A lot of humans
       <em>
        are

       No.  No hope.  I don't focus on hope.  Ever.  I focus on
       <em>
        work
       </em>
       .  Hope is some abstract concept you wish for the future.  That amounts to chasing after chimeras.  I dig my nails in and work in the here and now - aware of a future that I'm working toward, but not worrying about having any "hope" toward it.  The future is
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       ...every day, every moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that involves
       <strong>
        <em>
         work
        </em>
       </strong>
       - not hope.

       There was a time when the American dream was a real thing. When a guy could work a factory job and be able to own a home, a new car and support a family with a stay at home wife. Or start a business and make a really good living. Nowadays most factory jobs don't pay enough to support a single person, let alone being able to buy a house or car. your lucky if you can cover your rent for your shitty outdated apartment, and your bills, food becomes a luxury at times. Not to mention most factory jobs treat you like a literal slave and try to make you work 16-20 hours a DAY, then fire you for "production issues" because you ONLY work 14 hours a day. This country is fucked. Pretty soon im just going to start looking to move outside of the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: this actually happened to me. Was working a factory job was asked to work 16-20 hour days. I refused and ONLY worked 14 hour days and was let go due to "production issues".

       All of our freedom's aren't quite gone yet, but we're currently in a plutocracy-style of government. Sorta of a transition phase.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPP will help finalize that transition. It'll allow the Saudis to further rule the US through proxy servants like Hillary Clinton. It's why Hillary is so hostile to Putin and Russia: Russia is a direct energy competitor with the Saudis.

       And the real bite is always worse then any fake "bliss".  It's all fakery and lies.  Why tf would anyone want to live in that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you want to subject yourself to fake "good" if you know
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       bad and pain are what will follow?

       no "bliss".  So long as there is ignorance, there are lies and deceit and ultimate, eventual, inevitable pain.  Never worth it.

       If you know a thing, then you

        continue

       living in ignorance.  Pretty basic concept really.

       Once you understand the simple, basic concept of cause and effect - and that actions have consequences - then it would simply be ignorant to continue doing nothing but keep trying to

       Everyone learns and figures it out eventually at their own pace I guess.

We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.”

       Is it really? In North Korea or Stalinist Russia, you would get sent to a labor camp for expressing the slightest dissent. Here, we can access the information and openly participate in criticizing the government and officials. Is our system fucked up? Yes. But these comparisons always make my eyes roll.

       You're missing the point, Yes you won't get thrown into a labor camp for talking bad about the government, that's not the point it is raising.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point the quote is making is people in NK or USSR were/are fed propaganda and have/had no means of getting the real truth of news/the inner workings of government so most of them went along with it and many took this propaganda as truth. In other words both populations could not get a real unpropaganized view of their country until the regime fell/will fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the current world, people are getting fed (not to the same degree) propaganda from news stations and media that are pushing their narratives and agendas. What makes us different is the internet age and such things as wikileaks have given us multiple insights and raw facts to base our opinions on rather than just absorbing what the media/newstations tell us the story is (ie. see CNN reporter talking about how looking at Wikileaks is illegal so the only way to see it is through the media, which is false).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with the influx of resources/unbiased facts/differing viewpoints, people are
       <strong>
        WILLINGLY
       </strong>
       continuing the believe the media's views on such things. There are normal people accepting these narratives and even going to lengths to call out/silence people who don't believe them. The government doesn't have to do a thing, the people doing their work for them. You could argue under NK and USSR the people were much more 'brainwashed' but what choice did they have to get any information that wasn't propaganda? If the people in Stalin's Russia or Kim's NK got their hands on the kind of facts we have available, would they turn a blind eye like many are doing today? Would they continue to believe the propaganda?

       The person you're replying to is an obstacle, but only if you choose to acknowledge him. He's too intellectual and sure in his ideas. He doesn't understand the creep of things. He doesn't have the sense to see the gaping maw slowly opening over  him before the chomp comes.

       I'm not voting for Trump. Let me get that out of the way. But the problem with our news media is that they cater to buffoons. You expect them to read the emails and explain that to everyone? The Hillary camp will whine if you omit the least bit of context and call you a shill. It's much easier to say, Donald Trump, women, etc. It's easy and simple and requires no hard work.

       Look at the history of Nazi and Soviet propaganda.    Plenty of room for fuck ups.   The American corporate media are indeed catering to buffoons,   but as proven in wikileaks,  they are taking orders from on high from other buffoons with a strategy.    Its documented.

       Kind of difficult when the culprits
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       the jails
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the justice system.  Gotta use something other than the system itself to bring them to justice because they
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       the system.

       His own limits of what he would say against his old friends the Clintons are cancelled.    He has been personally hit,  and he will hit back so as to make it personal.   On the other hand,  he is still going to french kiss Israel's asshole.   There are some people who you mustn't offend,  no matter what.    But the Clintons?   They are so corrupt there are a lot of Americans who will support Trump taking them down.    I suppose Jill is probably incapable of overcoming Clinton,  but not for a lack of trying.    Bernie had to kneel down to them and be brutally sodomized,  he didn't even take off any shackles at all,  he held all the important punches,  like a pussy.

       You have some information, but I don't really know how reliable the source is. Should I believe you over the news, which does report some things that I know are true? Even if I do, I can't affect the situation in any way. The commitment required to changes things would destroy my current life. etc. etc. etc.

       We're all together.  "They" is really
       <em>
        us.
       </em>
       We are them.  When TPTB attack the public, they don't look at you or me or whoever else and go "Oh.  Well don't attack
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       .  They're smart!  They're not part of the idiot morons!"  No.  They attack everyone and see us all as the same regardless.  Most people don't look in the mirror and think "I'm an idiot.  I'm stupid.  I'm a sheep.
       <em>
        I'm
       </em>
       part of the problem." yet many of us
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       indeed that very thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not be
       <em>
        as bad
       </em>
       as some people that are
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       mindless in their swallowing of state propaganda, but we shouldn't try to separate ourselves
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       much from our fellow brothers and sisters because, in the end, it will have to take all of us to come together to overcome all this b.s.

       naw, the point is that 4chan focuses on popular topics where it sprouds its often reactionary agenda while maintaining some bullshit "that is the truth!" propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       To go a step further: 
Stalinist Sovietunion found a few dandy ways to build their narrative - they published fake information, did hold fake trials and went as far as to delete unwanted persons from pictures and destroying the original (e.g. Trotzky and Kamenev
       <a href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/%7Ehick0088/classes/csci_2101/false.html">
        http://www.tc.umn.edu/~hick0088/classes/csci_2101/false.html
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't so much hiding the truth as rather establishing a certain narrative and part of this narrative was diminishing the efforts of jewish intellectuals during the revolutions - a narrative (nwo under the hands of jewish bankers!!!) which is sadly popular with 4chan/ this channel.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now let's take a look at the claim that you can be "instantly be spoon fed actual truth":
First of all you have no way to verify information found on boards like 4chan.
Secondly the information you get by using search engines is preselected/filtered - there is a very real possibility that you end up in your own bubble / in the bubble of a small community. The only difference to the "truth" of the "mainstream" (*) media is that your narration is out of touch with the intersubjective truth of the rest of the society.
      </p>
      <p>
       (*) There is a massive difference between outlets like NYT,NZZ,Guardian and e.g. the daily mail and yet there is always "the mainstream media" to complain about.. -.-

       Our world is fucked up, but you don't see it because you were brought up in it, molded by it, and you haven't woken up yet. that is the case for majority of the population. they are brainwashed zombies, who can't think critically about anything.

       No,  the bosses are very specific about what they want to go out over the broadcast.   Its not something being left open to local managements ideas of just getting by or even to the good old ratings wars kinds of rationales.
