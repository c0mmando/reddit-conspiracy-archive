        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Don&#39;t get too caught up in what was said last night and what they were arguing about.  Literally the entire thing is a script and they&#39;re both playing the script. EVERY SINGLE THING.  Every single question and answer is manipulated, either one of them can&#39;t go a single minute without looking at the notes they have in front of them and then saying the answer they&#39;re supposed to say.  Literally it is no different from Hollywood, they are both actors and they&#39;re really damn good at it.  When you look at it from this perspective it really becomes so blatant and they&#39;re both working towards wrapping millions of people up in issues that are meant to divide us.  The only way they get their power is by continually finding ways to divide the people, and that&#39;s where their power lies and we are easier to control when we are separated.  </p>

<p>These people and the powers at be are alllll trying to show us that these are the <em>real</em> issues, and <em>this</em> is what we should be talking about or believing in or wasting our energy using the logic one of them used in a debate we have with our friend...it&#39;s allll nonsense.  It&#39;s a waste of time.  It sounds silly but common sense is a massive ally in this.  </p>

<p>We see the lengths they go to control, manipulate and script our reality everyday here on reddit esp. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (RIP), like they go to extreme lengths to influence soooo much.  If this is the manipulation imagine the manipulation they do on TV on the mainstream!!  The whole point is don&#39;t waste too much of your energy hating on this shit, the government does not care about you, they may have 300 years ago, but now they don&#39;t give a SHIT about any of you, me, or our families.  We are NOT their best interests and that is extremely clear given all the incidents that have happened in the last couple of decades and things that we have realized.  This system is broken, it&#39;s falling apart, and they are losing that control they&#39;ve had for so long. They want to bring you down with them; there are better systems to come but it starts at the individual and local level, believe in yourself, get in tune with who you are and keep following your passion and focus on doing what you came to this planet to do.</p>

<p>My two cents is that Trump doesn&#39;t have any notes nor does he have the capacity to memorize 90 minutes of scripted debate. Hillary obviously has notes she reads throughout but Trump just fires from the hip. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said whole thing, I read the first paragraph and the smaller second paragraph. I just don&#39;t think they need to script the debates, they&#39;re probably better off letting them go out there and do their thing, then manipulate through the media. The best case scenario is that Trump and Hillary actually hate eachother, that way they put on the best show. I believe in the shadow government and they believe that who ever gets elected can be controlled and manipulated. The only thing I don&#39;t agree with is that they go on stage and read scripts as if they&#39;re filming a movie.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clarification understood. </p>

<p>I agree it would be much easier to manipulate through the media then trying to get the two of them to stick strictly to a script. However, I would be surprised if they were not given notes about what to say and what will be asked. There is way too much money and power behind all this to let these two have full freedom over what they say.</p>
