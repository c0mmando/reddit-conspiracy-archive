       2) Announce withdrawal from the TPP, "a potential disaster for our country."
      </p>
      <p>

Donald Trump
(NaturalNews) Donald J. Trump just delivered an historic speech that lays out his plan for the first 100 days in office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Highlights are listed here. Actual quotes from Donald Trump shown in italics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system is totally rigged and broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dishonest mainstream media is a major part of this corruption. They lie and fabricate stories to make a candidate that is not their preferred choice look as bad and as dangerous as possible... They're trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people... They're trying to poison the mind of the American voter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they can fight somebody like me, who has unlimited resources, just imagine what they can do to YOU...
      </p>
      <p>
       The rigging of the system is designed for one reason: to keep the corrupt establishment and the special interests in power at your expense.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will never solve our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place. Hillary Clinton is running against all the American people...
      </p>
      <p>
       [This 100-day plan is] a contract between Donald J. Trump and the American voter... to bring honestly, accountability change to Washington D.C.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will drain the swamp in Washington D.C. and replace it with a new government of, by and for the People.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my pledge to you. If we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. We will make America great again.
      </p>

      <p>
       Side comment: We are going to work on fixing the VA hospital problem. "We have illegal immigrants that are treated far better than our veterans."
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump's propose Acts for serious reform
1) Infrastructure Reinvestment Act would restore investment in our domestic infrastructure (bridges, roads, water systems).
      </p>
      <p>
       2) School Choice and Education Opportunity Act will give parents the right to send their child to the schools of their choice. "We're going to end Common Core and bring education supervision to local communities... Our current system is not working." We will expand vocational and technical education, and make 2- and 4-year colleges more affordable.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act: Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with health savings accounts. The ability to purchase health insurance across state lines (to create competition), and let states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will include cutting the red tape at the FDA. We want to speed the approval of lifesaving medications.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Affordable Childcare and Elder Care Act would allow caregivers to deduct care costs from their taxes. Creates tax free dependent care savings accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) End Illegal Immigration Act: Fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border, with the understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost. Establishes 2-4 year mandatory prison sentences for those illegally re-entering the USA if they have multiple prior deportations or felony convictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Restoring Community Safety Act: Creates a task force on violent crime, increases funding for programs to train and assist local police. "Put violent offenders behind bars or out of our country..."
      </p>
      <p>
       7) Restoring National Security Act: Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment. "Peace through strength... we need a strong military." It also provides our veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or visit a private doctor of their choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional comment: "We are going to protect our vital infrastructure from cyber attack."
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Clean up Corruption in Washington Act: Enact new ethics reforms to reduce corrupting influence of special interests and donors.

       You clearly didn't even read it....why bother responding if you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about? Unless your goal is to prove to the world that your parents are siblings. Read the speech and then come back with a real argument.

       Propagandist shit like this makes me wonder if the sub is compromised. As if running to be the head of the largest military industrial complex death cult is "anti-establishment", OP is paid or a fool.

       P. S. a little black notebook by a Jeffrey Epstein has Trumps name and number, written in a list of people who traveled with him on his private jet to an island where he fucks child prostitutes. Hate to break it to you OP, but your so called "hero" likely fucks children and couldn't give less a shit about you or this nation because he's  a cuck foe Israeli like the rest of the whores.

       I've been in this sub for a while now. I've chased the rabbit down the hole several times. I've read tons and tons of threads. My conclusion is that the illuminati/NWO have a stranglehold on media, politics, science, entertainment, technology, military, finance, and education. I believe we've been lied to by our rulers for 500+ years (probably much longer).

       It isn't a bunch of little conspiracies, rather it's one giant conspiracy that goes far deeper than anyone understands. People think Sandy Hook is too crazy to believe to be a lie. People think 9/11 is to crazy to be a lie. HA. Those are small compared to the big lies everyone believes.

       okay who exactly is this? Is it a group of rich bankers? How did you reach your conclusion ?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are too many moving pieces for it to be one group running the whole thing. I mean all it takes is someone around that group to blow the whistle.  So I believe there are many different groups involved in conspiracies but their ultimate goal is the pursuit of money. So this illuminati/NWO is just the pursuit of money by these different groups.

       Okay first off how did this small group manage to get hold of this power and influence? People are just people and we all make mistakes. Your suggesting these guys are always on point and don't make mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, all it takes is one whistleblower. What your suggesting is unsustainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean there must be people handling the funds of this small group right? And then there are people around the fund handlers, then people around those people, and so on...and so your suggesting someone along that line of acquaintances never see's something that looks off?
