        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to the political donation tracking website OpenSecrets, in 1992 Jeb made a modest $400 donation to the presidential campaign of a man named Bo Gritz, who ran as an independent whose platform, among other controversial ideas, advocated for the return of racial segregation. When Jeb placed that donation, he listed his place of employment as the CIA. Worth noting is that the other campaign donations can easily be traced back to Jeb since he worked for the Codina Group before founding his own real estate firm, Jeb Bush &amp; Associates. Furthermore, his father, George H.W. Bush, was the director of the CIA before becoming president.</p>

<p>You can see the donation history here: <a href="http://opensecrets.org/indivs/search.php?name=Jeb+Bush&amp;cycle=All&amp;sort=R&amp;state=&amp;zip=&amp;employ=&amp;cand=&amp;submit=Submit">http://opensecrets.org/indivs/search.php?name=Jeb+Bush&amp;cycle=All&amp;sort=R&amp;state=&amp;zip=&amp;employ=&amp;cand=&amp;submit=Submit</a></p>

<p>The following link delves into some theories about what he may have been doing for the CIA during the time, although I&#39;m pretty ambivalent about its findings: <a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/jeb-bush-exposed-cia-operative-linked-drug-cartels-money-laundering/">http://thefreethoughtproject.com/jeb-bush-exposed-cia-operative-linked-drug-cartels-money-laundering/</a></p>

<p>With the aid and blessings of the Elder Bush and his sons, and the American CIA, Lehder was the co-founder of the Medellin Dope Cartel in Colombia. Lehder is the only drug cartel baron to have been extradited to the U.S. where he was put on trial on federal criminal charges, convicted, and originally sentenced to more than a life term.</p>

<p>Some background. In the late 1970s, Jeb Bush was installed as the head of the Venezuela unit of Texas Commerce Bank, a principal owner of which was his father, George Herbert Walker Bush. The bank unit reportedly became part of the money laundering of proceeds from the Colombia Medellin Drug Cartel co-founded by Carlos Lehder as a Bush Family business partner. The Drug Cartel was moreso headquartered in the U.S. than in Colombia. It was part of the whole CIA operation to the southern states of the United States, headquartered, in part, through an airport in western Arkansas, at Mena. The Elder Bush, his sons Jeb and George W., and Ollie North, and Bill Clinton, were all part of the operation. Guns were smuggled by CIA airflights to Central America with side-trips to Colombia to pick up huge shipments of cocaine which supported the Colombia economy moreso than coffee.</p>

<p>The tiny First National Bank of Mena, Arkansas, was purchased by the Riady family, ethnic Chinese tied to Bill Clinton and the Bush Family. The bank reportedly was a transmission point for the huge dope cash flow which went up to Garfield Ridge Trust &amp; Savings Bank, Chicago. The Chicago bank for many years had as a principal stockholder Cong. Dan Rostenkowski. For years a Chairman of the Board of the Chicago bank was a reputed former U.S. Secret Service official, Dan Shannon. Rostenkowski, called Rosty for short, was closely aligned with the Chicago markets, the next transmission point of the dope loot from Rosty&#39;s bank. That is, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and a sort of basement, step-sister operation called Chicago Board Options Exchange.</p>

<p>Rosty, as the long-time head of the tax-writing committee of Congress, got many &quot;speech fees&quot; and other benefits from the Chicago markets. He in turn pushed through almost private laws, favoring the Chicago markets with tax loopholes on straddles and hedging. So from Rosty&#39;s bank in Chicago the huge dope cash flow reportedly was transmitted to the Chicago markets and disguised as soybean and currency trading. Assisting this in all the years was international swindler Marc Rich tied to both the Bush Family and Bill and Hillary Clinton.<sup><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206153206/http://skolnicksreport.org/claffair2.html">LINK</a></sup></p>
