       This sub has become over saturated with election conspiracies (which I'm guilty of posting myself) but it's pretty relevant right now. There's still plenty of non election content that gets posted here, you just have to work a little harder to find what you want now.

       In my nine years of hanging out in r/conspiracy, it has ALWAYS reflected the current event. I think a lot of people, including myself, hadn't a clue just how deeply corrupt HRC &amp; Co. really were.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what we are seeing here. This sub is currently consumed by it, because it's just fucking mind boggling that this criminal psycho-Bitch is about to assume control of the most powerful military In the world with a mob of zionists clawing at her back to start WW III in the Middle East.

       These are dangerous times and r/conspiracy is just doing its job as I'm concerned anyway.

       The shit Hillary is being exposed of is pretty much exactly what this subreddit has always been against, and always warning people was coming. Every day is a new "I told you so" story that validates the claims of many in here, which is why you see so many posts highlighting Hillary's corruption and criminal acts. Also, the entire internet is pretty much under her control, and this subreddit seems to be one of the last remaining places to discuss these topics.

       Do yourself a favor and actually read the Wikileaks. Also, this isn't a zero-sum game, meaning that one can be against both Hillary and Donald. Don't misconstrue the high volume of anti-Clinton posts to be absolutely indicative of this being a pro-Trump hangout.

       Jesus H., there's some dumb mother fuckers that cannot seem to grasp this concept. People think I support Trump because I want Hillary to go down, completely disregarding I've been an advocate for Hillary's imprisonment before she was a candidate for Presidency and back when Trump wasn't even relevant. It is very possible to dislike both candidates and protest against your government by not voting as a means. Fuck both these candidates, but god damn it fuck HRC more.

       I don't know man. But damn you post a lot, I'm not reading though that, not that I doubt you, or that I would be happy about your vote either way.  Have a good night.  Sorry, the Dem/Republican shit can get me worked up, like it's designed to do.  LP voter here.

       Why are posts like THIS allowed to survive?? Asking to rename this sub has been offered up by more than one shill in the past month. This ninja user mostly posts in other subs and only posts here to try and tell the community what to do. How is that not suspicious?
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop allowing users to post baseless opinions on changing the sub name or attempting to label the sub as leaning one political way or another on the same level as r/politics. These shills are trying so damn hard to make this sub appear to be censored and exclusively anti-Hillary. Please stop allowing this.

       You're surprised the consiracy sub is reporting the biggest conspiracy revelation in modern history?  I think you have no grip on reality.  You should be asking why is no mainstream media outlet reporting all of this stuff.

       Nope, I started out as a tolerant Anglican child.... I opened my eyes and see the world for what it is... that is why nothing, not even 9/11 surprised me... hell I predicted it would be Bin Laden on the same day, you can even got to Fark.com archive and see we predicted it was Bin Laden... USS Cole had just occurred and he promised a big surprise, it was obviously him.
