<p>I wonder if John was approached by the DNC and refused to be a puppet to them so that&#39;s why he abruptly announced he was leaving the Daily Show...Trevor Noah clearly holds an anti-trump bias and rarely covers anti-Clinton news...</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s by nature a satirical program as I&#39;ve watched for well over a decade now, but they are pushing an agenda harder than I think Stewart would have...</p>

<p>If you look at John Oliver, Daily Show, SNL, it&#39;s all agenda humor shit now. Just so predictable, the puppet strings so obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t buy it, Stewart and Colbert are both shills for the establishment and they hold weight only to teenagers who put far too much trust in their ability to parse reality. I was one of these idiots. I&#39;m 26, and all throughout my teenage and early twenties I relied on these two scams to provide me a &quot;no bullshit&quot; approach to the news. I didn&#39;t know shit about the world, and I certainly didn&#39;t know about conspiracies. What opened my eyes is when I saw these people speak out AGAINST 9/11 truth, that&#39;s when I realized these people are our enemies and not our friends. I never turned on the television again, stopped watching all of that garbage, bill maher, jon stewart, colbert, that faggot on Hbo, all of em. They&#39;re paid propagandists, and most don&#39;t even realize it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stewart made fun of 9/11 questioners.  </p>

<p>Of course it didn&#39;t help that some of these &#39;truthers&#39; ran out into the show with a sign.  I kind of think maybe those people were provocateurs for the state.  I mean, what better way to make 9/11 truthers look like assholes than to have them do that.</p>

<p>They did it on Maher&#39;s show also</p>

<p>And to Geraldo also.</p>

<p>And today&#39;s show.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible normal people do this, but I tend to think that half of these photobombers are provocateurs.   I think we are change are an example of &#39;control opposition by leading it&#39;</p>

<p>ae911truth has some people fucking up their movement but Gage and others are absolutely not (gatekeepers)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember how hard the Marx Brothers or the Three Stooges tried to endear, entertain, and amuse? Somewhere along the line they decided they ain&#39;t doin&#39;  no more &quot;blackface&quot;, they&#39;ve ARRIVED, Yaweh damn it! It helped when, recently, their safes have <strong>exploded</strong> with the accumulated wealth of the goy middle class. Job done! No more kiss ass for you, obey me, blow me, serve me!!!! Problem is they don&#39;t know how to act astride the heap. It was somehow better climbing the Sysiphusian mountain because hurting people and expropriating everything they have is not fun. It doesn&#39;t satisfy. Cue the Apocalypse! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His job on the Daily Show was a continuation of his prior job, &quot;a puppeteer for children with disabilities&quot; because that&#39;s where most of us were getting editorial content that we half believed. His older brother was CEO of Nynex, part of the NYSE. You don&#39;t get plugged in to the Establishment any higher than that. He was our babysitter and we always think fondly of them, accept for that one who... never mind.</p>

<p>Anyway, as a gatekeeper he characterized for us a world view both futile, funny, and scandalous. Unfortunately he lead down a middle path so that we wouldn&#39;t see the <em>real</em> rulers. Blinders on, he cried us through 911. He was just as effective at getting us to see as he was at getting us to <em>not</em> see, never crossing fully into the ugly realm where conspiracies are real.</p>

<p>I enjoyed Leibowitz&#39;s Canticle while it lasted. He had to have seen the evisceration of the middle class, when it started and as it goes. He has to know 911 was a Neoconjob, did he show us that, no. I&#39;d retire too if I was basically a decent guy running interference and distracting the little people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think anyone in show biz--Stewart included--are very aware of these circuits of power.  Stewarts brother Laurence Leibowitz was the COO of the NYSE for 7 yrs until 2013, so during the time John was at the daily show.  So his connection to the neoliberal financial elite could not be ignored.  That said, even though Stewart was very rich from the daily show, he had basically espoused the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> consensus point of view, so I could see that he would be considered a kind of paleoprogressive who could not ignore Hillary&#39;s crimes. </p>

<p>However, he lost me when he fought against people who questioned 9/11 and mocked them openly, makng him a gatekeeper.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think the opposite happened.</p>

<p>Before he left, the political landscape looked ripe for a Hillary Clinton vs Jeb Bush election. </p>

<p>People were anticipating it and there were disgruntled observations pointing out that the US&#39;s own version of the royal families were going to duke it out for the POTUS. Apathy was everywhere, and the only obstruction of the election would likely come from the tea party. </p>

<p>That just doesn&#39;t seem like a very fun political climate to cover. Imagine being Stewart: You trash Jeb one day for being as dumb as his brother with half the coolness. Then you trash Hillary the next for being secretive and a bold faced liar. Then you make fun of Cruz for a little for being an obstructionist that won&#39;t go away.</p>

<p>He could have never imagined Trump, Wikileaks, Guccifer 2.0, FBI concluding their investigation, Veritas, and the media propaganda machine working overtime.</p>

<p>He was burned out and bored. He was tired of the lies and the manipulation that the media and our politicians churn out every day because it was routine. Little did he know it was about to get flipped upside down by Trump and Bernie.</p>
