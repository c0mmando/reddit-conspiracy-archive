<p>This place is as much a circle jerk for Trump now as the Sanders subreddits were for him, circa ~1year ago. </p>

<p>I hardly ever post or interact on here anymore because it&#39;s not worth it... I was accused of being a CTR shill for pointing out that Assange and wikileaks are most likely a govt honeypot- didn&#39;t even make an attack on Trump nor a support of Clinton. Wasn&#39;t referring to either of them.</p>

<p>So it is what it is, I suppose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wait it out. But be prepared, once the election&#39;s over, the usual suspects will go back to posting and mass upvoting racist crap designed to fear-bait people. You could look at the bright side here, the stupid pro-Trump stuff is almost refreshing when you compare it with the Stormfront stuff we used to get spammed with. Or you could look at the reality: The propaganda we&#39;ve been peppered with for the last few years has brought about a willing populace that has been led to think Trump is some kind of savior (newsflash: he&#39;s not, he&#39;s a tool of the Clintons. Hell, probably the Stormfront assholes are, too).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr. quackchomp, when I&#39;m working throughout the day I like to lurk here just to read what others have to say. I don&#39;t post until I&#39;m home from work. I don&#39;t see your name come up, ever. It doesn&#39;t ring a bell. Looking at your post history I understand why; You don&#39;t usually post here. Now, I understand it&#39;s not fair or appropriate to hold anything against you simply because you&#39;re not frequently posting on the sub. You seem to enjoy ducks and sports. No qualms there. But what is the source of your feeling of entitlement to make a post in a sub you rarely visit to claim that it is now r/thedonald and plead for us to &quot;stop&quot;? Do you not see the other posts like yours trying desperately to label this sub in a certain way? And is it not suspicious that all of you posting in such a manner also have limited post history in r/conspiracy, sometimes none at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a fair point, and I&#39;m happy to respond. I use to follow r/politics for a long time, I posted there many times and discussed many different topics. But the sub has become a joke, and though I am very much against trump, I am equally as against to clinton (both of them for that matter). I began to visit this sub more frequently and noticed I enjoyed many different posts, but in general I hardly post too many things in subs as it is. The influx of some radical theories that seemed to only come out of the_donald(which they mostly do) that could, and were, being disproven quite quickly surprised me. Now we are getting repeats of the exact same posts to make it to the front page (many of them are disproven in the comment threads). My point is that on this sub and others like it, mention the downfall of r/politics and r/politicaldiscussion shitty shills taking over. BUT this sub and others have gone under the same takeover, just that it happens to be from the *opposite side. What makes one better than the other? I love this sub and it&#39;s content when it is how it is supposed to be. You can look at my post history during the primaries and you can easily make out who I was for and how I felt about it.</p>

<p>Well, welcome to the fold brother.  You will fit right in here.  Our sub does not believe in censorship and so they allow all posts as long as they have some relevancy to conspiracy.  What you are witnessing is the right wing pushback against the liberal powerbrokers trying to rig this election by disrupting the free flow of information.</p>

<p>While I understand where you come from, you should understand that most of these political posts are bought and paid for...that includes most of the stuff you see in r/politics.  This sub has become the de facto backup to The Donald because the rest of this site is controlled by the people who own it, which are liberals.  </p>

<p>While it is annoying, I have to applaud the mods for allowing all content in a free and open format.  They, unlike many others, believe that you don&#39;t need to control information in order to benefit from it.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter! We don&#39;t care how you felt about either candidate. This sub isn&#39;t exclusively for either candidate&#39;s supporters. There are simply more conspiracies surrounding Hillary and her family than Trump. Did you miss what sub you were posting in? r/conspiracy?</p>

<p>This sub has not been &quot;taken over&quot; like r/politics has. We are not being actively censored and banhammered left and right for posting anything. Why are you and others trying <strong>so damn hard</strong> to equate the two? What kind of validation are you seeking? You also didn&#39;t answer my question as to why you feel so entitled to make this post. It&#39;s not a political sub so you don&#39;t get to complain about seeing too many posts for either side if they are related to a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a post that was on the front page of a Donald trump speech.... not a conspiracy theory or anything.. a speech. That is not what this sub is about. Many are just Clinton bashing articles with comments solely about trump&#39;s greatness. Conspiracy? Nope. Still up voted to the top? Yup.</p>

<p>Also, I do think this harassment is sanctioned by Reddit based on the reaction of admins to reports and the number of people being harassed by the same exact users (when this happened, I posted a couple of questions and a bunch of other users were getting threatened by the same user).</p>

<p>For fun, ask the user if they&#39;re being monetarily compensated for their time here and watch the reaction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the link. Did you watch the video? Do you understand the weight of his comments? Many of us here, including me, assumed he was another bought-and-paid-for puppet just here to give us a good show. That&#39;s the conspiracy here. He has donated to the Clinton Foundation and attended a Clinton wedding, among other social interactions. The fact that he&#39;s speaking so openly about the corruption is a bit jarring and helps to prove me wrong. So I think the &#39;bomb&#39; part is legitimate here and many people found it to be valuable in determining part of the truth of the aforementioned conspiracy. He&#39;s also speaking <em>of</em> a conspiracy itself. So I have to disagree with you on that point. As far as the comments go, I see a lot of contention and argument among users as is normal. I also do not see more than 2 comments openly complimenting Trump without any other constructive feedback. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it may seem like a sudden change in direction, the reality is the mods don&#39;t censor. Just because a post is pro-anything doesn&#39;t mean it gets removal, a tag, or magically disappears, and the users sort it out with voting. Now a ton of people here are pro-trump, and a ton of people are pro-third party; what no one here is is pro-clinton. This is a conspiracy forum, and the heap of conspiracies following the clintons should of had them out of the political arena years ago, and if Donald Trump or anyone else for that matter had an ounce of conspiracy material attached to them we would discuss it.</p>
