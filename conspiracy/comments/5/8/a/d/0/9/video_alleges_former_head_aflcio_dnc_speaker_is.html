        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You can&#39;t makes this up. Even I can figure out stuff and I&#39;m no journalist. </p>

<p>It seems there is evidence there is collusion between the AFL-CIO and the Clinton campaign to pull off dirty tricks, in the form of fake violent protests at Sanders and Trump events.</p>

<p><strong>The fakes, were, if true, eager and willing members of the union, out of Arkansas.</strong></p>

<p>This is from a secret video of a conversation with a reporter and a player in the Dirty Tricks Dept.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’m saying we have mentally ill people, that we pay to do shit, make no mistake,” says Foval in the video. “Over the last twenty years, I’ve paid off a few homeless guys to do some crazy stuff, and I’ve also taken them for dinner, and I’ve also made sure they had a hotel, and a shower. And I put them in a program. Like I’ve done that.
<strong>But the reality is, a lot of people especially our union guys. A lot of our union guys…they’ll do whatever you want. They’re rock and roll. When I need to get something done in Arkansas, the first guy I call is the head of the AFL-CIO down there, because he will say, ‘What do you need?’ And I will say, I need a guy who will do this, this and this. And they find that guy. And that guy will be like, Hell yeah, let’s do it.”</strong>

<p>So I go, &quot;Huh! Wonder who the current head of the AFL-CIO in Arkansas is?&quot; and so I look.

Richard Trumka. Remember him? Former president of the AFL-CIO. Speaker at the DNC, whose entire speech was slamming Trump on a personal level. </p>

<p>The guy accused of telling his members to not support Sanders? Writer for Huffington Post? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/bernie-sanders-2016-surge-afl-cio-richard-trumka-120360">http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/bernie-sanders-2016-surge-afl-cio-richard-trumka-120360</a></p>

<p>Assuming the video is authentic and the bragging was fact,</p>

<p>This is the guy who is the eager dirty tricks &#39;go to&#39; guy when they need bodies to pretend to be violent protesters. All those redneck racists? The pushing and shoving? The protestor and the protested, all working for the benefit of the Clinton campaign?</p>

<p>Should we ask for the union label?</p>

<p>How do union brothers feel about this allegation?</p>

<p>Just what can we trust from the National Stage to be anything other than staged? </p>

<p>Suddenly, everything you might think about Trump might not be true. Might be. Who frikkin knows???</p>

<p>Caveats: I was a Sander&#39;s delegate and my Dad was a union man. This just is what it is.</p>
