<p>I checked down detector when I couldn&#39;t load the wikileaks twitter to see if it was twitter or if they somehow were blocking specifically wikileaks. I saw some concerning patterns across many top web services, but apparently they were caused by someone DDoSing Dyn, a massive DNS host. </p>

<p>But who would be DDoSing Dyn? Could it be the government trying to desperately lower the exposure of wikileaks after cutting Julian&#39;s internet and possibly extraditing him didn&#39;t make it stop? Could this be the false flag Russian cyber attack that will take us into WW3?</p>

<p>I thought eactly this after noticing that big parts of Europe and the UK are now offline. JA has said WL was not publishing from the embassy, so from an ops point of view, they might be shutting down swaths of the Internet,  London is now out, to attempt to prevent more damaging leaks - exposing the entire rotten system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hopelessness and Confusion</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been noticing a narrative push lately on this sub... hopelessness. It&#39;s usually pushed by outdated sounding usernames like Someguy123 or whatnot.</p>

<p>Point is, hopelessness is the only hope corruption has for winning. Those that want to push a narrative of despair are letting themselves become repeaters of corruption, whether or not they&#39;re aware of it.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether Assange is being hyper-tortured in a CIA demon-infested ritual sex dungeon (/s... sort of) or just bored and without internet access eating bad vegan snacks all alone, we as individuals must continue to work toward sharing the truth and informing those around us while applying critical discernment to the arguments being presented to us by supposed peers, journalists and figures of authority.</p>

<p>To slow down or give up for the sake of speculative satisfaction is to play into the hands of those who predate upon the ineptitude of others in order to survive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before what? </p>

<p>As much as Beyonce wants it to be possible, the complete expunging of information stored or posted to the internet is nigh impossible. If such an event were to take place, one as serious as OP is implying,  the information logged from said event is still floating around somewhere away from reddit/twatter. It would only be a matter of time before it is found and posted</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ICANN is what LINF is referring to, and they actually do manage domain name resolution at a very high level, but think of them as records-holders and authenticators and standards-enforcers, not so much workhorse day-to-day infrastructure.</p>

<p>DynDNS is a company that runs a bunch of DNS servers that hold links between domain names and the physical systems they&#39;re connected to. For example, if you bought aluminoti.com (domain registry), you&#39;d then create a record that says &quot;aluminoti.com&quot; should resolve to computer &quot;127.127.127.127&quot; that holds the web site files you want to display (DNS).</p>

<p>Your hosting company or DNS company (they don&#39;t need to be the same, you could register your domain at GoDaddy and use Amazon for hosting your site and DynDNS to host DNS resolution, for example) would then have a bunch of servers with that record in it so that when Internet users type in &quot;aluminoti.com&quot; in their browser, it looks up the record and returns the right host. If the servers that respond to this lookup and service the request are being DDoSed, you can&#39;t get to those sites and they&#39;re effectively &quot;down&quot; for you - and that appears to be what happened this morning.</p>
