<p>Note also that this comes on the heel of an incredible email which both the &quot;left&quot; and much of the &quot;alt-right&quot; are ignoring: banks control the US government.  Citibank sent an email to Obama in which they &quot;recommended&quot; certain figures be placed in certain positions, and well...you do the math: </p>

<p>&quot;The cabinet list ended up being almost entirely on the money. It correctly identified Eric Holder for the Justice Department, Janet Napolitano for Homeland Security, Robert Gates for Defense, Rahm Emanuel for chief of staff, Peter Orszag for the Office of Management and Budget, Arne Duncan for Education, Eric Shinseki for Veterans Affairs, Kathleen Sebelius for Health and Human Services, Melody Barnes for the Domestic Policy Council, and more. For the Treasury, three possibilities were on the list: Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner.&quot;</p>

<p>No longer do they &quot;open governments,&quot; they attack a particular side of the establishment that they deem &quot;corrupt&quot; and sow seed of distrust wherever and whenever possible.</p>

<p>No Republican has been the target of wikileaks that I can remember...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>can you honestly tell me that you think wiki-leaks is an entirely &quot;above-board&quot; organization with no political agenda?  </p>

<p>look at their leaks in the last year, surely hillary clinton and the democratic party in general are not the only targets deserving of attack.  so where are the attacks on GOP, on Russia, on the &quot;military industrial complex?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re telling me that republican&#39;s haven&#39;t done anything in the last twelve months worthy of leaking?  you&#39;re asking me to believe that trump&#39;s email&#39;s are impenetrable to the same forces that took hillary&#39;s?</p>

<p>that&#39;s a stretch.  i think it is crystal clear that wiki leaks has an agenda</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m telling you that you&#39;re the one going out on a limb stating that they do for partisan reasons. What I am saying is that anything they have worth leaking, they will. They don&#39;t care who it affects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK so riddle me this.  Why don&#39;t they leak anything, 1 single document, about the GOP?</p>

<p>Are the Republican&#39;s using super-secure encryption on all of their emails?</p>

<p>For that matter, why has Wiki-Leaks moved beyond posting information for public consumption and started throwing in accusations?  Their twitter is hardly better than Infowars when it comes to thinly-supported accusations.</p>

<p>I think that WL may have started with good intentions and may have even contributed a few things of meaningful substance back in the day.  But this year they have fully come out of the bag as a tool to be used to manipulate public discussion.</p>

<p>Who is behind that tool should be the real question.</p>
