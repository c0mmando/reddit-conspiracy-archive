       Be careful. The shills will come out if you mention sandy hook.... They all have a cousin that lived there...

       There's no way out government would ever do anything to hurt or manipulate the American people... No way.

       Lol.. He must think the Boston bombing was legit too... My favorite part of the Boston bombing fakery was the amputee guy running around pretending to be hurt.. Even tho he had already had his legs blown off years prior... Or the straight lines cut into everyone's clothes... People looked like the ultimate warrior with those tassle straight lines cut... I mean a bomb would definately make my clothes look like that lol

       Why is everyone who disagrees automatically a shill? Maybe they were on r/all and hit new and this popped up and they didn't like what they saw. I'm sick of everyone being called shills on this sub because it's an easy way to discredit someone who disagrees. This sub is turning into a circlejerk like dear leader's sub and it's ruining the authenticity.

       I agreed with you until you dropped similarities with other subs and claimed our reputation/authenticity/whatever is ruined and that we circle jerk over anyone. I've seen probably 20-30 posts this week claiming the same thing or trying to relabel the sub as one user sees fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone gets the baseless circle jerking it's Bernie Sanders. He's no longer running, he's supporting the arguably more corrupt candidate in full and he voted similarly to Hillary throughout the past decade. But yet people still make posts about all his glory with 0 conspiracy links.

       Hmmm...why do you think you've seen so many posts about it? Maybe because this is a sub for CONSPIRACY theories, not a sub to attack anyone who isnt Trump. I would bet my entire life savings that if a major Trump conspiracy broke, the front page would be entirely filled out how people are framing him and shit, not the actual conspiracy.

       I've seen so many posts about it because the shills want to publicly label this sub as anti-Hillary an receive validation for it. They want to spread the message that this sub is censored so that only anti-Hillary posts get through and they try to compare it directly, every time, to r/politics. I'm not sure what else you need to see that groups of people are intentionally trying to frame this sub one way or another and rename it so they have an anti-r/politics sub to scorn.

       I would need to see proof, like there was about r/politics, instead of just accusations. Being accused of being a shill multiple times leads me to believe that most of these accusations are false.

       I'm making two arguments here and you're ignoring the second one. When you cry wolf at every person you disagree with and accuse them of being a shill, then nobody has any reason to believe you when they actually do come.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all I know, all you guys are Trump shills. You disagree with me, so you must be paid by someone to do it, since obviously nobody could believe anything but my opinion without being coerced.

       Where's your proof for users decrying shill whenever they are disagreed with? When users post suspicious shit and have little to no post history here (not talking about you, I don't actually think you're a shill) and try to convince the entire community to rename the sub to r/anti-Hillary or whatever bullshit they've been asking for, that's shill level. When you make a post complaining about how the sub is ruined, bought, etc. This is dangerously close to what some shills are doing. So maybe just be careful about complaining and labeling others so sweepingly.

       It's just a straw man fallacy. This Obama scrotum licker does not want us discussing the manufactured terror acts so he tries to derail the discussion with "Whah! Whah! Shillville!"

       Yeah figure that one out.....and nobody ever even heard from anyone that was actually inside the place during the shooting other than initial reports of a 3rd shooter wearing body armor...there were no "Witnesses Interviewed" seen on TV or interviews that I know of it got hushed away.

       Something else that got quietly hushed up was the 2nd shooter heading to Interrupt the Gay Pride Parade in West Los Angeles. Apparently after hearing that the Orlando Shooter was killed, the guy got scared that the CIA was going to "Off" him too and he actually turned himself into Santa Monica police. Here's the full story:

       I didn't hear much about it and shortly after there wasn't much reported on it so I figure the guy was done in...

       Call me a newbie, but i only recently started following this subreddit and none of these have happened since i "opened my eyes". What is the proof showing these were coordinated, planned events? I understand the reasoning and the purpose and I dont doubt the governments capcity to pull it off, id just like to see how they messed up and that shows us they did it.

       Go on YouTube and look for sandy hook debunk videos. There's overwhelming evidence that it was fake and you can fact check anything you are skeptical about. Sandy hook is what opened my eyes.

       I'm making two arguments here and you're ignoring the second one. When you cry wolf at every person you disagree with and accuse them of being a shill, then nobody has any reason to believe you when they actually do come.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all I know, all you guys are Trump shills. You disagree with me, so you must be paid by someone to do it, since obviously nobody could believe anything but my opinion without being coerced.
