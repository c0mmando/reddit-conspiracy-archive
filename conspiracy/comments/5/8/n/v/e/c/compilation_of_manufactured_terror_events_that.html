    <div class="md"><p>Lol.. He must think the Boston bombing was legit too... My favorite part of the Boston bombing fakery was the amputee guy running around pretending to be hurt.. Even tho he had already had his legs blown off years prior... Or the straight lines cut into everyone&#39;s clothes... People looked like the ultimate warrior with those tassle straight lines cut...

    <div class="md"><p>Why is everyone who disagrees automatically a shill? Maybe they were on r/all and hit new and this popped up and they didn&#39;t like what they saw. I&#39;m sick of everyone being called shills on this sub because it&#39;s an easy way to discredit someone who disagrees. This sub is turning into a circlejerk like dear leader&#39;s sub and it&#39;s ruining the authenticity.</p>

<p>Edit: downvoting me is doing nothing but corroborating my point. I appreciate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agreed with you until you dropped similarities with other subs and claimed our reputation/authenticity/whatever is ruined and that we circle jerk over anyone. I&#39;ve seen probably 20-30 posts this week claiming the same thing or trying to relabel the sub as one user sees fit.</p>

<p>If anyone gets the baseless circle jerking it&#39;s Bernie Sanders. He&#39;s no longer running, he&#39;s supporting the arguably more corrupt candidate in full and he voted similarly to Hillary throughout the past decade. But yet people still make posts about all his glory with 0 conspiracy links. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm...why do you think you&#39;ve seen so many posts about it? Maybe because this is a sub for CONSPIRACY theories, not a sub to attack anyone who isnt Trump. I would bet my entire life savings that if a major Trump conspiracy broke, the front page would be entirely filled out how people are framing him and shit, not the actual conspiracy.</p>

<p>Just as the shills ruined politics, the drumpfers ruined conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen so many posts about it because the shills want to publicly label this sub as anti-Hillary an receive validation for it. They want to spread the message that this sub is censored so that only anti-Hillary posts get through and they try to compare it directly, every time, to r/politics. I&#39;m not sure what else you need to see that groups of people are intentionally trying to frame this sub one way or another and rename it so they have an anti-r/politics sub to scorn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where&#39;s your proof for users decrying shill whenever they are disagreed with? When users post suspicious shit and have little to no post history here (not talking about you, I don&#39;t actually think you&#39;re a shill) and try to convince the entire community to rename the sub to r/anti-Hillary or whatever bullshit they&#39;ve been asking for, that&#39;s shill level. When you make a post complaining about how the sub is ruined, bought, etc. This is dangerously close to what some shills are doing. So maybe just be careful about complaining and labeling others so sweepingly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something else that got quietly hushed up was the 2nd shooter heading to Interrupt the Gay Pride Parade in West Los Angeles. Apparently after hearing that the Orlando Shooter was killed, the guy got scared that the CIA was going to &quot;Off&quot; him too and he actually turned himself into Santa Monica police. Here&#39;s the full story: </p>
