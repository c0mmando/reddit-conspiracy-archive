    <div class="md"><p>Tin-Foil is a go:</p>

<p>Why was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/21/europe/london-city-airport-evacuated/index.html">London Airport shut down</a> at the same time as the DDos attack? They claim it was because of a &quot;Chemical Incident&quot;, but as CNN (Puke) reports: &quot;No elevated readings were found and the building was ventilated, searched and declared safe.&quot;</p>

<p>Trying to move something through the airport without even security around? The speculation could end there, but stay tuned for the real Cold War shit:</p>

<p>Dyn, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2016_Dyn_cyberattack">the DNS provider to many of the worlds most heavily trafficked websites including Twitter, Reddit, and CNN had been on the recieving end of a DDoS attack</a>. Now Dyn, whose website encourages clients to <a href="http://dyn.com/">&quot;manage the internet like you own it&quot;</a>, has just welcomed their <a href="http://dyn.com/blog/dyn-announces-colin-doherty-as-new-ceo/">new CEO, hired Oct. 6th of this year</a> to replace their former CEO and founder who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/11/jeremy-hitchcock-steps-down/">left his job the day after gaining 50 million dollars</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/dyn-series-b/">series B funding</a>. The company was clearly performing well, why would they can the CEO? He said himself that maybe he wasnt cut out for the job. But was it his decision or Dyn&#39;s new investor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LetterOne#Pamplona_Capital_Management">Pamplona Capital Management</a>? </p>

<p>Well who is Pamplona anyway? It is headed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Knaster">Alexander Knaster</a>, Russian Billionaire (this isnt a Clinton hit piece I swear, if you doubt that just look at my history, yes it is short but I got banned from <a href="/r/redacted">/r/redacted</a> and made this account). Here are the board members of Pamplona&#39;s parent company, LetterOne (giant Wikipedia TL;DR incoming but the hyperlinks are to the sources - mostly):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Khan">German Kahn</a>, former director of TNK-BP (<em>that</em> BP) and current boardmember of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LetterOne">LetterOne</a>. Now <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2d178112-7008-11e5-9b9e-690fdae72044">LetterOne have reportedly been told in a letter from a senior UK official that this ‘is not a judgement on the suitability of LetterOne’s owners to control these or any other assets in the UK</a>(Sorry about the paywall, I dont know what to do about that), clearly there is some tension there. Net worth: 9.9b</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Fridman">Mikhail Fridman</a>, Co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfa-Bank">Alfa Bank</a>, the largest private bank in Russia and also the Chairman of LetterOne. His net worth of over <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/mikhail-fridman/">14.2b makes him the second richest man in Russia</a>. What makes him dangerous to Western Interests, or other billionaires? Maybe when he said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.milkenreview.org/articles/searching-for-growth-in-an-unstable-global-economy?IssueID=10">Last year I wrote an article in the – &quot;Tricks of the mind turned oil into gold&quot; – in which I said that the oil price had remained high because people perceived there was a shortage. I said that we <strong>were probably facing a new phase in which people would not fear the end of oil</strong>. Today, it&#39;s more or less clear that this is so.</a>, Emphasis mine.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Aven">Pyotr Aven</a>, Also on the board at Alfa Bank and LetterOne. But far more interesting is his time <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=12663877&amp;amp;privcapId=241771164">working as personal advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev</a> and later became Russia&#39;s representative to the G7. <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/wilson-center-to-honor-petr-aven-and-susan-carmel-lehrman">Aven received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship from the Smithsonian, in recognition of his contribution to corporate and public service to U.S.-Russia relations and &quot;building understanding&quot; between Russians and Americans during his career</a>. Net Worth: 5.1B</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So we have Dyn, a company that specializes in defending its clients from DDoS attacks, itself becoming a victim of such an attack that took out a substantial amount of the internet today while under <em>brand new leadership</em>. Simultaneously we dont know where Assange is with any certainty at all. And the London City Airport being completely evacuated for unsubstantiated concerns when, (roll eyes here), &lt; 20 people start coughing.</p>

<p>How does this relate to Pamplona? LetterOne, Pamplona&#39;s parent company, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/business/under-political-pressure-russian-billionaire-sells-energy-assets-in-north-sea.html">purchased North Sea oil interests for just shy of 6b dollars from a German company in March 2015. However, the British government refused to accept the Russian company as the new owners which forced LetterOne to sell for that acquisition for a mere <em>$750 Million</em>.</a>. Ouch. That might be what has pissed Russia off enough to &quot;meddle&quot; into american politics or at least to expose american hypocrisy.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with <em>anything</em>? Consider Joe Biden in a recent statement intending to reprimand Russia&#39;s alleged involvement in the DNC Leaks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re sending a message,” Mr. Biden told Chuck Todd, the show’s host. “We have the capacity to do it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shut down Russia&#39;s internet through Dyn, nab Assange, take him to some black site via a shutdown airport in the heart of London?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“He’ll know it,” Mr. Biden added. “And it will be at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh shit. The greatest impact, as in, when we could be looking forward to the most damning emails?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Todd <strong>asked whether the American public would know</strong> if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent.</p>

<p><strong>“Hope not,” Mr. Biden responded.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I certainly wouldnt want the American public to know that the US government is capable of their own Great Firewall, and are actively using it.</p>

<p>TL;DR: UK bilks Russian billionaires for 5 billion dollars prompting them to get involved in the DNC primary and leaking info to Assange who then gets targeted by the US, who shuts down an airport and shuts down the internet to secretly extract Assanges body and bury him next to Hoffa and the new Cold War started at the latest, last year and America has implemented the Great Firewall.</p>

<p>/tinfoil</p>

there is literally no barrier, or restriction for people to comment and post here.</p>

<p>i think it&#39;s largely been left alone due to the title, and the credibility posts, and comments lose to the outside reddit because of where it&#39;s discussed or posted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I interpret this:</p>

<p>The guy in the <a href="http://realitieswatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/122.jpg">card</a> is standing in front of his own coffin. As to make it known that &#39;he&#39; his dead (and STAY dead) and throw off a trail.</p>

<p><strong><em>apply tinfoil</em></strong></p>

<p>my theory for today:</p>

<p>Once TPTB <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/17/498243075/wikileaks-says-julian-assanges-internet-access-cut-off-by-state-party">cut</a> off  his internet, and WL &#39;activated <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-17/wikileaks-activates-contingency-plans-after-unknown-state-party-cuts-julian-assanges">contingency</a> plans,&#39; WL implemented his plans for escape. It is commonly known in the SpecOps world, that before you do a raid you cut of communications. That was WL que to get outta dodge.</p>

<p>Then, Pamela Anderson pays a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/16/pamela-anderson-says-julian-assange-was-a-bit-pale-after-visitin/">visit</a>. Do you think they can play <a href="http://content-img.newsinc.com/jpg/1391/31518278/45059567.jpg?t=1476619740">trading</a> spaces?</p>

<p>With all the time he had holed up in the embassy, he could&#39;ve devised the most intrepid &#39;ferris beuler&#39; type dummy with a tape recorder decoy to throw his voice into the room while his body escaped.</p>

<p>We hear that armed police are <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-21/wikileaks-reveals-heavily-armed-police-gathering-outside-ecuadorian-embassy-london">close</a> by, then the tweet stating:</p>

<p>&quot;Wrong building for Assange&#39;s EC bolt hole. Orator perch still waving flag. 51°29&#39;56.62&quot; N 0°09&#39;40.51&quot; W&quot;</p>

<p>meaning &quot;fooled you, Julian&#39;s Ecuadorian escape route was under the other building (london has lots of underground tunnels).&quot; </p>

<p>and &quot;the &#39;ferris bueler&#39; dummy voice that you are closing in on that you think is Julian, is still where you think he is.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-37734096">now</a> there is a &#39;chemical scare&#39; at london airport......</p>

<p>the perfect decoy for someone with the means to help him escape.</p>

<p><strong><em>takes off tinfoil</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t believe that as of yet, no one from Reddit /4Chan has arranged a public protest outside the embassy asking to see Julian.</p>

<p>It seems to me, that this sub will investigate anything EXCEPT the disappearance of Julian Assange.</p>

<p>So far the following bizarre events have taken place:</p>

<p>Julian goes missing:
WL start sending out bizarre tweets.
HRC starts advising people to look at WL?
Diane advises the emails have been altered!
All emails since P10 are weak with nothing damning.</p>

<p>Could this be that the subs and now the WL accounts themselves are indeed compromised and the biggest cucks of all, is us!</p>

<p>Have these threads become a barrage of non information, shit posts and general paranoia to the point of discrediting the users as crazy conspiracy theorist?</p>

<p>Why are so many posting, but not 1 actual person is looking into assanges disappearence?</p>

<p>There was an info graphic recently stating that this thread/sub had a huge amount of activity, is it possible this is bots or shills designed to muddy the waters, keep users distracted?</p>

<p>If assange has/was taken, you can be sure he would of said.. if you do anytbing to me, there will be public outcry... </p>

<p>imagine how Devistated he must feeling, knowing that not only was there not a public outcry, but in fact, not 1 person bothered to look for or try to find him, or at the very least arrange a rally outside the embassy demanding to see him, and that instead, people just let it go and he vanished in silence?</p>

<p>This thread won&#39;t let go of something Hilary said 10 years ago, but has absolutely already let go that a leader of the freeworld has been silenced and has gone missing without a word or a trace!!!</p>

Wikileaks tweets photo of security <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/58nyit/photo_heavily_armed_police_appear_outside/">outside</a>, but then deleted it. See my comment on that other thread about the C-Span interview (WL would not send out a tweet about the surrounding security detail. That&#39;s not about releasing &quot;truth&quot; and shining a light on corruption. They already had deep intel on the forces dedicated to monitoring them. WL might in fact be compromised.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve deleted tweets that they probably realized would not have been sent from the original account curator/s. It&#39;s only a matter of time before more people start calling bullshit - but they are likely holding out, delaying until the <em>election</em> passes by. (I use that term very loosely.)</p>

<p>Weird timing especially with all these weird happenings imo. </p>

<p>Edit: and twitter still down for me 
Edit: back up after I posted this. Hopefully coincidence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/maradesu You should probably add today&#39;s cyber DDoS attack against US companies to your list. It is very likely connected to everything else going on.</p>

<p>As for Twitter, someone is else or someone new is clearly writing Wikileaks latest tweets. I agree there is a change in tone.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure Assange is dead, but he certainly is no longer as visible or has access to Twitter.</p>

<p>What&#39;s also interesting is Snowden&#39;s silence throughout this election. I know he&#39;s asking to be pardoned by the White House, but I doubt it will happen.</p>

<p>At this point its clear there is more to the story then we know, but I&#39;m not sure either Assange or Snowden are dead. I think they&#39;ve simply been minimized, but not taken out.</p>

<p>edit:  this theory probably deserves another post- but I&#39;ll throw it in here.  the failed columbia peace deal is symbolic.  &quot;Columbia&quot; is a symbol of &quot;peace&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>the columbine (dove/ songbird) carrying the olive branch</li>
</ul>

<p>it&#39;s also the deification symbol of the United States.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting you&#39;re going to find a wikileak email from podesta saying that Hillary crashed the Farc deal to symbolize how trump is destroying the union.  I was referring to esoteric symbolism.  It&#39;s not something to argue over- just a perspective.</p>

<p>as far as things being named after &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot;-   Columbus is a anglicization of the Spanish Cristóbal (Crystal Ball) Colón (as in Colony of Christ).  His name in italian (Colombo) refers to the dove- as in the dove which brought back a sign of earth/ life/ refuge to the ark- new world.  As such, columbus is a symbol of the new world colony/ new world order- though it&#39;s interpreted for the masses as a symbol of &quot;peace&quot;- really it&#39;s about &quot;hope&quot; as in hope for a peaceful FUTURE.</p>
