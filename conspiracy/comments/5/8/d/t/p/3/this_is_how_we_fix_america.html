       It obviously won't be simple, and it requires real sweat and tears (no blood). I post this here because I can tell you're all passionately concerned about spreading the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a non-resident looking on, and I'm seeing an incredible amount of bullshit happening as you read this. This isn't normal or by any standards acceptable. You have both an inexcusable psychopath, and a mental asylum escapee seeking to run your homeland. They both have you by the balls simply because you hate the alternative's guts. Those paraded two are both shit, stop pretending.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself: Do you really support X? Or are they just better because you simply hate Y and their brainwashed supporters? Either way my friend...I can't help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to those who will listen to me, neither of them will step foot in that white house, because you're not going to let them do so. Its not a choice between evil or lesser evil really, you are going to either vote a third more sensible candidate, or not vote at all. Those are your new options.
      </p>
      <p>
       These leaks, emails, videos, investigations...they're not going to do anything for a person who's rolling deep in the bullshit if you just keep hollering "HEY WE EXPOSED THEM". Stop acting so fucking surprised, we're all aware of who they are now. Do not beg for change and attention, it is pitiful. You need to shut up and take action. Make videos, memes, posts, hashtags stating your position. 
(hash)WereNotVoting (hash)FuckLeftFuckRight, etc. I'm not familiar with whatever terms Americans might use to describe their stance, but take a level head and make firm and sensible statements. Don't ask or beg for people to join you, just let people know what you are doing, and why. People love to follow. Title your expose videos and articles "I'm done with this shit", instead of "Look at this shit", and you will see the effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all I can do from my end here, talk. But you have some real power. Do something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to reformat this message in any way you want, but retain the original impact. Inspire people to do, not to complain.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for America's sake, look before you all make one great fucking disastrous leap for mankind.

       No I appreciate your angle, I can't think of everything at once. Hm, I understand that they are drunk on cool aid, but I only suggest that changing the attitude and style of these information releases might penetrate their minds a little more. It can happen man, their brains aren't all cemented. What do you think?

       I take it personal because I'm a US citizen who knows shit is fucked (I'm a Polish ex-Communist immigrant). I also know, the whole world is. It's not just US, and simply blaming us is not right. The Brits are to blame, so are the French, the Germans, the Italians, the Swiss, the Egyptians, the Russians, the Colombians. We all are. We as people have fucked up. How is this not making any sense to people here? Here? Out of all fuckin' places.... We have only ourselves to blame as a people....

       Oh shut up. Countries are pussies. Don't blame the worlds shit on the US. We have been fucked for some time, but we are not the only ones. Every country has a corrupt conspirator who works with US because of ignorant or pussy populations. NAZI Germany would be one of the last who may have said fuck off. Fix your shit, and stop blaming people. If you're from the US, stop self hating. PEOPLE = SHIT, mainly governments and politicians..

       Ignoring the US's current role in global politics is not even realistic, mate. It's quite ironic really - you think other countries should fix their own shit while the US's own foreign policy is the complete opposite.

       I'm not denying it. NATO allows it, and Euro elects or is "supposed" to elect them. I actually give more credit to Europe in having more bawls than the US citizens, just misguided. IE the migrant infiltration, and allowing it...

       Yea, keep doing it. Because that is all you can do, because you don't want to take responsibility. Fix your own house, then fix the greater house. I may seem alien, and it's odd to hear. But, fix your shit, then we can talk.

       What you seem to be saying (rudely), is that people from other countries are wrong to acknowledge US influence in their politics. I don't need to refute that, it's ridiculous.

       Fix your own country then. Why you're electing corrupt officials. What you're saying is that a druggy is enamored by a drug dealer, because the drug dealer. Nope.. Drug dealer didn't bring them there, they did.... Still a druggy, which lead him there. Think, and fuck off :). A whore loves money, but doesn't necessarily like being fucked. Money trumps though....

       Look man, the intention,was for people to take up their own power more. I specified I'm not US to show I know little to nothing about the historical or current political environment (its a lot), so I can't give thoughts on that.

       Bwoy, nothing is wrong with my country. We're all fat and happy here, that's how I get enough free time to find myself all the way on reddit. To try to help. We don't even depend on the US for much more than Google search...and vehicles to Mars.

       A wise man once told me,"Most people want to just live in peace, raise and love their family. Only few wish war and drag the rest of us in. If we lived in peace we could explore the heavens as we are meant to."
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, here's a possible solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we should do is all write in Bernie and after voting, outside the voting area, congregate in mass. Some would conduct exit polls with local media broadcasting live reports. Make them count our votes If he wins in a landslide we then refuse to work until the electoral college validates our voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was the only possible candidate that could lead us out of this mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to stop serving the greater evils, have peace and explore space. We all deserve it.

       Oh shut up. Countries are pussies. Don't blame the worlds shit on the US. We have been fucked for some time, but we are not the only ones. Every country has a corrupt conspirator who works with US because of ignorant or pussy populations. NAZI Germany would be one of the last who may have said fuck off. Fix your shit, and stop blaming people. If you're from the US, stop self hating. PEOPLE = SHIT, mainly governments and politicians..
