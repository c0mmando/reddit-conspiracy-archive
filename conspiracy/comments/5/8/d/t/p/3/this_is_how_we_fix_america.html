        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It obviously won&#39;t be simple, and it requires real sweat and tears (no blood). I post this here because I can tell you&#39;re all passionately concerned about spreading the truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a non-resident looking on, and I&#39;m seeing an incredible amount of bullshit happening as you read this. This isn&#39;t normal or by any standards acceptable. You have both an inexcusable psychopath, and a mental asylum escapee seeking to run your homeland. They both have you by the balls simply because you hate the alternative&#39;s guts. Those paraded two are both shit, stop pretending.</p>

<p>Ask yourself: Do you really support X? Or are they just better because you simply hate Y and their brainwashed supporters? Either way my friend...I can&#39;t help you.</p>

<p>But to those who will listen to me, neither of them will step foot in that white house, because you&#39;re not going to let them do so. Its not a choice between evil or lesser evil really, you are going to either vote a third more sensible candidate, or not vote at all. Those are your new options. </p>

<p>These leaks, emails, videos, investigations...they&#39;re not going to do anything for a person who&#39;s rolling deep in the bullshit if you just keep hollering &quot;HEY WE EXPOSED THEM&quot;. Stop acting so fucking surprised, we&#39;re all aware of who they are now. Do not beg for change and attention, it is pitiful. You need to shut up and take action. Make videos, memes, posts, hashtags stating your position. 
(hash)WereNotVoting (hash)FuckLeftFuckRight, etc. I&#39;m not familiar with whatever terms Americans might use to describe their stance, but take a level head and make firm and sensible statements. Don&#39;t ask or beg for people to join you, just let people know what you are doing, and why. People love to follow. Title your expose videos and articles &quot;I&#39;m done with this shit&quot;, instead of &quot;Look at this shit&quot;, and you will see the effects.</p>

<p>This is all I can do from my end here, talk. But you have some real power. Do something.</p>

<p>Feel free to reformat this message in any way you want, but retain the original impact. Inspire people to do, not to complain.</p>

<p>And for America&#39;s sake, look before you all make one great fucking disastrous leap for mankind.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying it. NATO allows it, and Euro elects or is &quot;supposed&quot; to elect them. I actually give more credit to Europe in having more bawls than the US citizens, just misguided. IE the migrant infiltration, and allowing it... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A wise man once told me,&quot;Most people want to just live in peace, raise and love their family. Only few wish war and drag the rest of us in. If we lived in peace we could explore the heavens as we are meant to.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point, here&#39;s a possible solution.</p>

<p>What we should do is all write in Bernie and after voting, outside the voting area, congregate in mass. Some would conduct exit polls with local media broadcasting live reports. Make them count our votes If he wins in a landslide we then refuse to work until the electoral college validates our voice.</p>

<p>He was the only possible candidate that could lead us out of this mess.</p>

<p>We need to stop serving the greater evils, have peace and explore space. We all deserve it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh shut up. Countries are pussies. Don&#39;t blame the worlds shit on the US. We have been fucked for some time, but we are not the only ones. Every country has a corrupt conspirator who works with US because of ignorant or pussy populations. NAZI Germany would be one of the last who may have said fuck off. Fix your shit, and stop blaming people. If you&#39;re from the US, stop self hating. PEOPLE = SHIT, mainly governments and politicians..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. Your reasoning is fucked. It&#39;s a shame that the most arrogant are usually the most misguidedly confident, too.</p>

<p>If the drug dealer showed up, uninvited, and threw drugs through my window then I&#39;d blame him, yeah.</p>
