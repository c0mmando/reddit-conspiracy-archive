        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a copy/paste from my original thread in <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> which was censored.  Please help me track down how far this corruption goes.</p>

<p>I want to warn you that this is long so to start off let me give you the TLDR;</p>

<p><strong>When Soros and the DNC learned that they had been hacked, they immediately needed to devise a plan that not only discredited the leaks, but framed a narrative that would support their candidate Hillary Clinton.  They used the Guccifer 2.0 account and their corrupt media to place blame on the Russians (and Trump).  Below I&#39;m going to connect the dots for you and reveal why Soros is manipulating our election.</strong></p>

<p>Now for the details of how they created a narrative to squash Trump and escalate war with Russia.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you watch this video, you get an inside peak to the Russian mindset.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnqx6PYLqoQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnqx6PYLqoQ&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After watching that video you should be asking yourself, &quot;what does the Russian government have to gain with such a high risk move?&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li> Wikileaks has been around for a while, and the hacks have been occuring for sometime</li>
<li> Donald Trump is not a Russian Plant and there would be no way of knowing he would win the Republican Nominee.  He also received no direct help from Wikileaks or other hacking groups during the primaries</li>
<li> 16 Other Republican Candidates were a part of the primary, most like Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina were very Anti-Russia</li>
<li> The Russians have no way of knowing if Trump is pro-Russian.  All they have is his word, since he has no track record to run on for policy decisions.</li>
<li> The Russians didn&#39;t know that Hillary Clinton would employ Brownshirt Tactics and rig the DNC to win the Democratic Nominee.  If they did know, they would have idea that Jame&#39;s O&#39;Keefe would blow the lid off it.  Wikileaks started leaking information in June.  Well before there was enough forward facing credible evidence to support the corruption claims.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now Let&#39;s Talk Hackers</strong></p>

<p>Wikileaks has a perfect track record and has targeted the Clintons as early as 2010.  They and other actors knowingly took advantage of the lack of technical security within some key servers.  You&#39;re starting to see those leaks now.</p>

<p>We also know that Wikileaks and Assange never reveal their sources.  In the passed the U.S. government has had whistleblowers.  Some examples are Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden.  Another possibility could be <strong>Seth Rich</strong>. </p>

<p><a href="http://heavy.com/news/2016/07/seth-rich-dnc-voter-election-fraud-democratic-national-committee-wikileaks-murdered-shot-conspiracy-washington-clinton-data-analyst-emails/">http://heavy.com/news/2016/07/seth-rich-dnc-voter-election-fraud-democratic-national-committee-wikileaks-murdered-shot-conspiracy-washington-clinton-data-analyst-emails/</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s also been other high profile hackers in the passed like the original Guccifer and Anonymous.  These hackers work independently from any one government.  Hackers are notoriously hard to trace and can leave plenty of miscues on their trail.  There&#39;s no way of knowing who was responsible for leaking this information.</p>

<p>Unless of course someone comes forward to claim responsibility for the hacks.</p>

<p>Enter <strong>Guccifer 2.0</strong></p>

<p>If you&#39;re not familiar with Guccifer 2.0, they are shoddy, unreliable, and produced nothing of any real worth.  Their leaks consist of mostly forgeries, publicly known information or previous hacks.</p>

<p>Guccifer 2.0 showed up on the scene claiming to be responsible for providing Wikileaks with the hacked DNC files within a week of the drop.  No one has any previous knowledge of this person, but they claim to have hacked the Clinton Foundation, DNC, and other systems.</p>

<p>If you read this article or as I would say, propaganda, a few things stand out.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/meet-fancy-bear-the-russian-group-hacking-the-us-election?utm_term=.gs6rM3rMw#.ovlE9JE94">https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/meet-fancy-bear-the-russian-group-hacking-the-us-election?utm_term=.gs6rM3rMw#.ovlE9JE94</a></p>

<p>“Making those emails public, say cybersecurity experts and US intelligence officials, is what shifted the hack from another Russian cyber-espionage operation to a game changer in the long-simmering US–Russia cyberwar. Using the well-established WikiLeaks platform, as well as newly invented figureheads, ensured that the leaked emails got maximum exposure. Within 24 hours of the CrowdStrike report, a Twitter account under the name @Guccifer_2 was established and began tweeting about the hack on the DNC. One of thefirst tweets claimed responsibility for hacking the DNC’s servers, and in subsequent private messages with journalists, including BuzzFeed News, the account claimed that it was run by a lone Romanian hacker, and that he alone had been responsible for hacking into the DNC servers and, later, the Clinton Foundation, as well as senior members of Clinton’s staff. The account offered to send BuzzFeed News emails from the hacks and appeared to make the same offer to several US publications, including Gawker and theSmoking Gun.</p>

Within the week, WikiLeaks had published more than 19,000 DNC emails. Though WikiLeaks would not reveal the source, Guccifer 2.0 gleefully messaged journalists that he had been the source of the leak. Few bought the story — a language analysis on the Guccifer 2.0 account showed it made mistakes typical of Russian speakers, and when asked questions in Romanian by reporters in an online chat, Guccifer 2.0 appeared to not be able to answer. Meanwhile, metadata in the docs, such as Russian-language settings and software versions popular in Russia, ledcybersecurity experts to believe that not only were the emails leaked by Russia, but that Guccifer 2.0 was an account created by the Russian state to try and deflect attention.”</p>

<p>Why would a hacker working with Wikileaks who never reveal their sources &quot;gleefully&quot; contact the media and tell them they were responsible.  They would simultaneously leave plenty of evidence behind they were Russian, despite the first Guccifer being Romanian.  They would also leave behind forgeries, misinformation, to distract from the real leaks, yet be quoted as the source for Wikileaks in news articles.</p>

<p>A few more key phrases from that article.  Wikieleaks is described as a &quot;well established platform.&quot;  Guccifer 2.0 is described as a &quot;Newly Created Figurehead.&quot; Who just happens to be conveniently Russian.  This works perfectly for discrediting the leaks, matching Hillary&#39;s No-Fly Zone rhetoric, helps continue to push a Trump-Putin narrative and distracts from the real leaks and future leaks.</p>

<p><strong>Enter the Media</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/guccifer-2-0-dnc-docs-228091">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/guccifer-2-0-dnc-docs-228091</a></p>

<p>Here you have DNC Interim Chain Donna Brazile immediately trying to tie the leak to the GOP and presidential Nominee Donald Trump.  </p>

<p>&quot;There’s one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and that’s Donald Trump,&quot; she said in a statement Tuesday night, adding that Trump has &quot;embraced&quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin and &quot;publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign.&quot;  Trump claims his remarks were meant in jest and that he has no knowledge of who hacked the DNC.  Brazile also urged people to use &quot;extreme caution&quot; when accessing the documents, cautioning that they may contain malicious espionage software.  She said the DNC legal team is reviewing the documents to confirm their authenticity, and warned that &quot;it is common for Russian hackers to forge documents.&quot;</p>

<p>In one swift interview Donna Brazile who is proven to be corrupt by giving debate questions to HRC is telling you not to look at the emails because you&#39;ll get spyware.  Just like CNN told you it&#39;s illegal to look at them and you can only learn through the media.  Just in case you do look at them, be aware that some are forgeries (Only Guccifer 2.0&#39;s, which they always push forward when other reputable leaks happen).</p>

<p>Whenever there is a REAL leak, they always conflate it with fake ones and false flag accounts like Guccifer 2.0 (who they tie to Russia). </p>

<p>Notice the last part of that article. </p>

<p>“The reporters also noticed that this time around, Guccifer typed in broken English and mainly used emojis. In the past, Guccifer typed in near perfect English.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/08/31/guccifer-2-0-leaks-purported-dnc-memo-regarding-black-lives-matter/">http://www.snopes.com/2016/08/31/guccifer-2-0-leaks-purported-dnc-memo-regarding-black-lives-matter/</a></p>

<p>I want you to focus on one character in that article.  <strong>Deray McKesson</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://sandrarose.com/2016/07/deray-mckesson-lives-in-home-owned-by-wealthy-law-student/">http://sandrarose.com/2016/07/deray-mckesson-lives-in-home-owned-by-wealthy-law-student/</a></p>

<p>The manufactured outrage of BLM due to the fake Guccifer 2.0 leaks comes from a guy who lives in a house owned by wealthy donors to none other than George Soros&#39; Open Society Institute. McKesson has also visited with Obama around July 13.  Just over a month before the fake leaks.</p>

<p>This brings us back to other leaks.  Like DCLeaks which were confirmed to be real by Colin Powell.</p>

<p>This got me thinking.  I think that Russia was never intended to be painted into a big bad enemy this election cycle.  I think the issues were going to be mostly social bullshit, but Trump changed the narrative there.  He blew the lead off a lot of big problems, and then you had a series of attacks in Europe and the U.S. combined with the explosion of the great migration out of the Middle East.  This is a huge problem for the Democrats now, especially since we know how they were created.  Which is also why Barrack Obama is trying to squash ISIS asap, to erase that stain on the last 8 years.  The Democrats can&#39;t focus on the problems they created, so they try to deflect and distract.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget the &quot;Great reset&quot; Clinton had with Russia.  That ultimately left to this quote.</p>

<p>Last week, he dismissed criticism of the vote by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of US efforts to weaken Russia, and on Thursday he upped the ante by accusing US special forces of being involved in the killing of deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
&quot;Who did this?&quot; Putin said. &quot;Drones, including American ones. They attacked his column. Then - through the special forces, who should not have been there - they brought in the so-called opposition and fighters, and killed him without court or investigation.&quot;
A spokesman for the US military said the claim was &quot;ludicrous.&quot; In a related aside, Mr Putin said John McCain, the US senator, was losing his mind, probably because of the torture he suffered as a prisoner during the Vietnam War.
Putin was responding to remarks McCain made in October, when the former US presidential candidate said the killing of Col. Gaddafi should make &quot;dictators&quot; like Putin &quot;nervous.&quot; Signalling that President Barack Obama&#39;s much publicized attempt to &quot;reset&quot; relations with Russia was now barely alive, Mr Putin added: &quot;Sometimes it seems to me that America does not need allies, it needs vassals. People are tired of the dictates of one country.&quot;</p>

<p>Russia has apparently been threatened by the Obama/Clinton administration for quite some time, and surely doesn&#39;t want a full blown war.  They do see the destruction and wake that we&#39;ve left in the region though.  I don&#39;t doubt they pursue their own interests where they can. It seems super dangerous for them to get involved knowing the chance Hillary could win.  She already made anti-Russian decisions as Secretary of State and had used anti-Russian rhetoric during the primaries.  That&#39;s a big, big gamble and escalates tensions further.  That is unless they believe because of the strain on our Alliances and terrible leadership of the passed 8 years we can not contest the Russian interests anymore in the ME and they don&#39;t fear retribution (no one wants war).  Another, much more realistic option is they feel like the U.S. is screwing things up and poses as a very strong threat towards Russia and can&#39;t let Hillary become President at any cost (further destabilizes the world with her bad decisions and creates more hostility towards Russian interests and ultimately their stability which would result in War).  In my mind it’s scenario two, but Russia would never take a risk this big to try to manipulate the election and is unfortunately at the mercy of the U.S. </p>

<p><strong>This is why it is up to us Patriots.  There is a global ploy to subvert our glorious Nation.  Do not let Soros steal this election.  Do not let them escalate war with Russia.  They are criminals trying to manipulate you and bully their way to power.  All of this is connected and a well concerted effort to remove your freedoms.</strong></p>

<p>I believe the Clinton Foundation and other more serious leaks are coming.  Stay Nimble, look for discrepancies and false flags.  ALWAYS question the narrative, and get out and vote!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m always impressed with Putin after I watch him speak. It&#39;s such a vast difference on how he handles himself and the press compared to US leaders. He speaks plainly and in great detail about everything while our politicans are slimey scripted douchebags who treat us like stupid children and they do nothing but try to placate us or rile us up against the &quot;enemy&quot;.</p>

<p>They&#39;re more than likely 10x as corrupt as Putin too, despite him being far from saintly.</p>
