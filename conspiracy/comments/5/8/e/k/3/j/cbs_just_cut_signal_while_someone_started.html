       The guy started in on details about Haiti and as soon as he said the word Haiti I got black screen and no audio, went back to full HD and perfect sound just as that guy finished talking.

      <p>
       Anyone else have that experience?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I am talking about during the post debate focus group discussion. I was watching it thinking how contrived it seemed, then someone finally had a negative comment about Hillary, and I got a short blackout.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: Just realized I caught it on DVR.

       It's some of each of those along with amazement for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's impressive on some twisted level that was coordinated in real-time and communicated downstream so that the talking heads were all ready to go when the director gave each the signal they were on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's going to be real change that benefits all of us, this was another step forward towards exposing all of the lies.

       Every single one of them said the exact same thing over and over again. Even the "comedians". Did not one of them have an original thought on the debate? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills - how is it that people don't catch on? Is it because they only watch one to three news sources, and therefore don't realize that literally everyone is hammering the same nonsense home as if it were the last nail in the coffin? Or is it because the repetitive statements, flashing and twirling sigils, combined with high emotion/minimal logic and research literally hypnotizes them into their MSM ordained position? Fuck, wake up people. We need you to get it together.

       It reminded of the video about shopping that went around during the holidays last year that showed the talking heads all using the same script regardless of which city/state they broadcast in.

       As I was reading your comment, they just said on the news that Trump campaign is already responding to the controversial statement that he would not accept the result of the election....(local Podunk news)
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeebus...unrelated but that was immediately followed by a story about a vote to remove a statue of Thomas Jefferson's grandson from the college campus because he was a slave owner and the statue is therefore racist, even though he founded the seminary that later became the university.

       I liked his answer too. It's so disturbing how they've asked him this in two out of three debates now as if they're trying to advance discredit him (pre-discredit?) because they know something is up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in a way I think it's much more disturbing they all had the same talking points, national and local, within seconds, particularly on one of the least memorable bits of an explosive debate.

       There is a name for this. Its called: censorship. And its usually the very beginning to very bad things, such as fascism.

        as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.[7] Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.[7]

        Fascism promotes the establishment of a totalitarian state.[161] It opposes liberal democracy, rejects multi-party systems, and supports a one-party state. The Doctrine of Fascism states, "The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people."[162] In The Legal Basis of the Total State, Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt described the Nazi intention to form a "strong state which guarantees a totality of political unity transcending all diversity" in order to avoid a "disastrous pluralism tearing the German people apart".[163]
       </p>
       <p>
        Fascist states pursued policies of social indoctrination through propaganda in education and the media and regulation of the production of educational and media materials.[164][165] Education was designed to glorify the fascist movement and inform students of its historical and political importance to the nation. It attempted to purge ideas that were not consistent with the beliefs of the fascist movement and to teach students to be obedient to the state.[166]

       Trump may be a nationalist at heart, which is a different form of fascism, but it certainly doesn't appear that he has the propaganda arm that Clinton wields. It doesn't appear like he's the one instigating political violence at campaign rallies. It doesn't appear that he is strong arming the election by painting one party as non-viable due to it being made up of "deplorable" people, effectively pushing for the concept that the US is now a one-party state. It doesn't appear that he instigating international conflicts with allies by pushing the narrative that Russia is evil and trying to strong arm the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like nearly every attack Clinton has brought out against Trump, its because she is trying to deflect against her own record of shittiness. Classic Karl Rove tactic. So when she started trotting out that he was a fascist, thats when I personally started to worry. Meanwhile, Trump has all but certified that he's just a plant by Clinton to take the fall for the election. Had there been a more popular Republican candidate this cycle, it would have otherwise been too obvious when the results came in heavily for Clinton anyway.

       You only have this 20 minutes of fame "journalists" covering this joke of an election. Do you really want to be known as just another shill that took a few bucks from the DNC, or Clinton Foundation? Seriously you're going to get caught, it is inevitable. You might as well live by example and do some good for your country instead of have your 20 minutes of shameful fame.

       I was watching the NBC feed on YouTube. During the pre-debate coverage, after talking to pro-shillary people, the correspondent said "now let's hear from Trump's people". At that moment the audio cut out and there was nothing until the start of the debate. Greasy.

       Just watched on CBS, it didn't cut for me. When the black guy brought it up it did not cut for me to be specific. I'm in Pima county AZ if that helps. Not ruling out other areas like yours, though, more could be cut.

       There was no cut on the CBS live stream from my location. Keep in mind that normally the content servers will be different across the country and it's possible some were affected while others weren't. They could have easily done this in swing states only or whatever they desired.

       Florida! And in an area of Florida where there are approximately 2 democrats and 1 independent per Republican. Someone else commented on the YouTube video that his cut out live also. Being as how I was basically watching a satellite feed of a local news affiliate's feed of a national network feed, there are definitely multiple points of failure and or opportunities to correct the record.

       Warhorses need blinders.  The support they'll need for war comes from the people on the couches watching television.  They'll probably cripple the internet at some point and blame it on Russia, so they can squash dissent and push propaganda to the max on TV as they have been, but without openly discussed criticism.

       You should have watched CSPAN, the first caller after the debate called Bill Clinton a rapist, then got cut off. It was glorious and the next caller failed, so we all had dead time for that to sink in.

       Force a narrative. It's that simple. And what's going in Haiti is a shame, sham and outrageous. 6 years since the earthquake other than food and medical relief what has been done to help Haiti help themselves?

       The Clinton Foundation charity work has gone no where including 150 million project.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shows the public is paying attention to these issue although I doubt they found out from the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       A forcing a narrative and/or constructing a desired answer has been used by survey companies for decades to make a product seem great. Take a survey from a store, car dealer and/or the companies they use you see very specific questions designed to illicit specific answers, not for information but to fit a narrative.

       It honestly looks like someone just turned off their TV right after the guy started answering the question and then turned it on again a few seconds later.

       When it happened live, I actually grabbed my TV remote thinking me or my dogs had accidentally bumped a button, but my TV makes a light show when turned on or off, and if the DirecTV box goes off the TV shows an LG logo screensaver as soon as it doesn't have a signal. Bout the time I realized that, the feed came back. I did literally think for a second that something had turned off though when it happened live.

       The post debate focus group on the national coverage. An African American gentleman said Hillary lied about the foundation, then said the word Haiti and I got blank screen until he was done talking.
