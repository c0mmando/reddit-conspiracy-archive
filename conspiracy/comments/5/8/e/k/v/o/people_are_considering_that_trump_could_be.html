But he didn&#39;t and now there is the hard truth that has been pushed aside for some time now... That Trump is controlled opposition. Some of us have caught onto it sooner by the way Trump repeatedly says he is going to deal with ISIS and how much of a problem they are. But why would one keep shouting out that ISIS is a problem when the TPTB/CIA control it?</p>

<p>We had two considerable anons on 4chan: FBIanon and High Level Insider. FBIanon has failed whereas HLIanon has specificed that Trump is controlled opposition since he popped up in /CFG/ threads and has made claims that are highly possible to be true. </p>

<p>I know that Shills will try to push away the topic, but we need to start opening our minds and really look behind the lens. We have to start thinking of alternatives so that we can have something to fight for. We can&#39;t fight on &quot;TPTB are evil!&quot; alone... We need a vision of a future that is possible and grounded in reality. We can start this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For example if Trump became POTUS and had Hillary arrested like he claims, that would be a pretty telling sign of non-collusion. Or on the other hand if Hillary got elected and Trump then began endorsing her, that would be evidence of team play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he comes out full conspiracy theorist they will use that against him. He would have to limit his attacks to the things have the most evidence and fewest avenues of weaseling out of them. He talked about Wikileaks because their only defense is attacking the messenger.</p>

<p>The US funding and controlling ISIS is one of those things they could easily turn around on him because to verify it requires a great deal of research, and you&#39;re average person isn&#39;t going to do that. But by saying he&#39;ll deal with ISIS, it&#39;s a subtle way of saying he will be dealing with their controllers as well.</p>

<p>If you think Trump is controlled opposition, they who do you vote for? One of the other unpopular candidates that have no chance? That would only help Hillary.</p>

<p>If Hillary is elected and some people go to Trump as an alternative leader, if he is controlled opposition then all those people are screwed. If not, it would be the only hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One doesn&#39;t have to go full conspiracy theorist to defeat Clinton in a debate.</p>

<p>If anyone did then they would surely deserve to lose unless they had huge amounts of information and heavy blackmail capabilities. I&#39;m not saying for him to point out ISIS is a controlled faction. The question you should asking is: if Trump knows ISIS is controlled, why would he need to keep spouting off about it when he can press other things? By talking about ISIS so much, he is actually having the opposite on people who don&#39;t know what ISIS is (which is a controlled faction to help TPTB further their objectives in the ME without complaint from the masses). To them, they would think that Trump should continue the hunt for ISIS... Which is beneficial to the Elites.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re on the wrong track of asking me who to vote for. Any reasonable regime wouldn&#39;t want there to be a possibility of there being an opposition to it. The players in the current government have been around for a long time. Making another JFK happen is reasonably easy for them. </p>

<p>In an alternate world, Trump could have been the somewhat decent guy in recent history but after going through HLIanon threads, reading up on CIA/ISIS from the r/Conspiracy posts, and thinking about what would actually be possible and questioning... Trump isn&#39;t playing the field right if he wanted to actually win. </p>

Yeah that first one was a wash but then again the moderator was ridiculously biased along with the questions which were hit pieces. In fact in many cases Trump has had to go off topic to really attack her on some of these issues cause the moderators will not go there on their own.</p>
