<p>Look, there might be some people here who will be offended by my disbelief of lizard people and all that, but for the most part I think this is a pretty rational sub filled with cautiously curious people who question everything around them. And there might be some cooky theories here (it is a conspiracy sub, after all), but what you won&#39;t find here is censorship and the suppression of unpalatable news/beliefs. I come here and read things, true things, things independently verified (things like wikileaks findings), shocking things that you would never find anywhere on the MSM. And that is why I come here: open discussion with people who question the world around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand. I go through phases of interest and disinterest.</p>

<p>To address your concern about the idea that &quot;[you] don&#39;t believe everything is corrupt and someone is pulling the strings&quot;:</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories involving an evil cabal controlling everything are generally referred to as &quot;grand conspiracy&quot; theories to differentiate them from the standard conspiracies involving a handful or even a few hundred people for a limited and specific purpose (e.g. conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to defraud, etc).</p>

<p>One of the possible explanations for the type of grand conspiracy thinking you often see on this sub is the desire for order in a world that seems uncomfortably chaotic. This is not entirely confirmed, but the evidence and research tend to lean that way. For some people, this argument goes, it is more comfortable to think there is an evil force causing all bad things to happen than to think that the world is generally unpredictable, bad things happen to good people, and coincidences abound. </p>

<p>Because of this desire, the human mind&#39;s fantastic ability to identify patterns (even when there are none), and the pride at being one of the &quot;awake&quot;, the grand conspiracy theory is born. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why this makes one unfit for hanging on this sub; if anything, it makes you uniquely qualified. Right now, this sub is full of election crap and even when it&#39;s not, it&#39;s full of propaganda posted by many different interests who believe - whether it&#39;s merited or not - that we&#39;re &quot;influencers&quot; worth their propaganda time. Newsflash: Instigators of &quot;it&#39;s all a hoax&quot; are typically working for someone and the rest are gullible useful idiots. They need those of us who aren&#39;t either to be here to take the piss. If you have the stomach for weeding through that garbage (bonus if you have the fortitude to realize &quot;karma&quot; is bullshit and calling bullshit on stuff like that is worth a few seconds), there&#39;s worthwhile content and good people here. If you don&#39;t...I guess we all kind of understand because we&#39;ve been there, but there&#39;s no reason to grandstand about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve worked with people in government and I&#39;ve never come across a lick of any sort of brotherhoods, illuminaughty, or any crap like that.  The world is made up of people like you and YOUR group of friends.  You help each other in sickness and doubt, and you give them jobs when you can, and you invite them to a meal or offer them a couch when they are short.  The world is FULL of normal fucking people.</p>

<p>There are ladder climbers and cabals, and surely some people&#39;s aspirations and agendas are bigger than others, but sometimes the search for the truth can lead you into a LOT of dark places full of people just out there trying to confuse and manipulate each other.  r/The_donald has shitposted all over reddit and ruined a lot of nice subs including here, r/wikileaks, r/news, and others with fucking racism and propaganda, taking an ounce of truth to justify a mountain of lies and to try and get their agenda across while smearing everybody else.  Fuck that!</p>

<p>I visit here to get a different perspective on things, and <em>perhaps</em> get a unique perspective.  There aren&#39;t any unique perspectives here anymore, just a bunch of people wanking each other off about how smart they are and how &quot;the government&quot; is out to get everyone.  Fuck that.  </p>

<p>If you pay taxes, then the government actually works for you!  Have a problem?  Call you local elected official, schedule a meeting with your local council member, or someone from your congressman&#39;s office.  They will actually meet with you or have a representative that will.  This is YOUR country, and don&#39;t let anyone tell you it isn&#39;t.</p>
