    <div class="md"><p>Imagine how it will look years from now. &quot;first female president was up against Trump the clown, had the entire media on her side, had to rig the primary against an old man, has a history of corruption spanning decades, had the FBI bale her out, had 6 million dollars go to employee an army of users to &#39;correct the record&#39;  online, and is amongst the least favorable candidate in history&quot;.  </p>

<p>Her goons would look at this list and say &quot;still president&quot;, that&#39;s just the type of people who support this type of candidate. Ends justify the means. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll try to rewrite history as well (probably with google), but <del>the Russians</del> anyone with integrity will stop them with evidence. </p>

<p>Maybe she&#39;ll be first female president to be impeached. Then she a Bill can be the first impeached couple. I bet they&#39;ll stay in politics if that were to happen anyways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh god, PLEASE, let&#39;s not start about this. You&#39;re right, absolutely, I see it and HEAR it everywhere. It was REALLY bad in the beginning, but thankfully it has died down :)</p>

<p>But are we really that shocked? Hillary is scum, she is not above ANY &#39;tactic&#39; to get the votes. Obama received similar votes from the black community. Even the 2nd time he ran, when a few voices were heard pointing out the few things he had done, when he had promised to do so many other things for the black community and failed to do them. Or even discuss them.</p>

If he has some insane executive orders then you can bet that the powers that be will intervene. He won&#39;t start a war with Russia which Hillary seems to be itching to do and he probably won&#39;t deport anyone besides the illegal immigrants that we house in for profit and labor camp prisons. Companies like GE would be pissed at losing some of their cheap labor force but America would benefit because we wouldn&#39;t be dropping 65k a year to keep someone in jail. HE couldn&#39;t go after legal immigrants because our country relies on them too much, the tech industry for one would crumble overnight if he deported all legal immigrants by revoking their visas.  </p>
