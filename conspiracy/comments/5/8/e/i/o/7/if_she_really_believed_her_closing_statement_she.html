       I wouldn't have a problem with a woman President but not Hillary.  There is so much baggage (false and true)  that should make everyone think about her creditability and true intentions (ego trip, more $$$$$)?

       Imagine how it will look years from now. "first female president was up against Trump the clown, had the entire media on her side, had to rig the primary against an old man, has a history of corruption spanning decades, had the FBI bale her out, had 6 million dollars go to employee an army of users to 'correct the record'  online, and is amongst the least favorable candidate in history".
      </p>
      <p>
       Her goons would look at this list and say "still president", that's just the type of people who support this type of candidate. Ends justify the means. I'm sure they'll try to rewrite history as well (probably with google), but
       <del>
        the Russians
       </del>
       anyone with integrity will stop them with evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe she'll be first female president to be impeached. Then she a Bill can be the first impeached couple. I bet they'll stay in politics if that were to happen anyways.

       This is what they (Hillary supporters) LOVE claiming, that if you Dont want Hillary as Pres, then it MUST mean you're afraid of a woman being President. augh. Everyone has to walk on glass, or they are considered being sexist and ancient when in reality we Dont care what sex the President is just Dont be Hillary. Don't be any of the current choices but DEFINITELY not Hillary.

       The other mantra is "if you're a woman" you are voting for Hillary?  If you don't - you're a traitor to your sex and women all over the World - yikes that's allot.

       Oh god, PLEASE, let's not start about this. You're right, absolutely, I see it and HEAR it everywhere. It was REALLY bad in the beginning, but thankfully it has died down :)
      </p>
      <p>
       But are we really that shocked? Hillary is scum, she is not above ANY 'tactic' to get the votes. Obama received similar votes from the black community. Even the 2nd time he ran, when a few voices were heard pointing out the few things he had done, when he had promised to do so many other things for the black community and failed to do them. Or even discuss them.

       Orientation shouldn't be an issue but a person's creditability and true intentions to lead our Country are top priorities.  The double speaking and complete reversal on key issues "behind closed doors" is wrong and truly represents what she thinks?

       the scariest thing is the only other option is fucking donald trump. we are in a bad movie. fucking hell! I can scarcely imagine 2 worse choices, it's like choosing between the KKK and Hamas, both are shit and you don't want either but there's nothing you can do because they just have anyone who resists them kidnapped or killed or silenced in some way..so..we're out of luck!

       Honestly, I'm not that scared. I won't vote for that idiot but most of his insane ideas will be stopped the second it is put to a vote. If he has some insane executive orders then you can bet that the powers that be will intervene. He won't start a war with Russia which Hillary seems to be itching to do and he probably won't deport anyone besides the illegal immigrants that we house in for profit and labor camp prisons. Companies like GE would be pissed at losing some of their cheap labor force but America would benefit because we wouldn't be dropping 65k a year to keep someone in jail. HE couldn't go after legal immigrants because our country relies on them too much, the tech industry for one would crumble overnight if he deported all legal immigrants by revoking their visas.

       Legal immigration is not as much of a problem as "illigeal immigrants".   The financial burden of  "illegal immigrants"  comes straight out of "our pockets".   We keep hearing about the infrastructure, our power grid and other projects that need financing but there's no money?    The high numbers of undocumented immigrants (millions &amp; millions) equate directly to dollars spent and wasted.  NATIONALISM over Globalism - save our Country?

       'Mr Sanders' is economically illiterate. His proposals, which never would have been passed by Congress anyway, would have doubled the debt and plunged the country into Venezuelan-style chaos. Let's face it...all the 'candidates' suck.
