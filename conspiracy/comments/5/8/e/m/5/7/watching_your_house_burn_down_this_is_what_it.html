<p>By all objective standards Trump sucks and is one of the worst candidates we&#39;ve seen, but Clinton is so completely and utterly corrupt... it is astounding how people can just look past everything and really rally behind them. Do these people really just plug their ears and pretend like Hillary isn&#39;t pure evil?  Do these people really think Donald will make America great again?
Watching this show is depressing, not because the quality of the candidates but the willingness of the public to support them. </p>

<p>This sounds all well and good from a moral or legal standpoint.  However, the logistics and expenses of trying to forcibly deport millions of people show it to be a fools paradise.
You would begin a &quot;war on illegals&quot; that would match the &quot;war on drugs&quot; in ineptitude and ineffectiveness.</p>

<p>I feel all humans are brothers. This obsession with &quot;our&quot; people and &quot;our&quot; land and &quot;our&quot; borders is an outlook designed to make you complacent with the exploitation of both yourself and those in others countries. Gotta work hard and pay taxes to protect &quot;our&quot; border. Gotta keep you in fear of &quot;those people&quot; coming over and taking &quot;our stuff&quot;.</p>

<p>And that mentality makes perfect sense to you - if you lived in a shithole that keeps getting worse due to capitalistic demands, and you knew there was a nicer place elsewhere, <em>wouldn&#39;t you want that for yourself and your family?</em> </p>

<p>But as soon as they come knocking on our door and want the standards of life we enjoy, you would turn away your brother. Do you not think there&#39;s enough? Or do you think we would dilute ourselves, resulting in a lower standard of living for everyone? Doesn&#39;t that imply that you have ALWAYS had a higher standard of living than others, and your resentment towards them is really a thinly veiled fear that they will demand equality, and lower your position in doing so?</p>

<p>What would Jesus do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My great grandparents were immigrants from Austria who went through the proper channels and applied for citizenship back in the 1920s. I feel like a lot of people have that same experience in their families.</p>

<p>Nowadays the system to apply to become a citizen is different, however people still apply the legal way. What most people have a problem with is border hoppers who take jobs and then send the money they receive back into their country of origin. I am not just talking about Mexico, think farther and wider. Illegal immigration is a business, and there are many ways to go about it, such as marriage scams. This is offensive to most people who have worked through the system because it lessens their struggle.</p>

<p>Companies do not exploit third world countries just because of slave labor, but also for tax laws and trade deals. You pay taxes on any profit you make overseas, so most companies keep their money in tax havens, whether that be for legal or illegal reasons. Our trade deals state that countries importing goods into our country pay far, far less than it would be if we exported them. Again, corporations know this and abuse it.</p>

<p>We should probably reform our society, distribute goods equally, and then find peace with one another in our equality. Realistically, I doubt our primate brains can make the conceptual leaps required.</p>

<p>Total fucking bullshit backed by zero evidence. I’m going to say this once, just once, for all the stupid knuckledragging fucks in the world (<em>not you</em>): YOU CANNOT CONTROL AN ENTIRE COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE WITH TANKS, JETS, BATTLESHIPS OR ANY OF THAT.</p>

<p>A fighter jet cannot stand on street corners and enforce no assembly edicts. A fighter jet cannot kick down your door at 3 AM to search your house for contraband material or antisocial propaganda. A fighter jet is useless for maintaining a police state. Police are needed to maintain a police state. And no matter how many police you have, they are always outnumbered by the people, which is why it’s important for your police to have automatic weapons and your people to have nothing but their limp dicks.</p>

<p>But when every random pedestrian might have a Glock jammed in his waistband, kicking down those doors becomes a lot fucking riskier, lest you catch a bullet on your way in.</p>

<p>America has a small standing professional army. (I’m using the term “army” to refer to the entirety of the Department of Defense) of 1,456,862 personnel and 1,458,500 reserve. They are probably the best-funded, best-trained, and best-equipped fighting force in the world today and the best which has ever existed in raw technological killing power.</p>

<p>There are 311,591,917 people in the US, of which 73,270,043 are males age 18-49. There are also 90 guns every 100 persons in the US. Now, even assuming every one of those million and a half active members of the armed forces are trained infantry grunts (pro tip: they aren’t), how well do you think they will do against 73 FUCKING TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER?</p>

<p>Even assuming there would be no defection or desertion among the armed forces, they are still massively outnumbered and outgunned by an enemy they can’t tell apart from their supporters. We’re getting good at it, but not good enough.</p>

<p>Al-Qaida and the Taliban ran us ragged for more than a decade with muskets used by illiterate goat herders and a few well-connected, college-educated fanatics in their leadership. Why? Because they hid among people we were told NOT to kill, and so were allowed to win. The only way to win against them is to slaughter them all, and while that should be done there, it couldn’t be done here in a civil war scenario. The US is a technologically advanced society completely saturated with the Internet and the advances of modern manufacturing. Nearly military grade weapons are the most common rifle here.</p>

<p>Go ahead and try to stop an armed insurrection.</p>

It&#39;s a dangerous game they&#39;re playing, because we can win. I&#39;m not in the military and have never had occasion to ask myself, &quot;would I be willing to die for the future of my country?&quot;  I decided during this election that yes, I would. America&#39;s future is more important than mine. I would gladly stand in front of the tank. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The OP is absolutely right. The day after election is going to be violent - I can feel it in my bones. 50% of the country is going to feel complete disenfranchised and angry and nothing is going to prevent that.</p>

<p>This election represents a fork in the road and a change in direction for our country. I personally don&#39;t like the direction Hillary wants to take our country in.</p>

<p>When the United States ended slavery... that represented a major shift in direction for our country. We all know how that turned out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps. But would you rather be standing there watching your home burn down and see Hillary laughing maniacally with an empty gas can, Or Trump desperately trying to put it out with a garden hose knowing that while it may not be enough, if you love your home no matter how small the odds, that you should never give up?</p>

<p>In 1988 Trump said that if things ever got so Bad that he would step up to bat. Things have never been worse and  28 years later here he is.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEPs17_AkTI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEPs17_AkTI</a></p>

<p>We know exactly what Hillary is planning for our country as we have wiki-leaks and 20 years of failed policies. Trump MIGHT be racist, Might Be Sexist and Might be no different. However, no one can be certain of anything other than about What Hillary WILL do.
 Never before has someone such as Hillary been permitted to commit so many crimes against America and been permitted to be allowed to run for president. Only 2 Us presidents have ever been impeached, and one of them was her husband.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I would fully argue that the internet is why we are where we are in many facets of life.  I&#39;m not at all against it, but I&#39;d say for sure it&#39;s why there&#39;s so many upheavals going on in so much of our lives.  For instance, when I was just out of high school, the internet had really just started.  I used to get on a chatroom called &quot;The Globe&quot;.  That was my first instance of talking to people of all religions.  My father is a Pentecostal Minister and it was so eye opening.  This example has been going on through the years, with religion,  social recognition,  etc. The ability to talk on a Planetary scale has changed us as a species</p>

<p>The events that caused me to get over zealous (world changing)  have been, a very first commerical with Dick Cavet on something called a personal computer (well educated husband said &#39;Who would want a personal computer.  What good are they?&quot;), a brand new network that utilized every citys local channel and challenge the three major networks (Fox), 911, the first day of the Arab Spring in Egypt,  and the banks failing the morning it was first meantioned.   These events (for some reason) stand out lmmediantly to me.</p>

<p>I also have rarely paid any attention to elections and left it up to others to make those decisions.  But, immediately when the primarys began, I gravitated towards Trump as our best choice.  Trump would normally not have been my choice at all.  He is loud, pushy, at times even rude.  He has very little experience in politics and he wants to build a wall of separation.  All those things I hold against him but there is something that tells me he is running in this race for a reason.</p>

<p>I believe we are at a cross road that we are meant to make a decission.  Just like the events I meantioned earlier we are in a place that very large changes are coming and it will be a major decission for our country.  The choice we make will be a very strong deciding factor on how we are going to prepare ourselves for the least amount of damage (as damage, suffering etc is coming for this country and the world).</p>

<p>Trumps policys are going to get us through the upcoming mess.  Although we can all pretty much say he&#39;s a jerk at times he is still an honest man.  What he wants to do with closing borders, building up our forces, and changing our economics etc will help us prepare for the upcoming event, an unstable United States.  Whether anyone likes it or not, we will all be hunkering down in a few short years.  We will need to be like England and vote in a Brixite (sp?).  Because our citizens come first.  Through Trumps inexperience we can gain ground on lessoning the momentum of distress.  We have to come home and strengthen out country from within.  </p>

<p>Hillary on the other hand has a lot of experience.  Whether she made bad choices or not doesn&#39;t matter and her history becomes mute at this point.  The giant wheel of politics has grown oversized and by politicans following the same path as they always have our country will not survive the great devide of this world.  Hillary will take each small event that leads into a greater event and apply what she&#39;s learned to do under degress.  These applications of applying the same old solutions will compound the problems.  She will not look very far into the big picture and will only try and repair problems as they come and be easily distracted.by additional issues she would believe are not important.  </p>

<p>Believing it should be politics as usual by us is a big mistake for us to make.  England didn&#39;t like Winston Churchill much but he got the counrty through some very rough times.  Trump is like that to us.  Although Trump may not understand his part in much of this, his policys (although they may sound extream) places our country into the best position to weather the storm.</p>

<p>I can not tell which way this election is going.  With all these petty distractions and how close we keep paying attention it makes it almost impossible to determine.  But when we all scratch our heads and think this is a stupid, silly, no win election, we all must consider that therepair are reasons for everything.  Are we going to make the same mistake my husband made when he said &quot;no one needs a personal computer&#39; argument?  Its time to bring us home, repair our borders (temporary), and strengthen our economy.  I believe there are major changes coming and we may lose our  world position of center stage from our own internal unrest.</p>

<p>we owe them nothing</p>

<p>I feel all humans are brothers. This obsession with &quot;our&quot; people and &quot;our&quot; land and &quot;our&quot; borders is an outlook designed to make you complacent with the exploitation of both yourself and those in others countries. Gotta work hard and pay taxes to protect &quot;our&quot; border. Gotta keep you in fear of &quot;those people&quot; coming over and taking &quot;our stuff&quot;.</p>

<p>And that mentality makes perfect sense to you - if you lived in a shithole that keeps getting worse due to capitalistic demands, and you knew there was a nicer place elsewhere, <em>wouldn&#39;t you want that for yourself and your family?</em> </p>

<p>But as soon as they come knocking on our door and want the standards of life we enjoy, you would turn away your brother. Do you not think there&#39;s enough? Or do you think we would dilute ourselves, resulting in a lower standard of living for everyone? Doesn&#39;t that imply that you have ALWAYS had a higher standard of living than others, and your resentment towards them is really a thinly veiled fear that they will demand equality, and lower your position in doing so?</p>

<p>What would Jesus do?</p>
