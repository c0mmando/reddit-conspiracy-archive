       Looking at the front page it feels like America is taking crazy pills.

       By all objective standards Trump sucks and is one of the worst candidates we've seen, but Clinton is so completely and utterly corrupt... it is astounding how people can just look past everything and really rally behind them. Do these people really just plug their ears and pretend like Hillary isn't pure evil?  Do these people really think Donald will make America great again?
Watching this show is depressing, not because the quality of the candidates but the willingness of the public to support them.

       Most of the Clinton supporters I know are real, brainwashed, and scary, especially because before this year we were pretty much on the same page about most stuff. But the past year has seen a huge escalation in divisiveness and knee-jerk reactions.

       Whats sad, is most people I talk to have no idea what Wiki leaks is, who Julian Assange is, whats going in Syria, nothing. Yet they hate Trump because he says mean things and are fully behind Clinton just based on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is no Saint and his performance last night was extremely disappointing, but at this point he is def the lesser of the two evils.

       Trump is saying some things that need to be done in a way no candidate before, at least in my lifetime, has had the balls to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immigration is a big problem and I would like a president to take a hard stance about cleaning out every. Single. Illegal. In the country. Every one. I don't care if they're 1 year old or 90. Get rid of them.
      </p>

       So no, he's not by "all objective standards" "one of the worst candidates we've seen."
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not nearly as bad as Bush Jr, or Obama, both who got elected twice.

       This sounds all well and good from a moral or legal standpoint.  However, the logistics and expenses of trying to forcibly deport millions of people show it to be a fools paradise.
You would begin a "war on illegals" that would match the "war on drugs" in ineptitude and ineffectiveness.

       Yeah right fuck these people! Having the audacity to dare try to partake in OUR land of the free?! The fucking nerve! Stay on your side of the imaginary line, where I don't have to even pretend to care about all the terrible things my endless capitalistic desires have wrought upon you. Dig up metals for my iphone, grow coffee for my cup, cut down the amazon so I can eat beef with every meal, destroy yourself in sweatshop labor for my clothes and goods. But never dream of coming to my land and living beside me.

       I feel all humans are brothers. This obsession with "our" people and "our" land and "our" borders is an outlook designed to make you complacent with the exploitation of both yourself and those in others countries. Gotta work hard and pay taxes to protect "our" border. Gotta keep you in fear of "those people" coming over and taking "our stuff".
      </p>
      <p>
       And that mentality makes perfect sense to you - if you lived in a shithole that keeps getting worse due to capitalistic demands, and you knew there was a nicer place elsewhere,
       <em>
        wouldn't you want that for yourself and your family?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       But as soon as they come knocking on our door and want the standards of life we enjoy, you would turn away your brother. Do you not think there's enough? Or do you think we would dilute ourselves, resulting in a lower standard of living for everyone? Doesn't that imply that you have ALWAYS had a higher standard of living than others, and your resentment towards them is really a thinly veiled fear that they will demand equality, and lower your position in doing so?

       My great grandparents were immigrants from Austria who went through the proper channels and applied for citizenship back in the 1920s. I feel like a lot of people have that same experience in their families.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowadays the system to apply to become a citizen is different, however people still apply the legal way. What most people have a problem with is border hoppers who take jobs and then send the money they receive back into their country of origin. I am not just talking about Mexico, think farther and wider. Illegal immigration is a business, and there are many ways to go about it, such as marriage scams. This is offensive to most people who have worked through the system because it lessens their struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Companies do not exploit third world countries just because of slave labor, but also for tax laws and trade deals. You pay taxes on any profit you make overseas, so most companies keep their money in tax havens, whether that be for legal or illegal reasons. Our trade deals state that countries importing goods into our country pay far, far less than it would be if we exported them. Again, corporations know this and abuse it.

       At this point, deportation wouldn't be so bad. Leave you with your service economy while you live out a shoebox paying for your beloved illegals' social security as they vote for corrupt bureaucrats for more free stuf until you're living in your perfect serfdom utopia and are no longer needed. Your free car, taxed by the mile (if you're even allowed to drive yourself anymore).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, if you're lucky, the government may even assign your kids to a good job. Or, wait, are you going to have any kids? I guess you probably shouldn't overpopulate so you can make room for the illegals reducing your standard of living and enriching your culture. I know you liberals despise children. They're gross and should be blended up.

       It's mostly that first thing that might actually make him a good candidate, he has the balls to say stuff and if he can do so while president might be a brilliant new move for the US. On the other hand he says a lot of stupid shit off camera that catches up to him, might show he's different than in his campaign. IMO still better than corrupt clinton

       This is really interesting because a lot of poets have posited life to be this way: "We all live in a house on fire, no fire department to call; no way out, just the upstairs window to look out of while the fire burns the house down with us trapped, locked in it. Tennessee Williams"

       The oligarchs want you to revolt, as violently as possible. While you're revolting other people are panic buying and the ads are running on the news.

       Orrr you do it through something less collective than a revolt. If you're whole argument is that revolt is the only way I invite you to start.

       Well, I just see a lot of people say things like "we need to revolt".  But how, practically, will that happen when nobody is saying "i am going to revolt".  Using the "we" just spreads the responsibility around, and nobody will actually do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong - I have no hope at all.  I think the best course of action is to hunker down and prepare for the worst.

       Americans are being fattened for the ideological slaughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Pentagon gets all it's hardware in place, it will simply unleash the slavering Media upon us, and a terrified, jangled, stressed out American populace - searching desperately for a way to lash out and unify - will be blasted night and day with the most vile propaganda the world has ever seen. All directed at vilifying Russia out of any proportion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when Obama dumped 'bin Laden' down the ocean, and people were literally rioting in the streets out of sheer elation? Multiply that by 10 this time. And it's Russia we're going to dump down the ocean.

       I would agree with you, however to me it seems that the more propagnda they throw at us the more people wake up, and the nastier, dirtier, and obvious it gets the more people will ignore those mouth pieces until they lose money and either change their tune or get replaced by a real news outlet.

       Total fucking bullshit backed by zero evidence. I’m going to say this once, just once, for all the stupid knuckledragging fucks in the world (
       <em>

       ): YOU CANNOT CONTROL AN ENTIRE COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE WITH TANKS, JETS, BATTLESHIPS OR ANY OF THAT.

       A fighter jet cannot stand on street corners and enforce no assembly edicts. A fighter jet cannot kick down your door at 3 AM to search your house for contraband material or antisocial propaganda. A fighter jet is useless for maintaining a police state. Police are needed to maintain a police state. And no matter how many police you have, they are always outnumbered by the people, which is why it’s important for your police to have automatic weapons and your people to have nothing but their limp dicks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when every random pedestrian might have a Glock jammed in his waistband, kicking down those doors becomes a lot fucking riskier, lest you catch a bullet on your way in.

       America has a small standing professional army. (I’m using the term “army” to refer to the entirety of the Department of Defense) of 1,456,862 personnel and 1,458,500 reserve. They are probably the best-funded, best-trained, and best-equipped fighting force in the world today and the best which has ever existed in raw technological killing power.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 311,591,917 people in the US, of which 73,270,043 are males age 18-49. There are also 90 guns every 100 persons in the US. Now, even assuming every one of those million and a half active members of the armed forces are trained infantry grunts (pro tip: they aren’t), how well do you think they will do against 73 FUCKING TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even assuming there would be no defection or desertion among the armed forces, they are still massively outnumbered and outgunned by an enemy they can’t tell apart from their supporters. We’re getting good at it, but not good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Al-Qaida and the Taliban ran us ragged for more than a decade with muskets used by illiterate goat herders and a few well-connected, college-educated fanatics in their leadership. Why? Because they hid among people we were told NOT to kill, and so were allowed to win. The only way to win against them is to slaughter them all, and while that should be done there, it couldn’t be done here in a civil war scenario. The US is a technologically advanced society completely saturated with the Internet and the advances of modern manufacturing. Nearly military grade weapons are the most common rifle here.

       I've been wondering when we would all get around to talking about actual revolution. Most Americans don't have much, if anything, left to lose. It's a dangerous game they're playing, because we can win. I'm not in the military and have never had occasion to ask myself, "would I be willing to die for the future of my country?"  I decided during this election that yes, I would. America's future is more important than mine. I would gladly stand in front of the tank.

       The OP is absolutely right. The day after election is going to be violent - I can feel it in my bones. 50% of the country is going to feel complete disenfranchised and angry and nothing is going to prevent that.

       This election represents a fork in the road and a change in direction for our country. I personally don't like the direction Hillary wants to take our country in.

       Perhaps. But would you rather be standing there watching your home burn down and see Hillary laughing maniacally with an empty gas can, Or Trump desperately trying to put it out with a garden hose knowing that while it may not be enough, if you love your home no matter how small the odds, that you should never give up?
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1988 Trump said that if things ever got so Bad that he would step up to bat. Things have never been worse and  28 years later here he is.

       We know exactly what Hillary is planning for our country as we have wiki-leaks and 20 years of failed policies. Trump MIGHT be racist, Might Be Sexist and Might be no different. However, no one can be certain of anything other than about What Hillary WILL do.
 Never before has someone such as Hillary been permitted to commit so many crimes against America and been permitted to be allowed to run for president. Only 2 Us presidents have ever been impeached, and one of them was her husband.

       I often wonder if we always fear that way when we see something new. All of this that you are seeing is because of the Internet. What do you think it was like before the Internet. welcome to the New Age organization. There is no centralization or decentralization everything everywhere. I don't have the words for what it is but things change no matter what we want when we solve a math problem. Traveling salesman problem so much more than optimization

       Yep, I would fully argue that the internet is why we are where we are in many facets of life.  I'm not at all against it, but I'd say for sure it's why there's so many upheavals going on in so much of our lives.  For instance, when I was just out of high school, the internet had really just started.  I used to get on a chatroom called "The Globe".  That was my first instance of talking to people of all religions.  My father is a Pentecostal Minister and it was so eye opening.  This example has been going on through the years, with religion,  social recognition,  etc. The ability to talk on a Planetary scale has changed us as a species

       Combine that with global warming, making less resources and combined with the ever increasing income inequality gap the majority of said resources will go to the top. Jobs will only get harder to provide as technology and efficiency increases. Labor can no longer adequately negotiate their wage and we are competing with third world countries.

       You are forgetting something that is key. Guns do not fire said "bullets" by themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. has a severe lack of true patriots who are willing to organize and put their lives on the line to defend and take back, your once great nation, from internal/domestic political criminals.

       I am. And so are my closest friends, and Oathkeepers, and pretty much all of the military. The problem most people have organizing is "who is the culprit?"  Thankfully Assange provided us nicely formatted excel spreadsheets in the leaks.  We're not afraid to fight or die, the republic will stand.

       Funny that Americans didn't feel this way during 9/11, through Anthrax, for 18 months of media blackout (Left and Right) about 9/11 mysteries, as the U.S. invaded an unrelated nation, and as the U.S. worked for years to destabilize the Middle East &amp; lay the groundwork for ISIS.

       The sad reality is that regardless of who wins, it doesnt matter, their corruption will continue and it really will all be meaningless because runaway climate change is already begun, both canidates are advocates for big oil and coal.

      <p>
       We cant afford another day of emissions and yet days pass, and if you look into Clintons history you can absolutely assure yourself there will be many many new oil and coal deals. We will see the crippling effects of climate change, look at Syria, we are already seeing it there. Just a matter of time.

       The climate change thing (formerly global warming, which they couldn't call it because it's been cooling.... ) is a scam. Just another way to suck more money out of you via carbon taxes, plus control the way you live.

       lol, the only way climate change is gonna affect the way I live is when it rips my fucking house down and society collapses from water shortage. The UN has already said we have at best until 2030 before we see it. I assure you climate change is mindshatteringly real. Look into methane clathrates, even if what I said wasnr true, they inevitebly will rise through the watercolumn and cause immediate devastating climate effect.

       The climate will always be changing, regardless of whether or not we live on this planet, that's why it's a scam. Paying a carbon tax isn't going to save the planet, but it sure may make things even harder for some families to keep a roof over their head and food on the table.

       There are others things you should be voting on too, not just President. Take a look at the ballot measures up in your state, the state congressional elections, House elections, etc. Those things can have a bigger effect on your day to day life than the President does, and your vote will matter more.

       Through out my life there are certain events that make me sit up and take notice.  Usually its life as usual, then I move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The events that caused me to get over zealous (world changing)  have been, a very first commerical with Dick Cavet on something called a personal computer (well educated husband said 'Who would want a personal computer.  What good are they?"), a brand new network that utilized every citys local channel and challenge the three major networks (Fox), 911, the first day of the Arab Spring in Egypt,  and the banks failing the morning it was first meantioned.   These events (for some reason) stand out lmmediantly to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have rarely paid any attention to elections and left it up to others to make those decisions.  But, immediately when the primarys began, I gravitated towards Trump as our best choice.  Trump would normally not have been my choice at all.  He is loud, pushy, at times even rude.  He has very little experience in politics and he wants to build a wall of separation.  All those things I hold against him but there is something that tells me he is running in this race for a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we are at a cross road that we are meant to make a decission.  Just like the events I meantioned earlier we are in a place that very large changes are coming and it will be a major decission for our country.  The choice we make will be a very strong deciding factor on how we are going to prepare ourselves for the least amount of damage (as damage, suffering etc is coming for this country and the world).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps policys are going to get us through the upcoming mess.  Although we can all pretty much say he's a jerk at times he is still an honest man.  What he wants to do with closing borders, building up our forces, and changing our economics etc will help us prepare for the upcoming event, an unstable United States.  Whether anyone likes it or not, we will all be hunkering down in a few short years.  We will need to be like England and vote in a Brixite (sp?).  Because our citizens come first.  Through Trumps inexperience we can gain ground on lessoning the momentum of distress.  We have to come home and strengthen out country from within.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary on the other hand has a lot of experience.  Whether she made bad choices or not doesn't matter and her history becomes mute at this point.  The giant wheel of politics has grown oversized and by politicans following the same path as they always have our country will not survive the great devide of this world.  Hillary will take each small event that leads into a greater event and apply what she's learned to do under degress.  These applications of applying the same old solutions will compound the problems.  She will not look very far into the big picture and will only try and repair problems as they come and be easily distracted.by additional issues she would believe are not important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believing it should be politics as usual by us is a big mistake for us to make.  England didn't like Winston Churchill much but he got the counrty through some very rough times.  Trump is like that to us.  Although Trump may not understand his part in much of this, his policys (although they may sound extream) places our country into the best position to weather the storm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can not tell which way this election is going.  With all these petty distractions and how close we keep paying attention it makes it almost impossible to determine.  But when we all scratch our heads and think this is a stupid, silly, no win election, we all must consider that therepair are reasons for everything.  Are we going to make the same mistake my husband made when he said "no one needs a personal computer' argument?  Its time to bring us home, repair our borders (temporary), and strengthen our economy.  I believe there are major changes coming and we may lose our  world position of center stage from our own internal unrest.

       Many posters here talk a big game like they're Che Guevara or some fucking revolutionaries but just sit on their ass, eat cheetos, and reddit all day. Gimme a break! How many people here are actually involved in any real protest, and real political activity or activism? And what ideas do you actually have (for the US as a country) other that fantasizing about fighting "the power" like you're Han Solo or something while you sit in your dark room jerking off.

       You do realize that the president doesn't have that much power right? The speaker is the real most powerful person in America.

       You are forgetting something that is key. Guns do not fire said "bullets" by themselves.

       The U.S. has a severe lack of true patriots who are willing to organize and put their lives on the line to defend and take back, your once great nation, from internal/domestic political criminals.

       I feel all humans are brothers. This obsession with "our" people and "our" land and "our" borders is an outlook designed to make you complacent with the exploitation of both yourself and those in others countries. Gotta work hard and pay taxes to protect "our" border. Gotta keep you in fear of "those people" coming over and taking "our stuff".
      </p>
      <p>
       And that mentality makes perfect sense to you - if you lived in a shithole that keeps getting worse due to capitalistic demands, and you knew there was a nicer place elsewhere,
       <em>
        wouldn't you want that for yourself and your family?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       But as soon as they come knocking on our door and want the standards of life we enjoy, you would turn away your brother. Do you not think there's enough? Or do you think we would dilute ourselves, resulting in a lower standard of living for everyone? Doesn't that imply that you have ALWAYS had a higher standard of living than others, and your resentment towards them is really a thinly veiled fear that they will demand equality, and lower your position in doing so?
