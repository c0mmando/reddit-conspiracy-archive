    <div class="md"><p>I know some people think he&#39;s a plant, but you&#39;ve supplied no more than I&#39;ve already heard, and it is all implications with no substance.</p>

<p>Insiders never get audited. They don&#39;t get accused of rape. That stuff is saved for the Cosby&#39;s and Assange&#39;s of the world.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s a plant, the powers that be are fucking morons. They could just have him be an idiot from here on out... but instead, he&#39;s pointing fingers and lending credibility to the idea that the whole system is rigged. He&#39;s pointing out corruption in specific details that a puppet like Obama wouldn&#39;t touch.</p>

<p>The OBVIOUS sellouts of the GOP are the ones that are the most against him. ANY of those candidates on the GOP stage would have been a better plant than Trump, which is why they were trying to throw it to anyone but Trump... time after time.</p>

<p>And just a note... I happen to like most of the Jews I meet. If Trump&#39;s children were marrying into the Rothschilds, Bush&#39;s or Clintons... that would be significant. </p>

<p>The idea that marrying a Jew makes you somehow suspect is thinly masked bigotry. I&#39;d like a source on Resorts International, please :)</p>

<p>The Clinton campaign actively encouraged the media to legitimize Trump. Leaked Podesta emails have admitted that Hillary&#39;s only chance of winning relied on Trump being her opponent. </p>

<p>Trump may not be intentionally trying to lose, but he only got to where he is because the Clinton machine planted him there with help from the media. Before Trump announced his candidacy, Bill Clinton even personally encouraged him to get more involved in politics. Because the Clintons and Trumps are old friends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they would willingly sink the TPP, as the most BASIC pillar of why this is absurd. The defeat of the TPP is as big a blow to globalism as anything I&#39;ve seen in the past 20 years, since the wall fell.</p>

<p>His brutal takedown of Nafta is also hugely destructive to the globalist cause.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got friends screaming &quot;corruption&quot; that I&#39;d NEVER have thought would wake up. Donald woke them up.</p>

<p>Then needed to hear it from a candidate... from someone important, who they feel has been inside the system enough to see it for what it is... FUCKED.</p>

<p>He&#39;s calling out voting machines.
He&#39;s pointing to wikileaks.
He just added term limits to his platform.
He&#39;s the only republican candidate to harp on the Soros angle.
He&#39;s pointing out the corruption in the Clinton Foundation.
He&#39;s pointing to the fuckery in Haiti.
He&#39;s offering detante to Russia.</p>

<p>He could skip all of this and just throw the election to Hillary by saying, &quot;I&#39;m just running for president because of the High Grade Pu**y I&#39;ll be able to nail in the Lincoln Bedroom&quot;.</p>

<p>Romney was a straw man, designed to throw the election... and that makes sense, because he didn&#39;t really attack Obama much at all, on anything of substance. He didn&#39;t spoil any trade deals, and he didn&#39;t ever call out &quot;International Finance&quot; like Trump recently did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been hearing &quot;Trump is a plant&quot; for SOOOO long... but there is nothing but insinuations. Not a single email from the DNC has alluded to this, and they have been caught on SO much stuff, this time around.</p>

<p>Early in the campaign, they were trying to promote the &quot;Dark Horse&quot; candidates, like Trump, because they didn&#39;t think he had a chance. Trump was meant to pull the frontrunners further to the right, to give Hillary a better chance in the primary against them.</p>

<p>In the beginning, the Media did cover Trump, and they weren&#39;t that mean to him (relatively)... and that changed when it started looking like Trump had an actual shot at the nomination.</p>

<p>No one thought Trump would seal the nomination 18 months ago... but the Media, the Mainstream Republicans and the Hillary Campaign turned on him WAAAAY before he had the nomination clinched.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m not sure, either... but it doesn&#39;t quite make sense that he&#39;s a plant. Bringing out all those Clinton Rape victims? Surely, a plant wouldn&#39;t have dug there.</p>

<p>The shit she did to Haiti? Surely, a plant wouldn&#39;t have given specifics like he did, and remember that he had that dude that was From Haiti expose that he was offered a bribe to play ball.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s shenanigans with the rape victims are surely what caused the latest accuser of bill to step forward.</p>

<p>I think the &quot;Trump is a plant&quot; narrative is crafted specifically for me... and people like me, who LOVE digging into the secret machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Write-ins are often just tossed in the trash, particularly if the person in question isn&#39;t registered officially as a write-in candidate in your state. If you want your discontent actually counted, you&#39;d do better to vote for a third party that&#39;s actually running for president. Even if you don&#39;t actually want them to be president, at least your voice against the two-party duopoly will actually be measured and heard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Trump is acting a part for the Clinton/deep-state machine has been blatantly obvious to me since the media started covering Trump for hours a day way before the primaries. They completely ignored him when he ran in 2000. It became more obvious when the biggest Bush lover on reddit, the guy who created <a href="/r/Conspiratard">/r/Conspiratard</a>, created the biggest Trump sub and made it filled with garbage memes and racism.</p>

<p>&quot;Reality Show&quot; actor, &quot;Beauty&quot; pageant mogul, &quot;Greed is Good&quot; motto. He&#39;s a heel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>VOTE! VOTE! VOTE!  Vote, Jill, Donald, or Gary....TPTB want us to not vote, because &quot;they&quot; know Hillary is the last person anyone in this sub would vote for.  I don&#39;t know the extent that voting matters, but it matters. Voting sure as hell does more than just sitting at home, bitching about the corrupt system and feeling smarter than the &quot;sheep&quot; because you chose to what?  Not even ATTEMPT to make your voice heard?  Ludicrous.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m at it, let&#39;s be pragmatic.  I hear the argument made that by not voting that somehow that means you aren&#39;t participating in the &quot;game?&quot;  Do you think the Clintons, Bush&#39;s and Soros&#39;s of the world go to night fretting about all those people that are sitting out?  They don&#39;t give a shit, it probably makes them happy tbh.  So go vote, if you don&#39;t like Trump, vote 3rd party, just do SOMETHING dammit!</p>

<p>He is 100% a plant. The Democrats got their media buddies to give him free advertising. He had more media coverage than any other candidate because the Clinton campaign made it happen. The entire Republican establishment was actively working against Trump, but he had too much free advertising from supposed &quot;liberal&quot; media outlets like CNN. </p>

<p>Technically Trump himself may not know he&#39;s a plant though. It&#39;s possible he&#39;s an idiot who is trying his hardest and just keeps fucking up because he&#39;s an idiot. Or he could be intentionally pulling his punches and trying to lose. It&#39;s hard to say for sure, but what is entirely sure is that the Clinton campaign chose Trump as the opponent they wanted to face and the media made it happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it was hard to believe the Republicans were serious when they ran McCain/Palin against Obama, and the DNC filed a response when sued by Bernie&#39;s supporters saying that Bernie&#39;s people knew all along that Hillary was going to be the candidate. It&#39;s pretty clear what&#39;s going on here... They wanted to give us a choice between Bush III and Clinton II, but couldn&#39;t get away with it. They gave us a choice of Hillary instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I actually liked Trump, went to his rally in March and own a MAGA hat. I&#39;ve been for him since fall of last year and memed on The_Donald with various accounts (including this one) the whole way. Once these presidential debates started though it seems as if he took a turn. He doesn&#39;t bring up obvious points or topics that would hurt Hillary when the opportunity arises and seems to spend way too much time and energy talking about irrelevant shit that doesn&#39;t matter and only serves as fodder for his detractors. Makes no sense. After the first debate I mentioned something to this effect on The_Donald but my post was deleted for being a form of &#39;concern trolling&#39;. For a while I&#39;ve felt The_Donald has been compromised too though (ever since the mod overhaul) and rarely does genuine debate or discussion ever happen there anymore</p>
