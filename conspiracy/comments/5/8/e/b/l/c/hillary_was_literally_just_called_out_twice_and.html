    <div class="md"><p>The fact that she put a wedge in the wiki leaks talk by being the first one to bring it up, and then spinning it into Russia, was a planned diversion. </p>

<p>Trump should of been on the offensive out of the gate, but the mod soft-balled the beginning and Clinton jumped topic to segue right to wikileaks/Russia. </p>

<p>Imo this was moderated for the usual trove of key issues, and somehow campaign fraud and corruption are not Key issues. Whether a person should be aborted or not, and will you transition smoothly, Mr trump? Those were key issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me preface this by apologizing, I&#39;m horrible with names and I don&#39;t give enough attention to those involved that I am about to mention. Help me out and I&#39;ll put their names in my comment.  </p>

<p>I saw Fox News interview Donna Brazile regarding the debate and how Hilary dodged the accusations about her campaigning. Megan Kelly was specifically focusing on the whole &quot;DNC paid actors to get physical at Trump rallies and start fights&quot; info that was released just today I believe.  </p>

<p>This host was very precise with her facts, pointing out that the recently-fired employee who was caught hiring the actors was a person who had been to the White House 242 times and met Obama numerous times. And this black lady has been caught paying the guy to do this!  </p>

<p>Well she deflected the hell outta those accusations. She was asked well thought out, thoroughly researched and presented questions, and she simply would not answer. She talked about being persecuted, talked about being attacked, talked about everything over than the questions asked of her. </p>

<p>Next Ms. Kelly tried asking about why Brazile sent the debate question to Hilary. She perfectly described the leaked emails on the subject, and pointed out the question was emailed exactly word for word one day before the debate to Hilary. And that the accused individual was fired from CNN!  </p>

<p>Guess what she did? Yup, deflected! Would not answer the question. Kept repeating &quot;we never got info from CNN&quot; but when asked for clarification wouldn&#39;t say anything further. She refused to acknowledge the emails because she claimed they were fabricated, and why address something that was clearly faked?  </p>

<p>Anyway, what I think I am trying to say is that I thought Hilary dodging her accusations was pretty bad. Then I saw this black lady, and she was ten times more cringeworthy...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did have a problem with him, just not publicly. During the RNC representatives had to show their voters that they are united and support the nominee. This story allows the GOP to dislike this independent in a coordinated effort. There is a reason some GOP loyalist and donors are supporting Hillary now. Hillary&#39;s policies are more aligned with some GOP Republicans policies like supporting large corporations and continuing the war machine in the Middle East. </p>

<p>If the GOP supported Trump they would simply have to point to Bill Clintons past. They&#39;re finding ways to dislike Trump without bluntly saying so. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get why he didn&#39;t have a response about multinational media corporations or international donations.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, this is a seriously skewed view of what was discovered. Early in the year two Democratic connected groups decided that the GOP primaries were attracting people with short fuses, thugs. They trained some people to protest at their events who would be provocative, sometimes being provocative just by wearing a Planned Parenthood t-shirt, sometimes by verbal agression, near reporters and with other trained protesters with cell phone cameras ready. Trump supporters especially frequently took the bait and videos were splashed all over media of Trump supporters beating up on people they disagreed with. The trained protesters were trained specifically not to attack but to be victims which is lost in much of the Breitbart analysis.</p>

People I formerly though of as smart just parroting MSM propaganda and acting like they&#39;re a genius and getting 20 upvotes... it really is frustrating to see so many people get tricked in to supporting a warmongering obviously-corrupt criminal, and then to see the same thing on the Trump side of things too, people supporting this blowhard sellout like he&#39;s going to do anything for them. The whole thing is a fucking joke and I&#39;m so tired of it. People really are sheep. They&#39;ve had chances to speak out against this, but instead they&#39;re just quiet and afraid, or just outright go along with whatever their flavor of MSM tells them to parrot. Ugh.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant. I just have got to vent these feelings. I feel like I&#39;m living in a dystopian novel.

There are a lot of British people that don&#39;t trust a damn thing that come out of the media&#39;s mouth, shown by the fact that lots are switching to alt. media such as RT, Al Jazeera and on the Internet. Hell, r/ukpolitics and r/unitedkingdom are almost as much of a cesspool as r/[deleted]. I&#39;ve been following the election, digging into everything and as such have been supporting Trump for a while, but it still amazes me that I have to explain everything to work colleagues about veritas, wikileaks, etc. because <em>&quot;Trump said pussy and he&#39;s a racist&quot;</em>
Fuck, I&#39;ve been lurking here for years, but had to cancel my old account for fears of retaliation by the regressive left, sad times.</p>

<p>Much of Clinton&#39;s campaign strategy seems to be to convince Sanders supporters that Trump is too dangerous to vote for.  A simple fact sheet that reveals just how many Trump quotes are out of context would allow people to see what&#39;s really going on here.</p>

<p>E.g., &quot;Trump says we should attack first,&quot; with a short paragraph to put that into context, and then a link to the video so that people can see for themselves that what he was actually saying in that speech makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think his lack of preparation for the debates and thin skin make him grossly unqualified to be president. Even if clinton were guilty of everything she has ever been accused of. I&#39;d rather have a cunning, murderous president than a bumbling, shoot-from-the-hip, thin skinned, maybe billionaire, who forgot to do his homework. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s as thin skinned as you suggest.</p>

<p>I really think he&#39;s just a part of the plan by the Clintons and their paymasters.</p>

<p>Lets go back to the primaries for a moment. Trump was lambasted for over a week about his decision to let a conservative think tank come up with names for potential Supreme Court justices. Now with the Podesta emails, we can plainly see, that happens all the time behind closed doors.</p>

<p>After having a supposed fallout in 2011 and in early 2015, Trump takes a call from former president Bill Clinton and all of a sudden he has announced his candidacy to run for president. If I recall correctly, it was even mentioned that Clinton actually <em>urged</em> Trump to run.</p>

<p>Back in 2008 and thereabouts, Trump is on the record numerous times praising Hillary Clinton for various things, even suggesting she would make a great president.</p>

<p>Now in the present, we have a very powerful business man that seems to have trouble attacking his former friend, someone he has monetarily supported by donating numerous times to her slush fund. Isn&#39;t that strange?</p>

<p>It also appears he was just handed his VP choice. And he apparently doesn&#39;t necessarily talk to him much. Doesn&#39;t that seem strange?</p>

<p>To me it seems like Trump is clearly a wolf in sheeps clothing here. He lets other conservatives perform his duties to select his aides and other officials because they would know who best suits their goals since his true goals are different - and it doesn&#39;t matter since he isn&#39;t trying to get elected. He&#39;ll attack his political opponent and former friend but in a way that nearly always ensures he looks incompetent. He has done little to actually legitimize his standing in this election cycle. I mean for fucks sake, he&#39;s running for president and has made it all the way to November election as the Republican nominee and yet he looks utterly incompetent? How the fuck does that happen? There&#39;s even a Brent Budowsky email mentioning how dangerous it would be for Hillary&#39;s campaign to proceed with a strategy to push for an easy to defeat Republican opponent. I mean, what the hell is that all about?</p>

<p>The right have been playing to the worst, most ignorant part of the rebublican party, so they get an awful, ignorant, unintelligent candidate. Makes perfect sense to me.</p>

<p>Whats interesting about this bit is that it started during the 2008 primaries from people in Clintons camp, most likely Blumenthal. So of course you would have Trump, another Clinton associate at the time, whistling it loudly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had hundreds of arguments with shills over at /r/P and unless you&#39;re some new model, you don&#39;t make your arguments in the same manner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No they don&#39;t but you actually answered this yourself above. Just like you observed yourself when the likes of the Teapartiers and the similar groups rose to power, a large swath of voting people could be swayed by a select number of issues. Ring the bell, get a prize. If we can hypothesize that Trump is indeed a plant, he was the one ringing the most bells and ringing them the loudest.</p>

<p>There is also a secondary part to this that Clinton and her associates apparently are in control of however - a large chunk of the widely consumed media. How often do you see any mention that Trump and Clinton used to be former friends anymore? It was a small topic during the primaries but then it disappeared. Remember when Trump proudly proclaimed that in the past he had &#39;lobbied&#39; a good portion of he Republican candidates during the primaries? And how he claimed to have tons of insider knowledge? Where has that all gone? No one in the media is asking anything about that. Why? Control the flow of ideas and control the easily swayed people.</p>

<p>This is really an idea I can&#39;t get away from. Too many things point in that direction. So far my instincts have been pretty spot on this entire cycle too after having tons of concerns I had confirmed through these emails.</p>

<p>There are plenty of delusional people just like you that fully support her by ignoring all the bad and only focusing on perceived good. </p>

<p>I have a co-worker who can speak multiple languages and has a Master&#39;s degree and she fixates on all the &quot;women and families Hilary has helped.&quot;</p>

<p>What about all the women and families she has helped destroy through warmongering? Maybe I&#39;ll ask her one day but I wager it will earn me a permanent enemy. </p>

<p>Think about that for a minute. Russia has put nuclear capable missiles along the NATO border and deployed their god damn aircraft carrier (which they never do because it&#39;s so expensive). We haven&#39;t seen them do this since what...1982?</p>

<p>Putin issued a warning this year about the dangers of MAD going off the table. They know there&#39;s a limited window of time and we, in our current policy and efforts, are escalating the shit out of things. You realize what that means, right? They cannot back down while MAD is still on the table, not an inch.</p>

<p>If Trump were calling for nuclear war with Russia and Hillary wasn&#39;t, I&#39;d vote Hillary instead just because the RISK OF NUCLEAR WAR &gt; OTHER PROBLEMS. However, as luck would have it, Trump (who I revile less than Hillary at the moment) is the one calling for treating Russia like its full of human beings.</p>

<p>I cannot even grasp how anyone can even remotely consider a presidency which may jeopardize the fucking human race for its own personal gains. It&#39;s absolute madness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with you.</p>

<p>Russia <em>will not</em> allow Syria to be bombed by the USA. They have the best AAA in the entire world. We&#39;d have to get into a <em>very</em> messy war to win, assuming we get lucky and no nukes are used.</p>

<p>Even if we win in Syria we still lose. We get more terror and thus perpetuating an endless war in the ME.</p>

<p>If everything about Trump is true, I&#39;d still prefer him to Clinton. It&#39;s like Nicholson&#39;s Joker running against Hannibal fucking Lecter. Trump is an incompetent - but Hillary will destroy everything you love from the inside and make almost everybody smile until its too late.</p>

<p>This is a vote on allowing the country to be run by an oligarchical political criminal or a man with a ridiculous haircut and loud mouth. I can&#39;t believe people are more offended by racism that actual institutional corruption on a n unprecedented scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have a huge influx of Trump supporters in this sub because he actually speaks some truth, which leads inquisitive minds to seek more truths. You need to go back before all these election shenanigans and take a good hard look at Donald Trump. It seems to me that he is up on that stage for only one reason. He makes Hillary look 51% electable. It&#39;s all political theater.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no evidence of Russian involvement in the e-mail leaks. They will manufacture evidence if they have to.

<p>This is the thing. There very well might be evidence that Russia hacked some or all of the emails, and they may even of done it, but so far, and I&#39;ve looked, I&#39;ve seen no one release tangible evidence. It&#39;s all &quot;general agreement in the cybersecurity community&quot; or &quot;US intelligence agencies say.&quot; That&#39;s really not good enough. </p>

<p>And even if they did provide evidence, it would likely not be conclusive. Usually with hacks of a certain sophistication, you can&#39;t track them back directly to a source. You look at things like areas where the servers involved are, and patterns within the malicious code itself, and compare it to known hacks in the past. The problem with this is that if people know where a certain group hacks through and their coding style, as is clear if you have something to compare it to, then both can be mimicked. </p>

<p>The whole election&#39;s bullshit anyway, and Trump is likely controlled op in one form or another, but this Russia business is the first time it&#39;s really looking like a Clinton presidency could be significantly worse than just your typical TPTSB pick of the litter.

<p>Yes, the way he allowed her to interrupt, control the dialogue and dominate the conversation was most &quot;gentlemanly&quot;... and I suppose that would have been appropriate had his opponent been a &quot;lady&quot;, rather than a serpent.</p>

<p>The threat of serious conflict with Russia is real - we know this because the Russians are taking it VERY seriously - making preparations.</p>

<p>But the motives for our aggression against Russia go beyond DNC political scapegoating: The core of the friction is in Syria - where we are SUPPOSED to be stomping out Assad for the benefit of the Zionist Regime. </p>

<p>Russia is messing with that game, and the AIPAC overlords are demanding that the US take action, and US politicians and the media are toeing the line, ramping up the propaganda and beating the war-drums.</p>

<p>Regardless of who &quot;wins&quot;, shit will likely hit the fan, and it will not end well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true, the Russia conflict is much bigger than just the DNC. A well-orchestrated, or even poorly-, false flag or similar event in the next year or two and even Trump would be dragged into a more involved Syria conflict. Syria is more more important geopolitically to Russia than to the US, so I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll back off easily (assuming Russia&#39;s not just part of eastern wing of the same PTSB, of which I&#39;m not convinced). </p>

<p>I think a critical event to consider was Obama&#39;s &quot;red line&quot; on chemical weapons, and what ended up stopping the US from going in with force at that point. As I see it, the possibilities are a) public opposition from the US, b) Kerry making an offhand offer that Russia was able to jump on, c) it was actually part of the plan to drag out the conflict, further destroying Syrian infrastructure, and paving the way for ISIS and the various benefits that gets the US. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s b) or c), I don&#39;t think it matters too much who wins the presidency. But if it was a), I think there&#39;s a strong case to be made that there would be much greater opposition to military intervention in a Trump presidency than a Clinton presidency. The anti-war Left all but disappeared in &#39;08, and it&#39;s more or less non-existent on the Republican Right. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The reason that the &quot;red line&quot; fell to pieces is far more sinister: </p>

<p>The Sarin gas attack of 8/21/2013 was a FALSE FLAG operation launched by Syrian &quot;rebel&quot; commandos equipped and trained by the CIA and the Mossad.</p>

<p>There is very strong supporting evidence: </p>

<p>First, recall the circumstances: Assad had been accused of using CW&#39;s on multiple occasions - charges that he vehemently denied - and for which substantive evidence was non-existent.</p>

<p>In the hopes of vindicating himself of the charges, Assad INVITED United Nations inspectors into Syria - as guests of the State - to investigate prior allegations. </p>

<p>The inspectors <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-23747375">arrived on August 18, 2013</a> and were staying in a hotel in Damascus.</p>

<p>On August 21, three days later, <strong>while the inspectors were in Damascus</strong>, SOMEONE launched a Sarin Gas attack in the city of <strong><a href="http://orientalreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/al-ghouta.jpg">Ghouta - some 20 miles from where the UN inspectors were staying.</a></strong> </p>

<p>Hundreds of people were killed.</p>

<p>The idea that Assad&#39;s forces would be SO BRAZEN and foolish to launch such an attack <strong><em>while UN inspectors were a mere 20 miles away</em></strong> - and knowing FULL WELL that Obama&#39;s RED LINE threat was hanging over his head is utterly ludicrous.</p>

<p>There is no question that the attack occurred - the question is, WHO LAUNCHED THE ATTACK?</p>

<p>The most likely answer is that it was a group of &quot;rebels&quot; that had been specifically equipped and trained for the mission <strong>by the CIA and the Mossad</strong>. What evidence do we have to support this scenario? </p>

<p><strong>Jerusalem Post - August 23 - two days after the Ghouta Attack</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Report-Syrian-rebel-forces-trained-by-West-are-moving-towards-Damascus-324033">Report: Syrian rebel forces trained by West are moving towards Damascus</a> </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Guerrilla fighters trained by the West</strong> began moving towards Damascus in mid-August, French newspaper Le Figaro reported on Thursday.</p>

<p>Le Figaro reported that this is the reason behind the Assad regime&#39;s alleged chemical weapons attack in Damascus on Wednesday morning, as UN inspectors were allowed into the country to investigate allegations of WMD use.</p>

<h1>The rebels were trained for several months in a training camp on the Jordanian-Syrian border by CIA operatives, as well as Jordanian and Israeli commandos, the paper said.</h1>

<p><strong>The first group of 300 handpicked Free Syrian Army soldiers crossed the border on August 17 into the Deraa region, and a second group was deployed on August 19, the paper reported.</strong></p>

<p>The paper quoted a researcher at the French Institute for Strategic Analysis as saying <strong>the trained rebels group was passing through Ghouta, on their way to Damascus.</strong></p>

<p>In June, the Los Angeles Times reported that CIA operatives and American special operations units have been training Free Syrian Army soldiers with anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons since late 2012.</p>

<p>The newspaper reported that the training took place at covert bases in Jordan and Turkey.</p>

<hr/>

<p>More at the link.</p>

<p>The reason that Obama could NOT fulfill his &quot;RED LINE&quot; threat is that it was a fucking FALSE FLAG attack pulled off by &quot;Rebels&quot; trained by the fucking CIA and the Mossad - and THEY FUCKED IT UP so badly that the fact that it WAS a false flag could NOT be concealed - and they knew it.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-23892783">British Parliament was the first to smell a rat</a> - and they flatly rejected a proposal for British intervention - a move that humiliated PM David Cameron. US Senators and Congress quickly followed suit, distancing themselves from backing Obama in his &quot;RED LINE&quot; threat. </p>

<h1>They had no choice</h1>

<p>If they were stupid enough to try to push the issue, there is NO DOUBT that the False Flag would have been exposed - and that the US and Israel would have been exposed as the culprits.</p>

<p>Obama was FUCKED. He had made a promise, and now he looked like a FOOL. The fact that Putin jumped on Kerry&#39;s (convenient) suggestion that Assad be allowed to DISARM was a godsend for Obama - as it allowed him to save face.</p>

<p>At this point Putin was both Satan and Savior - but one thing was certain: The US and their Zionist Overlords wanted Putin OUT OF THE PICTURE in Syria.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, shit hit the fan in Ukraine a few months later, and that kept Putin busy for quite some time.</p>

<p>Also coincidentally, it was ONLY after the botched False Flag attack that we startd to hear of this mysterious (and strangely scary and powerful) group called &quot;ISIS&quot;.</p>

<p>/Long rant... Hope you found it worth reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In politics, as in any form of competition, there is such a thing as &quot;peaking too soon&quot; and running out of gas before the final hurdle and it&#39;s Trump, not Hillary, that is riding an unpredictable wave of public sentiment that&#39;s steadily followed a pattern of two steps forward and one back almost at regular intervals throughout this entire contest. </p>

<p>As outrageous as he may have seemed from the outset we&#39;ve begun to see and understand that it&#39;s Hillary and all the greedy, vain, and perfectly villainous forces she actually represents that are beyond what even that word &quot;outrageous&quot; can begin to accurately describe. </p>

<p>Each time Trump has fallen back he&#39;s followed it up with an attention grabbing come-back attack out among the voters that&#39;s hit Hillary and all the rotten and corrupt machinery behind her harder, more directly, and right on the money in more ways than one and drawn even more support for himself than he had prior to having either eased off or seemingly suffered any so-called set-backs. </p>

<p>He and we can forget the MSM, there&#39;s no point in him trying to look good there or reach any of the people who rely on it and are watching it to presumably get informed in any way. It&#39;s all enemy territory and pure unadulterated propaganda where any show of strength by Trump will either be ignored or else turned inside-out and upside-down and used against him in any and every way it can possibly be twisted to do it.</p>

<p>Trump actually needs to keep all those spin doctors off-balance and busy in order to make them show their hand and so far he has. </p>

<p>All they can do is heap on even more spin-doctoring, ridicule, and disingenuous efforts to try and hide a reality that is stubbornly refusing to stay hidden and flaring up as just as fast and all over the internet and across social media and sites like this where any attempts to try and suppress it are conspicuously and obviously seen and known for what they are... namely the handiwork of paid and organised trolls in Clinton&#39;s or any of her numerous backers&#39; employ. </p>

<p>There&#39;s three weeks to go and a mountain of dirt on Hillary and Bill Clinton and their money laundering foundation and outright criminality that just keeps getting bigger and bigger like a large festering boil on America&#39;s backside as those days go by thanks to Assange, WikiLeaks and countless other honest, decent, and rightfully concerned people. </p>

<p>Like him or not, Trump is the only person who can lance that pus-filled boil. Hopefully enough people will realize that before it&#39;s too late and vote for him even if they have to hold their noses while they do it. As much as I hate to admit it I believe Trump&#39;s perfectly right about this election being the last and only chance to do it or else live with even more and worse from here on if Hillary ever manages to get elected.</p>

<p>he doesn&#39;t need to convince his supporters to vote for him. we&#39;re already firmly behind him. he needs to convince the people who are in the undecided grey area which is exactly what he did this debate. the biggest issue for trump is that people can&#39;t imagine him as president. he acted very professional last night and succeeded in convincing america he can do the job</p>

<p>I have to say, I was seriously impressed with his speech on the ME. Most of the foreign policy I read agrees with him - the past eight years have been an utter disaster in the ME for the US.</p>

<p>Most people are idiots. I&#39;m not sure that the Wikileaks thing is having an effect outside of internet users (young people).</p>

<p>Speaking of younger people, Reddit has signed its own death certificate with this election. Most users hate the &#39;leadership&#39; and where the platform is headed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s really bothering me is how people are trying to create this narrative of &quot;CAN YOU BELIEVE TRUMP SAID HE MIGHT QUESTION THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION?!?&quot; I mean, I&#39;m not even a Trump supporter, but what if the elections one day ARE rigged? As technology gets more sophisticated it really won&#39;t be out of the question for it to be possible. Having a tradition in place where you have to blindly accept the results of an election or else you get labeled some closeted authoritarian dictator seems sort of insane. In fact it absolutely incentivizes someone to rig the elections because the American people will condemn your opponent if he or she questions you about it. In effect, it&#39;s a tradition that actually encourages the same poisoning of the democratic process that creates dictatorships in the first place. </p>

The moderator was a hell of a lot more fair to Trump and, I dare to go out on this limb by saying this, was even a bit aggressive toward Hillary.  I LOVED IT!  But I digress.  </p>

<p>If she DID have answers prepared then any so-called &quot;notes&quot; or scribblings she may have been putting down would have been to mark out replies she won&#39;t need and/or circling others or earmarking the ones to use so she can read them off as she replies.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, I did find it incredibly curious that she did continuously glance down at what she had written in front of her.  For as long as she talked versus the sheer amount of times she glanced down I can&#39;t say that, shy of her having the shorthand skills of a court reporter, she couldn&#39;t have written out THAT much to have been reading as much as she appeared to be looking at and/or reading.</p>

<p>I cannot stand her, her beliefs, her past and present with all of its corruption, that she is bought and paid for by all of the people she accepts <del>bribes</del> &quot;donations&quot; to her money laundering Clinton Foundation, the fact that she&#39;s committed what some see as treason and got away without any kind of punishment...it sickens me that almost half of the people of the US want that woman as their leader.  </p>

<p>It makes me think Trump is a party to her cheating because otherwise he&#39;d call it out. He mentioned it after the first debate, so why is he not allowed a teleprompter. He&#39;s staring straight at the camera and doesn&#39;t look down all the time like Hail Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would rather have literally anyone else other than Hill-dog.  Do some research on what she&#39;s been up to for the past 15 years.  Then imagine what it will be like when she sits in the oval office, even scarier, has the power to put her finger on the button.  People don&#39;t seem to realize the evidence that has been compiled about what she has been involved in.  How many people need to disappear or die from mysterious circumstances before the vast majority thinks &quot;ok this might be a bad idea...&quot;.  I am afraid for what her presidency would mean for all of us, our families, our friends, our loved ones.  It will probably turn into the wild fucking west here, make sure you capitalize on that second amendment while we still have it lol.</p>

Can you not see the never ending cycle? </p>

<p>Her role in selling massive amount of weapons that fuel more war and taking kickbacks through her foundation is just god damn wrong. And yet she is considered to be the champion of gun regulation, oh what hypocrisy. When we sell weapons in our country we need regulation but when we sell to other countries we dont need regulation. Im no trump fan and his foundation is shit too, but damn fuckin tired of seeing HC supporters make excuse and justification for every wrong decision she has made. </p>

<p>Because Russia has a history of cybercrime, they&#39;ve been standing up to US influence more and more since the 90s, and they have all the motivation in the world to not have Clinton as president. It isn&#39;t even necessarily the case that Wikileaks is doing something wrong, I&#39;m sure there were plenty of middlemen who could&#39;ve easily stuck their fingers in the pickle jar.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not so much blindly trusting the establishment, more that I&#39;m equally distrustful of the anti-establishment. It&#39;s not like either candidate has a problem lying with a smile on their face.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no evidence of Russian involvement in the e-mail leaks. They will manufacture evidence if they have to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the thing. There very well might be evidence that Russia hacked some or all of the emails, and they may even of done it, but so far, and I&#39;ve looked, I&#39;ve seen no one release tangible evidence. It&#39;s all &quot;general agreement in the cybersecurity community&quot; or &quot;US intelligence agencies say.&quot; That&#39;s really not good enough. </p>

<p>And even if they did provide evidence, it would likely not be conclusive. Usually with hacks of a certain sophistication, you can&#39;t track them back directly to a source. You look at things like areas where the servers involved are, and patterns within the malicious code itself, and compare it to known hacks in the past. The problem with this is that if people know where a certain group hacks through and their coding style, as is clear if you have something to compare it to, then both can be mimicked. </p>
