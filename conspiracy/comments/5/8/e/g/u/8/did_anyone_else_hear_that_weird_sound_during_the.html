       Yes, someone was whispering japanese code words to her. No. It clearly sounds like dozen, and she immediately resumes her train of thought and says DOZENS.

       I dunno man, I've listened a few times now, and it still sounds like a rapidly stated "dozen" that sounds like "dussn." Even slowed down it doesn't sound like what you're stating it does.

       Yeah I've listened to it a few times as well, including slowed down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some audio clips that clearly lay out what was said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clip 1: "do sai" normal speed, maximized volume:

       Clip 2: "do sai" half speed, maximized volume:

      <p>
       Sounds like a SAY or SAI at the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever whispered that might have been saying "dozens" with a poor accent. I'm not ruling that out.

       Yeah, she's scripted. She has people off-camera in a distant control center feeding her lines and zingers.

       Cheating: What the Clinton cartel does best.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was an exchange in the debate where she calls Trump a puppet and he responds, "No, YOU'RE the puppet". Trump is vindicated. She really is a puppet--reading other people's words because she can't go toe-to-toe with an opponent herself, without a team of cheaters helping to scam her over the finish-line. Truly disgraceful.

       it's not cheating if it's allowed by the CPD, and the CPD is run by the two parties.  The only people it cheats are the americans who are led to believe these arent scripted and managed candidates.

       The mic she is using is wired, so interference isn't going to happen-- or if it is, it'll be noise, not human speech.

       In the wikileaks emails, Hillary's "Debate Prep Book" is right in there as an attachment. Reading it, the canned answers are so familiar --- we've heard them enough times. She memorizes canned answers that are "flexible" and that can sometimes be applied to numerous questions.

       The Clinton staff has spent countless hours constructing "one size fits all" answers on various topics. It's CYA - Cover Your Ass. Heaven forbid that a real truthful answer would ever get out. Trump doesn't do this which is why he paints himself into a corner sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prime example of canned responses - If you have some time, go back and look at some of the Republican Debates. Look for Rubio and his infamous "Dabiq" references. It got to the point where it was being telegraphed by him while he was revving up for it. He used the Dabiq references many times on the stump too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funniest thing ever was when I felt him revving up for Dabiq, and Chris Christie knocked him off his game. It was the debate with the great Rubio unspooling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did he use the Dabiq refs so often? It played well with the sheeple --- sounded exotic --- sounded like he actually knew about some foreign place. Rubio has also employed a speechwriter for just about all of his Senate years. That's why he also sounds so polished. Paying someone for words will help make that happen.

       Probably because people are used to politicians being heavily scripted. Everyone knows their speeches are written up before hand. That said if it were possible to show the candidate literally being told what to say then it would look bad. Probably not going to be able to get hard enough proof though.

       Every nominee except Donald Trump has prepared in the same way in all of modern history. Is Hillary not as off the cuff charming as Obama, GWB or Bill? No doubt. Don't be swayed by stupid stuff and fall for trump. He's a conman. Don't be conned.

       She is no better.  She is the queen of corruption and chock full of political power to back that.  I have lived in third world countries, it is all down hill when the population begins to accept corruption as inevitable.

       I don't know about this. I have two working theories based upon just this clip, both stupid and humorous more than informative:
      </p>
      <p>
       Either A Trump is a cyborg and that's the sound of his eyelid servos freezing.
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       B Clinton farts.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: It's just a latency issue between the voice and the lip smack. The audio is about 35-45 ms ahead of the video, and it can be heard as ahead when she starts the word "dozens" as well. My interpretation is she breathes the word "pff-fuck" because she dropped the ball on something she should know.

       so are all of us here in the "Orlando Shooting was a false flag" boat?  I only ask because I didn't follow orlando that closely but an alleged San Bernardino survivor was making comments in the news about it.  And the San Bernardino "exercise" was a shit show of false flag if anything.

       the planned parenthood guy got really little news.  But a muslim dude equals middle east, equals ISIS, equals Terrorist.  So i was figuring just the good ole terrorist fear mongering.  But theories seemed everywhere hence my confusion.

       This is an interesting one. When it happened it had all the signs of a false flag and was the hot topic and pushed the fear mongering agenda. I don't personally believe a lot of these mass shootings are as they seem because they seem too convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's really weird to me is the Father of the man who did the Orlando shootings was at the DNC convention. That just seemed suspicious.

       with the ISIS fear mongering, elites want to get us afraid but in order to support more war over in the mid east. A lot of folks think to themselves "ok muslims are terrorists so let's cut off all muslim immigration. Let them cause trouble in their own countries" Well the elites don't want to cut off immigration cuz it's great for lowering wages and making us fight amongst ourselves. So our liberal politicians, will always support immigration but not end the wars which angers their supporters, and our conservative politicians will always keep the wars going but not end immigration which angers their supporters. Vicious circle when we should really all team up, sweep away the rich, and start making common sense policies.

       And I didn't even realize Soros had bought stakes in Haliburton a while back.  That's just as big of a red flag as any.  Two opposing political sides, just trading their fear-mongering resources.  If Cheney makes an appearance in the news I instantly suspect he's just attempting to validate a false flag.

        Here's more

       where he suggests that this guy is an actor that's been in several movies, when he doesn't even look like the same guy, never mind the idiocy of assuming someone might do this with actors that have been in several movies, as if that would remain secret for very long.

      <p>
       FFS, this is retarded as hell.  The only way there's a false flag operation here is if the "crisis actors" theory is a false flag operation intended to instantly shut down any credibility for the idea that the shootings were a false flag operation.

       If the news reports on a mass shooting in Breaking News style, ESPECIALLY before any significant death toll or casualty count is discovered, then it's absolutely a false flag. They wouldn't interrupt their normal coverage for a shooting they didn't know about ahead of time if they weren't certain anyone even died.

       It actually fits a lot of what we'd expect for an early prototype android. Weird, inhuman and uncanny valley facial expressions, a constant entourage to keep it standing straight up, a remote connection feeding human input for the times it goes off the AI rails, constant robotic spasms, no real soul or appearance of empathy, metal parts falling off, batteries running dry leaving it to fall over at less than opportune times, no morals, can't think on its feet.

       Because he knows he's grasping at straws. Doing CTRs job for them when you post unverified, whacko claims like this. Discredits the sub and frankly wastes everyone's time. Especially when there is a dearth of material out there that would land her in prison that is worth talking about.

       Why are you trying to steer away from this so strongly? Putting a little too much effort into it. Makes me think there is something here to investigate.

       It's just so blatantly ridiculous, that I was wondering aloud if there was actually an ulterior motive to this post. I doubt it, but as I said, that seems much more likely than what the OP was insinuating.

       Yeah, when unsubstantiated, ridiculous claims like this are taken seriously, it really does make you wonder if there are ulterior motives. This sub is (was) dedicated to providing solid evidence and support for theories. Now, if you don't follow this sub's bizarre pro-Trump narrative you are automatically a shill. Cannot wait for the election to be over and have all these butt-hurt Trumpians return to what ever sub they crawled out from so intelligent discussion can resume.

       I just watched an interesting video on Huma. It relates to what trump was saying about Saudia Arabia donating a chunk of change to the Clinton Foundation. The music and tone is total fear porn but the connections are interesting and am surprised I have never heard about this Huma Abedin until now.

       It could be Hillary blowing into the mic or someone else with a mic (or near the camera)  making a sound.  If this was "dozens" whispered through an earpiece,  I question if the microphone would even pick that up...

       It was just a weird exhale or exasperated sigh. I can't believe people are upvoting this like it's important. This is a total distraction from any real issues, like Clinton fucking dragging us in to a potential nuclear conflict with Russia because of her bull-headedness in Syria. Why aren't people talking about THAT?
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, let's talk about her having a mic or something, which we all know she probably has anyway. What does it matter. Focus on what matters.

       People are talking about those things. The fact that her debate might be scripted or that she is not well enough to even go through a debate says a lot about if she is "fit to be president".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one discussion of many. Start a new post about how we're going to war with Russia if she gets in power because of her imposed "No Fly Zone" and the fact that she dodged the question about "if a Russian plane flys through, will she shoot it down".

       OK, while it sounds like it could kind of be a fast "dozen", play it over a few times and watch her lips, I think that's all it is and it's a coincidence.

       Not shilling here, but I caught it live. I wasn't watching the debate, but I was listening to it with a headset and I heard the "sound."

       My initial assumption was that it was Wallace trying to say something to someone, maybe someone in his ear, or someone who had a question.

       That Trump was a ventriloquist or the real donald trump has ventriloquist skills.  The sound came from trump.

       You do realize ventriloquists talk by not moving their mouths, right? That is kind of what makes them special. If trump "threw his voice" but opened his mouth then... he was just talking.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, good on you for bringing this up. Maybe it was just a weird coincidence and at the moment Hillary loses her train of thought, a sound that sounds exactly like the word she said as she continues with her sentence is heard. Strange coincidence.

       It's very clear that it's someone saying, very quickly, "dozen!" Just at the point where Hillary appears to be lost for words, exactly like the person who sits to the side of a stage play to whisper loudly to actors should they forget their lines.

       It does indeed sound like someone was speaking to her. This begs the question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it wrong to have an earpiece in during the debate? Would we not expect her to have assistance whispering in her ear? Obviously Hilary would be expected to pull some shit like this, but would we be mad and upset if our local congressman wore an earpiece during a debate or a press conference?

       No, you're right, the microphone picked up audio from an unseen earpiece, of someone whispering "dozens", as if that were a crucial part of the point she were making. Or, that in the hour and half debate, that was the only instance in which she was floundering and needed coaching...the election is really watering down this sub.

       I think I have to go with that too.  I don't hear dozens, but I hear the sound for sure.  It just coincides perfectly as she sucks in and makes some kind of sound as she does it.....like she was trying to say it right then but her mouth and breathing had other ideas.
      </p>

       Even it didn't happen to fit in right at that time, there is not enough to say we heard voices from an earphone, but only at that time.

       This is the kind of thing that if people run away with it, claiming something that can't be proven, we all get hit with the "disregard stick".

       Besides. Lets examine this. If there were only three mics on at that time (Hers, Trumps, and the Moderators), how could the cameras have picked it up but no one else heard it? I think its just a suction noise either she or trump or even maybe the moderator made while she was about to speak and it just so happened to sound a little bit like dozens.

       As soon as the other person mentioned her mouth, you can check and at that exact time the sound is made.....she sucks in and her lips hit together making the sound.  I think she was about to say it and did that instead, but then said it.

       In the wikileaks emails, Hillary's "Debate Prep Book" is right in there as an attachment. Reading it, the canned answers are so familiar --- we've heard them enough times. She memorizes canned answers that are "flexible" and that can sometimes be applied to numerous questions.

       Here is the link to the book - just go to Attachments

       No, they are most certainly not supposed to be scripted. The candidates know the topics beforehand, but are not supposed to know the specific questions that will be asked.

       Just to make sure I understand, you're saying that you think that CTR was in her ear? If so I thought that CTR was for shilling the internet. Ninja edit: Oh. You're implying

       She's prepared. Does she have some zingers in the can? Yeah. Does she have answers about emails and Benghazi ready to go?  Yep! Preparedness isn't a bad thing, though.

       Because he knows he's grasping at straws. Doing CTRs job for them when you post unverified, whacko claims like this. Discredits the sub and frankly wastes everyone's time. Especially when there is a dearth of material out there that would land her in prison that is worth talking about.

       Every nominee except Donald Trump has prepared in the same way in all of modern history. Is Hillary not as off the cuff charming as Obama, GWB or Bill? No doubt. Don't be swayed by stupid stuff and fall for trump. He's a conman. Don't be conned.
