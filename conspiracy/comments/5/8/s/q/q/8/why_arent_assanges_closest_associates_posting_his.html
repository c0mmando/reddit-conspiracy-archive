       If my communication with the world got shut down one fine day, and I was the kind of at risk public figure Assange is, you can rest assured that my friends, family, and loved ones would take to social media in a heartbeat to ask questions, demand answers, and relate status.   They'd start an online vigil.   They'd make it clear to the world that something isn’t right on a number of different fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'd put the thumbscrews to Ecuador.   They'd plan a trip to the embassy in London and tell the world when it's going to happen, and record the entire journey on video while giving a day by day account of it all.

       My theory is the full force of the US goverment showed it's hand and is doing all possible to stop the big things from wikileaks from being released. If they turned off their site and accounts people might freak out but doing it this way maintains status quo. Release daily but keep the bombshells out. Wikileaks main weakness is the lack of figurehead other than Assange it was probably easy for them to be taken over, the dead man's switch was the only tricky part to handle.

       I think the lieutenants of WL know the forces against assange are nearly godlike in terms relative to worldly powers. I'm not surprised if all of them were contacted as JA was captured. Then, knowing the clear and present danger he was in, nobody is willing to literally die for wikileaks like Julian.

       As for lawyers, well he's on number three at the moment. If I was in that guys shoes I'm pretty sure I'd want to keep my distance too at this time. Even if there is no impropriety as to the the past deaths it would certainly be enough to make you think about getting in the way.

       An embassy gig in London for an Ecuadorian civil servant is a really big deal. They're probably under orders from the Ambassador not to mention anything WL or Assange until after the Election.

       If someone has the free time they could always surveille it for takeaway food is deliveries. It would be a better indication than nothing.

       Yeah well if thats true and I was the ambassador, I would say the U.S doesn't have jurisdiction to tell us what to do. Given the fraud happening within government the people at the U.S have every right to know what the hell is going on with that rogue government. :)

       I really do applaud the sentiment, that's nice to see. Sad thing is they've obviously been leant on by some bastard (Kerry). I don't think Julian would want the people of Ecuador to suffer the repercussions let alone jeopardise his asylum. It's a sticky situation for everyone I'd reckon.

       True, but I would make it public, and let the people decide, if there were any ramifications the people would know the truth and the U.S would look like the enemy. Their getting away with this because people are not standing up to this bullshit. Once one person does so will the rest. the U.S is a house of cards right now, one wrong move for them and it will all come crashing down on top of them.

       If you were the ambassador and someone would hand you a key that gives you access to a 250 million dollar off shore account, would you see that differently?

       Maybe completely exaggerated but every body has their price. Or a weakness that could be exploited.

       Well, there are a lot of people who would think differently if they were actually presented with that choice.

       It´s good to see that you wouldn´t in theory do that, but I think it´s fair to say that the world we live in is not exclusively populated by good people.

       People who keep saying he doesn't want to give up his location either a)have no idea he has been in the same place for years or B) are assuming he is making an escape and has already left the embassy.

       I think that most people are smart enough to realize he has been in the same place for years.  He could be silent for several reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        He was captured.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        He is still in the embassy, but was cut-off from outside communication.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        He is moving and knows that any communication will be tracked.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        He is dead.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I am sure there are other options, but I am hoping he was able to move to another location and is not communicating at all.

       You say he "is/was" located in the Ecuador embassy.  If he were moving, then he would not make any communications with anyone because it can be tracked.  We already know this from Snowden.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he communicates at all, then the NSA will know for sure he is still inside the embassy, or he has moved.  If he is silent, then they do not know for sure unless someone talks.

       those you expect to keep us informed of the state of wikileaks would have been pressured by the same forces that took julian, if you believe that's indeed what has happened. Knowing julian was taken while "protected"... they are not willing to be tortured and killed for WL simple as that. IF JA was captured it's a tremendous show of force and scary as fuck if you're the one in line to carry the torch after julian.

       The pressure on Assange has increased in the past weeks. Assuming he isn't captured, it will be in his interest that no one knows where he is. This would complicate any plans to 'drone' him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately for us this would mean we will not get a solid proof of him being alive, since it might give away his location.

       Not sure what Craig Murray's relationship is to Assange, but he supposedly saw him on the evening of Oct 19th,
       <em>
        the day after his internet was curtailed
       </em>
       . Mr. Murray's recent blog posts are interesting.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        1) Go into the Foreign Office and read ten Top Secret documents about UK collaboration with torture to refresh my memory. Hand back documents and my notes in a double sealed envelope (have just done this bit).
2) Immediately after reading Top Secret documents, go to see Julian Assange for a whisky in the Ecuador Embassy (am on my way).

       Here is a question: Is there any set of normal circumstances that could create the result we see? Is there any possible explanation other than a forced cut off from the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, you would just have to think who would benefit the most from his disappearance. I think it´s safe to say that his focus was on the US in the recent weeks and months. I think it´s also safe to say that namely Hillary Clinton has the most to gain by his disappearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that in turn does not prove anything, but it is highly likely that someone close to her has acted for her, IF she didn´t initiate this herself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am too confused that we don´t hear ANYTHING from him. At this point it´s like he never happened. Thing is, if that continues for a year or so then the public will forget.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only hope that wikileaks has grown enough to operate independent from Assange. Just in case.

       And Hillary Clinton probably has dirt on many people in Washington. She
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       have put pressure on someone in the military or an intelligence agency who is able to send out covert operatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the "deadman switch" doesn't get tripped, then you can assume that Julian Assange is being pressured by "intense negotiations" in order to keep him resetting the countdown. Of course, they might have found out what the reset procedure is, and are resetting the deadman switch themselves, making Assange's life superfluous.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could be really bad for Julian Assange. He needs our prayers.

       Because it's getting coverage. This is exactly what happened with Putin during that supposed coup. This is exactly what happened when we went through "Hillary Health" for 2 weeks when everyone said "this is it guys, she's done!". Now we're being told he's missing to bring attention to the fact that wikileaks is happening. They're using the tactics being used against us by CTR.

       There must be others.  And he certainly has relatives and loved ones.   It's hard to believe someone can't call the Embassy and reach him for emergencies.

       I am hoping that his absence is just to create a story and lift up the wikileaks story. If he is missing then and people start becoming nervous, more people might think "hmmm maybe there really was stuff leaked that is bombshell enough to get you disappeared."
      </p>
      <p>
       At least I hope it is so the leaks are the focus and not him, but it is very very strange and I would not be surprised if he is in custody.

       Perhaps he's remaining silent so more people pay attention to the leaks as they are constantly looking at his pages.

       Give him time, he will post again.

       I personally think its an attention grab.  The world thinks he's disappeared.  Everyone is checking his pages and twitter account.  Than curiosity will peak and people will look into more things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, he will drop a bombshell, and with the recent tweet stating that they are releasing a statement about him, more people will be looking at his page, then read this bombshell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I'm right.

       Is it possible he escaped and instructed them not to say anything for fear of leaking any kind of info?  Or is this just wishful thinking?
