<p>And there&#39;s been suspicions of emp/power grid attacks(false flags) leading up to war with Russia- though it could also mean the Internet in lockdown (to prevent the latest wiki releases) and leaving us in the dark, info/communication wise.</p>

<p>But no, sorry, nothing additional about the train.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enjoy nature and family. It wouldn&#39;t hurt to build a 3 day emergency kit for your home or car just to have an edge over the average person if things go down, the act of building and organizing one is therapeutic and calming in itself, to me. </p>

<p>It can be very stressful to feel like you&#39;re one of a handful of people following these things or paying attention. Even giving these things a passing thought is more than most people will. Mentally prepping that these things COULD HAPPEN already puts you at a survival advantage to be calmer and collected when you need it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points. In all honesty, I just went through hurricane Matthew. Did not prepare much at all, decided to ride it out and pray for the best. We had no major damage but lost power for a week. We survived on adrenaline, instant coffee and cigarettes. I did not miss having power, I felt like I was glamping. </p>

<p>The scary part was the looting. They sent the national guard so it kept it bay for the most part, but it was happening. A whole city, half evacuated and no power. It could have gotten ugly fast. On a larger scale, it will not be good. </p>

<p>Being mentally prepared is very important, in my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhh yeah train was going &quot;double the speed&quot; it should have been and only hit brakes at last second. Nobody important it seems was injured. No muslims blamed, and everything is back together for the most part.</p>

<p>But it was shut down for some time, enough time to set up anything in a train or the station itself. Maybe this was just a smoke screen to do something big.</p>
