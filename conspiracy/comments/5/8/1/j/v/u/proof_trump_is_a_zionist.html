       He is in line with the Zionist agenda, his AIPAC speech shows he is fully compliant. Thus he will go to war in Syria. From his AIPAC speech:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My number-one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it because already, you know, as you know, it has, the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        When I’m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran’s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        When I’m president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. ...
       </p>
       <p>
        The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable.

       He's a total Zionist sellout, and a warmonger, and WILL attack Syria if it is massively profitable for him. Which is easy to do since the Rothschilds Zionists possess legal money-creation abilities through the central banks.

       I think his choice of VP is pretty telling as well. Pence supported the Patriot Act, supports TPP, supported military action against Iraq, supports Israel and its "right" to attack facilities in Iran to prevent the Iranians from developing nuclear weapons and also defended the actions of Israel in its use of deadly force in enforcing the blockade of Gaza. Oh and the guy says his role model as Vice President would be Dick Cheney. If Trump somehow won the election, Pence would be the one holding the leash.

       Whoa sudden attacks, even in PMs! I certainly hit a nerve here... I think I hit on to a thing they don't want anyone to talk about because it ruins the MSM Hillary vs Trump narrative and makes people realize both sides are controlled. Stein is the only anti-war choice.

       I care about who is a Zionist, you see. It's an ideology. I'm not a racist. I don't care about people's race, only about what they believe and do. And Stein is very clearly anti-war.

       (((Stein))) is a Communist Jew, who believes in Israel. AKA, a Zionist. Two party solution. Just because you are daft/ignorant, does not make me wrong.  Look into the Lilith you support... Calling me a shill or troll and shit. lmao. You're ignorant as fuck. Hate to burst your naive/delusional bubble (no I'm not). Bernie is also a Zionists, both Jews... Both Zionists. I'd actually pick Bernie over Stein, because one is a straight up Communist the other a National Socialist.... lol. Magnora, get back when you actually know wtf you are talking about... Pathetic, and sad.. I told you, I would eat  you alive, keep this shit coming. So the whole community here can see it...

       Zionism is the ultimate belief in a Jewish homeland, in which she agrees with (This goes against the language of Judaism - Hebrews - no homeland until the messiah comes). She's a "Jew" (Eastern European). Just because you are ignorant does not make it so. You're a joke bro, and if you want to debate me, you're going to need to learn up. Debate what I just said, her stance, and your ignorance.... THX.

       That's historical Zionism. Israel already exists. I'm talking modern political Zionism, as the term is used today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument now is should Israel be allowed to expand to take over more land, or not. I say not. Stein says not. Trump and Clinton both support Israel's expansion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore Stein is not an Israeli expansionist, and therefore is not a Zionist as I'm using the word here. Sorry if we were not using similar language at the start, my fault.

       You showed your character when you started attacking my character instead of addressing the argument, just as you were ironically trying to accuse me of doing. Everyone sees what you're doing. No one is fooled by your attempts to control the narrative without having substance to back it up.

       Let's say the Palestinians get what they want. We give them Israel (never mind the people we displace for now), aren't they just going to start fighting about the next piece of land?

       We just need to leave the borders where they are. Israeli expansionism is the driving problem of that conflict:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If things would simply stay the same instead of the constant expansionism by Israel, the situation would improve dramatically in the long run, in my opinion.

       Why would they? You kind of sound ignorant. Maybe Khazars should move back to Russia, Poland, Germany, etc etc, and give the land back to the Semites, which are Palestinians...

       Couldn't agree more, I go on /pol/ all the time and they hail Trump as the one who will back off the "globalists" (jews), and I laugh and point to the fact that he literally campaigned for Bibi, and there is a lot of evidence that points towards him actually being jewish himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: and please don't called them rothschild zionists, there is no other type of zionist. It's redundant. show me a single one of these globalists who is not also a zionist and I will concede that point. :D

       If someone attacks you, report their comment and follow up on the report with a message to the mods requesting action.

       We will remove the attack, and that way you get to maintain the high ground by not getting in the muck with other users, lowering the level of discourse on the sub.

       Fair enough. But is it not accurate? He repeatedly does this type of behavior, over months. I will keep simply flagging it when I see it, I guess, but it seems like mods should take control of this sub for the users benefit instead of letting thread-derailers, forum sliders, and provocateurs run the threads, but I guess that's none of my business. Have a nice day.

       What I said is a figure of speech, as in: I'll destroy your argument/accusations (after being called a troll). How that is a rule 10 violation is beyond me..

       I'm quoting the man. It's his own opinion. The belief that Israel should have Mount Zion is the core of Zionism. Mt Zion is in the middle of Jerusalem, which he said he wanted to move the US embassy to, to help Israel make it their capital, so they can push away the Palestinians and take Mt. Zion.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a Zionist. This is proof.

       And "I'll eat you alive magnora" isn't an attack? Don't hate me for hinting at the truth, instead hate the people repeatedly intentionally dragging down the level of discussion on the forum and making personal attacks. He's attacked me at least 5 times today with various threats
