       My point exactly!
With the added bonus of being able to have some questions answered.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        If you don't ask (AMA request) you don't get!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Good points raised so far:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        His lack of a known internet connection
       </strong>
       is a very valid point and something I thought of prior to posting however you can't tell me that, in this day and age, he wouldn't be able to obtain one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the actual AMA, I have complete
       <strong>
        faith in the Moderators/Admins of r/conspiracy
       </strong>
       . It's their time to shine.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I posted this to, at the very least, draw attention to the fact that there is no
        <em>
         rock solid
        </em>
        proof that he is alive
       </strong>
       and well during a [crucial] time where they are actively attempting to
       <em>
        silence
       </em>
       him.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a community, we can dissect all the (mis)information for as long as we like but hearing from Julian Assange is the only way to know that;
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         he is indeed alive and well
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wikileaks has not been compromised
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         what has become a
         <em>
          movement
         </em>
         has not just been nullified

       Fuck I hope he is ok. The last 3 days has been a fucking shit-show.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked this in another thread but do you remember the call made to the Ecuadorian Embassy when the internet was cut, asking about Assange?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the photo's that I can no longer find of someone being escorted from the Embassy in a black hood and put into a van?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the details about the 1:01 post dated 1/1/1986 (possible room 101 reference?)?
      </p>
      <p>
       So much shit to sift through I can no longer find them. Hoping for a peaceful resolve to this situation though. Jules is a true Aussie hero.

       yep, I remember the transcripts of the call (I think the actual recording of it was on periscope) and the comment about someone being escorted out though I never saw a picture to back it up. The only thing I remember with dates was the 1/1/1984 upload dates on the Wikileaks files.

       Yeah that's right, was on Periscope. And they all got taken down didn't they? Don't suppose you have the link to the 1/1/1984 file on wikileaks?

       It's the link to Wikileaks files and torrents, initially some thought it was new info but its just old releases. There is a 101 connection I didn't see the first time though!

       He definitely shouldn't use this site because it would be so infested with fake posters/bots trying to push propaganda that the entire thread would just be one big inform &amp; influence operation against social media users, all the fake posts would be upvoted, and any real/genuine questions or replies would be downvoted to hidden status, which is what already happens in every thread relating to politics or news on any major subreddit here.
      </p>
      <p>
       sometimes the fake posters accidentally copy/paste the exact same text on multiple accounts in the same thread. it's just ridiculous how bad it has gotten, reddit isn't the same site it was before the political garbage picked up.

       This isn't just about his safety. We can't know that the leaks are genuine or that a massive bomb isn't coming to discredit Wikileaks, until we at least know Assange was tortured to death to turn over passwords and keys.

       His lack of a known internet connection is a very valid point and something I thought of prior to posting however you can't tell me that, in this day and age, he wouldn't be able to obtain one.

       I posted this to, at the very least, draw attention to the fact that there is no
       <em>
        rock solid

       proof that he is alive and well during a [crucial] time where they are actively attempting to

       him.

       As a community, we can dissect all the (mis)information for as long as we like but hearing from Julian Assange is the only way to know that;

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         he is indeed alive and well

       No. pay attention to anyone asking for proof of life. We aren't making any statements other than things are fishy and there has been no proof that he is alive since the weird events that day. So anyone saying he is fine, there is no evidence he is dead, are completely side stepping this. All I would like is a picture from a friend, or for him to stand on the balcony and wave for 5 seconds like he has done numerous times.
