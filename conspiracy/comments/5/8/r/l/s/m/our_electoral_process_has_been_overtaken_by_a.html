    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. I hope you don&#39;t mind my suggestion the plan goes back decades to the creation of The Fed. I believe the real test for the shadow government was JFK&#39;s assassination. He fired Allen Dulles after Dulles defied his order and moved ships into the Bay of Pigs. JFK did not capitulate as Dulles believed he would and JFK took the heat created by CIA spin. The military industrial complex needed a new war from which to profit and JFK didn&#39;t play by their rules. JFK had also announced his plan to issue government-backed currency to eliminate interest, to downsize the CIA, and then made his now-famous speech about forming a relationship with the USSR. The speech was similar in tone to Eisenhower&#39;s warning as he left office. The CIA was successful in this covert operation with the assistance of the Warren Commission, to which Dulles was appointed (also Gerald Ford). This emboldened the agency which went on to remove MLK, Jr., Bobby Kennedy, and very likely Malcolm X. A website, Ratical.org, has links to the transcripts of the prosecution of Clay Shaw (CIA) and the civil lawsuit that alleged MLK&#39;s assassination was a conspiracy. The closing arguments for both are incredible; the MLK verdict was in favor of the plaintiff. The CIA sent a clear message to the puppets. In the mid-70s the Church Committee revisited the findings of the Warren Commission and its report is also available on the web. Read the passages on the media&#39;s CIA operatives as both editors and journalists and on the use of biological weapons, spying on U.S. citizens, warrantless wiretapping, the use of drugs in experiments, covert operations, and more. The report reads as if it is 2016. Church condemned the Warren Commission and the Committee recommended scaling back the power of the CIA. Many of the same players went on to work for the Nixon, Ford, Reagan administrations and then Bush Sr., a CIA agent who was in Dallas when JFK was assassinated and son of Prescott Bush who was once head of the CIA, started a new camaign against Iraq. He was condemned for not finishing Desert Storm by taking out Hussein, but it has been speculated that was intentional as part of the new plan for perpetual war and the eventual assumption of power in the middle east, aided by Israel and Saudi Arabia. I could go on and share details about William Kristol, the Kagans, Project for a New American Century and all of the other &quot;think tanks&quot; that are covers for defense contractors&#39; P.R., Robert Kagan&#39;s wife, Victoria Nuland (has been a key player in WJC&#39;s, GW&#39;s, and Obama&#39;s admins, along with her sister-in-law Kim Kagan), the 1998 Iraq Freedom Act, and Papa Kagan&#39;s letter that encouraged Cheney to invade Iraq even if WMDs weren&#39;t found - but I&#39;m guessing you know all of this. Oh - and the reason W cited concern regarding WMDs was because the CDC provided them to Iraq during the USSR-Afghanistan war. Many don&#39;t realize Rahm Emanuel assisted the Israel Defense Forces during the Gulf War. He was Director of WJC&#39;s finance campaign and was on retainer for Goldman Sachs. He was also one of the architects of NAFTA. All of the political elite are connected, regardless of Party. Voting is a charade designed to make us feel as if we are true participants. Social triumphs (e.g. gay marriage) are concessions when the wind is blowing in a certain direction. It is no accident this occurred under Obama, with the help of the MSM, to distract us from the REAL issues, all involving money and power. While it&#39;s positive and a victory for human rights, at the same time how many rights have been weakened or eliminated? How may humans have been sacrificed in war-for-profit? How many know our income tax only pays the INTEREST on the debt created by our &quot;defense&quot; operations? The Fed prints the currency that is transferred to the powerful all around the globe and we pay the price.  Literally, in lives and $. Again, thanks for your well-informed post and references.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how old you are but to me context and history is SO important.  To see the same people &quot;working&quot; in four administrations, or more, is proof the 2-party system is a charade based on human trait of dichotomy: good vs. evil, winners vs. losers., thus our love of athletic competition and contrary to protests, war. I was indoctrinated by textbooks full of propaganda: lies and omissions. I was not taught the REAL history on most subjects. And the U.S. was always framed as the good actor. I had no idea Standard Oil, like companies today, funded and profited all both sides of WWII. Or that Manifest Destiny ignored the fact that it was genocide. I thought the &quot;tea party&quot; and taxes was the reason for the Revolutionary War, not that Washington had decided to abandon the Crown&#39;s currency (Rothschild). Just by knowing that one seemingly minor detail anyone can see the creation of The Fed was contrary to what our ancestors fought for: freedom from indebtedness and all that it brings. Since my epiphany, when Obama labeled Snowden a traitor, I vowed to stop criticizing the &quot;other&quot; Party (had done that since a child), and started examining my Party&#39;s actions. Overwhelming. And I was ashamed of my own confirmation bias that if a Democrat is in office all is good. Obama and the Clintons participated in the same 1-Party service to the powerful elite, but they did it better; able to hide that their actions were utterly contrary to the values of the average Party members. I research a lot now, and was pleased to see your post with new information of which I was not aware.</p>
