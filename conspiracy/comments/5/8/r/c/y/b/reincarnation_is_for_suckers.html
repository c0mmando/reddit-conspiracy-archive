No dead relatives, no tunnel of light, no light beings, no life review; just pervasive, unrelenting joy. I still had something to do, so I chose to get back into my body and finish out this life, which had, except for that one thing, already been blown. Maybe I&#39;m just a freak, I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see and understand what you mean, there. I guess a better phrasing of the question would be: What physically represents these angels to you? Those participating in these races or those observing? How do you see it playing out? I&#39;m curious as an American observing this election from the inside; curious to a point-of-view from the outside. I pass no judgement on worldly and non-worldly views no matter how far out they may seem from my simple mind, so feel free to share without worry as to whether I am being a judgmental prick and replying with closed-minded verbal bashing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The touch of good and justice, waiting for the people to see and act upon it. To care and know they help to change the course it is going now. Middle east long time, many wars, now europe gets damaged as well. It can reach usa. Did already damage before but must not get worse. The battle is on many levels, not just politics, media, internet and more !. Souls that believe in good. Look at UK, it breaks souls that are good. The souls in middle east that have suffered so much that these are lost ones that now do damage and make more. Even terrorists, not evil as baby, but too much damage, and damage spreading damage now. I vote not, but Jill i like best, i would hope not clinton it has been too long damage doings. This war has been going on for a long time already but it is getting bigger and deeper now. I moved away out of europe. Also i lived one year in islamic country. Time is now. The fight has become very dark. That is why the election is ugly to see.  What you not see, is worse than just ugly. Know, that people are good until we damage them too much. The battleground now we can see some inside , the fight is hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a very large amount of Americans see that, but they have no idea where to begin. I can tell you that the good fight will be fought, though. I see many people leaving the cities to become self-sustained and sovereign individuals far from the epicenter of the issues. I am fully aware that these issues must be addressed head on and not by trying to leave the system alone in hopes that it will starve. I am willing to do whatever I can. However, like a majority of my fellow Americans, my social programming has hindered me and denied me the skill of true critical-thinking. I lack the resources to initiate some sort of change, and no matter how many weapons the average citizen stockpiles in preparation, we&#39;ll be outgunned every time. The things we would have to sacrifice would be immeasurable, but it would all be pointless if we&#39;re bound to lose a physical fight. Despite all the wrongdoings of man, I still have no doubt that the universe is unfolding and will unfold exactly as it should. The suffering can and will end. I&#39;d stake my life on it.</p>

<p>Long story short. There is nothing to fear for, my friend. Ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome. I wish your post would get a ton of up votes. Unfortunately people are to busy bickering about Trump vs Hillary. In a possible WW3 situation where majority of us might die, this is far more important knowledge than who&#39;s running for POTUS. Quite sad, but can you blame us for being so blind as a race? You can only blame those who are presented the truth and they turn their backs on it. This topic of afterlife is my new hobby as it is the most crucial part of my new life in the afterworld. We are spiritual beings having a human experience. I will not be brainwashed by mainstream Christianity and instead follow what the Gnostics taught us. Jehovah wants us to be his bitch.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello.   I have often thought about this subject.  I would describe myself as a follower of the Christ teachings according to the Gnostics.  It was only in the past 3-4 years that I began to hear about the &quot;Reincarnation Trap&quot;.  At first I thought it was complete BS, but then I realized I couldn&#39;t think of a single time where I learned about what to do when you die and cross over.  What spiritual teachings have ever said to go to the light?  If you do go to the light, how is it possible that we, as extensions of the source of all, can ever be enslaved by lesser beings?<br/>
This is all very confusing to me, however my gut feeling tells me that you cant go wrong if you follow the path of love.  In other words instead of going to the light, maybe go towards the love?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. That is very tricky. They will project fake images of loved ones, so be very careful. They have enslaved us because we became incredibly lazy and extremely stupid. To be truly free one must understand how and when; to &quot;self project/overlap/rewrite&quot; reality, or what you see as &quot;out there&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Practice Visualizing constantly, with eyes open and closed. The ability can be strengthened like a muscle. You must put in a constant amount of effort. We have massively atrophied and this is why we became stupid and enslaved. The Matrix is currently projecting our reality, like Platos &quot;Allegory Of The Cave&quot;. Get the Silva Method books (very cheap) and learn to project upon your &quot;Mental Screen&quot;. Understand that images around you are Holograms and can be manipulated by thought. What is very important to remember is; The Group Conscious and Subconscious are incredibly powerful and solidifies this reality. The major portion of that group believes in pain,sickness, poverty, war and death. To overcome that you must develop your consciousness constantly. You need to saturate your inner conscious levels with the truth about this Holographic Matrix. We can overwrite this reality if we wake up and be the Incredible Creators we were meant to be..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s quite fascinating; the ones I spoke with referred to travel as swimming, and this was quite confusing to me, until I realized they really meant flying. I asked one if they used the term because the air was so dense to them that they can swim through it, and she said <em>partly.</em> Yours is the first mention of it I&#39;ve seen. I also think I may have shot one while it was a crow.</p>
