       It's a scam.  We give them money so they can buy our weapons.  America is the largest weapons exporter by a very wide margin.  The weapons foster global instability, which in turn drives demand for more weapons.  We also seek to exploit war zones for political and commercial gain.

       So what you are saying is...arms sellers like Lockheed Martin and Israeli support lobbiests like AIPAC pay bribes to politicians who then send billions in "aid" to Israel. Israel gets free arms, Lockheed gets to sell said arms and make cash, the politicians get their dirty money, and the US citizen takes it up the ass?

       yes, it's an indirect subsidy.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is normally how the "loans" work for international banking institutions, too.  The Worldbank and IMF loan capital to third world countries, but that capital has stipulations that require contracting with the investor nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a shell game of sorts.  Like when a company contracts with its subsidiaries to move money on and off book to make it look profitable.  Only in this instance, it feeds the military industrial complex.  The problem is that while it's creating havoc in the middle east to let us sell more weapons, it's also helping israel independently build a tech industry which will inevitably take over the globe.

       Ooo, ooo, I know this one. What happens in these types of deals is that the US gives billions of dollars to the target country, and the target country then uses the cash to buy US weaponary and "advisors". What this does is allow the USA to effectively position military hardware and key personnel without having the appearance of directly deploying military forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, it's Israel's planes enforcing an agenda that coincidentally benefits the West. Totally not the USA.

       Very well said. I had not considered this angle but now hearing it, it seems all too probable to be the best answer ive seen so far. The shear number of US military bases around the world is unprecedented. This is a perfect answer to how and why.

       You aren't going to believe the answer at first, but if you research this on your own you will come to the same conclusion I did.  Israel runs this nation.  Israel has successfully subverted our democracy, and has consolidated its power within our government since about the 1970's.  The USA is nothing but a whore for Israel, to be used, abused and cast aside when there is nothing left.

       True. I guess my real question was, why is there no transparency or accountability to the American public as to what exactly the money is for? It's crazy they can just send as much cash they want to who they want. That's our money they are throwing away and no one cares enough to do anything.

       And in the end, a third of my extremely low income that I'm using to barely keep afloat in this economy goes to the Feds who decide to ship it out to wherever they want, while there are cities full of lead, a looming future energy and water crisis, and a shit public education system. They're making more money for themselves with the money they stole from me, not using it to better the lives of the American people.

       And buy out trusted news organizations to manipulate the population with choice words and carefully planned dialogues. We are no better than North Korea at this point. Unfortunately, over half of the population is either blissfully unaware or have been brainwashed into thinking ethics is irrelevant and that this is just how it is and should be.

       But this is a breaking point. Even if Hillary does take the crown, there are thousands of emails and documents, along with these videos that clearly illustrate illegal activity. There will always be people advocating for truth and justice. She will not be able to silence us all. But this is our chance to not take this shit anymore and I hope the majority will realize it soon. And I hope the media will grow some fucking balls and stop sucking Hillarys dick for two minutes.

       Oh yeah lol and the polls are desperately trying to show Clinton is ahead in the polls. By over 10 points?? Sorry but that's just incentivizing all the trumpets to just be more vocal, showing how much they care. But it won't matter because we know they can rig elections, we know they're not going to stop, and we know no one is going to do anything about it. I am still just hoping wikileaks has the Obama emails and more leaks than just the podesta stuff that comes out every day. I hope there's some hard proof of the big media corporations colluding with the campaign. But we'll see. In the end, it'll be decided by how dirty the dirt they have on her is.

       Yea I've actually been pretty surprised at how much coverage the wiki leaks stuff gets in the mainstream, since they shit out most other things. I also wonder if something truly undeniable cane out, like recording or video, if they could still cover that up? I'm excited to see more leaks too, but I'm pretty unsure at this point if there is literally anything they couldn't suppress.

       Yeah I'm in the same boat. We'll see how it turns out. Just do your part and get the message out. Tell everyone the dire consequences of this (war with Russia, Huxley's brave new world is going to be America, etc.) Remind them of the millions of civilians who have died around the world at the expense of these fucking assholes in power. Just shove the truth down their throats. Force feed them facts. There's dozens that I bring up with people and they don't have any response. But these are facts and people have a responsibility to know the truth and not let these people harm anyone anymore. This is our only opportunity to bring down the establishment. We need to not take this lightly

       The people who support Israel will make life loud and unpleasant if we don't. If we persist in our withdrawal those same people who support Israel will begin to sabotage things in America up to and including false flag terror attacks. Israel means war in the middle east, it always has and it always will. The only thing we are in control of is if we want it fast or slow. In the nuclear age, it's become possible for less than 1% of the population to consistently blackmail the 99%. Israel cannot be dismantled without a minimum of a billion deaths. This is common knowledge to the average Israeli.

       Yes, but I feel this still doesn't explain how this excuse justifies our government actually paying for their defense. We could still be strong allies and "come to Israel's aid" whenever we wanted without having to be Israel's money machine. How do more ppl not find this absurd?

       politicians get paid by deciding how money is spent.  The more they spend, the more they get paid.  They can only spend it on things they've fooled the people into believing they should be spending money on, and financial aid is one of them.

       Control.  If politicians and elite power brokers want something from you (bribes) then they are more willing to do as asked.  But you can't tell your public that you are buying influence with foreign governments....so "aid package".  I'd bet that the vast majority of aid is influence purchases.

       That makes a lot if sense. I just find it wildly unbelievable that politicians can get away with just giving random "aid packages" without showing specucally what it's being used for. Otherwise, they make it look like they gift wrapped several billions of dollars and shipped it to Israel with the tag "To: Israel From: Santa".

       Because we aren't giving it to a nation. We are giving it to a small group of people, which makes them very rich, while it only costs us pennies.

       Listen, you will always be poor, but if you can spare a few hundred dollars for the Clinton Global Initiative, you can push a dying old woman and a charming pedophile rapist a little further from the consequences they have avoided over the past 5 decades.

       I'm not trolling. I'm very interested in discussing why this is a thing and how it is justified. I've heard it was mostly military aid to help protect them from terrorism and Hamas. However, my question is why do we pay for something they can afford to do on their own?

       The funny part is that they don't even need the aid. Israel's Iron Dome system has been exposed as a hoax.

       So....the open air prison in Gaza condemned by the vast majority of the world is a hoax? Are the illegal settlements also a hoax? Please enlighten us.

       I'm very confused. I watched the sound effects bit of that video and the narrator showed what he called the "real iron dome". So, is the iron some real or not. He even said that BBC clip of at the missiles firing was real.
