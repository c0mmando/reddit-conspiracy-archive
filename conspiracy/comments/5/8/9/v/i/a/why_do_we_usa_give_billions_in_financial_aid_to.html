    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a scam.  We give them money so they can buy our weapons.  America is the largest weapons exporter by a very wide margin.  The weapons foster global instability, which in turn drives demand for more weapons.  We also seek to exploit war zones for political and commercial gain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you are saying is...arms sellers like Lockheed Martin and Israeli support lobbiests like AIPAC pay bribes to politicians who then send billions in &quot;aid&quot; to Israel. Israel gets free arms, Lockheed gets to sell said arms and make cash, the politicians get their dirty money, and the US citizen takes it up the ass?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, it&#39;s an indirect subsidy.</p>

<p>this is normally how the &quot;loans&quot; work for international banking institutions, too.  The Worldbank and IMF loan capital to third world countries, but that capital has stipulations that require contracting with the investor nations.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shell game of sorts.  Like when a company contracts with its subsidiaries to move money on and off book to make it look profitable.  Only in this instance, it feeds the military industrial complex.  The problem is that while it&#39;s creating havoc in the middle east to let us sell more weapons, it&#39;s also helping israel independently build a tech industry which will inevitably take over the globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ooo, ooo, I know this one. What happens in these types of deals is that the US gives billions of dollars to the target country, and the target country then uses the cash to buy US weaponary and &quot;advisors&quot;. What this does is allow the USA to effectively position military hardware and key personnel without having the appearance of directly deploying military forces.</p>

<p>See, it&#39;s Israel&#39;s planes enforcing an agenda that coincidentally benefits the West. Totally not the USA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t going to believe the answer at first, but if you research this on your own you will come to the same conclusion I did.  Israel runs this nation.  Israel has successfully subverted our democracy, and has consolidated its power within our government since about the 1970&#39;s.  The USA is nothing but a whore for Israel, to be used, abused and cast aside when there is nothing left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. I guess my real question was, why is there no transparency or accountability to the American public as to what exactly the money is for?

Unfortunately, over half of the population is either blissfully unaware or have been brainwashed into thinking ethics is irrelevant and that this is just how it is and should be. </p>

<p>But this is a breaking point. Even if Hillary does take the crown, there are thousands of emails and documents, along with these videos that clearly illustrate illegal activity. There will always be people advocating for truth and justice. She will not be able to silence us all.

I am still just hoping wikileaks has the Obama emails and more leaks than just the podesta stuff that comes out every day.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but I feel this still doesn&#39;t explain how this excuse justifies our government actually paying for their defense. We could still be strong allies and &quot;come to Israel&#39;s aid&quot; whenever we wanted without having to be Israel&#39;s money machine. How do more ppl not find this absurd?</p>

I just find it wildly unbelievable that politicians can get away with just giving random &quot;aid packages&quot; without showing specucally what it&#39;s being used for.
