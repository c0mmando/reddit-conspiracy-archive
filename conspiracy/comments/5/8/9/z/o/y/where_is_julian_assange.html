<p>There is a rule inside the CIA if you want a good interrogation and you want good information you send the suspect to Jordan,  if you want them to be killed or tortured to death you send them to either Egypt or Syria - never to see them again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He can technically leave but I doubt he will because he is in breach of a warrant that was granted to extradite him to Sweden. So if he left it could result in his arrest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re missing the point.</p>

<p>Since the internet was shut off, nobody has seen or heard from him. That coupled with the speculation of a rendition plane flying from London to U.S. shortly after this happened makes the issue all the more pressing.</p>

<p>We <em>know</em> HRC wants him dead. We <em>know somebody</em> is trying to frame him for pedophilia and taking money from the Russians. And yet, those watching the embassy have not seen him at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And we know that the Ecudaor embassy at the urging of Kerry, cut/restricted his internet access ... i.e. ability to reach anyone. </p>

<p>This is the perfect cover because it presents a front of why he hasn&#39;t surfaced/still is fine yet at the same time he could actually be missing/in danger allowing plenty of time for all sorts of scenarios. Pending any true bombshells or confirmation he is alive, even post-election we could still all be left to assume he hasn&#39;t acknowledged he is fine bc his internet access is limited.</p>

<p>The whole plane situation REALLY was interesting...and I read somewhere on here that a &quot;military operation&quot; took place and was finished within 5 minutes, involving people repelling down the building and taking someone out of the embassy. I find it hard to rely on the embassy&#39;s statement as a measure of his safety since they seemingly worked with state officials to limit/silence him already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Least they could do is video him saying he&#39;s alright, I am seriously concerned by the lack of coverage. Ok, so a video could be faked but it would give some indication and if it did turn out to be fake, I.e. We found out later he was already taken, it would at least be proof that we were being lied to.</p>
