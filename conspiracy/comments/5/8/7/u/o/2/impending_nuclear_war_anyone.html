       sorta, yeah, but then the imp of the perverse in me winds up the clownery, cause why not, ya know?  perhaps this is how current leadership thinks of things.  anyway i cope with it through absurdity and weed and a silly joy i cannot explain.  then i think a nuclear war is really stupid.  and i spin around like that for a while getting higher and higher.  you?

       The Army Survival Guide is a good place to start. And then some reading on the effects of radiation, how long it lasts, how to counter it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you start getting supplies. A three month food and water cache, and firearms are MOST critical for that first week. Most likely shit will be very surreal for the first 36 hours because people that aren't stupid will be INSIDE. INSIDE. INSIDE. INSIDE. If you go outside you will die a very painful death. Thankfully, all the retards will suffer from radiation poisoning fairly quickly. They will want to go outside and see whats up. Don't do that.

       Hell no I'm not afraid and neither should you be.  I've seen way too many of these supposed doomsday scenarios over the years.  They want the masses to be afraid before the election because scared people are easy to manipulate.  Forget about war with Russia, it's not going to happen (If there is any US vs Russia conflict it will be contained to Syria).

       Instead think about what they are trying to distract you from.

       I'm not buying it.

      <p>
       History has proven that the party in power will fear-monger to protect its grasp of power. Bush did it in 2004 as his campaign and the RNC warned of the dangers a shift in leadership could have on the Iraq war.

       I believe the same thing is happening here. Obama and the Dems need Clinton. A Trump presidency means that all their diplomatic efforts would likely get flushed. Do you want an inexperienced individual leading our country especially while we are at the brink of nuclear war? Of course not. So vote for the establishment because while they may be crooked, they know how to play the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least that is what I gather from this conflict and how we are being manipulated to think a certain way

       Download and print every manual and schematic of all the machines, weapons and appliances you own. Maps of atleast 500 miles radius. Military handbooks are huge source, you can find anything from improvised weapons to medical handbooks, this I hugely recommend... If you cant print back up on unpowered devices like jump drives and external hard drives. Faraday cages are really a good idea if you want anything electronic to work .

       Yup. This is how it'll go down. If Hillary wins, there's going to be a lot of people who freak out....shutting down everything....but if Trump wins there will be even
       <em>
        more

       I don't think so. As far as i know it was only liberals who fire-bombed an election office. Hillary supporters are some of the worst double standards I have ever seen. I'm an independent. I have no problem criticizing or praising either candidate when its deserved. What scares me the most is blind faith in any politician. You have to constantly keep these fuckers in check -- no matter which side of the aisle.

       Honestly I am thinking about an exit strategy before its too late. Either way we're fucked -- doesn't matter who is President at this point. I never thought I'd say this but I am starting to read up on some of those prepper blogs ya know just incase the shit really does hit the fan i don't want to be the guy who is like "wait guys, why doesn't my iPhone work?" while everyone else is prepared for food/water/bank shutdown.

       I had a dream of something like "the Hammer of God". I'm sleeping but wake up just exactly as I'm aware of an beyond description force approaching, like sub harmonic roar of a 1000 foot wave, only faster. Then
       <strong>
        SLAM
       </strong>
       the roof drops. My body offers no resistance, nor does the metal frame bed, straight to the slab, flat. No time, not even a short breath, my brain says, and it's already gone, my last, "I'm dead."
      </p>

       This will be what it feels like.

       I've been having reoccurring dreams lately that I used to have as a kid. I'm in a giant black sphere with a patch of grass at the bottom, with one tiny yellow flower amongst the grass. The flower turns into a girl in a yellow dress, and she says "help me". Immediately after, giant "big boy" bombs crush through the sphere, crushing my body with a mass that is insane. I hadn't had the dream in something like 15 years and thought it was kinda funny that it popped back up recently.

       Yes, In my dream is was a
       <em>

       force that approached. I suspect those at ground zero are either blinded so fast they don't know it or the whole thing happens so fast that the flattening is the only sensation. It's so fast and so brutal,

       Forget about nuclear, by the sounds of it, you'd better slow down before you end it yourself.

       If I were a bettin' man, I'd say large scale nuclear war will not be allowed to happen. Watch this

       courtesy of SiriusDisclosure interviews. These are vetted, sworn in [most military] witnesses and cross referenced by multiple witnesses at the same event. Essentially, UFOs disarm nuclear warheads that are stationed in highly secure military silos, as well as ICBMs that have already been shot. (This happened, but I can't remember that witnesses name who tells this story, might be in this playlist.) Highly advanced civilizations do not want nuclear bombs going off because it damages the biosphere as well as supposedly other dimensions. Hopefully you aren't high while reading all this, haha! These video interviews revolves around Bentwaters, but there were hundreds of these incidents around the world during (and what likely ended) the Cold War.

       Try disconnecting from this sub, I find it's quite addictive. On my first few visits, I was thinking, "what the hell this sub is all about Hillary bashing. Sure she's a crook, but conspiracy is NOT all about one or two politicians". But over time I've devoted way too much time commenting on Hillary threads. Websites are designed to be addictive, keep that in mind.

       Not quite, it was one witness that described a nuclear warhead that already launched via ICBM towards the end of the cold war. This is how close we came to the end, but ultimately, this was the last straw. We can not expect others to come and rescue us. However, going nuclear is just about the only thing ETs will step in, dematerialize and save our asses from our utter stupidity. Anyway, this witness described a UFO disc that flew around the nose of the ICBM (sorry, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile), fired three laser like pulses and the ICBM fell out of the sky.

       It sounds crazy, but this is exactly why I believe a nuclear war wouldn't be allowed. They will not help us fight corruption until we do it ourselves, and they can't just come fix everything because that ruins the learning experience and consciousness expansion of our species.

       Apparently nuclear weapons have consequences that go throughout the galaxy. My grandpa swears he saw a UFO hovering completely silently over some trees at night while he was driving. He went to the fire station to wake the people up and show them, by the time they got up and came out it was gone.

        Essentially, UFOs disarm nuclear warheads that are stationed in highly secure military silos, as well as ICBMs that have already been shot. (This happened, but I can't remember that witnesses name who tells this story, might be in this playlist.) Highly advanced civilizations do not want nuclear bombs going off because it damages the biosphere as well as supposedly other dimensions. Hopefully you aren't high while reading all this, haha!
