    <div class="md"><p>The Army Survival Guide is a good place to start. And then some reading on the effects of radiation, how long it lasts, how to counter it.</p>

<p>Then you start getting supplies. A three month food and water cache, and firearms are MOST critical for that first week. Most likely shit will be very surreal for the first 36 hours because people that aren&#39;t stupid will be INSIDE. INSIDE. INSIDE. INSIDE. If you go outside you will die a very painful death. Thankfully, all the retards will suffer from radiation poisoning fairly quickly. They will want to go outside and see whats up. Don&#39;t do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not buying it.</p>

<p>History has proven that the party in power will fear-monger to protect its grasp of power. Bush did it in 2004 as his campaign and the RNC warned of the dangers a shift in leadership could have on the Iraq war.</p>

<p>I believe the same thing is happening here. Obama and the Dems need Clinton. A Trump presidency means that all their diplomatic efforts would likely get flushed. Do you want an inexperienced individual leading our country especially while we are at the brink of nuclear war? Of course not. So vote for the establishment because while they may be crooked, they know how to play the game.</p>

<p>At least that is what I gather from this conflict and how we are being manipulated to think a certain way</p>

<p>Wow, they know how to play the game, but <em>for themselves</em>. Wake up. No corrupt official is going to fight for your rights. You basically just said you WANT to lie down. You know deep down that&#39;s not why you&#39;re here. Wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forget about nuclear, by the sounds of it, you&#39;d better slow down before you end it yourself.</p>

<p>If I were a bettin&#39; man, I&#39;d say large scale nuclear war will not be allowed to happen. Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYU_tr5K5ws&amp;amp;list=PLnrEt2fIdZ0ZPGO1Uc04AfI9aynSpZzS2">playlist</a> courtesy of SiriusDisclosure interviews. These are vetted, sworn in [most military] witnesses and cross referenced by multiple witnesses at the same event. Essentially, UFOs disarm nuclear warheads that are stationed in highly secure military silos, as well as ICBMs that have already been shot. (This happened, but I can&#39;t remember that witnesses name who tells this story, might be in this playlist.) Highly advanced civilizations do not want nuclear bombs going off because it damages the biosphere as well as supposedly other dimensions. Hopefully you aren&#39;t high while reading all this, haha! These video interviews revolves around Bentwaters, but there were hundreds of these incidents around the world during (and what likely ended) the Cold War.</p>

<p>Try disconnecting from this sub, I find it&#39;s quite addictive. On my first few visits, I was thinking, &quot;what the hell this sub is all about Hillary bashing. Sure she&#39;s a crook, but conspiracy is NOT all about one or two politicians&quot;. But over time I&#39;ve devoted way too much time commenting on Hillary threads. Websites are designed to be addictive, keep that in mind.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to tell you how to live of course, but blow and strippers are <em>probably</em> not helping your health or perspective on life. Download a meditation app and try that out in a park. Search out meditation benefits, gets into thickening of your neo-cortex, reinforcing higher level thinking, and dissolving fight or flight /basal/reptilian brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite, it was one witness that described a nuclear warhead that already launched via ICBM towards the end of the cold war. This is how close we came to the end, but ultimately, this was the last straw. We can not expect others to come and rescue us. However, going nuclear is just about the only thing ETs will step in, dematerialize and save our asses from our utter stupidity. Anyway, this witness described a UFO disc that flew around the nose of the ICBM (sorry, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile), fired three laser like pulses and the ICBM fell out of the sky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds crazy, but this is exactly why I believe a nuclear war wouldn&#39;t be allowed. They will not help us fight corruption until we do it ourselves, and they can&#39;t just come fix everything because that ruins the learning experience and consciousness expansion of our species. </p>

<p>Apparently nuclear weapons have consequences that go throughout the galaxy. My grandpa swears he saw a UFO hovering completely silently over some trees at night while he was driving. He went to the fire station to wake the people up and show them, by the time they got up and came out it was gone. </p>
