<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/2506098/Madeleine-McCann-Gerry-and-Kate-learn-of-Amsterdam-sighting.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/madeleinemccann/2506098/Madeleine-McCann-Gerry-and-Kate-learn-of-Amsterdam-sighting.html</a></p>

<p>I lived just a stonesthrow away from the party store where she was seen. This is the store
Dam Feestartikelen
Middenweg 40 - 42
1097 BP Amsterdam
Nederland</p>

<p>Now this is where it gets weird, last year I was walking with a friend in the hood and we saw a huge army truck and police on the same street, actually not only the same street but just across the street from the party store where she was seen,</p>

<p>Here is a translation of an article about it</p>

<p>Police on Tuesday a few hours of research done in and around a store to the Middle Way.
On Tuesday morning, a police container was at the height of number 33. Also there were several police cars in front of the building and screens were placed in the course of the morning. Later, the help of the army was also invoked at noon. In the past, the police enlisted the help of Defence when we were looking for hidden spaces.
Where there is in this specific case, research has been done is not known. According to a police spokesman, there is &quot;an ongoing investigation&quot;, it can be told more until next month.
<a href="http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/140191/politie_bezig_met_onderzoek_in_winkel_op_de_middenweg">http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/140191/politie_bezig_met_onderzoek_in_winkel_op_de_middenweg</a></p>

<p>Shitty translation but the key here. Is the part about the army being involved, and why they were involved, I had a look at what was found but there was not a lot execpt for something about a guy who has been missing Since 2010, who owned the house above a store, so if there was a hidden room then he owned the hidden room.</p>

<p>Here is the follow up article
<a href="http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/140243/onderzoek_middenweg_houdt_mogelijk_verband_met_oude_vermissingszaak">http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/140243/onderzoek_middenweg_houdt_mogelijk_verband_met_oude_vermissingszaak</a></p>

<p>A little bit from the article</p>

<p>Maurice Gerse disappeared in August 2010 suddenly from his home. We later found out that he was involved in shady deals and that he had debts. He would collect money from non-paying tenants.</p>

<p>Another article
<a href="http://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/politie-zocht-op-middenweg-naar-lichaam-maurice-gerse%7Ea3954373/">http://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/politie-zocht-op-middenweg-naar-lichaam-maurice-gerse~a3954373/</a></p>

<p>Now the police are saying that this is a huge mystery, he disappeared from his house.</p>

<p>Now here is something that you won&#39;t find on the news, 
There were rumours that the investigation was connected to human trafficking, 
Human trafficking is something that is definitly active in Amsterdam, the red light district needs its prostitutes and some are acquired in this way, so there is a sort of infrastructure in place. </p>

<p>But back to all this a simple timeline</p>

<p>-Mccann disappears</p>

<p>-Is seen in Amsterdam within a week later</p>

<p>-3 years later a man disappears without a trace from his own home just across the street </p>

<p>-5 years after him disappearing the police and army investigate looking for hidden rooms.</p>

<p>Now this man was into &quot;shady dealings&quot; and it looks like he was being investigated next to his disappearance.</p>

<p>Just a little bit about the area where this happened, it is east about half an hour from the city center, it is a quietish neighbourhood, and if McCann was anywhere in Amsterdam it fits to be around there, not a lot of cctv is very close to the highway and there is a parking garage less than 50m away. </p>

<p>In light of pizza gate it struck me all of a sudden and I made the connection between these 2 cases, there is just too much weird on both. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Op here, here is my theory</p>

<p>This man was involved in the ring, every country must have some form of ring run by these elite. He harboured Maddie, and her kidnappers, or illegal guardians. </p>

<p>Maddie is inconsolable, where is her mom and dad? Where is she? Who are these people? She cries and maybe even screams when she is with them, I have lived in this neighborhood and I know very well that these houses have very thin floors and walls.</p>

<p>They look out the window and see the party store, they bring her there to cheer her up. The woman sees her and maddie takes her probably single chance to ask someone if she knows where her parents are.</p>

<p>They see her talking to the shop assistant and whisk her away, never to be seen again.</p>

<p>Now this is why I think this man is involved, this is a man of low morals, in the end of his known life he had debts. To clear these debts he started collecting unpaid rent money from renters. when this does not meet the amount he needs, he thinks of another plan. He knows something that he could use for blackmailing the people he helped, now normally this wouldn&#39;t be possible, this man should not know who he is harbouring by name, he has no evidence, nothing. This has all changed with the huge media coverage over the years following.
He does not want justice, justice does not get his outstanding bills paid (be they legal or not). He tries to squeeze these people and they kill him for it. Helping these people must have huge payments, maybe enough to live off for a few years. That house and that neighbourhood is worth huge amounts of money. This man had a whole block, at age guess what 33 (this for once maybe coincidence?). </p>

<p>I checked for house sales in the same street close to number 33, 36 just across the street is on the market for 700.000+ euro&#39;s.  There are 3 floors to a building and each floor is one house or apartment. So this man had corrected to about 7 years ago paid at least 500.000 euro&#39;s for this house or was paying big money for rent. </p>

<p>the man had his own houses that he rented out. Probably in different neighbourhoods maybe not but if he can go around claiming rent he has to have quite the portfolio.</p>

<p>At age 33 sure it is possible he got all this with hard work, and I could be wrong but 3 years after a missing girl is seen he goes missing in his own house, which seemed to have a hidden room, that was investigated for 5 years after he disappeared, why? How did the police know to look? How did the police and the army think to look for this hidden room 5 years after he has disappeared. Did new info come to light? </p>
