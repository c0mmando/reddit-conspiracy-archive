What is the reason for that decline and what does it mean for the gold market?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The yellow metal was supposed to shine if Trump won</strong>. Instead, the price of gold declined about 9 percent from almost $1,340 reached during the election night. What happened? There are three main reasons (from the fundamental point of view) behind gold’s free fall. <strong>First, the uncertainty diminished</strong>, as the two of the worst fears of 2016 – Brexit and Trump’s victory – had already materialized, but the world had not collapsed. Actually, Brexit will be more gradual than thought, while Trump softened his style and started to act presidential. The reduced worries mean weaker safe-haven demand for gold.</p>

<p><strong>Second, the Fed is still going to hike in December</strong>, which casts a shadow over the gold market. The stock market rally after the elections removes the last possible excuse (i.e. the financial turmoil after the election) for the Fed not to raise interest rates at the next meeting. Indeed, the market odds of such a hawkish move in December are nearly 86 percent.</p>

<p><strong>Third, real interest rates increased, as one can see in the chart below</strong>. Investors are expecting that Trump’s fiscal stimulus will accelerate economic growth (and the fiscal deficit) – this is probably why bond yields rose. Higher nominal rates without accompanying inflation translated into <strong>higher real interest rates which are negative for gold, a non-interest bearing asset</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The above reasoning seems rational</em></p>

<p>The dollar index is extremely high. <a href="http://www.investing.com/quotes/us-dollar-index">http://www.investing.com/quotes/us-dollar-index</a></p>

<p>What are the prices of gold in other currencies compared to USD? <a href="http://www.kitco.com/gold_currency/index.html?currency=no&amp;amp;timePeriod=d&amp;amp;flag=gold&amp;amp;otherChart=hardCur">http://www.kitco.com/gold_currency/index.html?currency=no&amp;amp;timePeriod=d&amp;amp;flag=gold&amp;amp;otherChart=hardCur</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll preface this with, I&#39;m not a financial advisor and this is not advice and is just my opinion..</p>

<p>The gold market is divided into two markets, paper and physical. TPTB manipulate the paper markets to keep physical gold low, and the USD high. If the USD is high, the markets are good, if the USD is low, the markets crash. This is why fiat money is terrible. </p>

<p>If gold was at it&#39;s actual price, the USD would crash. So, who would be doing this, and what are smart people doing? Keeping the USD high, and physical gold low, in order to buy it at dirt low prices, with a powerful USD (China and Russia are doing this, in order to back their currency with physical gold - taking advantage of the West&#39;s stupidity). While simultaneously, continuing the illusion that the USD is strong. It&#39;s all smoke and mirrors, and yes Petro and OPEC come into play as well. </p>

<p>If I had the resources, I&#39;d be investing in <strong>physical</strong> gold, right now. Especially after a Trump victory (said this prior to the elections as well). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree with you, i know for 100% China is hoarding gold for a while now and keeping it quiet. China is now the biggest buyer and bought almost all major gold miners. I personally believe the actual gold price should be $1800-2000 USD on a normal US economy. I guess my butt hurts because i switched my stocks to gold and saw the reverse happening from what my logic told me. Soon i will find time and do a proper appraisal on gold price against USD. I started doing the math once and it was showing to go up to $5000 USD, so i stopped to rethink my algorithm because it seemed too inflated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And let me add that the algorithm i was using was the same they used before the dollar became a fiat (oil) currency. Its straight forward, logical, fair and easy to do a good historic calculation if you have time. But it was showing a huge price inflation i think, so now i will create my own and add more external factors and run them into an analytics simulator to create a million probabilities and study them to see what they show and if a pattern is exposed and how trustworthy it can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey come on, let me dream in my illusion of a free government a bit more :) personally i&#39;m not a huge government supporter, i think the most important is having police and fair court system. The big politics are creating more damage and hate than good. Governments should be small, with no noticeable power to overcome the people like we have now. Also, i believe the best trait of government that was used in ancient cultures, even when the democracy was discovered is no pay to politicians. Back then it was illegal and unethical to get paid if you were a politician. The salary was respect and fame and they were dependent on people to welcome them in their house and offer/donate food and necessities. That was the democracy those people created and had, not what we have now. Our politicians have salaries into millions of $. I might say on this that Trump not getting a salary makes him the only president ever coming close to that ideology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree. Not only pardon them but give them a metal and open acknowledgement, also reimburse them for what they went through. We used to be a nation seeing this people as heroes and now we hunt them down for treason. Treason to who? The government acting against the people? For Bernie i would rather not comment, he sold out, yes listen to what he has to say but no power to him. He supported the most undemocratic act and let a party take peoples right to vote away. What really turned me against him was supporting Hillary when that woman is everything he was fighting for. He really broke me, i let him go and i will never accept him back or give him the same respect. </p>
