    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree with you and my gut feeling tells me he never existed and is all a Roman or Jewish conspiracy of some sort.  Being from a Christian family and being told that if I do not believe in Jesus I am going to suffer forever has caused me to second guess myself too much on this subject. Both sides claim they have plenty of proof that he either did or did not exist depending on who you ask. Would you mind explaining how you came to the conclusion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Disclaimer: not disparaging religion, just offering my own experience) </p>

<p>For what its worth, i went to Christian school and i never &quot;felt&quot; religion the way others did. I saw only loopholes and hypocrisy, and mostly it made me uncomfortable; but still there was sense of fear in admitting i didnt believe.</p>

<p>This is how religion works. And its also why it continues to work. </p>

<p>If you choose religion because it makes you happy and gives you purpose, then thats awesome. If you choose religion for fear of being tortured for eternity because you defected, you are nothing more than a hostage.</p>

<p>Its an uncomfortable and nauseating feeling, at first. Once you accept the reasons you don&#39;t believe, and stop fearing the reasons why you do believe, you will feel liberated like you never have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a good look at the Last Supper sometime. Who&#39;s purported to be in the DaVinci painting? The 12 apostles. Obviously, right? It&#39;s a lie. The greatest lie ever propagated. Who is at the right hand of Jesus? Look closely. It&#39;s a woman. A mirror image of Jesus. Forming a perfect V - or chalice - fertility - between the two of them. Mary Magdalene was the lover of Jesus. She was not present in Golgotha for his crucifixion as the lie says. She instead was smuggled out of Judea altogether. And not alone. Have fun. </p>

I am familiar with the idea of the twelve apostles representing the signs of the zodiac etc. I am also aware of Jesus&#39;s similarties to other ancient &quot;gods&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>This might be a bit weird, but trying to put this into ordered thoughts its too much for me right now. We are genetic hybrids. Conscious beings can directly interact with the natural world through their genome by using sexuality in specific ways. This is apparent with other humans, but its important to note that you can interface with all living beings, even those lower on the evolutionary spiral. </p>

<p>So if we look towards the lower life forms, we can learn much. Single celled organisms like tardigrades have complex chromosomes and can survive all sorts of environments. The dna tells the cell how to construct itself. The cell then sends signals back to the dna. They are holographically linked together. Through the form of one, you can see the other. The form of your dna is related to the form of your body, and vice versa. If you imagine in your mind this link you can access it.</p>

<p>It takes a certain amount of humility and grace, as this is sacred ground. There must be some sort of natural intelligence that can understand the inner workings of cells. This is where we meet the kundalini shakti, this is the goddess that secretly guides mankind&#39;s evolution. A belief in inherent divinity and inspiration is a godsend for traversing such complex inner realities.</p>

<p>If you look at ancient idolatrous figures you notice they have human, animal, and spiritual characteristics. Ancient men were sorcerers. In these forms they encoded their own knowledge and beliefs of the world. To expand beyond human they looked to the natural world, and attempted to replicate it within themselves. Then they crafted molds so that others could easily put their minds into similar resonances. There is a certain danger though, in shifting into animal forms or mentalities. Molding your mental and emotional self into other forms is changes the way your dna expresses. The strands will fold differently to match the mental vibration you impart to them. This is why it is important to love yourself, in all your forms. Become more of yourself, follow what is natural to you. Its as simple as moving your arm into a mudra, these forms naturally open your body to the flow of etheric energy that suffuses the cosmos.</p>

<p>So the issue now becomes, if you are looking to expand and evolve, how can you evolve into a higher form of conscious life. Humans are very good at mimicking. I believe that this is a good way to go about it, but it misses the true essence of understanding. So another way is to have a teacher, one who can impart their wisdom and lead your soul towards love and understanding. My understanding is that the word of god, would be this perfect evolutionary language from the soul that imparts perfect understanding to the mind and body. When the mind knows the word of god, the body will also be as a body of light made from the thoughts of god. Yoga is how it links together. Yoga is union. When you perform yoga with the universe, you follow its intended design. The spiral revolves, and evolves, reaching ever farther, ever closer, ever bigger, ever smaller.</p>

<p>How do we find these teachers? They are all around us. The plants, animals, cells in our bodies, and also the stars. The pattern of our galaxy is a spiral, and so is that of the dna strand. It mirrors itself folded neatly together in a cute little chromosome. As the strand expresses more of itself, the inner mind can mirror or behold more of the the universe. We can learn to tap into the universal energy. Release the neural pathways from the more rigid ways of thinking. They are flexible, you can bend and morph them, and your perception will also bend. Open yourself to what lies within. Let the serpent uncoil from her long slumber. </p>

<p>You cannot grasp the mind. Right when you think it slips away. </p>

<p>I would say that this occurred by virtue of our being equipped with at least a <em>portion</em> of the genetics of those who create us.  I don’t believe they wanted us <em>too</em> smart, however, so I think the <em>other</em> portion of our genetics came from sources that were quite a bit less evolved.  If you combine this genetic manipulation with the vast and ubiquitous amounts of MSM brainwashing that exists in this civilization - a brainwashing that forces us constantly toward closed mindedness and toward thinking very much <em>inside</em> the box of a normalcy and limitation - one can then readily sees how it is that this species, the human/homo sapien sapien species, is both commendably intelligent (via the “smarter” half of our genetic ancestry), yet considerably retarded in its development (via the less intelligent half combined with the MSM brainwashing).</p>

<p>We as a species have nowhere <em>near</em> reached our potential.  We are kept back by covert forces existing on this planet making sure that we cannot move <em>too</em> far forward.</p>

<p>The biblical Tower Of Babel story rings quite prophetically even today.  We are not allowed to go <em>too</em> far.</p>

<p>It is ultimately no less cruel than we ourselves are to all the myriad of species that we’ve created and genetically manipulated.  Imagine how they think and feel about us.  Imagine how we are looked upon by the average cow or sheep…or even dog or cat for that matter.</p>

<p>This is not by any means to excuse the cruelty of one type of genetic manipulation because it’s done/exercised by another, but it is to help one see that just as we have created and genetically manipulated many different species for our own benefit…well, there is a lot of data indicating that we ourselves are a genetically-manipulated creation in the same vein.</p>

<p>So yeah.  Sounds like a cruel creator to me…but people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones…and we humans live in an <em>extreeemely</em> fragile glass house.</p>

<p>They do.  They know a <em>loooot</em> more than many of us do.  They may not be anything more than “important underlings” to the <em>true</em> PTB, but many know a lot more than the average serf.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because they’re not the true PTB.  There are powers and forces far above them that they themselves are beholden to.</p>

<p>We take for granted how weak and powerless we are - we human beings.  We don’t understand just how many powerful forces are in this universe, and on this very planet alone.  There are forces that are so powerful that the beings we look at and consider formidable are but dust balls in comparison.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There’s a lot of evidence showing that it’s a <em>lot</em> more than that alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So where do Yahweh, Lucifer and Satan fit in to this in your opinion? My current research has pointed me to the Gnostic held belief in the demiurge. If I understand correctly, they believe that the creator God (Yahweh) is imperfect. As far as I can tell the story then says Lucifer came to Earth to enlighten and free humans spiritually.  Does this idea hold any weight according to your beliefs? Also earlier you stated that you would &quot;not agree one bit&quot; that tptb might know something more than the average person when I stated I think they do since there is such an active cover up of information that could free humans spiritually. If you don&#39;t believe they know something more than are you saying you think an outside force is the only thing working to cover up the truth? To perhaps keep us enslaved for their own personal gain? </p>

<p>As far as I have been able to asses, they are the names given to some ETs that have come here at one time or the other and had great influence upon humans and human civilization.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As far as some of the research I’ve done is concerned, there was a group of ETs that created humans as a slave to do work they were themselves unwilling to do, and to keep the slaves in line, a fable was created to get the slaves to fear the king ET (who looked upon the slaves as little more than dirt) and fear/hate his older brother (who was comparatively benevolent to the slaves and tried to help them here and there).</p>

<p>I thought I said the <em>opposite</em> of that.  TPTB on this planet <em>do</em> know much more than the average person.  I would not <em>DIS</em>agree one bit that TPTB know more than the average person is what I believe I said.</p>

<p>[looking at my previous comment]</p>

<p>Ha.  I’m a fucking idiot.  I just looked at what I said:</p>

<p>You’re right!  I did say “I would not agree with this one bit, sir.”</p>

<p>lol.  Dur.  Again, I’m a moron.  Simple typo is what happened there.  I meant I would not DISAGREE with this one bit, sir.  Sorry for the confusion there.</p>

<p>TPTB know a <em>lot</em> more than the average person.  The knowledge is stratified and relative though, and just because there are ptb on this planet that know a lot more than the citizenry, many of these ptb here are themselves quite in the dark as compared to even greater powers than they.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually not very familiar with the holy grail.  Seems very abstract according to this definition:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail">Different versions describe it as a vessel, dish, or stone with miraculous powers providing happiness, eternal youth or food in infinite abundance.</a></p>
