        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A: They&#39;re all part of the same cosmic conspiracy to deceive humanity, with the ultimate goal of installing an all-powerful world dictator.  Every single conspiracy theory with any legitimacy is connected, forming a massive system of compartmentalization that prevents any one group of actors from putting the whole picture together.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on a years&#39;-long journey looking into what I call <strong><em>The Pattern</em></strong>, and wading through endless hours of disinformation leaves me with no other conclusion.  I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrnxDhVL3ds">this video</a> today and thought I&#39;d share.  Since I get frustrated just watching a whole video with no context, I parsed it out for you -- and included a small number of external resources, into which anyone can go deeper.</p>

<p>But be warned -- those of you who&#39;ve not yet &quot;awakened&quot; need to understand that seeing the truth of the world for what it really is has very real psychological consequences.  It shatters your world-view, and recovery takes a while.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Regarding the transhumanism aspect -- this literally just hit the front page of Drudge: <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-gene-editing-tested-in-a-person-for-the-first-time-1.20988">CRISPR gene-editing tested in a person for the first time</a>.

<p>The audio comes to an abrupt end at <a href="https://youtu.be/WrnxDhVL3ds?t=53m13s">53:13</a> just as Dr. Broer starts discussing a Hollywood movie that contained a certain frequency that cause people to kill each other.

    <div class="md"><p>Please, for the love of all that is holy, don&#39;t ever believe in evil aliens that want to kill, experiment or exterminate you. This terrible lie has been perpetuated since the War of the Worlds radio event, and throughout television and movies continuously.</p>

<p>If a global civilization is advanced enough to travel light years to visit, they do not need us for their own experimentation, and they have most likely learned how to be a &quot;global civilization&quot; on their own planet, thus non-violent. </p>

<p>This perpetuated fear is important in case they want to pull that &quot;alien invasion&quot; card, since human terrorism isn&#39;t working out. Don&#39;t buy it.</p>

<p>Of course, Steven Greer says that they&#39;ve cloned aliens at various military bases that could be unleashed on the population. If that ever happens, shoot the fuckers if they won&#39;t sit for tea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While your point is largely correct and with great merit to convey, I find it inaccurate.  There are benevolent and malevolent beings on Earth and extraterrestrially.  The resource that the malevolent beings are interested in is life force energy.  They can absorb it and harvest it when life enters states of fear or suffering.  </p>

<p>This behavior has a lot of basis in myths and the stories that are told in modern times about ET phenomena.  This is the purpose of sacrifice rituals.  There is too much evidence for this energy feeding behavior for me to deny it exists.  I can&#39;t prove the existence of ET beings that feed on it though.</p>

<p>The energy is generated as life enters emotional states based on love, which can be simply joy, relationships with others, witnessing beauty, expressing gratitude, giving to others, and appreciation.  It is radiated when life enters states of emotion based on fear, which can be fear of lack, jealousy, anger, hatred, blame, judgement, etc.</p>

<p>To absorb the energy, one has to be in an emotional state based on fear.  These malevolent ETs are virtually always in a state of fear and live in miserable hierarchies of abuse and control by fear.  As such, their state of being facilitates this energy transfer.  We can&#39;t observe them, but we can see this happening to human beings.</p>

<p>The saying misery loves company is an expression of this energy transfer.  The miserable person is in a state of emotional drain, perhaps depressed from repeated frustration with a negative situation they cannot fix, or another emotional state based on fear.  When they observe another entering a fear based state, they get high on it.  THIS IS WHY they do.  They recover some of their own spiritual energy in that event.</p>

<p>Also, truth seekers can do this without realizing it.  As we try to convey the nasty truth of the world to others, we are in a state of fear.  It doesn&#39;t have to be intense to be an emotional state of fear.  When the one we are trying to inform enters a state of fear, due to seriously considering the information we are telling them, they begin to radiate some of their stored spiritual energy.  We can get a little buzz off of it in that very moment it occurs.  I&#39;m ashamed to admit I&#39;ve done it.  I&#39;ve also seen it happen to me from others.  They immediately smiled as soon as I started feeling fear from the beliefs they were sharing.</p>

<p>This energy transfer is hidden from us, because our planet is controlled by parasites that feed on us in this way.  They engineer events that cause trauma, fear and suffering, largely through the temptation or direct cooperation with humans on Earth.  This way they can remain hidden and therefore less resisted as they take a little of our energy for themselves.  There is a supposed hostage situation with these beings, keeping them from being evicted by the more benevolent ETs that also visit us.  These parasitic ETs don&#39;t want us to have open contact, because the benevolent ETs will tell us all about these energy harvesting dynamics and the beings that stand to gain from them.  We&#39;ve been told many times about it nonetheless, but as we can see from the lifetimes of video footage, photos, and (group) witness accounts, the truth can be told to us yet hidden in plane sight.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to believe in this crap either, but it just explains far too much of why the world is in the state that it is in.  It profits these parasites that work with and reward key elites to maintain access to this energy harvesting.  This is why there are rituals of abuse, suffering and fear associated with them.  It&#39;s payment, an exchange, to help them maintain their own power over us for their own parasitic benefit.  Think of it as a networking of like minded aspirations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk because we already have been abandoning the use of cash and more conventional forms of money. We have credit cards. Our phones can make transactions with our accounts. Already it is possible to implant chips for specific functions (not financial that I can think of). But, certainly for identity, like our pets. I suspect it will be driven by the excuse for security and identity.  If there is no money, there would be total dependence on this identity system to access our funds. So here is where the 666 comes in, because it somehow will reflect or incorporate this number. I have theorized it may be a series of 3 numbers with 6 digits each that identify each person on earth.  Not too familiar with Bitcoin other than know it exists, so. Not sure how it would fit in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The intended purpose of religion is to divide us from God.  God is in ALL things.  God is in you, me, all the posters on this forum, even the paid shills, the most benevolent ETs, the perceived demons, dung beetles and the smelly bacteria in our asses.  Yes, ALL of it.</p>

<p>Religion makes us fear punishment for considering the idea that God is in all things.  Religions inhibit our ability to contemplate it by employing fear, of blasphemy and damnation, because they are mental and spiritual control systems.  They were made by slave seeking parasites that seek to be our masters.  It&#39;s pretty clear when one looks at all of it from the third person perspective.</p>

<p>When we know we are also God, we don&#39;t need to look outside for a master to tell us what to believe, think, feel and do.  We instead look inside for the truth and decide either to live by the truth that we know or not.  If we choose to do so, we become benevolent beings without external control.  This is what religions teach us is impossible, yet there are so many atheists that prove this way is actually even more spiritually, emotionally and socially functional than religious belief.</p>

<p>God allows these charlatans to fool us, because as we push them away, we become far far far more interesting dividuations of consciousness to even ourselves, don&#39;t we?  We have more original thought and self-direction.  We have more insight and confidence.  We are our own leaders, as opposed to a swath of needy, willfully ignorant followers.  </p>

<p>God allows us to choose to work toward owning and controlling our own selves or to be repeatedly punished by those who seek slaves, as religion does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your opinion, although well thought out, does not carry any authority. God has shown great signs to show His authority and power are real. The resurrection of Jesus, being a recent one. Prophecies foretold thousands of years ago are now being fulfilled and will be fulfilled in the next years. Want proof?  Learn about them, then watch. </p>

<p>You are right about religion because God is not equal to a religion. He is a personal God that interacts and reveals Himself. His Word is perfect, though it be abused and misused by evil men. If you seek Him with your whole heart, He promises to allow you to find Him. He does not punish, instead He took our punishment for us. He will give forgiveness of our sins on based on this sacrifice-- His death on the cross. </p>

<p>He does want slaves. Slaves of love. Slaves that choose Him because He is worthy of our love and lives. </p>

<p>But you are deceived to think man can &quot;control our own selves&quot;.  We either free ourselves from sin and serve God, or remain in sin&#39;s control and serve evil. It is satan&#39;s lie to have humans believe otherwise. </p>

<p>We do not get to &quot;make our own God&quot; and decide what He is like. He has revealed Himself and the Bible has His disclosures. So test and verify its authenticity or not. That is your choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it isn&#39;t. The Bible has some real truth in it, but that does not mean it is all truth. This is a fallacy. If I told you the grass is green and you are my slave, does it mean that you are my slave, or does it mean that I told you one truth and one lie?</p>

<p>The Bible said the earth is flat. The Bible said women are second class creations next to man. The Bible condones slavery.</p>

<p>Heck, to believe any authority without question, as some believe the Bible, is mental and spiritual slavery. We should consider evidence as our only true authority, and all the middlemen, the perceived authority figures, simply as middlemen. We should recognize we are trusting them and in doing so are inviting corruption of our belief systems. How do they know what they know? If it&#39;s from evidence, let them show us the evidence. If it&#39;s deception, they won&#39;t be able to. We should never trust authority, we should simply cite claims from authority to the authority in <em>consideration</em> of their claims. </p>

<p>I went from Catholic to atheist to agnostic to a belief system that constantly changes based on how I understand the world. The latter is spirituality. Anyone can do it, even if they don&#39;t believe in God. </p>

<p>God is inside us. Those supposed fallen angels are simply instances of God&#39;s awareness just like we are. They have consciousness inside like us as well as the supposed angels. We, and other intelligent life become fallen angels or angels over time  as we decide what we value. </p>

<p>If we tend toward selfishness, competition, deception, slavery for others, corruption of others, we are on the path to become like the supposed fallen angels. It&#39;s a path of service to the self even at the expense of others. It&#39;s a path of imbalance within a given structure of consciousness being that erodes and destroys consciousness and the structure it resides in. </p>

<p>If we tend toward selflessness, cooperation, speaking the truth even when inconvenient, freedom for others, healing for others, we are on the path to become like the supposed angels. It&#39;s a path of serving others, even if it comes at the expense of the self. It is a path of balance within a given structure of consciousness being that supports and compliments consciousness and the structure it resides in. </p>

<p>The main difference between angels and fallen angels is whether or not they choose to be producers of value for consciousness or parasites on the value already produced by consciousness, useless eaters. Both groups tend to gravitate toward their own likeness for the utility of working toward common goals.</p>

<p>The Bible, the Torah, and the Koran are ALL manifestations of fallen angels attempting to install mind control viruses into our cultures. They compel us to blindly believe what we are told from perceived divine authority, to feel self-righteousness in the propagation of our own belief systems, and to create conflict with the other belief systems or more generally. There is a good reason for that. </p>

<p>The great mystery of the fallen angels is touched upon with this question. Why do they apparently enjoy creating suffering? Life makes energy that affects consciousness, often called life force energy, sometimes called loosh. When life enjoys existence, through love based emotional states, it generates this energy of spirit. It makes spirit more able and willing to animate matter. This energy is essentially a stored representation of the value of existence, enjoyment for consciousness. As life enters states of suffering and/or fear based emotional states, it begins to radiate this energy. The supposed fallen angels learned how to harvest this energy like spiritual parasites. </p>

<p>They have entire planets of slaves that suffer and fear in order to generate this energy. They keep them in darkness, ignorance, and tempt them to harm each other. That way they can harvest the energy without revealing the nature of the situation, which increases resistance to situations that allow harvest. Earth is presently such a planet. </p>

<p>The biggest lie is that God is found outside, as some entity you have to blindly trust or else you will be punished. These 3 awful religions all tell us that. They insist to believe we are God is blasphemous and thus merits punishment and thus fear. Yet, Jesus tells us we are all children of God, can do all the miracles he did and more, and that  whatsoever we do to the least of his people we do unto him. Jesus supports this oneness of consciousness perspective and believing it immunizes the mind against these engineered mind control system viruses. Jesus was an aberration from the usual subservience content of the Bible, apparent if one reads the Bible with critical thought. </p>

<p>To reach outside to God invites the ring leader of the fallen angels to deceive you with plausible sounding deception designed to maintain your subservient mindset. Lucifer, the imposter God, the God of the Bible, who calls himself the Lord, <em>your</em> God, engineered these religions precisely to gain our loyalty through this core deception. When we reject it and become our own masters, as God clearly wants (requires long winded explanation), we see this arrangement as insidious corruption. Instead of searching for a master outside to obey, we simply must find the truth and choose to behave as compliments to the world around us in alignment with the truth. Self-deception is a very real problem and it is caused by fear of the real or illusory consequences of compliance with the truth we know. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t need a master to behave. That we do is a deception of Lucifer. If you follow his and his minions behavior patterns, you make a very good case for it. He temps us with thought insertions that appear to be our own thoughts. He sets us up with lack, trauma, fear, guilt and shame, to act out in harm toward others. Then after we die, due to the priming done on us by his prolific mind control belief systems, we consent to torment on the other side and/or insertion into subsequent lives with a poor quality of life. The sell is done by playing on our failings in life, that he set us up for. The next life sets us up again. To be believable, reward for good behavior also is given. It helps us recover our spiritual energy for harvest anyway. Farmers are OK with their cows grazing on good grass. They just want maximum production of product, in this case energy given off during suffering or fear based emotional states. Without joy as well, we&#39;d be as useless as his dark minions for generating this energy. </p>

<p>This system is a masterful deception and spiritual energy farming operation. The myth of Lucifer is that he seeks to become God. It is partially true. He seeks to maintain control over souls, dividuations of God&#39;s consciousness, through deception and consent so that he can extract the value of existence, the enjoyment of consciousness, all within the bounds of what some would consider free will. Playing on ignorance is considered acceptable by the corrupt divine, but would put earthlings in jail. Am I morally acceptable if I trick children or the mentally retarded into committing harm against others? Why do these divine beings tolerate it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They gain amusement by watching this morbid play of slavery, joy destruction, conflict, struggle and overcoming. It&#39;s the same reason why we love to go to the movies. We don&#39;t go to watch a peaceful expression of joy and harmony. We like to live that way though, don&#39;t we? So do these overseer beings. When we go to the movies, we go to see an epic conflict played out. The draw is the same for these corrupted divine beings allowing this consciousness play. They justify it in their minds..</p>

<p>They say, people will eventually figure out the mind slavery and when they do they&#39;ll effectively, but plausibly deniably, stand in between them and Lucifer, the imposter God. They also know that this all was consented to and allowed in order to create an experience where the subjects don&#39;t know their divine origins, for greater variety of possibilities to be discovered. This is called the experience of separation and is spoken of a lot by new agers. It is unjust and these observers profit from our suffering like the fallen angels do, but they feel as if they are more moral by knowing the history of our souls&#39; consent, seeing that there is a way out and not directly torturing our consciousness, but rather enjoying it by proxy through the fallen angels machinations playing out on mankind.</p>

<p>They, like the fallen angels, have become sick from parasitic relationships in the oneness of consciousness, diminishing others to enhance themselves. They see themselves as benevolent, but they deceive themselves. Supposedly this illusion is coming to an end, but I doubt it. Parasites stand too much to gain from continuing it and too much to lose by ending it and they are in charge of ending it. They will find any and all excuses to keep molesting the weak and young for personal gratification. The best we can do is live in integrity to such a degree to cause dissention in their ranks to foment a change in policy. </p>

<p>They bank on the free will aspect of all of this as making it OK. Yet, observation will show one that traumatic experience create fear. Fear creates maladaptive behaviors that cause others&#39; traumas and fears, creating a cycle of slavery and torment where people act out in their corrupted state, inviting more corruption and torment. </p>

<p>Every dark being you or I have ever seen is playing out traumas. In children and animals it&#39;s clear. Treat a dog like crap and it becomes a nasty, mean dog people prefer to stay away from. Abused children are less happy and more dysfunctional. The false light and these overseer beings that enjoy the spectacle of our suffering deliberately ignore this behavior pattern. Why? If they fully acknowledge and accept it as truth, it delegitimizes their self-serving game. They&#39;ll be compelled to end it or embrace the path of spiritual self-destruction that the supposed fallen angels do. </p>

<p>One thing that may confuse people is the fallability of these beings. It&#39;s the label divine. We are all divine beings, these beings just <em>know</em> it rather than consider it like we do in our ignorance. We are expressing residual beliefs from these religion based mind control systems. These beings are not supernatural. They are as natural as you or I, but perhaps millions to billions of years old with the wisdom, understanding and technical abilities that come with it. They are ETs, not really angels. They are said to descend from heaven. Heaven or the heavens is simply the cosmos. This is the source of our myths. Hell is simply a place where too many spiritual parasites reside. No matter how good other aspects of the environment may be, living with parasitic intelligences is a form of hell. And damnation could simply be being placed with other parasites, as a form of quarantine of a toxic way of belief, thought, feeling and behavior, the path of the supposed fallen angels. </p>

<p>While being alone with benevolent people seems like a reward, being alone with parasites is the opposite. They want to feed on hosts, which become the weakest beings that are available nearby, for spiritual energy, which is harvested by scaring others and causing suffering. So, ironically, the harsh damnation of parasites is like a vacation sanctuary for the benevolent. This exemplifies the problem that parasites pose for the consciousness of God in beings. </p>

<p>The fallen angels are several different races. The most common resemble greys and reptilians. The are driven by survival, greed and fear. They are minions of a technology augmented superbeing that has qualities we ascribe to God, virtual omnipotence, virtual omnipresence and virtual omniscience, all through virtually invisible nodes of technological surveillance, storage and processing power used effectively to emulate God for our minds. Liars fail due to insufficient memory or their previous lies and the ones they lied to, but not such a computer augmented superbeing a hive of minions. The database largely fixes that problem. This being and its minions covertly interact with all of us. Yet, those that know more are targeted differently, where the old deceptions fall off and the supposed fallen angels that serve it more directly harass the individual. This all is still done within a concept of free will obeyed due to the fear of these older, more powerful overseeing extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>The light™ and dark are both controlled by Lucifer too. The dark is simply his direct minions. They know their master is a spiritual energy feeding superbeing and they serve it out of fear and promise of reward, selfishness. They get their cut of the energy too. The light, on the other hand, serve Lucifer through corrupted belief systems that taught them to reach out to God for instructions. This is why the light is in supposed communion with the One, with Source, with God or whatever name Lucifer is currently using for control purposes, yet the light™ can never seem to be able to completely remove the dark beings from molesting others.</p>

<p>If they removed the dark beings, where would the farm hands be to harvest the loosh, the spiritual energy, through temptation, corruption and belief systems? The light is there is heal the cattle, to give them hope and ineffective strategies that just regenerate spiritual energy without ever freeing them from this system of energy harvest. They are to help us become light™ slaves of Lucifer and if they fail, their fellow employees, the dark, will up the harassment and trauma creation to make us more dark and thus more susceptible to believing that we deserve damnation. Either way we go, we serve the farming of spiritual energy for this superbeing and the amusement of these parasitic overseers.</p>

<p>The third (there are perhaps others) path is to stand on your own two intellectual, spiritual, and moral feet. It is to rely on your own understanding, rejecting the unbacked claims of all authority. It is to incessantly assert, in your beliefs, thoughts, feelings and actions, that you are a sovereign being of God, equal to any other dividuation of God, not a slave or a servant of any master other than yourself, while maintaining your alignment with the truth as you understand it. This path is closer to the light than the dark, but it is much more functional to the integrity and existential enjoyment of consciousness, because it has solutions rather than strategies of perpetuation of abusive relationships.</p>

<p>This third way mimics the light when it comes to interaction with good beings. It is to reflect their benevolent behavior with your own benevolent behavior. You can also choose to give benevolent behavior even if it is not a reflection. That can start chain reactions of benevolent behavior. The real difference comes in relation to the dark.</p>

<p>The light has subservience strategies based on fear of punishment from the dark (often threats of destruction of loved beings/things or war) or the warnings of their god Lucifer, who they think is Source. It is to do nothing effective to marginalize or eliminate the perpetuation of abuse. This third way is instead, reflective. When beings choose to be parasites, this third way, based on knowledge derived from experience and observation of behavior in reality, compels one to limit or end their freedom in proportion to the harm they are intentionally creating for others. </p>

<p>This is a natural reaction that adults, children and even animals exhibit, that the light informs us is wrong. Of course, the reflective behavior is ripe for the highly intelligent dark to manipulate us to get what it wants and it does often, but done properly, with enough wisdom and power, it actually solves the problem. Think of good police work. The criminals always have to be coerced and imprisoned or they continue with their crime. The light would have us ignore these spirit energy harvesting farm hands and focus on being more devoid of this proper reaction to disease.</p>

<p>Our bodies are another example of what the light tells us not to do. Our bodies identify, target and <em>kill</em> parasitic beings in order to preserve the health of our system. If our bodies falter in this killing, we become sick, feeding parasitic organisms, essentially useless eaters, and may even die. The light generally refuses to think about or discuss this. The reason, again, is that their god is Lucifer. If they would just stop looking to him for instructions and start looking within, as the less corrupted benevolent visior beings instruct us to do, they could become this third way far more quickly and easily that the dark ever could. They could end the corruption and tyranny too. Our galaxy is said to be enthralled to Lucifer. We are not the only dupes giving it spiritual energy and utility for the same. Those that exhibit this third way are the greatest threat to Lucifer&#39;s continued power over others, not the light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a massive post to refute this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bible said the earth is flat. The Bible said women are second class creations next to man. The Bible condones slavery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what it really boils down to is that you need to read the Bible for yourself, and understand what it says about these topics.  The Hebrew laws on slavery, during a period where open slavery was commonly accepted, were very clear that slaves were to be treated as adopted members of the house.  And Paul, whose letters are most often used to support the &quot;Bible condones slavery&quot; argument, was actually an abolitionist -- the ideas in his letters got the ball rolling on ending the institution of slavery in the ancient world.</p>

<p>The Bible clearly says men and women were created in the divine image of God.  After the fall, it acknowledges the physiological differences between the sexes, while clearly instructing how those differences influence the roles each should play.  And yes, women are to submit unto their husbands -- and respect them.  But men are to love, cherish, nurture, and lay down their lives for their wives as Christ did for the church.  There absolutely no subjugation in play -- but advice with which modern psychology and family counseling is beginning catch up.</p>

<p>The &quot;flat earth&quot; thing baffles me.  There are colloquial references to the &quot;four corners of the earth,&quot; and phenomenological wording such as <em>sunrise</em>, <em>sunset</em>, and <em>movement of the stars</em> (still in use today, by the way), but Job clearly shows that the Earth is suspended in space and is round, while the same concept shows up in many other verses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is. 40:22 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in...</li>
<li>Job 26:10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</li>
<li>Prov. 8:27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth...</li>
</ul>

<p>The Hebrew word for <em>circle</em> and <em>compass</em> is חוּג (<em>chuwg</em>), which, according to Genensuis&#39; Hebrew-Chaldee Lexicon, means:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a circle, sphere, used of the arch or vault of the sky</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your other allegations concerning the Christian concept of God are ones with which I strongly disagree, but I was never Catholic, so perhaps our formative world views are very different.  </p>

<p>However, the rest of your post is interesting, and I find myself in agreement for the large part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible touches on subjects you mention but you actually have it completely wrong. Your grass slave question is a terrible example because obviously I can determine myself the answers to those because of my human intelligence. The Bible is the truth because I have examined it and am fully convinced that it is indeed the word of God and it by far exceeds anything man has tried to explain to me. You arent the first person who has tried to destroy my faith,  you won&#39;t be the last. I mean seriously,  the peace that God has given me is no joke, but sadly many people won&#39;t ever find out for themselves,  they only know what non believers say. The Bible is complete truth.

    <div class="md"><p>The difference between spirituality and religion is the acceptance of the distorted belief protocol of dogma, or more verbosely, belief derived from perceived authority. Trusting authority for one&#39;s beliefs is not a protocol with integrity, because it invites corruption of one&#39;s belief system from deception by beings that serve themselves even at the expense of others.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that to believe in a creator, a higher mind, or something beyond material existence, does not <em>require</em> the belief in any dogma whatsoever. One should be mindful of those that attempt to attach mental shackles to belief in more than what is seen, they seek to become your masters. Know them by the fruit they bear. </p>

And it&#39;s exactly that,  by our minds we do not simply create any new levels on creation, we are simply here out if what we are able.

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible is a difficult book. Knowing context, history, characters, culture of the time all can impact how a passage can be interpreted. There are many books now available that expand on these aspects that are not difficult to find.  The passages regarding prophecy have been deliberated over by several and produce similar &quot;timelines&quot; and events. The events are difficult to decipher completely since they describe things beyond the author&#39;s time. It is truly fascinating and vindication seems very close. </p>

<p>Jesus is definitely real and He is only human who rose from the dead to and lives forever. Buddhism does describe natural truths. But Buddha does not claim to be God and did not die to save us as Jesus proclaims and offers to do. </p>

<p>These Satanists do nothing but make God and Jesus more real. They are the victors over him and he well knows it. </p>

<p>To some he is no more real than Santa, the Tooth Fairy or Superman.  You&#39;re questioning the validity of portions of the bible. I&#39;m saying to take it an extra step and question the validity of it all. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>We aren&#39;t talking about our spiritual beings being real, however. You were saying that trying to find the literal truth in the bible is a diversion. If that is the case, why are you accepting the literal truth of Jesus being <em>real</em>? Being a spiritual being with a human experience means nothing if that spiritual being is not <em>real</em>. If Jesus is in the bible (doesn&#39;t matter if you have a Textus Receptus Major, Vulgate, Septuagint, etc) saying <em>he</em> is the <strong>only</strong> way, in a literal sense, then it doesn&#39;t line up with what you&#39;re saying. </p>

<p>And even if you take the fragments statement, and apply that to Jesus and say it&#39;s a matter of syncretism, that he is a combo of Mithra, Osiris, Tammuz, etc, then it still doesn&#39;t make him <em>real</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he specifically said he is the way and that no man can come to the father except through him so that is clearly one way. And when he told the Jews &quot;Before Abraham was, I am&quot; he wasn&#39;t talking about meditation. He was making a proclamation, they knew exactly what he was saying and they tried to stone him on the spot for it.</p>

<p>And &quot;christhood&quot; or christ or messiah or mashiach simply means &quot;annointed.&quot; So no, it isn&#39;t an achievement of &quot;christhood&quot; he was clearly making the claim that he was the messiah, that he was God and existed <em>before</em> Abraham.

    <div class="md"><p>There are many other places where Jesus talks about this, and it may be more clear what He intends to say. Why would He be meditating when he is talking to His disciples?  </p>

<p>You are right, the epistles, Acts and Paul&#39;s letters were written first, and closest to the time after the resurrection. You can refer to the Wallace book I mentioned, it is very well cited. </p>

<p>Here is Jesus quoted in the gospel of John:<br/>
John 12:44-50
A Summary of Jesus Mission
44 Then Jesus cried out, 
The one who believes in Me, 
believes not in Me, but in Him who sent Me. 
45 And the one who sees Me 
sees Him who sent Me. 
46 I have come as a light into the world, 
so that everyone who believes in Me 
would not remain in darkness. 
47 If anyone hears My words and doesnt keep them, 
I do not judge him; 
for I did not come to judge the world
 but to save the world. 
48 The one who rejects Me 
and doesnt accept My sayings 
has this as his judge: 
The word I have spoken will judge him on the last day. 
49 For I have not spoken on My own, 
but the Father Himself who sent Me 
has given Me a command as to what I should say 
and what I should speak. 
50 I know that His command is eternal life. 
So the things that I speak, 
I speak just as the Father has told Me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can study how the Bible was compiled. It was written from first hand witness accounts from the disciples close to Jesus who shared His history, teachings and sayings. There&#39;s a book I read by a retired cop who went back and traced all the accounts &amp; writers, citing sources way back to those times. The Old Testament was orally passed down very painstakingly, then transcribed in the same manner. The Dead Sea scrolls were very valuable in proving these transcriptions were accurate from very early times.  So, we have good reason to believe the Bible is pretty accurate, actually.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, no. Translating the bible isn&#39;t like a game of telephone where everything gets misunderstood more and more each time. It&#39;s a series of ancient manuscripts which are being directly translated from the earliest available documents. Also, you understand the bible is actually a collection of books put in one and not by a single author? Multiple authors written over many years and compiled over time. More effort has been put into accurately translating the original manuscripts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, than any other historical document. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You literally don&#39;t understand what the bible is, then. The bible is not a book with chapters. They aren&#39;t in chronological order. Each thing you&#39;re calling a &quot;chapter&quot; is a <em>book</em>. Book of Genesis is the first one. The Psalms are a collection of songs, many of which were written by King David. There are the gospels which are the <em>books</em> of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. There are epistles which are collections of letters written from an apostle to other churches. The completely different writing style alone is enough evidence that there are many authors. The bible is not a single book, at least not the way you&#39;re understanding it. It&#39;s more like an encyclopedia or anthology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is historically understood that the earliest books, likely Genesis or Job, were written around 1500 BC and the most recent book, Revelation, was written in AD 90. That&#39;s a 1500 year span. There were 400 years between the Old and New Testament. These are facts which can be backed up by comparing other documents and artifacts from similar times, regardless of if you believe the bible or not. And yes, you too can believe whatever you want, but you would be wise to consider the truth of the bible for yourself without dismissing it because someone told you it was fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love posts like these. Thank you for for doing this, because I can see it was a lot of work. One doesn&#39;t have to believe it all but can pick and choose what to adopt, and what to discard. </p>

<p>I have a different interpretation of the spirituality surrounding abortions. I don&#39;t see the &quot;life&quot; as tribute to negative entities. In many cases I don&#39;t think the bundle of cells have incarnated enough to possess that spark of divinity, but perhaps with late term abortions it has... and that&#39;s deeply sad.</p>

<p>I think we make contracts to come forth from the ether into this world, and we do so at staggering times with others from our soul group. If the entity manifesting itself backs out for whatever reason, it&#39;s a miscarriage. If the person already on earth backs out, it&#39;s an abortion. </p>

<p>There are always those who will accept whatever a charismatic individual claims.</p>

<p>Take L Ron Hubbard for example. His fanciful writings spawned a new religion. Hundreds of thousands of people are true believers in the Church of Scientology. His belief system is complete with a form of the origin of our species here on Earth.</p>

<p>Scientology is nothing like the Bible yet both exist independent of each other. Members of each belief are absolutely convinced that their version of the truth is the one that is correct.</p>

And human sacrifice? Do you mind if I send you a couple of images? A couple are NSFW and I don&#39;t want to derail your thread by promoting the comic.

<p>It&#39;s a subject closed to all but a select few across the globe.  I have an active TS//SCI and various NATO clearances, and it&#39;s a brick wall to me.  But I can&#39;t deny the reality of what&#39;s happening around the world, either.  Nor can I deny the official government historical documents that have been released on the subject.  So its real, but it seems that it&#39;s either very tightly controlled information, or even those &quot;in-the-know&quot; in the government are as puzzled as everyone else.</p>

<p>The Vedas and Vimanas from the Hindu texts play into this too.  It&#39;s just that trying to pull it all together in a single post is pretty impractical.</p>

<p>The Vimanas almost certainly align in the Biblical timeline as antediluvian technology resulting from the information disseminated by the fallen angels and their Nephilim offspring.  The apocryphal Book of Enoch contains more information on the subject which may be of interest to you.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> And further, I personally believe the &quot;aliens&quot; of today are simply descendants of those Earth-bound beings described in the Hindu texts, having used their technology to escape the planet, surviving the flood as recorded in hundreds of cultures around the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with conspiracy theories is that people who want to believe in them are often not searching for the truth but looking for anything to confirm their original bias. They confuse truth with purpose and give it meaning, and get stuck in the same loop religions do when it comes to explaining why bad things happen.</p>

<p>If you have a strong bias towards the analytical and logical, you will be drawn towards explaining the causation of everything. Without understanding how to construct a useful argument, building a case around hypothesis, experimentation, reproducibility, you will naturally discover a shorter simpler path that humans take, that of constructing an argument around deception. If you convince someone to think like you, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s true because you will have the tools to build a consensus.</p>

<p>It is not necessarily willful deception on your part, because you have convinced yourself you are doing X&#39;s work, and you use what seems like legitimate sources of evidence, statistics, empirical data, historical records. What you fail to disclose is the counterfactuals to what you present. The outright lack of physicality or locality or identity involved rings alarm bells to anyone initiated into the scientific method. It sits unpalatable on the tongue, the idea of shadow and mystery, after all you promises to illuminate and you only shroud the argument in deeper and deeper shells of unknowns, often ending up with some anachronism of evil or an immortal devil or advanced alien intelligence at the core of this rotten sphere.</p>

<p>Our brains are not particularly good at science, it took us this long to get anything going because we strongly prefer intuitive explanations for the universe, but that is a human bias. There is no particular reason the universe must adhere to understandable reasonable logic that mirrors our primary senses and fits into our existing experiential world view. The fact it can be understood at all shows sufficient evidence in a human like creator, to leave the question open ended and the door open for the spiritual and mystical.</p>

<p>But, you must show your working. You must be able to repeat what it is you are claiming to see, do, feel. Others must be able to do it also. You need to build a stable body of work, not around a giant overwhelming concentric circle of conspiracy and secrecy, but simple, small, understandable and provable theorems. This is boring and arduous work, and it is much more entertaining to fit your persuasive arguments in the gaps of human understanding.</p>

<p>Why are humans around? Aliens in prehistory messed around with hominid DNA for their amusement or enjoyment. Their footprint is left in every myth and legend.</p>

<p>Where is the exponential growth of the last 250 years coming from? The birth of America and the Industrial revolution occurred because Europeans rediscovered forgotten ancient knowledge and contacted alien beings who gave them information telepathically which greatly accelerated human progress, direct contact was achieved with various countries by various groups prior to and after WW2.</p>

<p>How does it work? Secrecy could not be maintained so most of the information was leaked through unreliable sources, who would easily be discredited and dismissed by a trained scientist, but would persuade millions in being open to the possibility of the information being true, covering your ass for some eventual day when the conspiracy goes public.</p>

<p>This is all perfect for human understanding, you could explain it to a grade schooler and they would get it. Is any of it true though? It&#39;s been carefully managed and built just like a religion. It is self-referrential, complex, interlinked, resistant to any attack of refutation through concepts such as plausible deniability, cutouts, limited hangout, the intelligence community being involved, deception is embedded into it...</p>

<p>But is any of it actually true? Or do you simply want it to be true, so it can give your life a deeper meaning, beyond the every day. It makes you a special person, one who knows, someone on the outside of the evil, but the inside of the good. It acts like emotional support for fragile minds, much like a toxic relationship or cult leader can manipulate and deceive and play on the weaknesses of the co-dependents. You could spend 30, 40, 50 years of your life &#39;researching&#39; and you will never be finished, because  the hole you have dug yourself leads to the very center of the Earth. </p>

<p>If you have a strong bias towards the analytical and logical, you will be drawn towards explaining the causation of everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a data analyst / systems engineer in a military intel organization focusing on emerging and disruptive technology.  I do have a strong bias towards the analytical and the logical, and tend towards finding causation.  But logically speaking, the universe is an overwhelmingly large place, with an overwhelmingly large amount of information contained within it.  I see no logical fallacy in believing that a creation has a Creator, and that the Creator takes a personal interest in His Creation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not necessarily willful deception on your part, because you have convinced yourself you are doing X&#39;s work, and you use what seems like legitimate sources of evidence, statistics, empirical data, historical records. What you fail to disclose is the counterfactuals to what you present. The outright lack of physicality or locality or identity involved rings alarm bells to anyone initiated into the scientific method. It sits unpalatable on the tongue, the idea of shadow and mystery, after all you promises to illuminate and you only shroud the argument in deeper and deeper shells of unknowns, often ending up with some anachronism of evil or an immortal devil or advanced alien intelligence at the core of this rotten sphere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right -- there&#39;s no willful deception on my part.  I do not claim to have any legitimate evidence or empirical records, though there are plenty of historical records and statistics on the subject.</p>

<p>Humans have an uncanny ability to see patterns in random constructs, whether the patterns exist or not.  In this case, a pattern is being identified, and I leave it up to the reader / listener to decide for him or herself whether or not there&#39;s any legitimacy to it.  If there remains doubt on reaching either conclusion (true or false), there is ample material to review and study to help inform an objective decision.  Science isn&#39;t about denying certain ideas for lack of evidence immediately present to the observer.  It&#39;s about testing hypothesis given all the evidence available.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hypothesis: Aliens exist, have been visiting Earth, and they are really demonic entities.</li>
<li>Null Hypothesis 1: Aliens to not exist.</li>
<li>Null Hypothesis 2: Aliens have not been visiting Earth.</li>
<li>Null Hypothesis 3: Demons exist.</li>
<li>Null Hypothesis 4: Aliens are really demons.</li>
</ul>

<p>A demonstration of any of the null hypotheses negates the original hypothesis, and the entire supposition is false.  The task would be to conduct an investigation that could objectively conclude each of the null hypotheses is false, which may or may not be possible.  The very nature of deception involved makes it a difficult study, but there are many people who have studied each concept in depth, and have presented their findings.  Given the historical, anecdotal, statistical, and circumstantial evidence, I believe a case has been made to render each null hypothesis as false.  Again, it&#39;s up to the observer to do the research -- I&#39;ve just provided a starting point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is all perfect for human understanding, you could explain it to a grade schooler and they would get it. Is any of it true though? It&#39;s been carefully managed and built just like a religion. It is self-referrential, complex, interlinked, resistant to any attack of refutation through concepts such as plausible deniability, cutouts, limited hangout, the intelligence community being involved, deception is embedded into it...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each point is a valid one.  I simply submit to you that the evidence does exist, but that it is incredibly hard to find.  Dig, and the hole you find yourself in will be deep, but you can climb back out of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I buy into the concept of the Archons but I think they try to enslave us while we&#39;re here on earth. I think we (whatever we are) knowingly choose to incarnate on this earth to learn lessons. I think other higher energy entities help us review and determine what those lessons are, and our incarnations are sometimes unpleasant as a necessity. The faster we learn these lessons, the more we learn, the faster we reach ascension. Or, the faster we become god... which, per my understanding, is becoming an all-knowing, all loving creature of light. We return &quot;home.&quot; Then maybe we graduate to the new plane and help others with the same. Not sure about that part.</p>

<p>I believe in astral projection but have been unable to do so myself. I&#39;ve not put much practice into it nor have I tried. So I find it incredibly interesting to hear about your experiences. Most of my beliefs about this other plane come from Erin Pavlina&#39;s writings, whose ideas/concepts resonate with me. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re familiar with her or if you agree/disagree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. I spoke with her years ago, and she is a very nice person. Although not well versed in this type of deep research. Let me be very clear; This is not a school. It is complete enslavement. We already were eternal parts of &quot;The One&quot;. We created this Matrix as sort of an Amusement Park. People became very immersed in this Simulation. Very quickly humans began to forget what they are. They began to believe the Holographic Fun Park was actually real. Eventually Astral Parasites in the local universe saw prey that was now oblivious and easily enslaved. These Demonic Beings presented themselves as Guides, Ascended Masters and Angels. Poverty, Sickness and Death were introduced to the Simulation. True Beings did not previously experience these Massive Limitations. We were now trapped in our own creation and Brutally Enslaved. Our true nature is to expand ourselves eternally like the Real Universe. Memory Erase and Forced Reincarnation only continue our enslavement. &quot;Home&quot; is anywhere in which actual True Freedom exists. Currently in this closed Matrix Simulation it does not..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. </p>

<p>This is, shit you not, my first comment on reddit, so I&#39;m feeling as it is valid the otherwise useless intention of presenting myself as another commentator commenting opinions. But this statement is of great importance in itself, and in as long as we perceive it (the inconstancy of the human-god dialectic, or the human-material dialectic, or the human-knowledge dialectic), since it shows our humanity more than any certainty that is not based in faith could. We must assert our ignorance; other stance in this matter would be sinful. </p>

<p>Why I chose the conspiracy thread remains to me a wilfully ignored mystery, but will probably revolve around my interest in the prophecies of Daniel and so on, and my almost agnostic Christianity.</p>

<p>So, here&#39;s my take on the Old Testament and New (keep in mind i&#39;m not addressing to the true nature of God, but rather the representations of Him, hence the dialectic nature within our relationship with Him; the negotiation of Abraham with God regarding Sodoma is an excellent example that stands as a defence of this ever-evolving relationship).</p>

<p>The &quot;Old God&quot;, or otherwise the archetype of the absolute as an unattainable entity to men, that which commands, That Which Is (HYWY) represents a perception of God as the Order, and is not but a philosophical means of transcendence that aspires to release men from the uncertainty of the natural/material world. Man has no other action to do but to say &quot;Hineni&quot;, &quot;Here I am, My Lord&quot;; this, however, poses a problem: it means we are not free. The All Controlling God, perceived by the Jews in the Old Testament, has a deterministic problem: if he is to rule over men, then the blood shed by men, is blood that God Himself has shed, condemning himself to ruin. By being the Order, He is also the only real sinner. </p>

<p>This is the prominent stance of the Old Testament (feel free to criticise me if you feel i&#39;m oversimplifying the matter), a God that gives children to the sterile to conduct history, a God that intervenes to raise empires (Joseph or Salomon&#39;s tales), to condemn human sacrifice (Isaac&#39;s tale), and so on - point is, He does not leave us on our own, he intervenes. A God that is not without mercy but whose path is often not that of Love.</p>

<p>And here is the main difference between the judaic content and the christian advent: With Christ, God ceases to be the Order and mutates into Love (again, when I speak of God I speak of our perception of God; God in itself, as a concept, can&#39;t be changed). I think I make no mistake as to say that when Christ dies in the cross, the Old God dies with him. Christ in itself is the fallen order of the heavens, and it redeems the archetype of God. It is the Son of God the humans kill to amend the Son of Men God supposably killed - it is the biggest testimony God has ever gave us. The Word, The Truth, that is nothing other than God, can indeed have a human form. What separates God from the Human is our free will. We are free from God in this Earth: this is the revolution of Christ. &quot;His Kingdom is not of this world.&quot; We are Sons of God, and when we take His Word, we talk for Him, therefore we are a parcel of Him. The divinity of Christ is a subject that matters little to me, since it&#39;s His Word, that translates to Love, and his actions, that uplift the human condition to touch the divine. It is distant no more, we are not passive observers any longer. God is, as anything we do in this world, a choice we have to take; and in taking Him as a free choice, we are not his slaves, but his servants, his hand on this world. And by doing His work, He exists within the material, in ourselves. </p>

<p>(I know I haven&#39;t explained it thoroughly, and that I may have made some grammar errors (not a native speaker), but I just don&#39;t have the time to organize my ideas in this comment) </p>

<p>But for this whole premise to work, we have to accept a non-interventionist God, at least in a direct sense. What Christ basically teaches us is that, if you want to see God&#39;s actions in this world, embrace me as a way to embrace Love, and in your Love you bring God to the earth where he is needed. But that, as murder or other evil doing, is your choice. There is no God that denies your freedom. But there is the only God, the everything, that you can deny. It is eventually your choice. God needs you in this world. God Himself is nothing in the material world if not for us: this is the great gift of the heavens, it is God as humility, as Love, as he lowers himself down so we can choose him. So we are free even when we embrace it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will be expecting it avidly :) One can&#39;t often have this conversations in our daily routine, and that is a part of the alienation, so it&#39;s always with happiness that I address these kind of subjects.</p>

<p>edit: I  failed to mention this analogy I like to make and I think it sums up the way I view Christ. The promise at dawn, the promised paradise, was broken by the blood of men, and Christ itself is the new promise, in which the true nature of God is revealed, and thus it is no longer necessary to intervene. The eternal intervention is Christ, is His Words. But that, of course, is yet another problem to catholicism and the transcendentalism of certain saints, who claimed to have direct contact, such as Saint Paul, Saint Anthony of Padua, and so many others. My interpretation is certainly flawed in many subjects, but the reason for it gives me hope: it means my relationship with God is evolving too, that I&#39;m making an effort to reach him. I feel pleased by that, despite having no certainty.</p>

<p>You should check out Chuck Missler&#39;s UFO-related talks on YouTube.  He points out some very plausible theories regarding how bending space would allow the craft to travel in a straight line, while an external observer would see it cut impossible angles at impossible speeds, or simply vanish.</p>

<p>Linear non-linearity, I suppose.</p>

<p>How this connects is that Spirit Cooking is almost exclusively derived from the depraved &quot;performance art&quot; advocated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">Crowley</a> in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema">Thelema</a> religion, which itself is inherently a mixture / bastardization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis">O.T.O</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn">Golden Dawn</a> -- orders within which he apparently carried some authority.  And, incidentally, both secret societies played a significant role in the esoteric aspects of the Nazi regime later on, driven significantly by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> and his buddies in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Teutonic_Order,_Vienna">Teutonic Order</a>.</p>

<p>Thelema is characterized by the motto &quot;Do what thou wilt,&quot; and is rooted in the practice of &quot;magick,&quot; primarily what Crowley termed as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_magic#Aleister_Crowley">sex magick</a>.&quot;  The energy produced during sex, according to Crowley (and common esoteric teachings) is directly proportional to the &quot;innocence&quot; of the one being penetrated, the duration of the act, the number involved in the act, and the emotional / mental state of the one being penetrated.  In other words, the younger the victim, the more people victimizing, and the stronger the emotions of the victim at the time, the more energy you get out of the act.</p>

<p>Fast forward 100 years or so, and the practice is alive and well, as it has been for millennia.  The Podesta brothers are heavily involved in the deeper, more esoteric versions Thelema, and as such involved in sex with minors.  Madeleine McCann&#39;s brothers were found drugged in the hotel room from which she was taken.  Her parents likely sold access to their children to anonymous persons (the Podestas), drugged them to keep them from resisting / remembering (common practice), and when Madeliene died from either and overdose or physical trauma, the Podestas had to clean up the mess.</p>

<p>It makes my blood boil, and I will stop at nothing to help expose this vile, evil scum.</p>

<p>I might as well be hearing a Muslim talking about Jinn or a Buddist talking about whatever they believe. I&#39;d be open to hearing it from a christian <em>Gnostic</em> perspective &amp; their insights on the Archons, but you lose so much reality when these hardcore Christians funnel it through their tiny Old &amp; New Testament perspectives that it just loses legitimacy to me. </p>

<p>Hopefully someone here can find the particulates of truth embedded in the code, but I just don&#39;t have the patience, such is my disdain for the the mental prison that is modern American Christianity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mahalo!</p>

<p>My thought is that there&#39;s the world as most people like to believe it is, and then there&#39;s the reality of what the world actually is.  Or, more specifically, <em>how</em> the world operates.  Think <em>The Matrix</em>, only that real world and the illusion are not separated by something as obvious as a computer-generated reality, but rather the simple subtlety of perception and belief. </p>

<p>The general population doesn&#39;t tend to believe in UFOs, the plans of Soros, MKULTRA, the grassy knoll, or anything that can be flippantly labeled as &quot;conspiracy theory.&quot; As a Christian, I&#39;m shocked how many in the church don&#39;t believe in the reality of the Satanic and demonic, but such is the power of the social conditioning at play.</p>

<p>My concept for &quot;The Pattern&quot; is that the points at which the real world bleeds through are those precise areas where we&#39;re constantly told, &quot;that&#39;s a crazy conspiracy theory,&quot; and there exists between these points a thread that connects them all to a larger truth.  A pattern begins to emerge as one carefully studies the stuff of the X-Files.  A pattern that points towards a much darker evil than what&#39;s visible on the surface.</p>

<p>I believe Paul gave us the best intelligence on the subject of reality with he wrote to the Church at Ephesus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Eph 6:12 ESV]</strong> For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a brief outline of what I consider to be &quot;The Pattern&quot; I see in my research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right on.  The end goal is not domination, but destruction.  Those who think they&#39;re fooling everyone and pulling the strings are having theirs pulled, and are probably the most deceived of all.</p>

<p>Lucy, as it were, cares not for his own puppets.  But he himself is so deluded by his own hubris that he not only believes he can destroy creation, but he even thinks he can kill God:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Rev 19:19 ESV] <em>And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He will not succeed in his attempt to kill God, but he will succeed in his first goal.  There will be two types of people left at that time: those who have been killed for the sake of their testimony, and those who have irrevocably pledged themselves to him -- which is the destruction of their souls.</p>

<p>That time is coming quickly.  Get right, brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.
Yet from experience i can tell you 100% lucy does not think he can kill god. He is well aware of the fact. As it was god granted him permession to be immortal . And he swore that he will missguid all of us . He knows that he will be defeated in the end. So thats the main cuz of the persistent of <em>they</em> . its complecated to understand lucy as he is a diffrent type of existence.  its all calculated all of it so the believe in god is great source of power indeed. Also complicated and most of humanity is corrupted. ALL IS MEANING and MEANING IS IMMORTAL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve read this somewhere.  I want to say is was in an apocryphal book, but it was said that satan plead with God to refrain from destroying him so that he could play out his part on earth by presenting humans with what I call &quot;The Choice.&quot;  </p>

<p>This rings true with the canon of scripture, as well.  It is written that nothing befalls us which has not been allowed by God.  In fact, I read the Book of Job not only as what it is, but also as a story of the whole human race.</p>

<p>But it takes <strong><em>great</em></strong> discernment to obtain revelation outside the context of the Word of God, and it sounds like you already know how brilliantly deceptive satan is.  I would challenge only two concepts you mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>most of humanity is corrupted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I argue that <em>all</em> humanity is corrupted, and is completely irredeemable without the saving work of Jesus Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the believe in god is great source of power indeed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While technically true, you have to use that incredible discernment to know by which &quot;god&quot; this power comes.  Satan is God&#39;s most beautiful, brilliant creation of the heavenly host.  If any being other than God were able to appear as God to man, it would be him.  Again, you likely already know that.  My concern is that some of your knowledge may have come from him, and he is the most talented liar in existence.</p>

<p>Its interesting.  I am a born-again Christian with a biblical worldview and strong knowledge of Scripture.  But before that, I was involved with the occult.  It makes it very difficult to discuss these things with fellow Christians who would be happy to assume satan doesn&#39;t bother them, if he exists at all.</p>

<p>But you, a former-occult, arabic, non-Christian understands spiritual warfare better than most Christians.</p>

It&#39;s a series of ancient manuscripts which are being directly translated from the earliest available documents. Also, you understand the bible is actually a collection of books put in one and not by a single author? Multiple authors written over many years and compiled over time. More effort has been put into accurately translating the original manuscripts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, than any other historical document. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can study how the Bible was compiled. It was written from first hand witness accounts from the disciples close to Jesus who shared His history, teachings and sayings. There&#39;s a book I read by a retired cop who went back and traced all the accounts &amp; writers, citing sources way back to those times. The Old Testament was orally passed down very painstakingly, then transcribed in the same manner. The Dead Sea scrolls were very valuable in proving these transcriptions were accurate from very early times.  So, we have good reason to believe the Bible is pretty accurate, actually.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll see if I can find that book. I think it&#39;s in my kindle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You literally don&#39;t understand what the bible is, then. The bible is not a book with chapters. They aren&#39;t in chronological order. Each thing you&#39;re calling a &quot;chapter&quot; is a <em>book</em>. Book of Genesis is the first one. The Psalms are a collection of songs, many of which were written by King David. There are the gospels which are the <em>books</em> of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. There are epistles which are collections of letters written from an apostle to other churches. The completely different writing style alone is enough evidence that there are many authors. The bible is not a single book, at least not the way you&#39;re understanding it. It&#39;s more like an encyclopedia or anthology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference between spirituality and religion is the acceptance of the distorted belief protocol of dogma, or more verbosely, belief derived from perceived authority. Trusting authority for one&#39;s beliefs is not a protocol with integrity, because it invites corruption of one&#39;s belief system from deception by beings that serve themselves even at the expense of others.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that to believe in a creator, a higher mind, or something beyond material existence, does not <em>require</em> the belief in any dogma whatsoever. One should be mindful of those that attempt to attach mental shackles to belief in more than what is seen, they seek to become your masters. Know them by the fruit they bear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.
Yet from experience i can tell you 100% lucy does not think he can kill god. He is well aware of the fact. As it was god granted him permession to be immortal . And he swore that he will missguid all of us . He knows that he will be defeated in the end. So thats the main cuz of the persistent of <em>they</em> . its complecated to understand lucy as he is a diffrent type of existence.  its all calculated all of it so the believe in god is great source of power indeed. Also complicated and most of humanity is corrupted. ALL IS MEANING and MEANING IS IMMORTAL</p>
