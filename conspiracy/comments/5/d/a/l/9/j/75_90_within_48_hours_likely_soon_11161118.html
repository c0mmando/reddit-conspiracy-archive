        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I study the sun. That is all I can say, and I will take my shitty post. bad karma, and apologize if I am wrong. </p>

<p>Most likely to happen in Alaska japan or California, Time starts 11/16/2016- 
I am a solar observer, much like dutchsince or suspiscious observers although I actually think dutch is reputable, and suspiscious is a conman for profit asshat that lost focus of the science... Call me a solar tard if you will. I do support the &quot;spacequake&quot; phenomenon, and have been an active solar observer since maybe 2010 - (like daily 24.7)...</p>

<p>Some people warrant this as a science, others a gamble. </p>

<p>After 5 years of watching I notice certain consistencies in patterns. Essentially when the solar wind peaked to 750km/s I expected the 7.0. I didn&#39;t post this but have two witnesses that I named it. </p>

<p>Ok so here is where we are now:
When solar winds rapidly drop I believe that the energy from the sun hibernates inside the planet; Call it geomagnetic harmonic resonances. That energy I &quot;feel&quot; is eventually brought back up to the surface when the solar wind speed stabilizes. </p>

<p>The sharper the drop, the more energy would be expected to be released because there is not a slow let up of said stored energy. </p>

<p>Today winds stabilized back to their normal levels. 350km/s respectively, however this was a fast paced drop in reality compared to a normal fluctuating pattern. </p>

<p>Cali and Alaska are both geo-graphically active faults which have had low level activity (but are known to have large peak episodes). 
However, Japan is known to have its series of large scale activity, and it would be another area to watch out for. </p>

<p>Another couple areas we could see some activity that would be sizable would be Nepal, and Afghanistan. Maybe even Brazil, but if I were a gambling man, I would assume 4.0 - 6.0 activity in those areas. 
Because the peak activity dropped so suddenly I would expect that the named areas in the threads title is the main area of concern. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t suggest panic buying. That is not my angle from an observing / researchers perspective; I essentially am a humanitarian, and notice this because I have an active relationship and hobby of monitoring the suns surface. Call me weird ok and I know. 
This was just a psa because metaphorically after staring at your neighbors for several years you typically can estimate when about they leave for work in the morning. </p>

<p>I am not a professional, but I have nailed some awfully large quake predictions, and could even provide links. But I don&#39;t feel I need to do that, because its early, and I pulled an all night bender and need to sleep. 
Just before deciding to get said sleep and assisting in other subs, I decided to double check solarham.net, and saw the sharp decreasing of wind; Which is usually indicative of HUGE HUGE quake activity. Likely 7.0+</p>

<p>As for areas of concern, because I do this often I check the quake maps daily, and the areas are generally selected due to them having minute tells: Such as the west coast being slightly more active then usual. </p>

<p>I also read a lot so I do know that recently a plate in California is showing recent signs of a large scale thrust, so I take articles like those into account. Hope that sums everything up. </p>

<p>my suggestions, are for the next 48 hours, have an exit plan, and if you have loved ones inform them. 
I do truly believe there is a say 80% chance this event will occur, hence me taking my time to write this post. But Again, I am heading to bed myself, and won&#39;t be around for maybe several hours. So again, take with a grain of salt, but Maybe a spoonful;</p>

<p>See that rise on the image in the &quot;Speed section&quot;. It correlates to the 7.8 in NZ... </p>

<p>See the now leveled activity. That is known to be a period of when the earth has settled. Now typically when it does it that fast shit is about to go down...</p>

<p>Even though I had no idea this would take notice thanks for viewing. 
I really gotta take a shower but will be back later :) Thanks for reading and I hope this leads to future discoveries. Nothing more and nothing less. Stay safe and have a great day all :)</p>

<p>There are alot of interesting questions. This feels like an ama. </p>

<p>I wanted to make this update. This is just testing a theory. If I didn&#39;t get to you specifically I apologize. IF this works Talk about it, and engage the sciences surrounding it. I implore all of you to challenge the official narratives of the surrounding universe. Always - :)</p>

<p>SOLAR WINDS</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/real-time-solar-wind">http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/real-time-solar-wind</a></p>

<p>We are almost to a low enough speed. (<strong>315*)</strong>NOW** need 250-350 stable. 6hr left- 8:12pac/nw/t</p>

<p>Final update Welcome to what I consider 48 hours later - maybe nothing will happen - 
Solar winds are now at a 315- That is pretty damn calm - 
It is 07 minutes until 8:12Pacifictime so I guess ya thanks for taking your time to check out my thread...</p>

<p>(I didn&#39;t mean for this to get attention or anything and I really do consider that a large scale seismic event is moments away) in spite of the initial timeline and such. (we got here a little later then intended but I don&#39;t see winds staying this low for long)- So ya. Unless anything happens in the next few minutes / hours? this is a fail. </p>

<p><strong>300km/s</strong> </p>

<p>Welp - We never hit under 300 :( 
So we will never know - I myself was hoping for a just a couple more hours / redemption - However solar winds will likely begin to elevate soon - Unless they drop I have failed - Owning up as promised. </p>

<p>please keep paying attention to these relationships -<br/>
What I will say is that there is certainly a link to extreme rises / However Extreme drops seem to still need further monitoring - (which has never felt so relevant). Ty for watching and learning reddit :) :( ;)</p>

<p>EDIT: 11/21/2016
Japan earthquake: 7.4 magnitude quake prompts tsunami warning – Downgraded to 6.9 (I say b.s.)
UTC time: Monday, November 21, 2016 20:59 PM
<a href="http://earthquaketrack.com/quakes/2016-11-21-20-59-49-utc-6-9-11">http://earthquaketrack.com/quakes/2016-11-21-20-59-49-utc-6-9-11</a></p>

<p>Ok updating: Leading wave of tsunami -
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vplWl_ibUJo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vplWl_ibUJo</a></p>

<p>I am not sure what to really update:</p>

<p>If you read all my comments the area in concern was the area struck - The timing is off and I apologize I am in no real position to really micro analyze these to a specific &quot;timestamp&quot;. However I think we all agree this was the largest seismic event to hit the area, and the initial fore shock did fall within the window of observation). </p>

<p>I am most hopeful for other users will begin to promote the &#39;potential for a relationship&#39; with and inbetween seismic and solar events. I believe there is a correlation and that is exactly why this post is here. 
I didn&#39;t quite &quot;predict anything&quot; it was a basic inference of data. Based on direct observations and persistence. </p>

<p>I am worried that fukushima Daiichii has been impacted by the tsunami. Recently the Reactor 1 cover was released, and should their temporary cooling system have been impacted there may be a release of contaminants. 
Please avoid going out in the rain in 4 days, as cesium and iodide levels will likely be heightened. 
This won&#39;t be in the news; There likely is a slight situation on site. &quot;However They have given their token&quot; 
&quot;All is fine, and nothing to see here narrative&quot;; &quot;Which is of no indication that all is fine&quot;. It is rhetorical.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to alarm anyone, however this will likely push a Californian quake within the next 7 days. 
(I am reluctant to push a date / time. Just know a likely 5.0 will happen) as this series of aftershocks follows. 
Likely some activity in Alaska too -</p>

<p>California areas to watch. are Northern California off shore between Redding and Medford - As well as the port of San Francisco, and lastly Cobb - (all offshore likely 20-40 km out / with a 45-80 depth).</p>

<p>Alaska will be Ketchican and Juneau - Offshore 5.0 likely with a secondary Potential area of risk in Talkenetta and Mccarthy (likelier to be onshore). </p>

<p><strong>about 3 hours ago 4.9 magnitude</strong>, <strong>16 km depth 11/22/2016
Sand Point, Alaska, United States</strong></p>

<p>That would be my west coast warning for the week. (These events aren&#39;t caused by solar, they are caused by tectonic shifting). Just want users to know. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know what else to update - Just maybe consider the science is relevant. 
You can support me through changetip haha - J.k. But I can&#39;t afford cigs even so It would be nice lol...</p>

<p>Those are my updates. I will work on a more professional breakdown of the data in which I assessed this from - </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know what to update at this point. Thanks to everyone for being kind. 
I truly hope that there is relevance to these posts in the future, and that through dedication we all can eventually produce a working EQ prediction model that will lead to saving lives in the future. 
Happy to answer questions, and or comment - I tried to answer most posts. If you said a basic ty; I maybe missed you. However I am very happy and thankful that you all decided to read this (even though I didn&#39;t know it would even take notice) so thanks :)
And stay safe and warm in Japan; Use the buddy system, and be careful as many aftershock in the 4.0- -6.0 range will follow this even, and loose debris is still likely to be present. So stay cautious of your wereabouts :)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>It appears That Fukushias reactors were slightly taken off guard Today. 
Recently reactor 1 was exposed as operations were beginning. It now appears that their cooling pumps are taken off guard. This ultimately is a very bad thing. I can&#39;t really say where they are at. 
Note ENENEWS sensationalizes headlines. </p>

<p>I think /U/chemplexity Is the real MVP today - If anything makes sense These pixels of light are awesome and blew my mind! Please openly discuss!!!</p>

<p>Interesting post! It sounds like your hypothesis actually touches on the relationship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances">Schumann resonances in the ionosphere and earthquake activity.</a>. This has been investigated before and reported in peer reviewed journals (<a href="http://www.ann-geophys.net/23/1335/2005/angeo-23-1335-2005.pdf">1</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474706506000660">2</a>, <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11589-013-0009-0">3</a>, but this is still a relatively new area of research. You can actually see there was major activity in the Schumann resonance spectrum today around the time of the earthquake (<a href="http://imgur.com/fS67ahS">link</a>).</p>

<p>If I interpret your hypothesis correctly though, it seems like you propose some kind of link between solar wind velocity and Schumann resonances, which I can&#39;t seem to find much literature on. I would recommend you investigate this relationship further, because you may be on to something here and have a testable hypothesis that could be taken seriously by the scientific community.</p>

<p>I Was pretty close here is the plates hit and positions fully named in comments below - 
 I fully agree with the initial 7.4 rating; Which my Eq assessment was 7.5 Please also compare named locations and depth&#39;s named as well:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t let the jerks get to you.  Just ignore them.</p>

<p>Also I would suggest that you not delete past posts as that tends make people think you would be hiding something.</p>

<p>To earn credibility, leave every prediction and just let the chips fall where they may.  </p>

<p>Keep working and modifying your techniques and you may discover something that was previous unknown.  And remember all new knowledge seems to pass through three well known stages once it&#39;s discovered.  Those steps are:<br/>
1) It&#39;s dismissed as pseudo-science, fakery, conspiracy theory or any other label that people choose to assign to it.<br/>
2) It&#39;s vehemently opposed and personal character attacks are common.<br/>
3) It&#39;s accepted as being obvious.</p>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate that this seems to be a repeating pattern but it does seem to be that way.  Just keep doing what you&#39;re doing and adjusting along the way and you&#39;ll likely be rewarded.  Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never made a post on this account - ever. 
This is a new account - 22 +/- days old but I respect the advice - </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really make this for the entire sub. Technically it was just supposed to be a three line fly on the wall, but because users are engaging I have stayed and filled in some blanks </p>

<p>I will say I failed if I fail. But I really don&#39;t expect to fail at all. 
You seem pretty level headed and ty for the advice. </p>

<p>Mainly I just hope items like these are documented for the benefit of science should they help collaborate a future &quot;working&quot; Eq prediction model. A college grant, or funding, or even scholarship would be excellent. But I am just someone that is passionate about the field and believe in the relationship between seismic and solar activity. (I literally can&#39;t explain it like einstein or anything).
Yet I do enjoy learning and refining my own personal experiences and concepts within the very small community of researchers that are actively exploring its validity. Maybe some day I will get a hat tip? 
Either way. I need to shower and sleep soon lol. I am starting to stink. 
But thanks and I will certainly say the advice is both warranted and helpful kind stranger :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome - it can be tough around here as skeptics and trolls are everywhere.  Sometimes a little encouragement is more beneficial than skepticism.  I&#39;m glad you viewed my post in the spirit in which it was intended.</p>

<p>I love science for it&#39;s ability to prove repeatability or expose unsound practices.  However, it can also be used as a weapon to silence new discoveries and that seems quite unfortunate to me.</p>

<p>So now I&#39;m conflicted - I hope you&#39;re right because that would be awesome to have a new tool for predicting EQs but then again, if you are right, people&#39;s lives will be dramatically affected.  I think the greater good is having new and reliable tools to predict EQs so I do hope you&#39;re onto something and find success.  </p>

The charge field is actually responsible for much of the mechanical rigors of physics that have been largely abandoned by today&#39;s &quot;virtual&quot; style of physics, which enjoys large mathematical tangents that ultimately have no resemblance to reality.

    <div class="md"><p>Earthquakes are triangulated (so it probably was a 7.5) They simply have to &quot;infer&quot; the exact size which they attempt to triangulate due to monitors being on shore- 
Estimating when a wind stream occurs is pretty difficult because you have to consider both the current speed, and the estimated events to occur - Much of my analysis is based on predictions made by the space weather observatory&#39;s prediction center-
The reports are available at solarham.net</p>

<p>Prepared jointly by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce, NOAA,
Space Weather Prediction Center and the U.S. Air Force.
UPDATED 2016 November 22 0030 UTC</p>

<p>.24 hr Summary...
Solar activity was at very low levels. There were no spotted regions. No
Earth-directed CMEs were observed.</p>

<p>.Forecast...
Solar activity is expected to be very low for the next 3 days (22-24
Nov) with a slight chance for C-class flares as former Region 2605 (N08,
L=191) is due to rotate back on the visible disk.</p>

Essentially it is determined by a large array of factors. If you read my comment history you will likely pull in more of an understanding. 
I will do my best to revise my theories in the long run - </p>

<p>To me I simply was over confident about the vector of arrival in reference to the solar wind speed. There was likely a coronal hole stream aiding the earths stimulation which made the duration of the estimated events entirety, take longer to manifest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Solar winds are almost exact earth quake warnings / </p>

<p>750 km/s 7.5 - 6.5
650 km/s 6.5 - 5.5
350 km/s 3.5 - 2.5</p>

<p>The main thing to consider is when solar winds spike at great lengths. For instance the 7.8 in NZ was in correlation to the original spike that set off this series of quakes taking place now. </p>

<p>The sharp drop following was a test run (on drops) .</p>

<p>It appears that it is the changing velocity that determines when a large quake will take place, in correlation with the speed lost or gained. For instance we are at a 516 km/s solar wind So I would assess 5.0 - 4.0 Eq activity on the planet at this time. <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/real-time-solar-wind">http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/real-time-solar-wind</a></p>

<p>That is why I assume there will be a 5.0 in California this week. (as Cobb California is indicating an unsettling period of activity, and the shift leads me to believe that there will be a pressure release there soon). (Also note that while cobb is actively releasing pressure. Due to where the plates bend, the more likely areas are Sanfransisco bay, and Between medford and redding 43km off coast). </p>

<p>The locations are chosen based on probability of areas that are likely to have earthquakes via their expectancy for seismic episodes, as well as reclusive states in which they have sat dormant. </p>

<p>So I assume by the time that solar winds calm and after a settling period that california will have a sizable, yet basic and downplayed event. (notable to the theory) Yet they are built to withstand 7.0 Activity. </p>

<p>Note that when making an earthquake prediction you also have to work around the suns schedule:<a href="http://solarham.net/pictures/archive/nov20_2016_ch.jpg">http://solarham.net/pictures/archive/nov20_2016_ch.jpg</a></p>

<p>This chart from the 20th as an example shows that the current sunspot region 37 is likely the cause in this additional wind spike. (as most spots take 2 weeks time to rotate to the right off the disk). 
Because this is in its own region, I believe that once the windspeed calms; (within a 72 hour period) the quake will happen +/- .
(as again while the disk rotates, more sunspots come into view). </p>

<p>the worst part about this science is everything is based on what we know now. So Even assuming California will take a hit (which I do). 
There is no way for me to know if another larger cold region will immediately follow 37; Making today&#39;s forecast relevant. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see that happening so at 530 km/s I see a 4.7 - 5.0+ Respectively (say 96 hrs). :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pardon me for interrupting here. I think I can add on... There are episodes where the sun has &quot;bursts&quot; of energy/heat. This is also called a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). </p>

<p>If I understand correctly, in a nutshell, there are quite a few ingredients that seem to be used to bake up an earthquake:</p>

<p>-Moon (full? new? half? super duper moon? is it in apogee? perigee?)</p>

<p>-Sun bursts/CMEs (think of the sun like a big giant microwave that runs with its door OPEN, and the CMEs are MASSIVE bursts of radiation, right? What happens to the MOIST spots when you put the food into the microwave? The more wet spots collect the heat, right? So you gotta stir/flip it over halfway through cooking it. With me? Cool. Now- since the object in the microwave is our Earth, and we can&#39;t flip it over when it&#39;s had &quot;too much radiation&quot; in a certain spot...that means that the &quot;WET&quot; spots in our Earth Dish are getting FUCKING OVER COOKED. What are those &quot;WET&quot; spots? Not my panties watching pizza dare, I&#39;m talking LAVA. So when you add in CMEs, which can BAKE/overheat certain areas beneath our earth&#39;s crust....welp....ya ever cooked something too long in the microwave, and it kinda.....exploded? Yeah. Volcanoes. I point this out because most people know that as lava builds, and volcanoes start belching, the earth moves above it.)</p>

<p>-Now, the other factor one would want to look at is the &quot;domino affect&quot; that happens when one fault strike/slip sets off another...and another.... (Hi, New Zealand, I&#39;m looking at you!!) We&#39;ve had the Pacifica plate expanding for a few years now, especially these last few months... Imagine a huge table where a group of people crowd around chest-to-wood, around that table. Got the picture? Now....Explain how one side of that table is going to go through a shit tonne of change....WITHOUT it affecting the other side of the table? Kinda hard to see how many miracles and outside influences it would take to prevent that from happening. SOOOooooo.... </p>

<p>Basically, between New Zealand disco-dancing in the southern hemisphere, and lately Brazil has been busy too (not even going to mention Italy here, cuz, you know...it&#39;s sitting at a different &quot;table&quot;...but we&#39;re all in the same dining room....) Then you got that Super Duper Moon last night. THEN I know there were some CMEs last week....I don&#39;t know about this solar wind, though- this is a new area for me to plunge into. </p>

<p>Additionally....the moon effects our tides as it PULLS AWAAAAAAY from us..... Today and tomorrow this moon is PULLING THE FUCK AWAAAAAAAAY FROM US, after having been CLOSER TO US THAN ANY TIME IN THE LAST 60? yrs. It&#39;s gonna be a big pull. Like, maybe a building 7 size pull. (Ha- little joke I made to myself there.) </p>

<p>So. This guy is validating the shit out of all the other information I&#39;ve been checking out, the conversations in scientific forums in which I eavesdrop, and my own theory that yeah.....the people our side of the table haven&#39;t been displaced as we&#39;ve watched EVERY OTHER person at our table fucking get knocked out of their chair. Odds are we are so fucking OVER DUE to feel this line of physically-attached-domino-like-faults and get knocked on our ass....simply by looking at the EQ activity swarms that&#39;s taken place over the last 10 years.</p>

<p>But. I could be high on laundry detergent....I&#39;m trying to get shit done so we have clean underwear for the apocalypse. Cuz GLENN WOULD WANT MAGGIE TO HAVE CLEAN UNDERWEAR.</p>

<p>While I appreciate your analogy, you seem to be completely misunderstanding how microwaves work. </p>

<p>It seems you think that &quot;MOIST&quot; spots will heat up more and that is why we need to change the orienation of the food, but this is incorrect.</p>

<p>Microwaves do NOT heat up &quot;MOIST&quot; areas more. Microwaves heat using dielectric heating, having nothing to do with the resonant frequency of water that many people seem to think they do.</p>

<p>The reason we have to change the orientation of food is because there is interference from the microwaves causing cold and hot spots based on whether the interference is positive or negative.</p>

<p>Changing the orientation of the food serves 2 purposes:</p>

<p>1: The cold and hot spots move location so the heat is applied more evenly.</p>

<p>2: the time it takes to change the orientation allows the heat within the food to transfer from the warmer to coler areas.</p>

<p>having said all that, your analogy makes sense, its just that you are misinterpreting how microwaves work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes / no</p>

<p>Yes its been 48 hrs - </p>

<p>Factually I am looking at solar wind intently and they are now at a respectable 324 and receding. Yes it&#39;s been 48 hours but there is a slight delay due to winds not having reached an ideal zone for the events to occur (280)-</p>

<p>If we are testing the science then the elements need to be right - and, so far I have maintained a large amount of accuracy in their being at the levels that I estimated (2 days ago)+/-. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a claim to fame - it is a theory which needs specific conditions set which can induce a large seismic event. 
So I am now myself waiting until winds reach the lowest end of the experiments threshold (250)ish-</p>

<p>Yes I am officially aware that as of now that 48 individual hours have passed = However, (to me) No the experiment isn&#39;t over yet = IF winds elevate back up to a 400+ levels with no real unmentionable seismic outcome, it is a complete failure;</p>

<p>However, if they reach 250 and we see a large seismic event (I would deem that a success). 
Again this is an experiment with solar winds - so the test is mainly determined by them. Not users opinions-</p>

<p>I do openly admit that we are right where we need or near where I assumed we would be. (below 350 threshold). cruising at a respectable 320 to boot.  However I was hoping we would have been at 280 at this time. I believe that is the &quot;Goldilocks&quot; zone - 
So Yes. Time is up. No - I am still actively monitoring the situation as it relates to the science - If nothing pans out soon I openly accept that I have failed in my entirety. -  </p>

<p>To be honest There is no real equipment for the estimation of solar winds; We simply estimate their course -  So If your looking at this as an experiment You should give the events a time to reach their optimal zone of fruition. If you want to claim it off - thats ok too - </p>

Yeah, even dead clocks are right twice a day, I&#39;ll give you that, but dude was pretty damn close in his prediction. Plus, I was calling your comparison ridiculous. Not, like, you yourself.

    <div class="md"><p>He was off by 3 days. That&#39;s not close at all.</p>

<p>7.3 compared to 7.5 might seem close just because we know those numbers are only 0.2 apart. What isn&#39;t as widely known is that the Richter scale is logarithmic. So the earthquake that actually happened was half as powerful as OPs.</p>

<p>OP&#39;s prediction was as vague and broad as it could get and he was still wrong. 7.5-9.0? Nope, 7.3. And he was 3 days early.</p>

<p>Oh and 7.5-9 is a difference of HUNDREDS of MEGATONS OF ENERGY. That&#39;s like saying &quot;the crater from this bomb could be anywhere from 5 feet to 50 miles wide&quot;</p>

<p>I am not aware of gofundme but another user just suggested it. </p>

<p>I really hope that you would only contribute a fraction of what you would consider donating to Japan in hindsight. I can&#39;t myself feel honorable to take anything away from those that are truly suffering at this time. 
I really mean that; I just hope they are all ok. I have already lost the most important person in my life, so I suppose it is in relationship to that, That I would feel compelled that they may need the resources more than me :)</p>

<p>So if you do push to help Please consider making a contribution to them first. I am happy with food and breadcrumbs, so long as they get the whole loaf so to speak. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everybody who does these predictions seems to have a new account and no verifiable history of successful predictions. The OP here has a one month old account and states, &quot;...but I have nailed some awfully large quake predictions, and could even provide links. But I don&#39;t feel I need to do that...&quot;  Seriously? You don&#39;t feel the need to show people you can do something that nobody on Earth has been able to do yet?</p>

<p>Of course we then get into the &#39;prediction&#39;. Predicting 7.5 or over is good, because there are only 18 quakes 7.0 or over EACH YEAR. <a href="https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/kb/questions/1/is-the-number-of-earthquakes-increasing/">https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/kb/questions/1/is-the-number-of-earthquakes-increasing/</a>   So every day on Earth there is a 4.9% chance of a 7.0 earthquake. Now the OP limited the time frame to 3 days so using the handy probability calculator here, <a href="http://stattrek.com/online-calculator/binomial.aspx">http://stattrek.com/online-calculator/binomial.aspx</a>   we plug in 0.049, 3, 1 and we get a cumulative probability of 13.99% for more than 1, 7.0 earthquake happening in any 3 day period (I&#39;m guessing he&#39;d claim credit if it happened more than once).  So the OP has a fair shot at making a &#39;correct&#39; prediction even with zero effort.  What if a &#39;big one&#39; happened a few days after his prediction? Would the OP take credit? Well if it happened on day 4 his cumulative probability was 18.2%. 5 days...22.2%....6 days - 26 %. Surely the OP wouldn&#39;t claim being correct more than twice his original period I would hope!</p>

<p>Sadly the OP then WIDENS his prediction! </p>

<p>&quot;...but if I were a gambling man, I would assume 4.0 - 6.0 activity in those areas.&quot;  Well let&#39;s consider how good a &#39;gamble&#39; the OP is taking here, shall we!  There are about 14,500 earthquakes on Earth EACH YEAR over 4.0 magnitude. So there are almost 40 quakes EACH DAY to choose from, again over the 3 day period in the prediction. So to be &#39;correct&#39; the OP only needs 1 of the 120 Earthquakes to be in his target areas...namely &quot;Nepal, and Afghanistan. Maybe even Brazil&quot;.  Given the huge target area I&#39;m gonna call this OP prediction correct before it even happens. Well done OP!!!  Damn Good Job!</p>

<p>It&#39;s always fun to see these prediction threads. I would dearly love someone to find a way to predict huge earthquakes, it&#39;s a very noble quest. But please, don&#39;t present it as some mysterious prediction that you can take credit for when the odds of being correct are pretty good even for a monkey.</p>

(They definitely aren&#39;t, but not assuming they are makes the math beyond my scope of knowledge since I don&#39;t have a model for earthquake timing offhand.) Then the distribution of earthquakes over a 3-day period follows a Poisson process with mean (3 * 18 / 365), so the probability that there will be at least one earthquake is 1 - e<sup>-3 * 18 / 365</sup> = 13.75%.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree however the problem with him is his general rushing into the whole Earthquake prediction application &quot;which literally was fraud&quot;.</p>

<p>He had no way planned to correlate the actual locations. He bases his zones off some irrelevant chart, instead of doing what me and dutch do &quot;The statistical areas showing recent activity vs past activity&quot;. Basically Yes the science is being perfected, but users like me and dutch (who have been doing this just as long if not longer) think he is a bloody thief, that exploited users for financial gains by selling an application that was in no way ready for a market. 
Hence him not having an update today - IMO (I didn&#39;t check that, so technically he may have one up for what I know). I literally dropped viewing him after he pulled his little eq prediction app heist last year. (Yes I&#39;ve been doing this for several years now, with a pretty good success rate). I am not perfect, But I don&#39;t ask for money in spite of the science being in no way validated. 
(Just an observer with some talent). </p>

<p>ty for paying attention to these channels. It will eventually be perfected but until then don&#39;t donate to charletons like ben</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s when you mingle two theories together. One, the sun can cause earthquakes, and these guys are set out to find a way to predict when the sun will cause one. Two, these earthquakes are man made.</p>

<p>Do you believe all the earthquakes are man made? Such as the recent Italy earthquake. I do believe that this is possible. My theory is that is has to do with similar technology that Telsa created.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time is a very interesting concept to explore.  It is simply our place in a cycle, and if we tune in to our souls, you&#39;ll be able to access a lot of information.  Have you considered that your bad feeling actually causes the result?  What if next time you started with that bad feeling you worked really hard to focus on positive outcome visualization.  Would be interesting to see if you experience a different result.  You have to believe, and not doubt, your positive visualizations while performing experiment for it to have a chance of working though.</p>

I remembered this comment when it was posted and even myself thought it was bullshit even though I wanted it to have some merit.  As soon as I heard about this earthquake I searched this out.

<p>OP said between inshinomaki and hitachinaka off the coast 25km out and 25km deep.</p>

<p>It happened right between inshinomaki and hitachinaka (straight east from fukushima) - 35km out and 12km deep!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO the speed didn&#39;t drop fast enough. It dwindled - </p>

<p>Imagine a car out of control. (no driver on a series of hills). </p>

<p>Now it floors it down hill rolling along...</p>

<p>It comes to an uphill and your job is to determine when it will slow, and when it will stop. The slowing is easy to speculate on - 
The kinetic energy is apparent in the tires, but Figuring out the exact point in where it stops having no real tools is difficult. 
now realize you have to make this observation at 20 miles out, with a pair of binoculars-</p>

<p>solarwinds from the sun / based on data from the space weather prediction center available at <a href="http://solarham.net/">http://solarham.net/</a></p>

<p>I agree we didn&#39;t hit a record fast paced low - 
However we stayed within the (Goldilocks zone). and the dwindling is likely what took the extra time involved in seeing the cause / effect-</p>

<p>from your language, it sounds like you&#39;re basing your prediction on intuition rather than any sort of modeling or data analytics.</p>

<p>really, i was asking for some sort of source on this claim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It coerelates to a very fast drop in solar wind. Note 750 km/s to 350km/s That is a 400,000 km a second drop in speed.</p>

<p>Not typical for average space weather, and earthquakes typically follow these drops statistically-</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a dataset would just be a collection of data about the solar winds you&#39;re talking about, correlating it to the type of seismic activity you &#39;re attesting to.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really interested in doing analysis for a space agency- get practicing on your data analysis.  you don&#39;t have to have money to go to school or to learn r or python or how to use analysis tools.  If you can&#39;t find existing datasets for what you&#39;re trying to study- get working on your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re saying their college would be free PRIOR to figuring out a way to predict earthquakes. The post is saying that they should learn proper data analytics and do research that validates in a scientific way their accuracy. School is how you would learn to do that kind of proper research...They&#39;re saying you don&#39;t need money to go to school. Which is certainly false. If you want to perform good, respected research...you need to know how to do it...to know how to do it...you need to go to school...THEN you figure out a way that&#39;s scientifically validated to predict earthquakes (that&#39;s the stage where your schooling would be free..once you&#39;ve proven you know how to do it scientifically..). You&#39;re saying he&#39;s figured it out so it would be free...but that&#39;s flipped.</p>

<p>You <em>do</em> have to have money to go to school...because you&#39;re going to school to learn how to validate the research you&#39;d be doing which would <em>then</em> prove that you figured out a way to predict earthquakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post! It sounds like your hypothesis actually touches on the relationship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances">Schumann resonances</a> in the ionosphere and earthquake activity. This has been investigated before and reported in peer reviewed journals (<a href="http://www.ann-geophys.net/23/1335/2005/angeo-23-1335-2005.pdf">1</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474706506000660">2</a>, <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11589-013-0009-0">3</a>), but this is still a relatively new area of research. You can actually see there was major activity in the Schumann resonance spectrum today around the time of the earthquake (<a href="http://imgur.com/fS67ahS">link</a>).</p>

<p>If I interpret your hypothesis correctly though, it seems like you propose some kind of link between solar wind <strong>velocity</strong> and Schumann resonances, which I can&#39;t seem to find much literature on. I would recommend you investigate this relationship further, because you may be on to something here and have a testable hypothesis that could be taken seriously by the scientific community. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be 100% honest We should talk about this more -
I am far less masterful in the areas in which you speak, but I am quite intelligent, and I think my theories would surprise you (or maybe already have). My main focus isn&#39;t financial though -
It is more just to aide the development of the science. (While I can).

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m definitely very intrigued by your observations. If you check out the wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances">Schumann resonances</a>, you&#39;ll see that &quot;A new field of interest using Schumann resonances is related to short-term earthquake prediction&quot;. Perhaps if solar wind velocity can predict Schumann resonances, and Schumann resonances can predict earthquakes, you might have just opened up a new kind of earthquake predictor!</p>

<p>Edit: I just wanted to mention that you were describing the derivative of the solar wind velocity (i.e. change over time) as the important predictor. I wonder if a sharp change in solar wind velocity disrupts the Schumann resonance frequency...</p>

<p>Edit 2: Also want to mention that Schumann resonances, <em>to the best of my knowledge</em>, may only predict earthquakes up to a day or two in advance. This idea of yours potentially extends that to 5-7 days.</p>

<p>I think to say &quot;global warming&quot; your really saying &quot;tax increase&quot; and &quot;epa restriction&quot; vs &quot;human rights&quot;. </p>

<p>essentially if you though dredging its gold, chopping its trees, poisoning its land water and air with radionuclides, toxins, gasses, viruses and contaminants; while allowing various elements to over abuse their privledges into the mass killing and extinction of the planets species is a joke. No the holocene extinction is all of these things.

    <div class="md"><p>Technically it is a fault that is connected to the juan de fuca fault line. However there are multiple plates separating them from direct interaction. So the dominoes are in a straight line. Same fault structure - Yet this is maybe two - 3 dominoes from a direct relationship;</p>

<p>Also not to be a downer but earthquakes at that depth typically show course for a settling period seismically (as in all the energy released will now allow for a brief period of stability); or in a reversal of this rule (worst case scenario) are indications of a much larger breach/ (fore-shock) to an even larger seismic event; </p>

<p>I myself would like to say this is the energy I assumed would be released as of the time of posting; So we are onto something - 
I couldn&#39;t tell you if it was all the energy or not; It appears to be, but the depth could be indication that there was much more energy there than we had taken into consideration. Time will tell in that regard - 
I assume seismic events will flow into the 4.0 and 3.0 ranges until Winds increase erratically again. (just a couple days). However I feel based on the available data and projected solar weather that we will only be in 5.0 - 5.5 territory - However this again is all only relevant to the actual solar wind speeds at the time - 
I don&#39;t see much solar activity being predicted; So I question if we are in the clear for the time being - Yet again, If this specific quake wasn&#39;t all the energy from the last 750km/s event; Then it could be a foreshock event. 750 isn&#39;t that high but it is pretty high - I assume its over (But I have assumed wrong before) so time will tell;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are seeing moderate to elevated seismic activity however - I did say as early as for the record. With a steady slowing of solar winds. The thing that usually delays this is a fluctuating solar windspeed in my opinion. So the calmer it gets, the less stable it gets. We aren&#39;t expecting a peak. This is what lead me to making the post. 
The calming after the 400.000km/s drop in windspeed is a vast change. Going from hot to cold (metaphorically).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. It actually makes some sense as I just read a scientific explanation against the AWG fraud.  It mentions how much heat the earth itself absorbs and perhaps sudden changes with our sun could cause sudden changes with our planet and precipitate earth quakes.  I will tale a peek at your links tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video shows how a segment can give from pressure, while placing even more pressure on the locked plate behind it. </p>

<p>I believe that when solar winds hit round 250 stable. We will see that a large earthquake happens on earth. There are several geologically active places on earth showing signs of tension. 
Of those several I&#39;ve considered the primary regions at the time. Japan east coast, alaska / canada west coast. California coast. </p>

<p>We are seeing if another 7.0 Will occur in a very relevantly short amount of time. </p>

<p>The instance in california could be anything. Ty for reporting the information. I Just assumed the video could describe a process in which this areas activity (loud sign of distress) could correlate to a pressure in the earth releasing is all. As though the plates budged, like the slate in the video - Which could mean to expect a larger quake there as the next one in line gives way - essentially. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes / No / Kindof / and way off / </p>

<p>A. There wasn&#39;t a flare it was a coronal hole&#39; meaning flaring and coronal mass ejections didn&#39;t occur. This is a cold filament on the sun that ejects cosmic radiation and solar material via a windstream directly to the earth. </p>

<p>The upperatmosphere is protected by the magnetosphere which is our shield for penetrating solar radiation; However its already been penetrated by highly energetic protons, ions, and particulate. </p>

<p>The initial blast lead to the 7.8 in NZ. 
Again that was the blasting wave. The punch, and the period the energy made its way to the earths surface. </p>

<p>I believe these particles excite the earths magma. Like punching a human body, and the effect it has on your blood system. 
(the effect of your blood now flowing, and your adrenaline rushing. </p>

<p>eventually it registers to your nerves though, takes a little time and you process it. after the initial rush you go OOOUUUCCCHHH. </p>

<p>That will be the secondary episode that I truly feel is imminent. </p>

<p>Sorry I didn&#39;t have enough money to go to a fancy school; So my terminology isn&#39;t always on point; But it doesn&#39;t stop me from speculation and assessing the cause and effect in metaphorical terms;</p>

<p>Truly I believe there is a solid scientific connection; However it is on the forefront of being understood at this time. Dickbags like ben and his solar observatory are giving it a good and bad name, by releasing faulty applications though. But I truly do respect his attempts to engage the Main stream scientific community. 
So he has some good points in my eyes, but honestly hes also damaged the future of the science, by taking peoples money and not delivering an acutal working product. Which may cause far more harm then good in respects to its future :/</p>

I&#39;m not sure where else you could post this, but maybe check around a bit, or just post it everywhere you can. Yes, you&#39;ll be attacked, trolled and people will be skeptical, but that&#39;s still probably better than doing nothing and not warning anybody. Maybe post on some other forums as well (besides Reddit)?</p>

<p>Either way, I hope you&#39;re wrong (for obvious reasons, not that I&#39;d like to see you fail, it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t want people to suffer a quake of that magnitude...or a quake of any magnitude really).</p>

Sharp increases of solar wind causes turbulence in the magnetosphere.  That causes aurora effects, and in extremis may interfere with electronic devices on the surface.  A sharp decrease of solar wind causes a temporary bulge in the magnetosphere, which is <em>thought</em> to be harmless.  </p>

<p>If the solar wind ever overpowered the magnetosphere, we&#39;d all die, but you needn&#39;t worry about that.  That&#39;s very thoroughly outside of the realm of ordinary variance.  It is, however, a consideration for Martian colonists, since the surface being bombarded by dangerous solar radiation is a real hazard on Mars.</p>

<p>Does this &quot;geomagnetic harmonic resonances&quot; have an actual sound? I heard this humming noise at night a couple nights ago. I&#39;ve heard this hum at night before on certain occasions back when I lived in the midwest, but I never associated it with earthquakes. However this is the first time I&#39;ve ever heard the hum in San Jose so I&#39;m wondering if the events could be related.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wont affirm this however it is factually attested by some that these incidents A. &#39;Could&#39; Correspond. B. have been reported. In my opinion it could either be echoing low frequencies reverberating then the audio signals would refract off the earths magnetic field tubes. Creating a high screach as the techtonics began to spring, prior to a massive push event. 
I would say that we would probably have evidence to support this phenomenon. But its now possible to view the flux tubes and I wonder if they are individual and could produce different ranges of sound when energy bounces off of them back to earth.<br/>
In that effect we could hear a series of different changing tones, while the plates grumbled out highly influential discharge into the upper atmosphere. 
I think physicists neglect a lot of the tones that space &quot;sings&quot; itself and have been too busy &quot;looking&quot; and searching for habitable planets then to have just spent more time sitting around and listening to what is said. 
I like programs like SETI which take at this goal, and am impressed with the recent developments of the chinese&#39;s progress in aiding this research. There are really cool new ways of research that are making absolutely groundbreaking discovery&#39;s. This was pretty recent:<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/aliens-proof-evidence-facts-stars-scientists-extraterrestrial-life-et-intelligence-a7377716.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/aliens-proof-evidence-facts-stars-scientists-extraterrestrial-life-et-intelligence-a7377716.html</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why I got off topic sorry. It was a good question, and I suppose the answers:
TL/DR. 
Some people think so. (No pics so it didn&#39;t happen)...? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not that it is specifically normal or abnormal. It to me is consistent with the energy radiating from the sun. like a record needle skipping about down the track, making its way about the grooves. 
Cause and effect. Low and high solar wind breaks typically are indications of massive earthquakes much like when a dj will &quot;scratch&quot; an album. The sudden slipping of the record is much like a fault system with the turntables motor synthesizing the normal rhythmic rotation of earths access. Yet radiation is essentially the Hand of the DJ, and its sudden burst&#39;s effect the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqgW-2orQQg">sound&#39;s of the music.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>(timing) 
Assessing solar wind streams is based on assumptions; I assumed the wind would reach x speeds at x rate of deceleration based on the available data. 
However the data points are only references - based on the available data at the time of posting-</p>

<p>I left the thread up for future observers - 
It isn&#39;t so much that I am &quot;Wrong&quot; as so much that the previous observation on deceleration rates lead me to believe an impending event would strike sooner then they had; </p>

<p>I believe that at any point that the solar winds experience a severe shift; That earthquake energy? is transferred into the earths core. 
(I would call it geo magnetic harmonization). Essentially. 
While this is only theoretical I believe magma and plasma have more similarities and that it is even possible that the earths core could in fact be plasma - 
What I have noticed is that every time a solar wind stream peaks over 680Km/s There is a 5.0+ EQ. 600 - 700 is a 6.0+ and 700 - 800+ km/s Is typical of an 8.0+/- range event;</p>

<p>I theorize that as this speed decreases in specific area&#39;s that aftershocks as well as quakes reflect its process - Hence the post. 
Tracking the deceleration is new to me - Hence trying to post it to others to further its study and validity. </p>

<p>Essentially I am under the impression that most earthquakes on earth are stimulated by solar winds, and cosmic radiation rates. 
So posts like these no matter how specific help to monitor the science and provide future researchers with resources to base their own theories on. </p>

<p>tl/dr The energy was there which is evident; However I missed the deadline... Which Of all things I hope doesn&#39;t negate the validity of the science - Being I am more so hoping it intrigues others into finding more methods in refining it - 
:)</p>

I&#39;ve also seen some reports that suggest that global warming is a natural solar pattern. Probably both though, and at some point the earth will need to go back to balance sort of like homeostasis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry about the radiation. The vast majority of the radiation released was iodine 131 (I might have the isotope number  a little off), which has a half-life of about 8 days. 5 Years after the leak, that adds up to over 228 half-lives. Each half-life cuts the remaining amount of iodine in half, so right now we&#39;re at 1 / (2<sup>228),</sup> or 2.32x10<sup>-67</sup> % of the original iodine. That&#39;s 0.00(60 something more 0&#39;s)232 %.</p>

<p>The other isotopes, like cesium, have longer half-lives, but made up a much much smaller amount of the original leak. There were two cesium isotopes released, the more abundant one had a half-life of 2 years, so we&#39;re at 17.6% remaining for that one. The less abundant one has a half-life of about 30 years, so it will be around for a while.</p>

<p>All in all, only about 2% of the original radiation is still around.</p>

<p>Some of their research is highlighted here:

    <div class="md"><p>we reached extreme winds in an extent but the activity today was pre postulated easily based on what we saw in the last weeks via the nz incident (When the first passing occurred).</p>

<p>(This is the same sunspot region after all). </p>

<p>I have theorized that the initial shocks and after shocks are the highest periods of magnetic complexity; So this being the middle passing I&#39;d assume while these are notable quakes, that most the real fireworks and destruction will begin in the passing phase of the sunspot group itself. So give it a few weeks for the magnetic filaments to shift into a more erratic state and thus you have test 3 in its full engaging circumstances.  </p>

<p>Sort of like a pimple really, at first it stings and you know your going to have it (nz). Then middle faze its a bastard and you have to live with it; (Solomon islands). Next will be the popping phase or the final showdown. </p>

<p>Because I am trying to prove a theory as much as I wanted to warn of the impending quakes today, their pattern didn&#39;t fit my specific probability on potential sites so I was reluctant to hop online crying wolf without knowing where to point to look for it; 
From what I have analyzed and observed; Japan will be next to have a truly magnificent quake, and it will come exactly as this region passes again. Hence test 3. </p>

<p>Sorry I hope you can see my reasoning as fair enough as to not be attempting to track all seismic activity on this channel. I&#39;d probably drive you all crazy. </p>

<p>I simply want to show the specific theory holds true. (Hence the public testing rounds). </p>

<p>My advice watch the extreme solar wind shifts, and the upcoming spots (on left of solar disk) and you too can easily determine when these periods occur :) </p>

<p>It&#39;s really not so much a prediction as it is an exact assessment of the data :)</p>

<p>Edit: typos :)</p>
