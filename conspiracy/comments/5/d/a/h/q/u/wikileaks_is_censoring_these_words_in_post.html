       That is a perma link to his comment where he tells people to use tor without protection 'just download the bundle and go', after linking to a resource full of CP.

       It started with cleansing all who doubted them, through massive bans.  Followed by enforcing only content they approve of/agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence the killing of the sub, in 'new' there are hardly any new posts - towards the bottom there is a 1 day old post.  Which means the subreddit is borderline dead.  If you notice, a lot of the posts are from mods.   The other thing is, they put all these mods on to 'fix' the sub, due to an influx of users, and they ended up killing it.

       Please read this - assume all WikiLeaks after October 16th are fake.  ALL of these are the ones pushing that the democrats were using these tactics to beat trump... before October 16th there was NOTHING anti trump at all from an e-mail sent by podesta or Clinton.  This is a coverup because they are pushing a democrat vs republican civil war and want us to think Trump is on our side.

       I dunno man.  It's shady enough that either it's true, or it's a trap made to look convincing, or it's deliberate misinformation paid for by the trump campaign.  My money's on one of the later, but I don't think it's just people innocently over-extrapolating data - It's either hoax or truth.

       I don't think it's people 'innocently" extrapolating data, but I do believe the people pushing it actually believe it, they just believe it because it's on a mental backdrop of wealthy and powerful people regularly fucking and eating children. They're not lying, they're mistaken. It seems awfully convenient to pass off the more wacko theories from people you otherwise agree with as false flags or intentional red herrings rather than just owning the fact that you (we) rub elbows with some wacky broken clock types who are often very wrong.

       Well yeah I mean - drawing the full conclusion of it requires a certain stretch of the imagination and predisposition towards some "rich and powerful people eat babies" mindset.  But an actual look at the evidence and you can't help but think something very creepy is going on.  I'm saying it's quite the coincidence if that's all just innocent interactions being extrapolated - I'm fairly convinced (as someone I thought to be a reasonable person) that something's up.  It's just far more likely to be deliberate misinformation/substantiated lies or a deliberate attempt to plant a particularly ridiculous conspiracy that will never be proven to discredit the rest of the clinton criticism, rather than an actual undercover pedo ring (but hey - they're not unprecedented).

       Weren't the Podesta emails rolling out automatically anyway?

       From Oct. 12.

      <p>
       That seems to imply that the Podesta emails are just rolling out automatically. Granted, the whole process may have been hijacked, but I assumed at the time this meant that Assange or whoever did not need to publish each batch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as
       <a href="/u/fat_osvaldo">
        /u/fat_osvaldo
       </a>
       mentions, there are emails verifiable by DKIM published after Oct. 16th. It was never the case that all of Podesta's emails were verifiable by DKIM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely the Wikileaks sub is compromised, and the absence of Assange since Oct. 16 is troubling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Here is an email published 2016-10-31 that is verifiable by DKIM.

       Did they block you on twitter at the same time?  Were you spamming their twitter?
      </p>
      <p>
       The mod is a mod on many wikileaks subs, and hence the massive bans.  Normally it's just ban to the relevant sub, do you have your comment that got you banned?  Did you post on the other subs, or is it just ones he moderates?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean...how would they know it's related (your reddit acc and twitter acc)?  The reason you got banned on twitter is not the same reason you got banned from the sub, is what I'm saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe something feels off about their twitter, but to assume they are both connected, is really reaching.  I'd need proof you didn't post on their twitter to believe it was connected, and that would mean you are being monitored heavily, which I very much doubt.

       On twitter I posted a link that teaches people how to check the hashes, keys, and dkim. Like 10 minutes later it was removed and I was blocked. I posted it again from my second account and the same thing.  This morning On the wikileaks sub, I posted asking why the pgp key isn't used, the dkim is missing and their hashes don't match. It showed on my account page but not in the sub so I messaged the mods and they never responded so I messaged them again with more harsh words and they replied calling me a fucker or something close, I can copy pasta their response. They don't want people to know how to check authentication.

       This sounds important. It suggests who ever is running the twitter account disapproves of the link or its content. So could you send me the link? :)

       Every tech cryptography site will show you how... But they don't want you to. Snowden and assange told us to watch for this and learn how this all works. I suggest people check into it.

       This is far from simply linking to CP.

      <p>
       That is a Tor Hidden Wiki. It is a common thing. It just has links to various dark net stuff. They get posted regularly on
       <a href="/r/onions">

       <a href="/r/tor">

       It was probably just a push for people to use Tor. Tor hidden wikis get outdated and die often. Keeping a working one that isn't outdated and full of dead links and shutdown sites is difficult.

       the purpose of

       is to discuss the leaks, not encourage people to use tor and browse the darkweb. And they are VERY strict.. they banned 48 people in a 2 day period because those people tried to discuss Julian Assange. Yes, despite what the sidebar says, the new mods have decided julian assange is "off topic" for

       There was a bit of an upheaval last week when new moderators were added; however those with pro-clinton bias were removed, the problematic bans they issued were reversed, and we are now trying to add public mod logs to ensure community oversight of all mod actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The OP of this thread is upset because the mod team refused to agree with his assertion that a link to the hidden wiki (or google) is tantamount to child porn.

       Well that's all well and good, but the more pressing question is this: Is your mod team itself even able to verify the validity of wikileaks' submissions as of late?

       Yea, we don't have any official connection with wikileaks as of yet and simply look to facilitate discussion related to their journalism; however the verified staff from their AMA did reach out the other day. It has yet to materialize into anything though.

       No, are you projecting?  The hidden wiki is one thing, the link your buddy posted, links to child porn.

       I just read an article about how google removed illegal content, let me pull that up for you.

       Any other baseless accusations?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, does this count as harassment - two posts before I reply once?  One of which accuses me of searching for child pornography.  Is this acceptable behavior from a mod?

       Actually no, a direct link is something that when you click on it, stuff happens! That's why they call it direct. In this case, your browser would try to open it and fail because you're not running tor. Unless you're a bad person,

       Now I agree with you but you need to consider the fact that it's public knowledge that the NSA pays close attention to anyone using Tor, along with the fact that the dude is essentially blowing smoke up your ass by telling you using Tor securly is a plug and play kind of thing.

       But yeah, it cracks me up when I read all the people in this thread whos palms are sweating at the notion of clicking on a link to a page which consists of other links (which cannot be accessed with a normal browser), some of which may contain child porn.

       Hey, if they weren't onion links, the prefetching setting in some browsers might cache that page without them even clicking it. Thankfully that's not what happens in this case.

       Well this might sound pretty far out but I saw her in one of those satanic cult style dinner parties with human cakes etc. She's in on it and they might have sent her to completely troll the fuck out of Julian since he was obviously well aware of all this before us.

       She in on it. They have some "celebrities" they use. Sean Penn helped them get El Chapo, for example. Whats his face, the basketball player was probably trying to help them get Kim Jong Un.

       who made that clear? was it a concentrated effort to block threads and nuke them? i live diff time zone so perhaps missed the best stuff.
i mean to be fair...its not a "donald discussion" but more of "donalds opponent discussion" which i guess if reddit is super serious about not going offtrack? dunno.

       Im not sure how new but go try to post this question. They say it's already been asked but it's buried. It'll show as posted in your account but not in the sub. Their sub is compromised and everyone needs to know. Until the keys and hashes match, we can't trust them. 1600 emails missing dkim pgp when before it was on everyone.

       Yes but if a sub is compromised then the mods of said sub
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to know, right? So either the mods suddenly had a change of heart, or something happened to not make them want to warn people.

       After the Internet cut, 6 or 7 new mods were added with full permission. There lies the problem, it's definitely compromised.

       Now wikileaks is trying to misconstrue how hashes and precommitment work. They also are acting like assange private response key to the pgp isn't compromised since they aren't using. Man they are digging a deeper hole. I'll feel like a big dick if this is hurting assange, but we have more evidence he isn't involved than evidence that he is. May kathulu bless us all.

       Assange is gone/dead and wikileaks as you know it is gone, they are now a propaganda/distraction machine.

       What do you want to know? This thread and the stickied thread at the top explain why it's not authenticated. Why the wikileaks sub and Twitter are censoring isn't in any news article yet.

       On twitter I posted a link that teaches people how to check the hashes, keys, and dkim. Like 10 minutes later it was removed and I was blocked. I posted it again from my second account and the same thing.  This morning On the wikileaks sub, I posted asking why the pgp key isn't used, the dkim is missing and their hashes don't match. It showed on my account page but not in the sub so I messaged the mods and they never responded so I messaged them again with more harsh words and they replied calling me a fucker or something close, I can copy pasta their response. They don't want people to know how to check authentication.

       Yes but if a sub is compromised then the mods of said sub
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to know, right? So either the mods suddenly had a change of heart, or something happened to not make them want to warn people.
