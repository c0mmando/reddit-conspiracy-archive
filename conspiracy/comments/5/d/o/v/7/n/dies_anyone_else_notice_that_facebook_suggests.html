    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I get it in Google suggestions and YouTube adds, it happened enough times now that it&#39;s not coincidence, when there is a conversation about something between me and another person, 5 mins later i  put a song on on YouTube and I get an add about the exact product we were talking about.</p>

<p>We tried to make it happen by talking about lawnmowers but couldn&#39;t get it to produce a lawn mover add, but it&#39;s happend enough times with YouTube adds that it&#39;s real, Google search suggestions are probably worse, having a conversation about something, I go to Google to look up a fact about what we are talking about (how many bricks in the great Wall of China) I start typing, how m. and the first suggestion will be &quot;how many bricks in the great Wall of China&quot;</p>

<p>Yes these things are always listening, I read a couple of days ago that Shazam never turns the microphone off, then there is the idea of smart TVs with a camera and a microphone and internet sitting in your lounge room (well not mine, no tv at all)</p>

<p>People used to be scared of things like this, now it&#39;s sold as a feature.</p>

<p>No conspiracy. Right in front of your face. </p>

<p>Seriously, a Google search for &quot;Facebook listening&quot; will yield numerous articles. Everyone here on conspiracy, and they didn&#39;t already know this. Jeepers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not as spooky but something similiar happend to me. In early summer 2015 I was writing with a girl via whatsapp. Nothing special, just a lot of those kiss/blushed smileys and very nice words. And exactly at that time my Facebook feed was FLOODED with relationship/love/motivational posts that have been liked by the same few friends (they were in actual relationships). Once i stopped writing with that girl it has gotten less and less over time. I havent payed much attention to that, until i started to send more funny pics/memes to my friend, because then my FB feed was filled with shitty pics + videos/unfunny memes that again a small group of friends seemingly loved. For several months now i&#39;m pretty inactive in Whatsapp and therefore my facebook feed is also 99% of the time neutral.</p>

<p>okay, while I was writing this comment, my brain made a very spooky connection. A few weeks ago i jokingly said to my classmate that we should vote for the AfD next year, a (retarded &amp;) infamous right side populist party. I&#39;m not 100% sure about that, but at that time Facebook was constantly and only recommending me to like the FB-page of the AfD party leader. The thing is, i&#39;ve never installed any FB app on my new phone, neither does my classmate (he doesnt even have a Facebook profile). Again, i&#39;m not 100% sure about what&#39;s happening here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way late to the party on this but I had an interesting thing happen today. I read this post yesterday and told my girlfriend about it last night. We both thought it was interesting but couldn&#39;t think of examples of it happening to us. Today we got a car2go and were trying to figure out how to open the trunk. Had a whole conversation about it as it took a minute or two to find the proper latch. Anyhow we get home and she pulls out her phone and starts laughing. The first ad she sees is &quot;Top Ten Questions About Car2Go: How to open the trunk&quot;. That is one hell of a coincidence, if it is one.</p>

<p>Also another weird &quot;coincidence&quot; I&#39;ve been noticing. People I meet face to face and converse with have been showing up in my suggested friends. Not nearly as often as the ads but it&#39;s happening.</p>
