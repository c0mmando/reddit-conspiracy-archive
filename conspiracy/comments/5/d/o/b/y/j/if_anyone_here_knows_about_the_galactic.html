       Guys stop "chanelling" entities outside yourself they are mostly demonic as the darkness still has "control" chanel your own pure cosmic self...chanelling opens yourself up to possession consider yourself Warned by one with decades of experience traversing other realms and dimensions...the new age religion is a nwo plot to ensare good natured souls like your selves, it is possible to receive accurate information but stay the fuck away from "angels", "ascended masters", gods, goddesses, ets, etc.. just trust me you do not want them coming in to your etheric field or body

       Be careful with what you say man!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Channeling is perfectly healthy and it's all about intention and using your intuition and your gut feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Negative beings don't have that much control as to what we allude they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to positively channel light beings and consciousness. Bashar is a famous example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of people channel beings of light and there is nothing negative about it.

       Don't say I didn't warn you, you are playing with fire it's not that simple just because it doesn't seem negative of course they are going to appear helpful, bashsr is not okay, sure impresses people though doesn't he, he has been predicting shit for years that never happens I discovered him 6 years ago and he is a distraction

       We'll you have a lot to lose by following your curiosity, and everything to gain by being careful, right now especially they are really laying on the deception as their days are numbered, work with the trees, if you guys want to start opening up start there, don't just start inviting spirits into your consciousness they can lodge themselves in your body for years without you ever knowing it, all the while influencing you

       What do you have to lose by being careful? Focus on trees and animals and children, they are the real masters get off thencomputer and out of your head and go volunteer at the animal shelter or with some autistic children, they will enlighten you way more than "lightbeings", you are extremely ancient don't get hung up on some random other life where you were on snother planet, you're not defined by these terms like starseed

       I believe you are a star seed, a channel that agreed to do work in this life time to help humanity move through this dark point in time into the light we are all stepping into.

       These are not "demonic" beings. Satan doesn't exist. Only God, the true creator of us and this world, exists. While negative entities do exist, demonic entities aren't going to try to possess you or lead you astray like other posters are saying in this thread.

       Oh wow I just skimmed through it and I remember reading this months ago!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest it made me burst into tears because it made me realize how much it would mean to me to see a UFO or ET/extraterrestrial because it would confirm all my beliefs I've held true to my heart and have helped me get through life. It would confirm everything I've ever believed in and it would be so powerful. Thanks for sharing that again I'm going to read through it again tonight

       I'm curious what your beliefs are.

       Have they been showing themselves physically? In your dreams? Subletly through subliminals?

       They show themselves in the sky with lights and "stars." They (stars) will be stationary for ever then just start moving and fly away this happened 4 times. It all starts when i telepathically speak to them. It will start with small balls of light falling form the sky very near me. Then moving stars. And last I saw two stars completely fade. One twinkled at me to get my attention extremely bright and then immediately disappeared. Then did it one more time and disappeared.

       It sounds like they are trying to get your attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is usually the first step before channeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend you keep going forward with this but always pay attention to your intuition and gut feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust that you are safe. God is protecting you and you wouldn't be going down this path with how positive of a person you seem to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       To look at examples of channeling, please check out Bashar on YouTube channeled by Daryl.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bashar is from the Essessani alien race and Bashar is a future version of himself that is channeled by his old self (Daryl, the bald guy that channels) it's a trip but it's empowering and enlightening.

       I had something standing in my room holding something that looked like an unlit lantern chanting. It woke me up and when I opened my eyes to see wtf was making that weird sound it faded back into the darkness. This was a few years ago and seeing this tread made me remember it. I just always assumed it was evil.

       They are imposters do NOT contact them, contact positive tree and faerie spirits, this is a warning I have been battling them energetically they are serving the false deities and only appear to be benevolent, I'm not going to respond to anything else just trust me do your own research into the false new age religion you will find truth

       Be careful with what he said. This is why it's a touchy subject, people are quick to jump to negative influences to point to.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is positive in nature and I can tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use your intuition and gut check feeling to be sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem like a positively aligned person and by being a positive source of light you block out negative entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's still good to shield yourself in a veil of light (think of light showering down over your whole being)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you can know somethings true intention by making it clear what your intentions are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you continue with this, go into it with a positive mindset and make positive affirmations (I am safe, I choose not to contact negative entities, I am protected, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's only negative if you make it negative but it is important to protect yourself

       This is exactly how I feel. When I first started this I had fear and had to learn to push it away. They give me good energy and when I telepathically asked my galactic star family to show me soemtbing they did. I will tell them I love them and how beautiful they are. How they fill me with gratitude and happiness and love. You create your own realty and your mind is powerful. If you are negative and full of fear, that is how things will be.

       I'm glad you understand this.

      <p>
       I was relieved to see your post on how we create our own reality because knowing these spiritual truths is essential when in contact with other consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time I feel like they only show themselves when the person is ready. And I'd say you are ready. Because of your beliefs, intentions, and mind set.

       Thank you. Especially for you positivity. What he said up there had me alittle scared because I have thought of that, but I believe I have a higher calling and this is not a bad thing. I know someone who this started with and they had a encounter with a ball of light/energy that floated up to them and say there for a few moments and it filled this person with love and happiness and good energy. It moved away and they tried to follow but it zoomed away quickly and disappeared

       Being negative, scared, and fearful, attracts those same energies back towards you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step into this new area of your life with love, positivity, light, and abundance, and you will get that back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, "reality is what you make it" and we create it by the states of beings we are in and our thoughts words and actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go about this positively and you will have positive experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step into this with fear and the feeling it's demonic and that's what it will mimic.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a powerful spirit having a physical existence on this earth. Don't let any negativity cloud your positive judgement and strive to listen to your intuition

       I want to tell the damn world but 99 percent would say I'm crazy or have a mental illness! Hahaha, if you have any social media or anything you should add me or follow me, like I said PM me, I am trying to connect with as many spiritual enlightened individuals as I can, I am trying to help raise consciousness and I think that is my purpose or higher calling.

       have to meditate a looooot, physical &amp; creative activity, enough sleep, i ching, rune reading or tarot etc feel all's good, talk to yourself, universe or higher beings lots, need to 'feel' words, forget language, chant a lot with lots of emotion, feel your brain waves reaching out to others or move energy around (try healing small pains, it's not too hard)
      </p>
      <p>
       4 years ago in Iran heard few steps come up to me then a loud sound of different digital tones and a shock to my heart. Meditated a shit load and did i ching. Had out of body experience, saw another dimension with thousands of beings &amp; heard couple very scary/threatening noises before waking up. Was shown eye of horus in mind's eye, found out I'm a targeted individual, lot of organized stalking (for at least 4 years, got eve lorgens's 'reptilian possession symptoms which she's since updated; tptb's tech squeezed my heart a lot and controlled my vocal chords like Bashar but it was on classic possession voice and a virtual reality dream of being stabbed at the end) Spoke with a being who appeared in my mind's eye, we spoke in a made up language, I could feel his words and see gifs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I can heal muscle pains and move clouds and
       <strong>
        every time
       </strong>
       I meditate tptb with tech induce very painful feelings on my body and needle prick feelings when I'm trying to go to sleep or just waking up which is when magic happens. I'm basically electronically harassed when I take a shit &amp; stalked lots I'm just 22 I think win.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard the inter-dimensional experience was good guys taking back some territory, IDK. I wish we could compile experiences by being type/environment type /time/location or a sketch library...is it tapping into other simulations, locations, times, frequencies? are experiences pre-set like on a cycle according to our DNA build? can everything be explained? gah they have it all down to a science and I'm just starting out.
      </p>
