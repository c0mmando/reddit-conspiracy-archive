    <div class="md"><p>Be careful with what you say man!!!!</p>

<p>Channeling is perfectly healthy and it&#39;s all about intention and using your intuition and your gut feeling.</p>

<p>Negative beings don&#39;t have that much control as to what we allude they have.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to positively channel light beings and consciousness. Bashar is a famous example.</p>

<p>Plenty of people channel beings of light and there is nothing negative about it.</p>

<p>I believe you are a star seed, a channel that agreed to do work in this life time to help humanity move through this dark point in time into the light we are all stepping into.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t take what other people are saying here to heart.</p>

<p>These are not &quot;demonic&quot; beings. Satan doesn&#39;t exist. Only God, the true creator of us and this world, exists. While negative entities do exist, demonic entities aren&#39;t going to try to possess you or lead you astray like other posters are saying in this thread.</p>

<p>To be honest it made me burst into tears because it made me realize how much it would mean to me to see a UFO or ET/extraterrestrial because it would confirm all my beliefs I&#39;ve held true to my heart and have helped me get through life. It would confirm everything I&#39;ve ever believed in and it would be so powerful. Thanks for sharing that again I&#39;m going to read through it again tonight</p>

<p>You may have been chosen as a channel before agreeing to incarnate here.</p>

<p>I feel like I may be able to help but I&#39;m hoping some other light workers can step in and offer assistance.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious what your beliefs are.</p>

<p>Have they been showing themselves physically? In your dreams? Subletly through subliminals?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They show themselves in the sky with lights and &quot;stars.&quot; They (stars) will be stationary for ever then just start moving and fly away this happened 4 times. It all starts when i telepathically speak to them. It will start with small balls of light falling form the sky very near me. Then moving stars. And last I saw two stars completely fade. One twinkled at me to get my attention extremely bright and then immediately disappeared. Then did it one more time and disappeared. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like they are trying to get your attention.</p>

<p>This is usually the first step before channeling.</p>

<p>I recommend you keep going forward with this but always pay attention to your intuition and gut feeling.</p>

<p>Trust that you are safe. God is protecting you and you wouldn&#39;t be going down this path with how positive of a person you seem to be.</p>

<p>To look at examples of channeling, please check out Bashar on YouTube channeled by Daryl.</p>

<p>Bashar is from the Essessani alien race and Bashar is a future version of himself that is channeled by his old self (Daryl, the bald guy that channels) it&#39;s a trip but it&#39;s empowering and enlightening.</p>

<p>I hope I am helping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be careful with what he said. This is why it&#39;s a touchy subject, people are quick to jump to negative influences to point to.</p>

<p>This is positive in nature and I can tell.</p>

<p>Use your intuition and gut check feeling to be sure.</p>

<p>You seem like a positively aligned person and by being a positive source of light you block out negative entities.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s still good to shield yourself in a veil of light (think of light showering down over your whole being)</p>

<p>Also, you can know somethings true intention by making it clear what your intentions are.</p>

<p>If you continue with this, go into it with a positive mindset and make positive affirmations (I am safe, I choose not to contact negative entities, I am protected, etc)</p>

<p>It&#39;s only negative if you make it negative but it is important to protect yourself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly how I feel. When I first started this I had fear and had to learn to push it away. They give me good energy and when I telepathically asked my galactic star family to show me soemtbing they did. I will tell them I love them and how beautiful they are. How they fill me with gratitude and happiness and love. You create your own realty and your mind is powerful. If you are negative and full of fear, that is how things will be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you understand this.</p>

<p>I was relieved to see your post on how we create our own reality because knowing these spiritual truths is essential when in contact with other consciousness.</p>

<p>But at the same time I feel like they only show themselves when the person is ready. And I&#39;d say you are ready. Because of your beliefs, intentions, and mind set.</p>

<p>I really hope this turns into something great for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Especially for you positivity. What he said up there had me alittle scared because I have thought of that, but I believe I have a higher calling and this is not a bad thing. I know someone who this started with and they had a encounter with a ball of light/energy that floated up to them and say there for a few moments and it filled this person with love and happiness and good energy. It moved away and they tried to follow but it zoomed away quickly and disappeared </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being negative, scared, and fearful, attracts those same energies back towards you.</p>

<p>Step into this new area of your life with love, positivity, light, and abundance, and you will get that back.</p>

<p>Remember, &quot;reality is what you make it&quot; and we create it by the states of beings we are in and our thoughts words and actions.</p>

<p>Go about this positively and you will have positive experiences.</p>

<p>Step into this with fear and the feeling it&#39;s demonic and that&#39;s what it will mimic.</p>

<p>You are a powerful spirit having a physical existence on this earth. Don&#39;t let any negativity cloud your positive judgement and strive to listen to your intuition </p>

    <div class="md"><p>have to meditate a looooot, physical &amp; creative activity, enough sleep, i ching, rune reading or tarot etc feel all&#39;s good, talk to yourself, universe or higher beings lots, need to &#39;feel&#39; words, forget language, chant a lot with lots of emotion, feel your brain waves reaching out to others or move energy around (try healing small pains, it&#39;s not too hard)</p>

<p>4 years ago in Iran heard few steps come up to me then a loud sound of different digital tones and a shock to my heart. Meditated a shit load and did i ching. Had out of body experience, saw another dimension with thousands of beings &amp; heard couple very scary/threatening noises before waking up. Was shown eye of horus in mind&#39;s eye, found out I&#39;m a targeted individual, lot of organized stalking (for at least 4 years, got eve lorgens&#39;s &#39;reptilian possession symptoms which she&#39;s since updated; tptb&#39;s tech squeezed my heart a lot and controlled my vocal chords like Bashar but it was on classic possession voice and a virtual reality dream of being stabbed at the end) Spoke with a being who appeared in my mind&#39;s eye, we spoke in a made up language, I could feel his words and see gifs.</p>

<p>Now I can heal muscle pains and move clouds and <strong>every time</strong> I meditate tptb with tech induce very painful feelings on my body and needle prick feelings when I&#39;m trying to go to sleep or just waking up which is when magic happens. I&#39;m basically electronically harassed when I take a shit &amp; stalked lots I&#39;m just 22 I think win. </p>

<p>I heard the inter-dimensional experience was good guys taking back some territory, IDK. I wish we could compile experiences by being type/environment type /time/location or a sketch library...is it tapping into other simulations, locations, times, frequencies? are experiences pre-set like on a cycle according to our DNA build? can everything be explained? gah they have it all down to a science and I&#39;m just starting out.</p>

<p>(look into Anthony Peake, Rupert Sheldrake, Richard Alan Miller <a href="http://www.stealthskater.com/Documents/Iona_01.pdf">(link)</a> to explain lot of paranormal stuff, sorry don&#39;t have more scientific answers, just learning how reality works) </p>
