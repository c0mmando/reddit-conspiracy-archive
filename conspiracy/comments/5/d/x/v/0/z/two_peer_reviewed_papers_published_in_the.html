<p><strong>Canadian Civil Engineering Researchers Disprove Official Explanation of WTC 7’s Destruction</strong></p>

<p>Noting the many shortcomings in Bažant&#39;s analysis, which have been studied and criticized extensively since 2001, Korol and his colleagues set out to apply a much more rigorous methodology for analyzing WTC 7, which, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), collapsed from normal office fires.</p>

<p>Korol and his colleagues set out to apply a much more rigorous methodology for analyzing WTC 7.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Robert Korol, professor emeritus of civil engineering at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and a fellow of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering, has led a team of academic researchers in preparing two peer-reviewed scientific papers on the destruction of World Trade Center Building 7. Both papers were published in the Challenge Journal of Structural Mechanics — the first one in July 2015, the second in February 2016.</p>

<p>Prior to publishing these papers, the team of researchers carefully reviewed the work of Zdeněk Bažant, a professor of Civil Engineering and Materials Science at Northwestern University, who had published a paper shortly after 9/11 focusing on the collapses of WTC 1 and 2. Entitled “Why Did the World Trade Center Collapse?—Simple Analysis,” Bažant’s paper presented “a simplified approximate analysis of the overall collapse of the towers of World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 2001.”</p>

<p>Noting the many shortcomings in Bažant&#39;s analysis, which have been studied and criticized extensively since 2001, Korol and his colleagues set out to apply a much more rigorous methodology for analyzing WTC 7, which, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), collapsed from normal office fires. As Korol explains, “WTC 7 is a particularly useful example, because there isn&#39;t the concern about trying to predict the amount of heat generated by spewing jet fuel and having it ignited within a building. It&#39;s the materials within the building that generate the heat release.”</p>

<p>The greater certainty about the material properties involved would allow the team to evaluate whether WTC 7 could have collapsed as a result of burning materials being ejected from WTC 1 and igniting fires on the 12th and 13th floors. The team’s analysis eventually led them to conclude that even with very high estimates for the amount of combustible materials present in office buildings — using the maximum amounts allowed in the building codes — and making many other generous assumptions, such as having two floors “totally ablaze with raging inferno fires,” WTC 7 still would not collapse.</p>

<p>NIST could not have been correct in claiming that such a failure mechanism could have resulted in the collapse.</p>

<p>Korol’s July 2015 paper, <a href="http://www.challengejournal.com/index.php/cjsmec/article/download/36/19">“Performance-based fire protection of office buildings: A case study based on the collapse of WTC 7,”</a> used accepted equations associated with thermodynamics and heat transfer to determine how much heat could be generated from office fires. Studying the type of fire that would occur in a typical office arrangement with cubicle partitions, he and his fellow researchers derived the temperature that would have been reached based on the heat release rate of combustible materials identified by NIST and others.</p>

<p>Given that high burn rates do not generally last longer than about 30 minutes and that fires in office buildings do not occur over entire floors simultaneously, Korol says that the assumption of having the entire area of the 12th and 13th floors ablaze was “a ridiculously conservative estimate for the purposes of determining the consequences to the building.” Even then, the researchers showed the temperatures to be insufficient to push a girder off its seat near Column 79, thus disproving NIST’s claim that such a failure mechanism initiated the collapse of the building.</p>

<p>In the subsequent February 2016 paper, <a href="http://www.challengejournal.com/index.php/cjsmec/article/download/50/41">“The collapse of WTC 7: A re-examination of the “simple analysis” approach,”</a> Korol considered the “virtually impossible circumstance” that the building experienced an inferno on two adjacent stories simultaneously. Noting that collapses do not occur instantaneously, Korol explains that even if two-thirds of the columns in a building are somehow “wiped out by virtue of the high heat, then the remaining one-third would still be sufficient to prevent collapse.”</p>

<p>According to Korol, Bažant assumed that any possible collapse would only be localized in the form of a plastic hinge; however, Korol’s team went further in terms of assessing the capacity of the columns. “Whereas Bažant assumed that there was only bending energy, we say these columns were resisting load axially — and Bažant ignored that.”</p>

<p>Robert Korol 2Dr. Korol has done extensive research on the axial loading properties of steel columns and beams. He appeared in the documentary “9/11 in the Academic Community,” and is seen here in his laboratory in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p>Korol’s team painstakingly analyzed what would happen if WTC 7 experienced fire-induced failures of more than two-thirds of the columns on both floors 12 and 13. The researchers performed lab tests to determine the amount of resistance for the upper block of WTC 7 to come down to the floor level of story 13. Assuming that the floor slabs of floors 12 and 13 were so hot that the concrete was pulverized without any applied load (an unrealistically generous assumption), the only energy associated with the structure in those two stories would have been that of the 26 columns that had not yet failed. Accounting for the remaining amount of resistance in the building, Korol et al. found that while the 11th story would collapse, there was still enough remaining energy in the building that the structure would not fail below that point.</p>

<p>Korol and his colleagues also undertook tests at McMaster University with regard to pulverization of concrete that is typically specified for floors incorporating ductile steel to restrain lateral motion. He explains, “Crushing is not an effective way of transforming brittle material into pulverized material. When you combine that with the 82 columns, there is no way the building is going to come down.”</p>

<p>Dr. Korol and his team are not yet done with their work. They are now conducting a study of the potential for fire-induced collapse of steel-framed office buildings in general, using a 50-story building as an example. The study will examine eight different fire scenarios, four of which will consider 4 adjacent stories experiencing raging fires as might be conceived from airplane strikes at various height locations. This work builds on the research described in the two papers discussed here — and none of the scenarios being studied has resulted in a complete building collapse.</p>

<p>The question that remains to be answered is whether Korol’s peers in their engineering community will begin to pay attention — or if they will, instead, continue to accept on blind faith NIST’s fantastical explanation for the destruction of WTC 7. - <strong>by Mike Bondi, P.Eng.</strong></p>

<pre><code>                                        Conclusions
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<p>By applying the principles inherent in performance based design to a localized area of a structure deemed to have been the trigger that resulted in cascading failures
and thence collapse of a building (WTC 7), our investigation was meant to confirm or deny such a conclusion reached by NIST based on their costly and time-consuming Fire Dynamics Simulator software package.</p>

<p>By employing basic thermodynamic principles, equations appropriate to heat flow, together with the combustion properties of materials of wood and plastic-based fuel
sources, and normal structural and fire resisting material properties, <strong>we came to the opposite conclusion to that of NIST, namely that, regardless of fuel loading chosen, or which of three thicknesses of SFRM selected, fires alone could not have caused the commencement of the collapse of Building 7 at the location cited.</strong></p>

<p>To arrive at such a conclusion, we made the key assumption, not challenged by NIST, that SFRM was employed and was intact during the fire event on 9/11. We
also made the assumption that the heat release rates of fires were intense and constant for duration times of 25 or 30 minutes and impinged structural surfaces in the form of radiation and circulating hot gases with a constant temperature determined by the fuel load assumed and the distance of the ceiling above any given cubicle’s partition height. </p>

<p>At the end of the burn period, we concluded that floor beam K3004, located on the 13 th floor, and which was exposed to hot flames in the 12 storey, either over its half length or even its full length, could not have elongated enough to cause a crucial walk-off of its adjoining girder. This conclusion is valid, whether or not shear connectors were present or not.</p>

<pre><code>                               Conclusions
</code></pre>

<p>Our objective at the beginning of the study was to simply investigate whether there was enough energy dissipative capacity in the 47 storey WTC 7 high rise
steel frame structure to offset its gravitational potential energy for the case of an extreme fire loading event. </p>

<p>As noted by NIST in their NCSTAR 1-9 report, very hot fires are claimed to have been present in the 12 th and 13 th floors for several hours during the late morning and afternoon of 9/11 sufficient in fact to cause the total collapse of the building.</p>

<p>The authors decided to revisit the problem to ascertain for ourselves whether the structure’s demise could have happened under conditions of two storeys being substantially weakened by the heat.</p>

<p><strong>Regarding our focus on gravitational potential energy versus the dissipative energy possessed by the structure, we found that the former was insufficient to cause a total collapse scenario to occur by a factor of 4.</strong></p>

<p>The question then morphed into a more detailed analysis whereby we
wanted to know the extent of a partial collapse. Indeed, our assumptions and analysis <strong>based on Newtonian mechanics clearly show that a very limited partial collapse would have been possible but that it would have been restricted to the storeys in which the fires occurred and to the one below.</strong> </p>

<p>Some might argue that an upper storey would have been more vulnerable, however, the column sizes involved were so little different, we decided to
adopt the Bazant hypothesis that crush-down would take precedence over crush-up. As noted, our progressive collapse investigation involved a storey-by-storey analysis that was initiated with Block A, the base of
which was presumed to be the 14th floor. It was presumed that a crush-down descent would begin with the equivalent of only 27 columns capable of resisting the
column and service loadings that the design engineering firm, Irwin Castor, prescribed in their loading schedule for dead and live loads. This number was based on the design possessing an overall factor of safety of 3, a not unreasonable factor that is consistent with building code standards in general. </p>

<p>As well, we treated perimeter and core columns as being equally loaded across floor areas that were vulnerable, since WTC 7 is known to have
come straight down as observed by video cameras.</p>
