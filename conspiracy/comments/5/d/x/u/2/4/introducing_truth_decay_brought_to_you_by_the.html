        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s this group&#39;s CEO who is pushing the phrase &quot;truth decay,&quot; which in his words goes: &quot;When everybody has their own facts, then nobody really has any facts at all.&quot; The more complete quote is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is to me really a dangerous and unusual time in history. Because Americans not only feel entitled to their opinions—and rightly so—but many of them, a growing number of them, frankly, across the political spectrum also feel entitled to cherry pick facts to support their opinion, or even commission up new &#39;facts&#39; if necessary,” Rich said. “…When everyone has their own facts, then nobody really has any facts at all.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His argument really boils down to a critique of critical thinking itself. After all, doesn&#39;t this entail reading a variety of facts, analyzing them, and coming to a logical conclusion? But, this guy calls this activity &quot;dangerous.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><em>So who is this guy?</em></strong></p>

<p>His name is <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelDRich">Michel Rich</a>, CEO of the RAND Corporation.</p>

<p><strong><em>What&#39;s the RAND Corporation?</em></strong></p>

<p>The Rand Corporation is almost synonymous with the US military, and is the same institute that worked with the CIA to institute <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=g19YFuKqKeUC&amp;pg=PT34&amp;dq=rand+mk+ultra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS-8nAp7fQAhVHvI8KHfc-AOYQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rand%20mk%20ultra&amp;f=false">MK Ultra</a>, the mind control program. <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/22120/rand-corporation-think-tank-controls-america">Mental Floss</a> deemed it, &quot;The Think Tank that Controls America.&quot; </p>

<p>Some of <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_tavistock05.htm">RAND’s clients</a> include the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T)</p>

<p>Chase Manhattan Bank</p>

<p>International Business Machines (IBM)</p>

<p>National Science Foundation</p>

<p>Republican Party</p>

<p>TRW</p>

<p>U.S. Air Force</p>

<p>U.S. Department of Energy</p>

<p>U.S. Department of Health</p>

<p>There are literally THOUSANDS of highly important companies, government institutions and organizations that make use of RAND’s services, and to list them all would be an impossible task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RAND, however, is actually an institution of a much larger consortium. It belongs to a group started by the British Military called...<a href="http://educate-yourself.org/nwo/nwotavistockbestkeptsecret.shtml"> Tavistock</a>. You might want to go down that rabbit hole sometime. But this is the same group that also tried silencing criticism of anyone Jewish as them being <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dPwBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT80&amp;dq=tavistock+soros&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi90a26qrfQAhXGro8KHZrMC-gQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tavistock%20soros&amp;f=false">Anti-semitic,</a> a play that we&#39;re seeing now with specific Trump picks like Bannon. </p>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR: The recent push to claim that people are reading &quot;fake news&quot; and participating in &quot;truth decay&quot; comes from the same quasi-military government institutions that engaged in mind control and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">gave such techniques</a> to dictators around the world.</em></strong> </p>

<p>Stay vigilant, everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t realize how un-democratic the modern US and &quot;free world&quot; has been. Real democracy is fractious and humans are prone to believing in their versions of the Truth. </p>

<p>This is the whingeing of the elite. They have or are losing the ability to shape the meaning of life for the mass of men. As much as they try to centralize and control the production of the myths that form identity, they really never can. And that terrifies them, especially as it becomes more apparent that many of the great fortunes and positions in the world are acquired through criminal means. </p>

<p>The RAND Corporation -Tavistock Institute are one of the leading purveyors of disinformation bullshit of the last several decades. They are literally paid to hide the truth from the public.</p>

Usually in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> if someone is going to downvote they will at least post in here letting you know why or if there are holes in your story.
