<p>hope you are well. i sopied ou in on a little email i sent to III. he got screwed ovc. 
with: . just like and countless others...</p>

<p>the pictures will help. you will see that they haVe a group of sexual predators, deviants ruftil 
rampant over there. no, they are not jamming guys in the ass persay, but they are ****/C.1;</p>

<p>judgenment. i think guys in this business are pretty much some of the best and some of (kw 
worst. it is the companies responsibility to prtect the good from the bad until they show 
ugly heads and can be removed. in this case the ugly ones are running the damn thing or in 
case of joe or donna are too clueless to recognize the truth or has no power to change it. </p>

<p>in the event Mfails to inform you. peeing on people, eating potato chips out of ass cracks. 
vodka shots out of ass cracks (there is video of that one), broken doors after driiken bravrlf; 
threats and intimidation from those leaders participating in this activity.:people 
have 1.-) 
terminated, like because he would not play their games and his slip up gave then 
to get rid of him. </p>

<p>i know this entire thing is going to make life less, bearable over there for all of us. i&#39;ll 
alcohol to some sane, accountable leadership. i am heading back on wed p.m. before !( 
want you to know that their are some good people over there doing great work. we are it;). 
scouts but there should be some exectation of professionalism in ones leadership. AGNA </p>

<p>been blind to all this and those good people are getting worn out and chewed up over it all. 
way the DOS has turned their backs to the guys on the ground and let the prostitution and g;, 
shit continue. (note:i have not spoken to them, but i know over all this time someone had to </p>

<p>drop that dime.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stay strong bother/sister, don&#39;t let the fear get to you...medicate yourself with something maybe (even habits) you get used to the fear after a while and want to experience even more maybe :P take a break, I will pray for you (am not bad at healing) I think your ESP gets stronger when you can see the bigger picture so that&#39;s a good thing (try visualizing what you want)</p>

<p>They squeezed my heart 20 times, caused forced speech, induced a virtual reality dream of being stabbed, gangstalk and V2K to people around me a lot, induced some very painful sensations and lot of needle prick feelings for months basically when I shit.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll like the newest Higherside Chats episode with Anthony Peake, basically a lot of people even scientists have had NDEs, OBEs, SHARED UFO experiences and various matrix glitches. He argues as people get old, in a way they are evolving into a child (ending of Kubrick&#39;s 2001: a space odyssey, His theory of energy fields surrounding beings is similar to Rupert Sheldrake&#39;s <a href="https://www.lifepositive.com/in-resonance/">morphic resonance theory</a>) People with Alzheimer and 3 year olds have many experiences of seeing &quot;little people&quot; (as the monster in the closet or kids singing) also classic grey experiences, I think it&#39;s safe to say there is something more to this reality. His new book talks about how Schizophrenia is opening the doors of perception (a play on Huxley&#39;s doors of perception, he&#39;s updated it with many modern scientific cases) where the veil is completely lifted and these entities speak to individuals until they drive them mad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my personal experience, the use of cannabis and psychedelics was the cause of this kind of thinking, and very shortly after i stopped everything calmed down and started to make sense again. Psychoactives are strong and make it tricky to stay coherent. I appreciate their effects but I advocate sobriety. Psychological issues are different though.
