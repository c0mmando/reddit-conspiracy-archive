    <div class="md"><p>Just so everyone knows, a kickstarter for this can be done, but Ed has also stated the following Thursday 11/17 on his Facebook account: <strong>&quot;LOL, ya know if 5% of the folks that listened to my pizzagate show and are all so outraged about it, just bought a 3 month subscription to The Opperman Report I could put together a team of investigators and PR to blow that thing wide open. Not even 5% maybe 1%&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>He is NOT joking nor is he making a plea just to get listeners. On his Pizzagate podcast he got over 20,000 listeners and if each one contributed just a dollar this would have been a done deal.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve literally put my money where my mouth is to support this initiative and implore others to do the same if they are sincere about hiring on a dedicated private investigator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kickstarter would take time, but provide a lump sum. Whereas if people became members of the Opperman Report they&#39;d get exclusive access to podcasts Ed does for the members while supporting the work he does. He&#39;s the genuine article folks and he stated publicly 2 weeks ago that he had just a received a serious and credible threat to his life doing what he does best gathering and disseminating great information.</p>

<p>It was Ed Opperman who sought out and interviewed Courtney Love&#39;s father Hank Harrison who stated that Courtney Love was &quot;dating&quot; a CIA agent when she was underage. Harrison further corroborated that when she was a child, Love also attended the Presidio Child Development Center during the rampant paedophile assaults that occurred there and may herself have been a victim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think from a practical standpoint for those who are specifically wishing to fund Ed for the pizzagate investigation, the kickstarter option is best.  Still no guarantee that the every dime will immediately be spent on pizzagate but if that is what people want and there is a way to make it very clear publicly that THAT is why they are donating, I think that more people would feel comfortable and contribute.  </p>

<p>Perhaps make a donation option on Kickstarter that includes access to Ed&#39;s content at higher donation levels?  That way those that want to &quot;hire&quot; him for pizzagate but also wish to fund his other operations could do so.  Not sure if this is possible but trying to suggest solutions.</p>

<p>On a serious note, THIS is the best way to get stuff done. Don&#39;t blow whistles, don&#39;t sneak around in the back lines. Don&#39;t be covert. Just stand far out in the open and visibly announce yourself and declare your intent and let true transparency be your protection.</p>

<p>We hope. Hillary was trying to start WW3, I honestly think in part to kill off a good chunk of us.</p>

<p>This should be pizzagate&#39;s motto. It draws attention to gravity of the situation, emphasizes our numbers, shows how low they will go, and is a great rallying call.</p>

<p>Truth requires exposing what is going on and love requires that we hold them accountable.</p>

<p>Also, not operating from a place of fear as that is a primary means of control they use to keep the very unhealthy status quo in place.  So continue to research, continue to share info, continue to discuss as openly as possible what is found.  There is strength in numbers in this regard.  </p>

<p>Right. We need to organize and package this in a way to post it in other subs and to sell it as an investment. This needs to be something people will see tangible results from and that needs to be included in the terms of the Kickstarter or however we choose to package it.</p>

<p>20k people will expect different results, so we need to be clear with the extent of what team is being formed, the depth they are willing to go (e.g. are they going to actually go to Haiti and truly investigate?), and the results should be in a clear concise and easily understandable format along with whatever evidence is found.</p>

<p>I respectfully disagree. The public light adds a layer of protection, but I do understand that it also can fuck things up if we have a crappy investigation. </p>

Someone has contacted me privately, I think it&#39;s the guy who created the first thread. Let me talk to him and we&#39;ll explore this. Until then you should pull the thread before it gets out of hand and we create an unnecessary mess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to pick one way to contribute and package it in a way to easily spread the word. I&#39;m willing to contribute but I don&#39;t like blindly throwing money.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also curious about the $20,000 number. $20,000 is only a drop in a bucket. Think about it in terms of salaries. $20,000 is generally less than two people&#39;s salaries working full time for less than a third of a year,  and he says he would organize a team? Idk if that adds up right. What kind of investigation are we getting for our money?</p>
