       Hey, I'm not a usual around here(Though I have been looking through lately), Sorry about coming in out of nowhere but I don't know where else to post this and it's been bothering me for months now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've known about the small group of people who discuss if a flat earth is possible for a few years now. Came across them researching something else and none of them seemed truly convinced. However in the last, 6 months? MAYBE year? I've been noticing that "These crazy people believe the earth is flat still" has been popping up, Mostly from popular websites and videos. Maybe they're just running out of content and also found those people at random like me. But it seemed like out of nowhere it became commonplace, Even people I knew asked if I had heard about these "delusional people". It was very jarring to me. I heard somewhere the theory it was to discredit conspiracy theorist, Seems plausible at least. What do you think? Have you noticed it as well?

       It comes in waves, some days there will be 12 different flat earth posts here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and often there are 0. It is, in my opinion, like you suggested - a nonsense theory that's promoted to discredit truth seekers. As a result of this, there are real people who believe it, but the theory doesn't thrive outside of message boards and youtube.

       YouTube started pushing the $#!&amp; out of it 6+ months ago.  Whenever I would look up any "conspiracy" or "alternative history" topics, YouTube would flood my recommended videos with flat earth nonsense.  I watched several hours of it a couple years ago, but found that it was mostly (all) ignorant nonsense.  Lately, it's been very discouraging, that they either A. Found enough trolls to shill it, or B. Found enough fools ignorant enough to believe it.  I suspect that many of the "believers" are churchies, but I haven't confirmed it.

       YES! My Youtube also started to get flooded with it about that time, Even my suggestions on a unrelated video.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's a mixture of those three things.

       I am going to put it as simple as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the Flat Earth crowd draws its information and evidence from Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Sphere Earth crowds will rely on academic scientific journals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it illegal to fly over or visit Antarctica? Our nations have continually signed treaties there, yet will massacre for oil. Most top academic institutions are to heavily invested in conventional thinking and will suppress a lot of ideas that discredit and rewrite history. This is both a Psychological obstacle, and history points that a lot of Scientist can and have been bought by special interest multinational corporations.

       Antarctica holds the key to bust the myth(or cement the fact) of flat earth...why is it that in the wake of this collective conversation has the UN declared antarctica off limits???

       There are several explanations that should come to mind regarding why Antarctica might be off limits, prior to making the assumption that it's because the Earth is flat.

       It's a possibility that should be investigated. Sounds far fetched, but so does human existence. Anytime that dismisses it without asking questions is buying into the brainwashing. Question everything.

       How on earth (haha) could you state unequivocally that it is 100%BS unless you personally have been to outer space to see with your own eyes? The Bedford Level and various "tall buildings that should not be visible from more than X miles away" are fairly substantial evidence that at least the curvature and measurements we've been given are not correct.

       Flat earth really is non sense. As a fan of conspiracy theories , I look for the crazy hard to believe stuff . I don't believe it all just like to be entertained but the flat earth movement is just plain dumb. So many flaws in it. It seems common sense goes out the window.
