<p>I&#39;ve known about the small group of people who discuss if a flat earth is possible for a few years now. Came across them researching something else and none of them seemed truly convinced. However in the last, 6 months? MAYBE year? I&#39;ve been noticing that &quot;These crazy people believe the earth is flat still&quot; has been popping up, Mostly from popular websites and videos. Maybe they&#39;re just running out of content and also found those people at random like me. But it seemed like out of nowhere it became commonplace, Even people I knew asked if I had heard about these &quot;delusional people&quot;. It was very jarring to me. I heard somewhere the theory it was to discredit conspiracy theorist, Seems plausible at least. What do you think? Have you noticed it as well?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It comes in waves, some days there will be 12 different flat earth posts here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and often there are 0. It is, in my opinion, like you suggested - a nonsense theory that&#39;s promoted to discredit truth seekers. As a result of this, there are real people who believe it, but the theory doesn&#39;t thrive outside of message boards and youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTube started pushing the $#!&amp; out of it 6+ months ago.  Whenever I would look up any &quot;conspiracy&quot; or &quot;alternative history&quot; topics, YouTube would flood my recommended videos with flat earth nonsense.  I watched several hours of it a couple years ago, but found that it was mostly (all) ignorant nonsense.  Lately, it&#39;s been very discouraging, that they either A. Found enough trolls to shill it, or B. Found enough fools ignorant enough to believe it.  I suspect that many of the &quot;believers&quot; are churchies, but I haven&#39;t confirmed it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to put it as simple as possible.</p>

<p>Most of the Flat Earth crowd draws its information and evidence from Antarctica. </p>

<p>Most Sphere Earth crowds will rely on academic scientific journals.</p>

<p>Why is it illegal to fly over or visit Antarctica? Our nations have continually signed treaties there, yet will massacre for oil. Most top academic institutions are to heavily invested in conventional thinking and will suppress a lot of ideas that discredit and rewrite history. This is both a Psychological obstacle, and history points that a lot of Scientist can and have been bought by special interest multinational corporations. </p>

<h1>IMO</h1>

<p>Antarctica holds the key to bust the myth(or cement the fact) of flat earth...why is it that in the wake of this collective conversation has the UN declared antarctica off limits???</p>
