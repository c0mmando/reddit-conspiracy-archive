       I'm spiritual, and believe in intelligent creation, the Aether, and the Universal mind, along with many other "pagan" beliefs. I think both religious dogma and pure secularism are the Achilles heel of humans. Former Catholic, btw...

       No, I do not believe in Darwinian evolution. I think humans have been here for millions of years, and we do not come from apes... Spark the debate all you want, I encourage it. I'm free with talking about my thoughts.

       Thanks for the offer, but I have no significant information regarding 6 Day Creationism or creation in general. I have pulled together some Biblical texts that help to support 6 Day Creationism, but my argument would hold less water than a sift.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your perspective is interesting. I've never heard of a non-Darwinian perspective about creation, that didn't sound too mythical. Most theories come across as "...and one day, god #1 had a chat with god #2, and then they fought. Each drop of blood turned into a planet, and blah blah blah.". I'll probably look up yours some day just to familiarize myself with it.

       I'm pretty drunk right now, yo. But I'll paraphrase a brilliant comment that was posted to me on this topic, some time ago and in another place. We are all energy, and energy cannot be created nor destroyed (SCIENCE!!). Think  of the universe a punch bowl. When you die, pieces of your spirit being get places back in and scooped back to existence. It's not you, your physical "being", but your spiritual being. Disconnect from the notion you, and you have some more inside. Ying\Yang, duality. Spirit being v. vessel. IMO, our spirits chose to be here for a reason, a test. This has been going on for millions and millions of years. Think of those who have "past" life experiences....

       I'm secular and find it annoying when some conspiracy theory starts off with something fairly reasonable and I'm getting sucked in and then it suddenly  (for no apparent reason) starts going on about jews or something and using god terminology a lot. It's like, where did I miss the turn (logically speaking). It completely ruins it for me. I'm trying to ascertain human motivation and they just pull the rug out from under me.  It's a lot like racism.  Just blaming a group for no good reason.

       In my experience the religion isn't the reason.  It's usually just a convenient descriptor.  Two groups fighting over some resources.  On happens to be Muslims and the other is a bunch of jews. The religion is secondary and is used to convince recruits. But not really more than that. There's nothing in the religious texts saying anything about the conspiratorial activities.

       I'm not a subscriber, but I believe that several of these conspiracies are preparations for end times. I think that we will see the last week of Daniel in our life times.
      </p>
      <p>
       An interesting idea in all of this is Chuck Missler, who has been speaking about the end times for a long time, and he is a former director of the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, I think that the Democrats and the Republicans are each under the control of opposing dark lords, who are battling for control of the USA.

       Former agnostic/atheist turned Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like the truth of Christ was purposely hidden/tainted all my life, which to me, is the ultimate conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel there is definitely a synagogue of Satan and the prophecies of the new testament are just...uncanny.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have finally started reading the bible for myself and everything I was told about it was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still in a sense skeptical. If I'm wrong, I don't really feel it will matter. Besides, my ultimate goal is to actually be a true followed of Christ in the sense that I develop true love and compassion for all. That's not easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, I feel "Christians" have fucked Christianity so badly. I feel there are very few true Christians. Many twist the bible to their advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion is not important to me though. Spirituality is of the utmost importance to me.
      </p>

       By the way, I definitely think it is important to be critical and skeptical of all religious teachings. I definitely am constantly researching and exploring. I also think it's important to study all religions, philosophies, etc. For example, I definitely uphold a lot of the tenets of Buddhism but wouldn't lable myself a Buddhist.

       I grew up SDA (type of christian), but today consider myself an agnostic with various theories on how to make sense of many clashing concepts I'm presented with.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my theories makes the guess that real humans created, what I call low humans, and they lorded over them from the safety of space before a revolt cursed them to have to hide amongst their creations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another theory has to do with planet X- that every time it comes around our two planets war. Perhaps theirs is a transhuman species, which leaves its tech behind after the wars. Perhaps every time the planet "comes back around again", that tech comes to life, which would explain why we humans suddenly advanced in technology so rapidly almost a century ago. Jokes on us. if we put the tec into ourselves, and then get controlled into turning on the rest of humanity. Divide and conquer before the war even begins :(
      </p>

       I was thinking of writing a sci-fi based on my ideas, but I never read fiction and I won't write it either (by principle).
I often find myself wondering, if Adam and Eve were kicked out of the garden (which was eastward of Eden), and had to till the soil to have food, then what were they eating before? 3D printed food maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to this idea of end times and climactic battles, some christian interpretations of prophecy support that idea and some don't. If I had to side with one, I'd say I am partial to historicism. It's a post-millenial, post tribulation rapture type idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, doesn't the Bible say the end will come like a theif in the night? I suppose that negates Historicism's premise, but it also negates the premise of papal authority :p
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, if God were real, religion wouldn't be true ;)

       I'm atheist.  Former Christian.  If the antichrist or Armageddon are mentioned, can't buy it.  I haven't seen much of it since Trump was elected.  But, it's coming.  Pretty much inevitable.

       Jesus of Nazareth is more well-documented from an historical POV than any other ancient figure. It's a pretty untenable position you've got there, to be honest. If we throw Jesus out, it is just as reasonable to assume that Alexander the Great and Augustus Caesar didn't exist.

       You're terribly misinformed. The four canonical Gospels, Josephus (most likely partially edited but with a valid core), Tacitus, and the Pauline letters all predate AD 200.

       How many sources documenting Alexander within 200 years of his purported lifetime can you find?

       Christianity as it is known today has been compromised to serve the evil forces of this world.  What we think of as the christ is really coded information about the psychedelic mushrooms that brought about enlightenment and prophecal visions.

       Im a seeker of truth. so the only thing that come close for me is Gnosticism. There is a source that created everything some where near the galactic core of the universe, but I dont believe it has anything to do with a personal savior. Its more like Aeon. (current of energy)

       I became a believer (born again) from being raised Catholic. The gospel was made personal, God asking me to accept His sacrifice on my behalf, to make up for how I inevitably sinned against Him, restoring peace between us.  I was encouraged not to depend on people telling me what the Bible said, but to study myself. This was all genuine and have grown in my understanding and closeness to God over many trying years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who tries to read the Bible knows immediately it is not easy to understand or follow. There are ancient, forgotten cultures and customs. So, although I was reading more directly myself, I did depend on presentations and commentaries from biblical experts. In those early days I learned about these end time prophecies. I found them fascinating, compelling and motivating to seek the safety of God's protection and salvation.  As years have gone by, the vague, incomprehensible series of events that were to come have been falling into place.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is not to say all Christians agree on how things will happen and who/what imagery is depicting, but there is general consensus about many things. Things that were impossible technologically, historically, and politically. I will list items described to me in the late 70's.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        People will no longer use cash to buy or sell.
       </li>
       <li>
        There will be a marked increase in knowledge.
       </li>
       <li>
        Satan will rule the world through an Anti-Christ like figure heading the one world order.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        This leader will require everyone to accept a mark (on their hand or forehead), in order to buy or sell.
       </li>
       <li>
        This mark is related to the numbers 666 and it is called "the mark of the Beast".
       </li>
       <li>
        At some point when the prophecy is close to ending, all those who are God's (have believed in Him and trust in His sacrifice to save them from being separated from God), will be taken up by God from the world.  There are movies about these events).
       </li>
       <li>
        Accepting the mark of the Beast is a form of rejecting God's salvation and siding with Satan.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Jewish people would return to the land of Israel. This had happened in the last couple of decades at the time and brought much validation to the expected prophecies.
       </li>
       <li>
        The desert in Israel would be made to bloom.
       </li>
       <li>
        There will be wars and natural disasters. Recently I have wondered if these will be the result of climate change.
       </li>
       <li>
        There are many harsh judgments which are described in fantastical terms and creatures. I have wondered when I read about science creating human/animal (genetic manipulation) hybrids with no sentience and the use of drones.
       </li>
       <li>
        The AntiChrist will take over the temple in Jerusalem and sit in it, which is an extreme blasphemy to God.
       </li>
       <li>
        There will be a world war centering around Israel.
       </li>
       <li>
        A one million man army from the north will attack Israel in the battle called Armageddon. Casualties will be massive and blood will run and fill the valley.
       </li>
       <li>
        Jesus will return in His resurrected /glorified body and fight/defeat Satan saving any believers that have turned to Him over this time called, the tribulation.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There are many more prophecies but I think these can get you started.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you will be intrigued enough to search all this out and look around you. Satanists are in the highest levels of govt pushing a one world order agenda. Is that just too close to what was foretold to be anything but true?!!!
