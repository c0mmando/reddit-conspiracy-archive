        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The problem is that we have become too smart. Not only do we have more accurate information, but we got it flowing through too many channels and they don&#39;t know what to do. They can&#39;t stop it because the light is too bright on it and we will see them. </p>

<p>I think we need to be hyper-vigilant now because they will eventually be forced to make themselves over either through new websites, aka VICE and TYT as examples, but people have to not bite. The true independent media is the future and that future is starting to take affect now more than ever. We all feel it. All the hard work put in by all the warriors of truth out there is now going mainstream. What a time to be alive!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more complicated than that. There are consumers who want well researched facts and there are those that want to be told what to think. The main stream media is still catering to the latter. If you want facts, you can usually go research the topic yourself just as easily as the &quot;reporters&quot; do. </p>

<p>The media is sinking because they are losing the people who have realized that coverage has been diluted too much. Now, they are just fighting to win the narrative battle. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to win someone to your narrative, try to win them away from opinion, spin, and bias. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not a good time to be alive. The world is collapsing due directly to central banks and CEO corporate greed. The economies of almost every developed nation are at risk of financial collapse and/or in 9+ digit debt. </p>

<p>What happens next? Well war, uprisings, famine, disease will rise.</p>

<p>The economic cartel known as the IMF and the World Bank are going to institute a global currency to re-stabilize the people. This world currency will be completely digitized and implemented in the form of RFID chips given to those who agree to join their currency system, work a job, and participate in controlled markets.  </p>
