        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s official now: There has been a silent war happening during the election. In this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-and-intelligence-community-chiefs-have-urged-obama-to-remove-the-head-of-the-nsa/2016/11/19/44de6ea6-adff-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html">Washington Post article</a> titled &#39;<em>Pentagon and intelligence community chiefs have urged Obama to remove the head of the NSA</em>&#39; (<a href="http://archive.is/cm8uF">link to archive</a>), it is stated that it was a demand from Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper. They also wanted it done before the election:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;The expectation had been that Rogers would be replaced before the Nov. 8 election.&#39;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <br/>
Why before the Nov. 8 election? Because they knew that the only people that could hack all the different DNC and Clinton-related systems were at the NSA. Since the NSA was in charge to monitor some of these systems (yes, they were!), there couldn&#39;t have been any Russian-based hack going on for more than 1 year without the NSA knowing about. The NSA never told anything about it for a good reason: They were the ones who were hacking these systems.<br/>
 <br/>
<strong>And consequently, the only possibility is that it was the NSA which was providing the information to Wikileaks.</strong><br/>
 <br/>
The CIA and the Pentagon, all linked to the Clinton war machine understood that much too late and tried to oust the NSA leader to protect their champion. They not only failed, but they really failed badly! Their conspiracy has been unsuccessful even though they have probably captured or killed Julian Assange. Now, Rogers is probably on his way to <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/306916-house-intel-chair-arranging-hearings-on-nsa-dir-rogers-reports">become Director of National Intelligence</a> while <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/306527-spy-chief-james-clapper-resigns">James Clapper has resigned</a> and will go on the same day than Obama on January 20th. Concerning defense, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/11/19/retired-gen-james-mattis-eyed-as-trumps-possible-pick-for-defense-secretary.html">seems to be Trump&#39;s pick</a> and will replace Carter.<br/>
 <br/>
The real question here is: Will we know what happened to Julian Assange once the transition of power is done?  </p>

<p>If such arguments are spilling out into the public domain, then they are &quot;supposed&quot; to be known, ESPECIALLY when they come from controlled sources like WP who have not had an actual journalistic story come about for some time.</p>

<p>This is thought control and someone is supposed to attract your ire and support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that people think of the &quot;NSA&quot; as a monolith all doing and agreeing to the same direction. The truth is thousands and thousands of individuals work there and they don&#39;t all agree with the company line. </p>

<p>I can agree that there is a good likelihood someone in the NSA gave the info to Wikileaks. Since Rogers went to visit Trump unauthorized it seems he is in on what went down and wants protection or whatever he negotiated from Trump for the leaks. One call from Trump to Obama and Rogers stays on at the NSA...it&#39;s that simple.</p>

<p>I doubt Assange would run the leaks without knowing who his source was. Not that he would care if one faction of the NSA made a deal with Trump as long as he gets to expose Clinton and the system as rigged. It&#39;s just if Assange is going to &#39;help&#39; an NSA faction and Trump indirectly then I bet he&#39;d ask for the case against him to be dropped in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Others had earlier suggested that the NSA (or similar agency) might be the source of the Wikileaks files that brought the DNC to its knees and undermined Hillary&#39;s campaign. </p>

<p>Some speculated the leaks may have been coordinated with the full knowledge of senior officials in the military and intelligence agencies, who were convinced the US would escalate military action in Syria, and launch a disastrous war against Iran if Hillary were to become POTUS.</p>
