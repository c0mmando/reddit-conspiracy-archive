        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is extremely odd. It looks as if they are trying to plant assassination thoughts in the minds of their audience. The panel was engaged in discussion about Trump taking a day away from the press, and Don said something to the effect of &quot;You need the press to have access. Remember when there was an assassination attempt on President Reagan (roll footage), it was very useful for us to have footage of that event.&quot; (footage continues to roll for a conspicuously long time).</p>

<p>This is really despicable and borderline criminal behavior.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the former KGB head of propaganda explaining how subversion works! Mind you this lecture was from 1993. Look for parallels in his topics that relate to current events. </p>

<p>Basically it&#39;s a four step process. </p>

<p>Demoralize, Destabilize, Crisis, and finally normalization. </p>

<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism</a></p>

<p>&quot;social unrest between the two antagonistic classes will intensify, until it culminates in social revolution. The eventual long-term outcome of this revolution would be the establishment of socialism&quot;</p>

<p>Anything that weakens the case for capitalism could be considered Marxist. By promoting the assassination of a political and business leader it would help the subversion of American society. See my post above, such an assassination would fall into the &quot;crisis&quot; category. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten alot of downvotes for being rude in the past. As it turns out &quot;Just look at the dots, draw your own line!&quot;  isn&#39;t exactly constructive to discussion. </p>

<p>Stay alert, keep your head up, don&#39;t let anyone distract you from seeing the truth. Of course in pop culture it doesn&#39;t take that meaning exactly, but you see my point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait that made sense. The press pool being there meant we got the pictures and info asap in an age before 24/7 news and digital media.  </p>

<p>Most of what the press pool covers is nothing but when shit goes down you have that on the spot reporting.</p>

<p>Say while Trump was at the 21 Club he was attacked by an enraged chef since he ordered well done steak with ketchup, sure the security guys are there for protection but not reporting.  </p>

<p>The next morning the Trump camp said it was a pro- Mexican terrorist and there&#39;s no one to dispute that unless there&#39;s a Snapchatter who&#39;s super quick in unexpected circumstances.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is fine, hate the media but later on you may appreciate the coverage.  Like GWB reading the goat book while being told the country is under attack</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not great quality and I don&#39;t have the context before the clip starts. If it&#39;s not online somewhere you should be able to find it by tomorrow on the net. The context isn&#39;t hugely important here, just look at the headline and compare it to the clip they are showing to juxtopose against their conversation.</p>

<p>The bottom line is this: this story is about Trump not wanting to do any press today. They could have chosen any clip to support their point, that Trump is (I guess) never allowed to take time away from press coverage without harsh criticism by the liberal propaganda machine collectively referred to as &#39;the media&#39;. </p>

<p>CNN must have tens or hundreds of thousands of clips... Incalculable hours of footage... They could have chosen any clip to play during this panel discussion, and the one they chose to use out of their vast library of video reel is the clip of an American Presidential assassination attempt, 8 days after an election. You&#39;d have to be braindead to not find this odd, to say the least. </p>

<p>Another suspicious factor about this is that many if not most panel discussions on TV news include no video clip in the middle of the segment. It&#39;s not like they needed video to play during this segment, but they chose to play one, and the one they chose is the Reagan assassination attempt.</p>

<p>&quot;There you saw what happened to the President... but he was the President, that&#39;s the key... he is not the President, he is the President elect&quot;. - thinly veiled threat, encouraging violence against Mr. Trump that would prevent him from taking office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t go on popular vote with the way our system is set up. If you want to talk about popular vote then you have to get rid of the electoral college from the start. There are many people who will not vote strictly because they know their state is ALWAYS red or ALWAYS blue. So since it isn&#39;t based on popular vote they just stay home. However if we abolish the electoral college and strictly go off of popular vote then campaigning is entirely different. Politicians would simply have to sway the top 3 or 4 big cities and promise them whatever they want and they would win. Which essentially puts New York City and LA in charge of the country, effectively ignoring the wants and needs of the rest of the United States that does not live in a major metropolis. This was a revolution because it was silent. Every biased mainstream media outlet said it would never happen. They disenfranchised and silenced everyone except major cities. And we elected in someone to shake everything up. He&#39;s not polished, he&#39;s crude, he has no political experience, and he&#39;s promised to take down the political elite. But believe me, almost everyone I know is going to be holding him to those promises. He either follows through or you will see the control of Congress shift in two years. </p>

<p>Im a Bernie guy, but you might rethink your take on him. Even I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt until he betrays that....but so far, besides climate change (which is hopeless to improve until all politicians born before 1950 die off anyway ) he seems to be doing some good work at the moment. </p>

<p>If Clinton were president elect, wed be looking at daily propaganda aimed at justifying invading syria and/or escalation of our global situation with Russia. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5">They have been lying for years now. Since &#39;12 maybe longer. Obama signed the NDAA which legalized propaganda against US citizens</a> </p>

<p>Now we have mainstream media bowing to Soros and Clinton who are paying rioters to provoke violence in our cities. Soros has attempted coups in Ukraine, Venezuela, Egypt and is the globalist behind much that is going on. Trump is about the only chance many of us believe to get away from this. If they do assassinate him, we are fucked IMO.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the weirdest parts about this election was that Crazy Cunt being supported by all those rappers, like the free concert in Cleveland featuring the likes of Jay-z, who spits <em>pure venomous vitriol</em> about women, portrays black men a criminals, pimps, drug dealers, gang members... yet this bitch of the pro-feminist, pro-black candidate? give me a fucken break. </p>

<p>anyway, this video is scary as shit, i hope someone can upload a longer version so perhaps we can get some context... but then again, why even bring it up? goddamnit cnn...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if I would go as far as saying that is all the Jay Z talks about. I am not a Jay Z fan for the most part (his first major album Resonable Doubt is decent enough and he does have a few bangers), but he does a lot for his community and made it big by working hard and selling out. He most likely doesn&#39;t have any other context of his growing up. I haven&#39;t listened to his music for years, but no offense, that sounds like something someone would say who doesn&#39;t know anything about rap or has a particular bias ( believe me, rap commodification bothers me). </p>

<p>Rap was born out of desolation. Postindustrial america wreaked havoc on the black community. I mean shit, Reagan (bush) and Nixon (and we know what Bill did in the 1990s) cut a ton of social programs so these blokes had to do whatever to have a meeting place. That was usually a park, where they would tap into the street lamps for electricity. Hip Hop culture is full of hard working, creative people. I always like to say it came from rubble, because it did. Some dudes had to resort to slinging rocks.  </p>

<p>And Hillary is no doubt, 100% a feminist. That&#39;s why she&#39;s so angry all of the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha... no, my friend, i actually have a huge respect for Hip-Hop. I wear my P.E. hat with pride. I think rappers like Jay z are an affront to the true potential of the genre. It&#39;s been a slippery slope to the nauseating, nasal drone of Drake, and it seems to keep deteriorating... </p>

<p>And yea, hip hop&#39;s origin&#39;s are beautiful. Born when art programs were cut and there weren&#39;t anymore instruments lying around... a beautiful example of, dare i say, american ingeniuty...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha nice. Ok I hope I didn&#39;t come off too brash. I feel like I need to defend rap because it has had such a major impact on my life and people don&#39;t <em>get</em> it. I honestly started to think about it after and I was like, ohhhh he is right. I am not really in the game anymore, but I did see Digable Planets in Seattle last year. </p>

<p>You make a good point about the instruments. I argued with the head of my graduate school for a week. She told me that saying rap was born out of &quot;Cultural refuse&quot; was &quot;culturally insensitive&quot;. They literally used people old records that they no longer had a need for to make new music. Anyway, nice running into you.  </p>

<p>Oh and peep this album if you have a chance. It&#39;s pretty decent and helps make up for Drake</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry if i came off as being anti-rap... i&#39;m just tired of the rhetoric, i&#39;m sure you understand. I dip in to a lot of genres, i usually try to find the artists that keep it pure.</p>

<p>Anyway, my main genre has been metal. I know its history well, and it basically runs parallel to hip-hop&#39;s, you even see them cross over. I could write a book about it. Just think of Anthrax and P.E., eventually that produces the magic of Slipknot&#39;s first album.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll peep for sure. </p>

Anyway, occasionally one of our members would bring Don Lemon and some other guy as his guests. Lemon was always a jerk. Never tipped. His buddies did but he didn&#39;t. And he never said thank you. It was just &quot;clean my clubs and here are my keys, go put then in my trunk.&quot; Prick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had to describe the reasoning for this clip to be shown from CNN&#39;s point of view, they could definitely make the argument that they showed it for the fact that Trump is similar to Reagen because they were both famous entertainers (reality tv stars, actors, socialites, etc.) before being elected president. I think CNN is showing what happens when a president who had an occupation like that in the past gets elected. Some people become absolutely radical towards people they don&#39;t feel qualify as being a fit president. They are sort of implying that this has happened in the past and that it could very well be a possibility that attempts like this could happen on Trump. </p>

<p>But I mean everyone here is probably right. CNN probably is just that blatantly sinister, and calling for someone to step forward and assassinate Trump. It probably is them trying to plant a seed in a mentally ill yet capable American. There literally is zero excuse for this. If they honestly try to say that wasn&#39;t their intention, than that&#39;s just a lie. They know damn well that there are crazy wreckless people watching CNN and that there is almost a guaranteed possobility that someone will be inspired by this. If they actually don&#39;t wish this upon Trump, they would never show this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s happening all over the &#39;mainstream&#39; media. Check out this recent NPR segment with yet another reference to a Presidential assassination, again this has aired recently, after the election, while people are threatening to kill Trump on twitter and marching against him in the streets. Not only is it a weird &#39;coincidence&#39; but if you listen to the audio, the whole segment is just plain creepy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point is not that he&#39;s not making himself available to the press.  This is a separate issue of exactly <em>how</em> he works with the press.</p>

<p>Previous presidents have always had a small select crew from the press corps following them around at all moments.  Not the whole press corps, just five or six of them to make sure stuff gets documented.</p>

<p>That small coterie of press corps who are supposed to be around the president all the damn time, no matter what else was happening in the world.  The idea being- if something&#39;s going on like a media circus public trial for OJ or something, and no press are following the president, something still might happen to or with him.  This small crew of 5 or 6 reporters travels in every motorcade, goes to every dinner, shadows him wherever he goes including theme park visits and vacations on his ranch.</p>

<p>The Reagan assassination attempt is often cited as the proof positive for this.  It&#39;s not like Reagan was surrounded by press that day, there was other stuff going on.  But, when it broke out all of a sudden and unexpectedly, there were press there to document it.  If he hadn&#39;t had an always-on-call crew of a few press there, no one in the world would have seen it.  There weren&#39;t cameraphones around to immediately document everything.  The other example that&#39;s often cited is Bush visiting the elementary school the morning of 9/11.  Because there were a few members of the press corps there with him, the American public had the vital ability to see into and scrutinize the president and hold him accountable for those moments in which we needed them most.</p>

<p>The press&#39;s job is to be witness to the president as close to 24/7 as possible.  The president does not really have a right of privacy in his day-to-day.  His time is no longer his; we own it, we&#39;re paying for it.   The presidency is 24/7, it&#39;s not a part-time job.  And there&#39;s no such thing as part-time accountability.</p>
