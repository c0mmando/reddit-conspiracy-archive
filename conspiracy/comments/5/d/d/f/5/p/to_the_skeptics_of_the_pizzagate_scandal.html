       Skeptics, ask yourself this.
What is the more plausible scenario?
      </p>
      <p>
       A. People interested in pizzagate are absolutely bat shit nuts, their argument holds no water, they are grossly exaggerating on every argument they have brought to light, and Comet Ping Pong is a family  friendly organization that just has pizza and games. The Clinton connection is probably nothing, and Soro's donation is likely blown out of proportion. The people implicated should be immediately cleared, and we should all apologize.
or
      </p>
      <p>
       B. The skeptics are onto something. Some very intelligent and skilled people, who have dedicated countless hours to examining the wikileaks with a fine toothed comb, have observed several leaked documents/emails involving Podesta that contain common sex ring "code words". Further investigation into Podesta exposed a link to a D.C. Pizza parlor, opening up several new leads, and upon following those leads, more intriguing information was found that connected some of our most prominent and respected public servants to the Pizza Parlor. An investigation into the owner of this pizza parlor revealed that his character is questionable, and some of his strange antics would fit the "pedophile ring" narrative (lude twitter photos). Their findings were deemed significant enough to justify further investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you're essentially either saying; We're dead wrong and nuts, or we're onto something? Is Option B Really that hard to imagine?
Enough evidence and connections have been made to justify further investigation, thats all I'm saying. Isn't this how the police and FBI operate? Just because serial killer John W. Gacy was a well respected member of his community and involved in local politics, the Police shouldn't have investigated further? I agree we should not make any official serious accusations just yet, and have a relative amount of respect for those believed to be involved, but I think this deserves a closer look...
      </p>
      <p>
       We're dealing with pedophilia and some very powerful people for christ's sake, and we have a legitimate argument to make. At least hear us out. Immediately denouncing us and encouraging us to stop just seems pretty ignorant to me.

       The ridiculous part is that there have been several mass pedophile scandals uncovered in the last twenty years such as the Catholic church, the British parliament, conspiracy of silence, epstein's island. Is it so hard to believe that there is more?

       There are almost certainly more, they just aren't based on 4chan jokes and slang.
      </p>
      <p>
       People devious enough to get away with stuff like this probably have more sophisticated code words than "cheese pizza," and almost certainly wouldn't open stores based on their code language.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is, I've seen plenty of actual human trafficking coverup articles on this sub since the election, but they're usually in the double digits.  "CASE CLOSED PODESTA" posts are getting upwards of 1000 karma, with the same, shaky evidence as last week.  Most of it is actually taken straight from these people's social media accounts.  Who would be stupid enough to post evidence, or clues, on their Facebook?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either the "investigators" are incredibly lazy and/or keyboard bound, or they don't actually care about catching the real bad guys.

       Criminals that get away with their crimes regularly are more prone to flaunting their crimes to friends or at times the public or law enforcement as well. That's how they could be stupid enough to post pictures on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you seen the pictures and comments that they posted to social media? Particularly instagram? I can't even look any further in to this after seeing them and big props to those who can stomach investigation of these types of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please tell me what your take on those pictures and comments are. How do you perceive the child with hands taped to a ping pong table? What could possibly possess someone to take that picture in the first place, then post it to social media and wtf is wrong with the people commenting on it?

      <p>
       It was electrical tape, won't even take the hair off of your hand when you peel it off.  Plus, it looked like it was in a room full of people, she's smiling, and there are ping pong tables in the background, so it's in public view.  Probably a joke at a "babysitter."
      </p>
      <p>
       Any comments that you think are too sick to stomach are probably inside jokes that you just don't understand.  If there's explicit language about abusing children, please link it because I haven't read it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not uncommon to interpret things like this as code or jargon, but in reality, it's likely that most 4chan users just don't understand recurring jokes between friends, or the way normal people talk.

       Lol, it's funny I was actually expecting an intelligent response, and maybe with text evidence that I was wrong.  I guess I'm the idiot.

       I don't find my suggestions any more plausible because of the people I'm talking about, I usually base my decisions on factual evidence and careful deliberation.  I can see that's where we differ.

       I've already stated that I don't have the stomach to revisit any of the evidence, so asking me to link you evidence and expecting me to go dig it up for you is (not to insult you) not the brightest response or expectation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You answered my question though. Despite. 
You don't consider past criminal history or interactions as evidence and therefore are more willing to accept people at face value. That's ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authorities and investigators take such things in to account however. A subjects history is factual evidence and a conviction has been carefully deliberated.

I'm not 100% sure...I REALLY want to be...I was neither Pro Trump or Pro Hillary, and this whole Media debacle of Google shutting down "fake" news sites, the Assange conspiracy, the Pedo and Clinton Foundation issues...

       I'd love to though, if I was given 100% solid hard evidence...ya I'd be all aboard.  But all I've seen is speculation and some loose "ties" to certain words/emails/locations.  I'm not saying it's not true, but I'm not saying it is...

       Sums it up perfectly. But, there are actually skeptics on this sub who think pizzagate should be disregarded. I'm asking them to take another look. We need to unify this sub and divert our focus on this, because this is the scandal that actually could bring these people down.

       Your post is an example of
       <em>
        circulus in probando
       </em>
       . This occurs in a course of reasoning typified by the complex argument in which a premise
       <strong>
        p1
       </strong>
       is used to prove
       <strong>
        p2
       </strong>
       ;
       <strong>
        p2
       </strong>
       is used to prove
       <strong>
        p3
       </strong>
       ; and so on, until
       <strong>
        pn − 1
       </strong>
       is used to prove
       <strong>
        pn
       </strong>
       ; then
       <strong>
        pn
       </strong>
       is subsequently used in a proof of
       <strong>
        p1

       , and the whole series
       <strong>
        p1, p2, . . . , pn

       is taken as established.

       All you have been doing is hopping around Pizzagate related threads and discouraging further investigation. As far as i'm concerned, I don't think anyone should take your opinion seriously, as it's pretty clear you have a bias on this topic and you probably can't be trusted because of it.

       The idea is, if they can get enough skeptical comments on a thread about pizzagate, they can turn the tide of opinion of new viewers on this sub towards rejecting the information. A lot of people read the comments after looking at an article or video or whatever, to get a feel for the "climate" of reactions form people who just saw the content. If everybody is saying, "Geeze...you people are lunatics!", then some people will turn away and reject the information. Controlling the climate of the content of youtube/reddit/forum comments is a big deal to these people.

       Not just batshit crazy, though.  You're definitely batshit something.  My guess would be extremely rustled over the election, with no jimmies in sight.  T_D should really be focused on holding Donald to his word, instead of finding other fronts.

       I see. So you denounce our investigation, and provide no explaination as to why, and no counter argument. Very impressive. I didn't vote in this election, I found both Trump and Clinton to be corporate spokesmen. Nice try though.

       You can't deny that the majority of the pizzagate crew is from t_d.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want evidence to the contrary, I think you should provide some proof that there is something to disprove.  I'll go through the established evidence for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta emails - The only evidence contained is mention of pizza.  The term has not always been associated with child pornography, and the connection was actually born on 4chan.  Not very likely that the elite would be using a word found on a Chinese image board.  I've heard people say that "pizza map handkerchief" or whatever is code speak, but the guy obviously cooks, and I read a real estate ad for one of his neighbors that states he has an outdoor brick oven, and regularly has pizza parties.  So, that was enough evidence for me to assume the guy might have a couple conversations about pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social media - I don't think I should have to explain why "evidence" found on Facebook or Instagram is suspect, I know people who were smart enough to keep drug dealing far away from their social media accounts in high school.  I'm sure these people wouldn't be bragging, or leaving clues, about crimes on social media, especially if they're in the public eye.  I'd guess they regularly talk with staff about guarding what you post, not oversharing, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Art - It's fucking art.  It's supposed to be different and weird.  The most disturbing piece I saw was the penis ejaculating pizza, but if I owned a pizza restaurant, I might understand being that excited about it.  Personally, I can't stand the shit artists get away with these days, and I think most of it is just lazy garbage, but people in DC are incredibly smarmy, and buying an art piece just because it's expensive is commonplace.  I didn't see any that explicitly indicated abuse towards children, just some pieces that could be interpreted in a number of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logos - Anyone who has a spiral shaped logo is a pedophile?  I had no clue that the symbol shown was related to pedophilia in any way, and I doubt the layperson would.  I don't think these people would even have a need to meet in person anymore, since the invention of the internet, and honestly I'm not even sure if the pictures of the "FBI files" on pedophile symbols were legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Video - I honestly thought it was footage of an unfunny stand-up act, it sounded like plenty of people were laughing.  Anything that might have been damning was garbled or marked [unintelligible] though, so it confused me how people even took it as evidence.  Someone could have purposefully distorted the second after he said "kids" to make it sound nefarious, like
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJn-DaHpl8k">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJn-DaHpl8k
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm blanking on the rest, if you link me the evidence I'll explain how it isn't concrete.  Like I said elsewhere in the comments though, there are plenty of other actual confirmed coverups that are posted here, but pizzagate posts usually get at least 100x the upvotes.  Kinda shows how people are caring about this selectively, possibly since Clinton stands to lose a lot of face just from its discussion.

       I'm envious of your creativity in your ability to lie to yourself. Also seems weird that a Trump supporter wouldn't want to go after this, considering Clinton is linked to the scandal. But whatever, if you can't beat em', leave em.

       I'm somewhat of a skeptic but I will say pizzagate did help to push me over the fence of not voting for Hillary. I just hate most of the analysis of instagram posts. It makes you guys look fucking autistic and honestly hypocritical. Reddit and 4chan are full of dark jokes (by normal people) yet "kill room" and the kid with the Euros are suddenly out of line. Get a grip. No, these people (whether tied to sex rings or not) are probably a little twisted in the head (hello they live in DC) and make dark jokes - just like the rest of us. My friends and I made dead baby jokes in the high school cafeteria. Does that mean we were secretly killing babies?
