        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This has been brought up in the sub before, but it seems as though it is worth reviewing given the fact that it has been over a month since we&#39;ve heard from Assange and there are so many new people on this sub. I&#39;ll try to summarize and highlight important information in each link, but I encourage everyone to look over all the information should they have the time. </p>

<p>We begin with a small dating site called toddandclare.com. There are several red flags right out of the gate. It&#39;s strange for a dating site to say &quot;This online dating site is a former United Nations Global Compact member.&quot; Is there any need to be a UNGC member? Still, one of the only things you find on their front page is this link. <a href="https://www.toddandclare.com/datinglife/online-dating/united-nations-statement-julian-assange-wikileaks/">https://www.toddandclare.com/datinglife/online-dating/united-nations-statement-julian-assange-wikileaks/</a> </p>

<p>This post explains that they spend thousands of dollars to be UN sustainable, and on October 12 2016 they were delisted. A significant portion of the email talks poorly of the UN and they complain that in their acceptance email the name of the business was misspelled and claim the UN strongly favors rich UN members. They admit that the UN no longer supports them because of their criticisms of Assange. So, why would a dating site be talking about Assange?</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/IMG/pdf/toddandclare-emails-3-sep-2016-to-21-sep-2016.pdf">https://wikileaks.org/IMG/pdf/toddandclare-emails-3-sep-2016-to-21-sep-2016.pdf</a></p>

<p>These emails are correspondence between Assange (or James) and Hannah Hammond, on behalf of Todd and Clare Hommand. It states that they would like Assange to help make a commercial for their dating site. James replies on Assange&#39;s behalf seemingly hesitant, but is willing to know more. T&amp;C offer Assange 1M US dollars to do this ad, they offer a synopsis of the ad, and some seriously out of place comments. Make of these comments what you will. They say that T&amp;C were approached by a foreign government. They mention that these emails will be looked at by two governments and this will be the last email sent before the deadline of Oct. 1st. They offer Assange &quot;safe passage&quot; should he choose to cooperate. The money is offered from the Russian government and to prove that they are serious, they offer 3 personal details about Assange&#39;s lawyer.
The next part says that Ecuador won&#39;t be safe for long, and that if he wants to avoid ADX Florence (American federal supermax prison for male inmates), he should consider that this is the only way Hannah, who is based in Australia, who is speaking on behalf of Russia, can contact him considering the surveillance he&#39;s under. The third part says that should he accept this offer, he will be paid regardless of whether the ad plays, and more information will be given to him on the 2nd of October.  Finally they say that the government assistance they&#39;re offering him is dependent on two things. The first is that he accepts the money before the 1st of October. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;2. Julian should take it upon himself to publish the following tweet to Presidential candidate Donald
Trump, by midnight on October 1st 2016.
@realdonaldtrump @jamiedimon @natrothschild1 Go to ToddandClare.com on Nov 7. Noon. Putin
will be live. #brexitneverhappened
Unless it is deleted by the US government, the tweet should not be deleted by Julian or his
colleagues at any time, and will stay live on twitter, until further notice.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like this tweet would be the green light and the signal for T&amp;C to act. It&#39;s worth noting that the US election would have been the next day. (Was this TPTB&#39;s way of trying to insure their president of choice got elected somehow?) James replies and makes it clear that he has no desire to do anything with these people. Their final response was &quot;Julian: We know it’s you writing. The offer expires at midnight, October 31st 2016.&quot;
So what exactly is this dating site? </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/IMG/pdf/final_report_t_c_17_oct_2016-2.pdf">https://wikileaks.org/IMG/pdf/final_report_t_c_17_oct_2016-2.pdf</a></p>

<p>This goes into detail that T&amp;C are a fake dating site and interestingly enough, it appears to have be published Oct-17-2016, the day that Assange&#39;s internet was cut.  This pdf shows an image of the address that the website is registered at and it&#39;s looks to be an empty warehouse. The phone number provided is not an American phone number, and there is no apparent connection between the woman listed as a contact and the
business. There are at least two instances of profile pictures that are taken from another website and slightly modified. T&amp;C claim that they aren&#39;t big users of social media sites, and this seems to be true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A Facebook page for Todd and Clare was identified. Only seven posts have been made
on the Todd and Clare Facebook page, the earliest post identified was posted on 1 January 2016.
There appears to be suspicious activity with these posts; there are hundreds of “Facebook likes”
(almost entirely from accounts outside the United States), but there are zero comments from
users. This represents a large deviation from normal user activity.&quot; 
Quote from wikileaks pdf. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t the truth anymore since a good number of people have posted comments calling this website out. More proof this website is a fake is this reddit post <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/58c43s/we_are_the_current_tenants_of_the_building/">https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/58c43s/we_are_the_current_tenants_of_the_building/</a> posted last month.</p>

<p>Of course T&amp;C decide to retaliate against Assange and WL.  <a href="https://www.toddandclare.com/datinglife/online-dating/we-stand-united-against-wikileaks-unlawful-attacks-on-us/">https://www.toddandclare.com/datinglife/online-dating/we-stand-united-against-wikileaks-unlawful-attacks-on-us/</a>
This response was posted Oct. 27th.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Be aware that Wikileaks Redditors are encouraging people to harm the personal safety of others–much like Julian Assange, <em>their Dear Leader</em>, has endangered the personal safety of Americans and our servicemen 
with his despicable activities against American national security.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stay strong everyone. From little acorns, mighty oaks grow. Thank you for all your support, we have an incredible dating site, that will rival the best of them one day. Dissent is so important. God bless America, 
we are truly the greatest nation on Earth.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quotes from blog post above. This dating website is surprising political time again. They also say that they have contacted the appropriate authorities as WL supporters have endangered at least 3 people&#39;s lives by posting personal information about these people. If that wasn&#39;t enough, there is another blog post just a 3 days later.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.toddandclare.com/datinglife/">https://www.toddandclare.com/datinglife/</a>
This one accuses Assange of sexual child abuse. If you are pressed for time, I suggest you take the time to read this blog post, since there is almost too much information to summarize concisely (as well as the Todd and Claire emails.) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Faced with such confronting terror, it’s not surprising that the Canadian family, who reported to our safety team that their 8 year old daughter was abused by Assange (as laid out in the UN report published on October 4) is viewing the raw power of Julian Assange and his Wikileaks Reddit&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d just like to point out that they said &quot;our safety team.&quot; Even though we&#39;ve established this isn&#39;t a real dating site, who ever is writing this blog for this dating site seems to a shill for someone painfully out of touch and with a lot power because dating sites don&#39;t have safety teams. Undoubtedly the most bizarre blog post from T&amp;C. It brings up statistics of rape victims such as 6 out of 1000 rapist will be in jailed and the suggestion that men shrug off rape because a women could possibly be lying. They claim that Assange has such a reddit following that if anyone were to come out with an accusation of rape, they would become a target. Regardless, they sent an UN report of this rape and they claim the WL&#39;s cyberattack on the days Oct. 19 - to Oct 22nd seemingly deleted the Google Cache of it. Every link that appeared to offer information on this report returned with a 404 error (that I can find.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So, for any women out there who have been abused by Julian Assange or powerful men like him, here’s the message that this kind of vigilantism sends, with a voice that is louder and more powerful than any sexual assault victims’ will ever be:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Stay silent. No one will believe you, even if you have a case.</li>
<li>Don’t bother going to police, and if you do, we’ll find out you and your family’s home address, publish it online for people to randomly attack you and ridicule you all over the internet. (Similar to how “Justice4Assange” has helped to identify the Christian names of the women in Sweden who say he raped them.)</li>
<li>If you stay silent and are too frightened for your personal safety to go to the police, we’ll misuse your silence and represent it as evidence that you’re lying.</li>
<li>Anyone who stands up for you, (like Todd and Clare has stood up for this family for no other reason than because it’s the right thing to do) will be misrepresented, attacked and smeared all over the internet.
#4 includes having pictures of your office address published online, so any vigilante with a Reddit account, and a gun, knows where to find you.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>They claim this is Assange&#39;s message, while being sure to be as sensational and fear mongering as possible. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If anyone who has been named in connection with Wikileaks Reddit or other sites regarding this incident dies, has an “accident”, or is physically wounded in the next 10 years as a result of this situation on Reddit, we’re asking that the police investigating the homicide(s) to obtain from Reddit the usernames of the anonymous internet trolls calling for unlawful, criminal harassment of innocent people.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, after almost 3/4 of the blog post, they get around to disputing the WL allegation of being a fake website, but they make sure to mention that child again. It sounds very much like this is a group of powerful people with an agenda. Do they hold a grudge against the UN because they were delisted, or because the UN said Assange&#39;s human rights were being violated? They loathe reddit and attempt to paint a picture that Redditors are hateful, cruel, vengeful, and merciless group of people who&#39;s only concern is worshipping Assange. They go so far as to accuse Assange of being a child predator. The child and family was so afraid of the backlash on Reddit that they were afraid to come forward. Who does this sound like? Who would make up these stories that are so full of serious hatred? Now I would love to believe that Assange is doing well in the Embassy right now, playing with a feather wand for his cat, believe me. But I don&#39;t. It looks like whoever did arrest Assange, or worse, may have tried to trick him first, and all ties point to America. T&amp;C are an American based company, with an address and domain name registered in American, they make a point that &quot;American is truly the greatest nation on earth&quot;, the payment for the ad was in US dollars, and the US was the most angry at Assange. I encourage everyone to check out each of these links, and offer any incite they might have. Again, I realize this has been covered before, but it&#39;s as relevant now as it was then. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Julian’s stay in Ecuador will not be permanent. Exit visas are imminent onto London streets. This dramatic turn of events is planned to have a “spectacular” conclusion. If Julian wishes to avoid ADX Florence... [etc]&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>was the real purpose of the whole exchange, and the reason JA responded and retweeted it rather than just binning it, since on the surface it is such nonsense, and so easily debunkable.</p>

<p>I did not have the mental energy to do such a comprehensive review of the whole T&amp;C story, so thank you so much, I think this is a very important part of the WL story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The site design is ridiculous for something claiming to be a popular dating site. The postings are all pretty weird. It seems pretty clear that most of their effort has been spent on their blog entries, which are all centered around Assange/Wikileaks.</p>

<p>Either it&#39;s an embarrassingly bad entrepreneurial venture or a front for something that would actually make money/serve a purpose. It&#39;s linked to Larry Summers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers</a>), so I&#39;m not really sure why someone of that societal standing would waste any time/money on an embarrassingly shitty dating site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The claim that the massive DDOS attack on the US was done by Wikileaks supporters has never made sense to me...

<p>In my mind, that line just gives more credence to the theory that Wikileaks/Assange is under duress.</p>
