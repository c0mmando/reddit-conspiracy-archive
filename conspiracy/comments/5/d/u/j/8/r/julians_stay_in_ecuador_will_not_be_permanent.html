<p>While we were all so busy proving what amateuristic buffoons they were with their lame blackmail scheme and easy-to-find breadcrumbs, we missed the whole pith of the exchange:</p>

<p>a direct and overt threat with a deadline. October 31st.</p>

<p>WL published this exchange not long before his &quot;internet went dark.&quot; </p>

<p>Am I wrong in presuming that few people know what ADX Florence is by name besides letter-agencies? </p>

<p>I have been remiss in getting this the attention I believe it deserves since it was published. Any thoughts on where else to get it some traction, please chime in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you weren&#39;t around when the whole ToddandClare business was debunked and tracked back to US operatives. It was quite an interesting trail, but I think in tracing that, the true message was missed, which was to communicate directly and clearly to JA about his cooperation with the letter agencies or else consequences.</p>

<p>Might have my tinfoil hat on too tight, but I was concerned back when this came out, and even moreso now. Will be delighted to be wrong!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that seems clear to me is that the two were not in the same room when the interview was done. All professional interviews are edited, so the fact that it was doesn&#39;t concern me so much as the faking of their whereabouts. It would be simple to do an insert of Assange in the corner like all remote interviews, or simply fess up to having given JA questions to film the answers to, if it went like that.</p>

<p>But I hate talking about this stuff bc I feel like if he has escaped, we are doing the letter-agencies&#39; jobs for them :/</p>
