<p>The UK police/state/forces of whatever kind use psychiatric hospitals as secret prisons. 
The social worker in this interview blew the whistle and has been attacked ever since. This includes being kidnapped by the police and held - without having been sectioned (i.e. illegally) - in various psychiatric hospitals. Under false names. Without anybody knowing where she was or what had happened to her (family reporting her missing was useless as she was detained under different names). For weeks / months at a time. Just to make this clear: she was NOT sectioned. She was not even seen by psychiatrists. She was simply disappeared (intended wording). And on the (so far) last occasion drugged. I.e. PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS ARE USED AS SECRET PRISONS. Think &quot;Black sites&quot;: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_site">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_site</a></p>

<p>At least in this case in Ireland: <a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5dp7ni/paedophilia_coverup_a_couple_that_reported_a/">https://pay.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5dp7ni/paedophilia_coverup_a_couple_that_reported_a/</a> it was attempted to section the whistleblowers in order to disappear them. The way it was attempted was unlawful, but they were not incarcerated without having been sectioned. </p>

<p>The case of this social worker is far worse, as sectioning was not even attempted, there was no psychiatric assessment. She just keeps disappearing from the face of the earth and put under pressure to hand over evidence whilst being incarcerated in these black sites.</p>

<p>Psychiatry is in the cahoots with police / other forces, which is the worst possible combination (think Stalin&#39;s gulags or really any other oppressive regime).</p>
