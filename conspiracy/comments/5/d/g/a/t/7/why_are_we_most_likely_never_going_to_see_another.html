       Recently there are more and more requests by people for a message signed with PGP private key from WikiLeaks in order to confirm their claims that Assange is still in the embassy and is OK. Here's why I think WikiLeaks is never going to deliver such proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the PGP private key was only kept on Assange's PC in the embassy and nowhere else. And I'm absolutely sure that his hard drive was encrypted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, here's the most interesting part. I think that Assange never kept the password for decryption in his memory. Why? He was aware that at any moment police can raid the embassy and hand him over to CIA which will extract the password from him using
       <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png">
        rubber-hose cryptanalysis
       </a>
       . It was too dangerous for him to know the password. So instead, he had his password printed on a small piece of paper that he kept in his underwear, or some other place on his body. The password was most likely long and complex, with 50, 100, 200, 300 or who knows how many characters. My assumption is that the embassy was invaded during the night, so there won't be any eye witnesses on the street. I also think that Assange's bedroom was secured with multiple locks during the night, because when he was asleep it was his most vulnerable state. So when Assange woke up and heard that police was smashing his door, he quickly took the paper out of his underwear, placed it in his mouth, chewed and swallowed it. And there you have it - PGP private key trapped on the encrypted hard drive, and the password for decryption is gone. They can never extract the password from Assange because he never memorized it, and they will need years or decades in order to crack the password with brute force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this is just my simple theory. Assange is a smart guy who thinks outside of the box, so maybe he used some different or even better system. But the point remains - he destroyed his PGP private key when he felt threatened. That's why the crew that took over WikiLeaks twitter account will never be able to sign a message with his PGP private key.

       I agree he wouldn't commit it to memory. One method I would use in his situation is to have pieces of it around the room. Like using parts of ISBN numbers from books on a book shelf. You could easily remember the pattern of books used to create the key. The problem is, if someone cleaned out your room looking for a key - you might not have everything.

       they could still force that out of him through torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       something what you described is most likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       i never understood the whole PGP being good securty for all situations. as you said if he gets arrested &amp; tortured hed sing no matter how much he wouldnt want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       even things like giving 1 letter of each key to his wikileak journalists wouldnt have worked cos it coulda been leaked or hed surredner that info.
