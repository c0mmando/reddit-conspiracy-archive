<p>&quot;It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you – something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. …What was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable…what then?&quot;  </p>

<p>-George Orwell, 1984</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d also highly recommend reading Brave New World. Orwell imagined truth being suppressed through aggressive, governmental intimidation whereas Huxley imagined truth being suppressed through public indifference. </p>

<p>Where Orwell has oppressive, militarized dystopia, Huxley has manufactured utopia. Where things are not in favor of the public, but they are distracted enough that they really don&#39;t care either way. Much more about the people being conditioned to accept their place in society, and remain complacent. </p>

<p>I have a deep respect for both Orwell and Huxley but tend to think, at least in the predictive nature of their works, that Huxley hit the nail on the head a little bit better than Orwell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh interesting, I will have to give that book another shot. The first time I attempted to read it, didn&#39;t like it much. Someone had to explain to me that I was supposed to dislike the main characters, but I never gave the book another shot. </p>

<p>I have to agree though, about the manufactured utopia, its incredibly convincing and it was something I could even relate too. Knowing what I know now, I will reread in a different light. </p>
