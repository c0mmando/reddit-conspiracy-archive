    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been here for years. This sub and many subscribers were on the Clintons long before the fucking emails. They were nothing new here. </p>

<p>It grew because pro-Donald rhetoric sold to the audience. Let&#39;s not be delusional about that. Probably by design, in my opinion it was - To think this sub doesn&#39;t suffer ANY of the same symptoms others do? That&#39;s wearing blinders.</p>

<p>If I were an ideological, vindictive, egotistical narcissist, and over time, and with people as disgusting and nepotistic as myself, developed an idea to plant seeds of propaganda for a power grab, this sub would be an easy to maintain leg of that machine. If I were a mini-Goebbels-Bannon, this is where I&#39;d put a little cash.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the kind of thinking that USED to be a top comment.</p>

<p>Am I saying I think this place is compromised? Absolutely.</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly fucking irritated that his sub has strayed from realizing and screaming that the whole fucking show is rigged. To say that Donald Trump is some grass-God-damned-roots shit that represented sentiments here before the last year would be a lie. This used to be the place to come find out how TPTB are fucking us out of our humanity, our future, our histories. </p>

<p>It used to see the illusion as illusion. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not changing the system from within. He&#39;s the fucking figurehead for whatever his controllers are allowing us to discuss and fight over while they rape the planet, little kids, and our livelihoods.</p>

<p>He&#39;s the enemy and anything pro-Trump earns a downvote from me.</p>

<p>Most of the people I know that support(ed) Trump did so not out of any illusion that he would be some sort of &quot;savior&quot; or hero, but because they were rebelling against the elitist cesspool that Hillary represents, and that supported her with all of their power, money, and manipulation.</p>

<p>Trump was not so much elected as Hillary was rejected, and I am cautiously hopeful that Trump and his comrades will be scrutinized and, when necessary, eviscerated with all of the energy and vigor that brought the Hillary camp down.</p>

<p>Eternal vigilance FTW. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t matter. The major point is that it&#39;s not Hillary. The republicans seem to have forgot, that Donald Trump is not a republican. He ran as a republican, to fuck with republicans. He&#39;s been trolling republican attitudes, and rhetoric this whole time. Now that he is in office we are going to a very big change in Mr. Trump. Looks like he&#39;s going to start by challenging corruption at the top. The lobbyists and term limits. No more career politicians. The problem with this country is that we have men on the Supreme Court, and congress, who probably remember segregation fondly.</p>

A lot of people on r/Conspiracy are licking them up and view them as heroes, but it never crosses their minds that maybe TPTB, who has enslaved the masses, has possibly created a cointelpro to trick Conspiracy theorists into thinking they&#39;re getting a lot out of whatever TPTB are feeding to them. To even mention that they&#39;re CIA-operatives insights anger and immediate backlash/downvotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hiding? Think of it like this: If you were part of TPTB, what could you gain by creating a cointel leak platform that everyone has become obsessed with? You could trick the slightly conscious people into following a narrative and cause them to lose track of finding the truth and possibly losing the ability of attaining leverage over TPTB. </p>

<p>A lot of r/C vastly underestimates TPTB and fail to understand that TPTB aren&#39;t afraid to give omitted truths along with a lot of disinfo. What has Wikileaks and Snowden done? People have said the government was spying on us years before Snowden came out. Same thing applies to WikiLeaks too. r/C already had researched that there was a pedophile ring long before these emails came out. WikiLeaks &amp; Snowden hasn&#39;t damaged TPTB at all. </p>

<p>I personally can&#39;t look at history, riddled with back-castle deals, assassinations, propaganda, coercion, subversion, infiltration, blackmail, false flag events, war funding on both sides, religious strangleholds, divide and conquer... and think that this slippery &quot;businessman&quot; fuckhead was a spear to world power&#39;s heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a good read. I personally voted for W in my first election, and promptly went third party the year after. The use of Liberal or Conservative as self-describers started to gross me out. People apply unfit labels to themselves. This sub has always been blatant, and not even remotely underground, but it was where people who didn&#39;t let the given extremes dictate the conversation, we created our own extremes. That&#39;s what I&#39;d rather see here, as well as regular conversations like ours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.</p>

<p>I sounded <em>just like</em> this guy when I posed a long post, &quot;the election is rigged for Clinton, there&#39;s nothing we can do, and here&#39;s why (insert citations) this is likely the truth.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually a very easy philosophy to have because you never have to admit being wrong about anything: if corruption is exposed, then you&#39;re proven right. And if someone is honest, then in their eyes, &quot;it&#39;s only a matter of time before THE TRUTH&quot; comes out. </p>

<p>But then I was proven dead wrong. Clinton didn&#39;t win. I suppose I could be like this poster and say, &quot;it&#39;s this complex super agenda of TPTB (notice zero citations or actual facts included in this diatribe,&quot; but I frankly find that lazy thinking.</p>

<p>Now I think it&#39;s closed-minded to believe the absolute worst case scenario, and ignore all signs of change. Skepticism is good, and a necessity. But it&#39;s also a good thing to admit that we don&#39;t have all of the answers to how the real power brokers operate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heard a story about &quot;fake news&quot; on the CBC today. Around election day they ran a piece about Trump equating him to a fascist and dictators. Pretty sure everything from them is bullshit now and fake news is definitely the buzz phrase. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t this be a &quot;Hail Mary&quot; on the part of the media establishment to try to make us think they are still credible? </p>

<p>Interesting that this fake news garbage comes just days after the mainstream news outlets got torn a new one in front of 300,000,000 Americans during the election that Trump would never win. </p>

<p>Interesting that some of the fake news accurately predicted Trump&#39;s victory while the MSM got shamed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many things awful about this fake news spin. The real fake news companies are imitations of abc, ie abc.com.co. Some news is clickbaitey, other is just sensationalized. But then we have real stories that get sensationalized, but have some underlying truth, which gets written off as fake news, ie Snopes gives a false verdict on lots of Wikileaks stories that were sensationalized, yet still deserve attention/discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>seems like we all believe different things, so they&#39;re winning on the divide and conquer side. seems like the proletariat feels like the resistance might one day succeed and the world will be free of corruption and crime, so they&#39;re winning on the malibar front. seems like the inner party have a substantial advantage on the psychological front if the proletariat believe different things, seems like they know the truth, and we know a truth that has been made for us. what do they believe? why are they winning? it&#39;s beautiful when the leaves change, and die, and fall away from the branch.

<p>As a Trump supporter, I have no delusion that he&#39;ll probably be compromised by the military-industrial complex as soon as he gets into office. I think that happens to every president that takes office.</p>
