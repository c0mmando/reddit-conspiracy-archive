        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have noticed a strange movement in our media and in politics as of the last week since Trump got elected. It seems as if the establishment is trying to throw the electoral college in favor of Hillary in December and here are the key things to notice why that might happen:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>MSM goes straight to the idea that electoral college could throw election to Hillary</p></li>
<li><p>Petition to end electoral college goes around and now has 4+million votes</p></li>
<li><p>3 Republican electors (For electoral college) already announced they won&#39;t vote for Trump</p></li>
<li><p>There is no serious charge for changing your vote in the electoral college (Extremely easy to get away with)</p></li>
<li><p>George Soros openly funding riots</p></li>
<li><p>MSM has been hitting Trump harder than ever, especially with race bating/homophobia/sexism</p></li>
<li><p>They want the public and the electoral college to think trump is unfit to serve</p></li>
<li><p>As of today a democratic senator signed bill to get rid of the electoral college (Still has to go through senate and house and is a longshot but still)</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook has let &quot;Electoral College&quot; trend for past week until today. They are trying to get the word out.</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook as of today however wouldn&#39;t let &quot;George Soros&quot; trend for more than 5-6 hours</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All in all this shows they are pushing to have the electoral college vote against trump. I know this is all speculation, but this election has taught me to never trust our government and to expect the worse when something opposes their rule.</p>

<p>P.S I know you all are tired of hearing about Trump shit, but if it weren&#39;t for this election many of us (myself included) would never have known about the conspiracies that have turned out to be true and or probably even voted for the man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has all the fixings of a conspiracy in action, however, their ability to pull off something so blatant is hampered by how exposed their scheming has been. Within no time at all the &quot;protesters&quot; were linked to Soros funding, buses were photographed bringing them in and this has been confirmed with the majority of those arrested in Portland being from out of state. I highly doubt that Trump would accept the outcome of this plotting and the end result could be far worse for them than allowing the election result to stand. The question is whether they have the sense to see this and the signs so far are not good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that Electoral College voters can technically just vote for whoever they want is so retarded. It makes no sense, the votes should just be symbolic and 100% binding.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll actually go through with this though. Hillary is so mistrusted and so hated on basically the same level as Trump (likely more so), and that will be inflamed x20 when people see the election literally being outright stolen. I think TPTB would know it would result in a civil war, one where they&#39;d surely lose control of everything and be ousted completely. It&#39;s way too risky and way too abrubt, I think they&#39;d rather just try to manipulate Trump and the rest of the government and then have another go in 4 years. Their methods are mostly based on covert, slow burns, not quick fascist takeovers. They would be tipping their entire hand, which is that the people have no real power any more. They will do everything they can to avoid revealing that, which ironically shows that the people do at least have some power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Nat&#39;l Guard is just made up of common people like you and me. I was in the military once upon a time, we definitely would not be following some orders like &quot;kill these citizens&quot; &quot;take them to camps&quot; &quot;take their guns&quot;. You forget that the majority of the infrastructure of the military is made up of guys and gals that make less than 30k a year. Platoons and companies are close knit family groups, if the majority of them are disgruntled by something this big, TPTB will not be able to do anything to persuade them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. What I wold be worried about is the U.S. bringing foreign troops to quash insurrection. They would have no problem doing the things they are ordered, similar to our boys and girls in Iraq and Afghanistan. We didn&#39;t have an attachment to those people, they were as equal to animals in a sense. The Nat&#39;l Guard might follow orders up to a point, like riot control, but once it&#39;s full blown civil war they would be choosing a side. Most likely protecting their fellow Americans and their own families. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the Electoral College would vote for Hillary the main reason is that a good solid $Billion was spent to achieve this outcome. </p>

<p>About the only likely reason for Trump to not be inaugurated is if something really undeniably incriminating is uncovered about him, like discovering he owes a few hundred million to some Russian associate of Putin&#39;s or there is actual evidence his campaign was in contact with someone in the Russian government.   </p>

<p>I think worst case as of right now is if the vote ended in a tie. 
When the House would vote, I don&#39;t think they would vote for Hillary. 
*They can vote for any of the top 3 vote getters so that would include Johnson, but that is very doubtful. </p>
