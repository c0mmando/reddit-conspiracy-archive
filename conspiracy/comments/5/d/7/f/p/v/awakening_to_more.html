       Certain things I can never explain how I know, but I just know.  I know there are many of you out there that know what I'm saying.  You've awoken to more than just basic understandings.  Fear gone?  Never offended anymore?  Instantly start knowing truths in things by quick flushing feelings across your body when you read it?  Realizing the bits of truth in just about everything?  Connections, patterns and such?  Quit smoking super easy?  Never really able to get super drunk on alcohol anymore?  Buzzing/tingling feeling in your hands, forehead, ring around your head?  Sometimes seen peoples eyes all black?  Know and say things about people you communicate with just by being yourself?  Freaking out some.  Future prediction working?  Visualize something out of the blue that comes true within short time?  Any way.  Whats up :) hehe
      </p>

       Been truth seeking for the past 8 years.  I don't mean finding truth in distractions by governments.  I mean truth seeking in finding who we are and why we are here.  This past year, since xmas last year, I've really POPPED. Very exciting, but also a crazy roller-coaster.  I post tonight because there have been 2 dates for whatever reason that have stuck in my head.  Just like this:  NOV 16 and NOV 19  This could be years or exact dates.  I got NOV 16 while meditating with my higher self.  The 19 was by asking a Mayan Elder if NOV 16 meant anything and he said no, 19.  What ya got?

       There is so little we know on the subatomic level.  Quantum effects we are just now starting to understand.  Many theories on dimensional stuff.  Existing outside of linear time.  One of the quantum things that seems possible for me would be the gate experiment.  Where the particle predicts a future event before it happens.  Future event effecting the past.  No offense meant, but

       I like to find current science knowledge to explain spiritual phenomena.  Thinking of our bodies like biological robots.  Quantum antennas for a brain.  To me this explains so many things through out history.  People like Edgar Cayce and Nostradamus.  If our higher self(spirit) exists in a higher timeless dimension.  Existing outside of time.  Past present and future all accessible to our higher self.  We can all predict the future.  To a certain extent.   Also I believe the

       Forehead, ring around your head may be singularities.
      </p>
      <p>
       (theory through research) It is said evil entities have 4 astral implants in us, 1 in the solar plexus, 1 behind the neck, and 2 in the forehead.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory on us:
      </p>
      <p>
       We were created to be used as physical servants, we grew, literally grew souls/consciousness, to a point where whatever created us, or wants to destroy us simply can't, due to our personal evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in Pleidians and others beings, but I believe there are bad beings, I believe 666 could either be carbon, or the frequencies of the singularities (black holes/worm holes connecting to archon/other negative being that absorbs/lives off of vibrations(666.6 is apparently their frequency).
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the earth is alive, it has a soul, a powerful soul, I believe in Divinity, there is no other name beyond that for it though in my book, simply Divinity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we will evolve into a higher plane of existence, but I believe some will get trapped by evil entities, like a soul torture, while others will be able to ascend to the comprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't drink alcohol, but I smoke weed + tobacco together, I find it extremely hard to quit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Greek mythology, I remember reading about the Furies, I believe they exist, they are djinns though, their purpose is none of our true concern, what matters is the things they do to try to elicit reactions, if its an attempt to get fear, or even an attempt to have you walk another path. I believe you can create the even worse furie's to torment you if your morals are evil.

       I like to think that it is infinite, the universe infinitely connected to more universes, really just making up the quarks of another universe, and etc. Like a picture within a picture within a picture within a picture, etc.

       Thank you, interesting.  Did you have a birthday recently or one coming up soon?  I'm an Aries.  Some of the info you posted is completely opposite of what I've experienced.  I really can't say research because I try to have life experiences for learning rather than reading what other peoples experiences have been.

       Pleiadians and other star systems.  I believe we were seeded by them.  Divine light.  Just like how we now send information via light.  I believe some naturally evolved here, while others came to "visit" and some stayed behind.  Don't think we'll be visited again until we create divine light(create a sun).
      </p>
      <p>
       Agree on earth living also.
      </p>
      <p>
       Completely agree that we are evolving to a higher plane.  I believe many have done this already through out history.  I also believe there is a mass rapid evolution currently going on because of the information age.  A massive change when on the verge of destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greek mythology keeps coming around with me also.  My father wanted to name me Ambrose.

       How would one get control of his dreams and astral? I have tried, I get the slight body wave feeling but I cannot get the body lock going, and what is your take on sleep paralysis?

       I wish I could help on that.  This is something that has come natural to me.  I believe because my father practiced it so much in the early 70s before I was born.  Passing on knowledge.

       I haven't experienced sleep paralysis.  To me it seems like mind waking up while projecting.

       It is, the body locks itself thinking you are about to sleep, then you are able to go from there as long as you have the crazy ringing in your ears and the intense wavy feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that confuses me is when people talk about sleep paralysis and entities, I am confused on why entities would be there.

       I've experienced, what I believe is dimensional vision.  Where at certain times I was able to peek into a higher or lower dimension.  I've had some friends that were heavy meth users that also have experienced similar things.  Shadow people.  May be in that moment of paralysis that is what is being experienced.  A temporary dimensional shift.

       Yes. I definitely do not have any fear anymore, despite rationally thinking that I should. I have also felt like something big is about to happen soon, I had that feeling for about 2 months now. At first it worried me but it doesn't anymore. In fact I am welcoming it and I dont even know why. Any thoughts on this op?

       I've bounced all kinds of possibilities around on this.  I think there is a paradigm shift event coming.  Good or bad, if there is even such thing as good or bad.  The lack of fear for me comes from this realization that everything is a process.  Everything that has happened in my life has come with positive understanding.

       I like to find current science knowledge to explain spiritual phenomena.  Thinking of our bodies like biological robots.  Quantum antennas for a brain.  To me this explains so many things through out history.  People like Edgar Cayce and Nostradamus.  If our higher self(spirit) exists in a higher timeless dimension.  Existing outside of time.  Past present and future all accessible to our higher self.  We can all predict the future.  To a certain extent.   Also I believe the

       shows quantum connection on a subatomic level.
