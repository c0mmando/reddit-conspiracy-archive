    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I mean shit will happen we cannot control and we were born into this reality that was already created.. Like a matrix almost. I know people who have seriously manifested money. Meditating and telepathically speaking to the universe and living by the law of attraction... I had a grandmother who would make home made checks to the universe and Mother Earth GAIA for things she really needed and she would somehow always come up with random money and good things always came her way. She was so positive and happy. Her vibe was amazing. She read tarots and collected crystals. I thought she was the good kind of crazy when I was younger, she would tell me to sleep with crystals under my pillow for good dreams. I would laugh to myself and act like I cared. Yeah she may have seemed crazy but she wasn&#39;t. </p>

<p>We can create our own realities by having a purpose for something and it be a good purpose. You can&#39;t ask the universe for money to go shopping or for materialistic or bad things, you have to ask because you need it to help yourself and your purpose. I&#39;ve read people&#39;s stories and it&#39;s amazing how things work out. Forget the outcome and know everything will work out and good things are always to come. Don&#39;t stress over things. mind over matter, our minds and inner divine selfs are so powerful... We are eternal souls! Having a human experience, it doesnt end here ❤️</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happiness is relative. You can have happiness is your day to day life, but overall I don&#39;t see happiness on the world scale. I want to see happiness with people freed from slavery, having food and water on their table, recovering from homelessness, ending wars, the sharing of knowledge and truth, things that make a big difference in the world.</p>

<p>Would thinking about these things all day in positivity create these changes on a mass scale?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Manifestation. I believe if enough people were, we could change it. As a believer in manifestation, that&#39;s why I feel we are always guided to the negative by the media. Keep us depressed so we have little hope. Get it into our minds that the world is failing and there is nothing we can do about it. Look at the divide the election has caused - it&#39;s for a reason. </p>

<p>I do think individual happiness is the best first step, because believe it or not happiness spreads just like negativity does. Strangely enough, I think we will be taking more steps in the right direction in this regard. People are waking up, but right now a lot are confused, scared, and lost so don&#39;t have much direction or are misguided at the moment. But they are still waking up. </p>

<p>A lot of us feel hopeless because we were groomed to. We&#39;ve been told our entire lives that nothing ever really changes with how the world as a whole is ran. What if we stopped listening? What if we all freed our minds and were able to yearn for a peaceful world, and knew it was possible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Omg dude yes. If we all would think positivity and just be happy the world WOULD change. They have everyone in fear. everyone angry. everyone separated from one another. people hating others because their jealousy. opinions and races are seperating us. All anyone talks about anymore is how everything is going to shit and trump is fucking terrible and basically hitler.. Yeah if they have 90% of people thinking this way, things will not go in the right direction. For all we know trump is going to help raise consciousness and open minds, he already has exposed things the public cannot handle like the fact vaccinations are causing not only autism but severe health issues and more in children. The media did nothin but talk bad about him and good about Hillary, never good about trump. Maybe he isn&#39;t really that bad? Idk but collective consciousness is real and we are all connected along with our thoughts and vibrations and negativity and anger and fear is taking people over and it is only making things worse. What if instead of  everyone in all the militaries wanting to fight and kill for their countries freedom, what if they all decided to just love one another and be positive? Not fight? Not be in fear or anger? Think how different things would be..... So many what ifs... You gotta help raise vibrations and consciousness. Until then nothing will change:(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Obama signed another Executive Order concerning outbreaks, and I haven&#39;t read the whole thing but I heard it has to do with mandatory vaccinations for everyone...I&#39;ll have to dig deeper on that one to know more.</p>

<p>All we are doing is vibrating through an illusion that our consciousness creates from our own perspectives. Our perspectives create our own little world, and we need to realize each of these little worlds are a speck of the greater picture. It&#39;s almost as if we need to take a few different subreddits and combine them into one. Conspiracy awake people, and spiritually awake people, everything&#39;s connected anyway. </p>

<p>In the movie Avatar when the indigenous people are meditating in their large group with everyone connected via hands on their shoulders...That&#39;s the type of connection we need. Feel the energy of everyone flowing. Might sound stupid but I think it would be beneficial, we all just want to be loved and have human contact. If soldiers weren&#39;t fearful they could easily walk up to an opposing enemy and hug it out, and have a beer. I believe it&#39;s that easy, yet we are in a system where many can&#39;t see that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where in the universe do you see peace? From the tiniest atoms to the most complex forms or life, everything is in competition for resources and/or survival. World peace is a lie, nature is all about brutal competition to see which species or genetics is the strongest and most adaptable.</p>

<p>The negativity is the two competing ideologies that have been fighting for hundreds of years, and neither of them are going to go down quietly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, too, create my own reality via a postmodern analysis. Liberals like to act as if the scientific method is sound and infallible, as if it isn&#39;t a western social construct, and that it&#39;s not moral relativism to impose that on the rest of the world. I, however, arrive at a foregone conclusion, and then find accompanying evidence to supplant my ideology, rather than the liberalist method of finding conclusions based upon already discovered evidence. Doing the latter only justifies atheism (a reactionary ideology contrary to the principles of morality and decency), whereas I act with the utmost virtuosity. I extend that same logic to historiography and examination of current events. This justifies conspiratorial thinking and the inscrutableness of reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Manifestation. I believe if enough people were, we could change it. As a believer in manifestation, that&#39;s why I feel we are always guided to the negative by the media. Keep us depressed so we have little hope. Get it into our minds that the world is failing and there is nothing we can do about it. Look at the divide the election has caused - it&#39;s for a reason. </p>

<p>I do think individual happiness is the best first step, because believe it or not happiness spreads just like negativity does. Strangely enough, I think we will be taking more steps in the right direction in this regard. People are waking up, but right now a lot are confused, scared, and lost so don&#39;t have much direction or are misguided at the moment. But they are still waking up. </p>

<p>A lot of us feel hopeless because we were groomed to. We&#39;ve been told our entire lives that nothing ever really changes with how the world as a whole is ran. What if we stopped listening? What if we all freed our minds and were able to yearn for a peaceful world, and knew it was possible?</p>
