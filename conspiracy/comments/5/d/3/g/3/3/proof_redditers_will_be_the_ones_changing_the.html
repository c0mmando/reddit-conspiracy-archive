        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">45</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-11-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/[deleted].html">[deleted]</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Common Knowledge is a concept formally described in game theory. To understand it quickly, here&#39;s a short puzzle:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On an island where everyone knows each other, there are 100 people who have blue eyes, and the rest have green eyes. Since the beginning of times on that island, no one has ever known their own eye color, as there is no mirror (and no one ever talks about eye color, it&#39;s very taboo). By rule, if a person on the island ever discovers they have blue eyes, they must leave the island at dawn on the day of the discovery. </p>

<p>At some point, a Reddit troll comes to the island, calls together all the people together, and makes the following announcement on loudspeakers, making sure everyone can hear: &quot;At least one of you has blue eyes&quot;. Because he subscribes to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, the outsider is well-known as entirely trustworthy; nobody thinks of questioning him.</p>

<p>The puzzle: assuming everyone on the island is completely logical and lawful, what is the eventual outcome of that public intervention?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer: on the 100th day after the announcement, at dawn, all the blue-eyed people leave the island at once. It works with any other positive number of blue-eyed people (that is, if there are k blue-eyed islanders, they all leave on the kth day). The explanation is actually easy and is at the end of the post. </p>

<p>The point is this: a troll came and didn&#39;t teach anyone anything. In this case everyone knew at least one islander had blue eyes, as they could all see it (although they didn&#39;t speak of it). Yet, they were living happily since the beginning of times; and now all the blue-eyes companions had to exile. What changed?</p>

<p>The answer is the common knowledge. Not what anybody knows, but what anybody knows that everyone knows. It&#39;s not the fact the islanders heard the troll say what he said, it&#39;s the fact they all saw all the other islanders listening to him say it.</p>

<p>This grasp of common knowledge is critical to understanding how propaganda works, as it revolves around herd identity, behavior manipulation and human domestication.</p>

<p>This is why the &quot;mainstream media&quot; is kept alive: they detain the crown of common knowledge, the symbolic loudspeaker. Even if in reality they attract less people than Zerohedge (or popular subreddits). If it&#39;s on CNN, everyone knows that everyone knows. Because you&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to watch CNN. When we say &quot;it&#39;s official&quot;, i.e. &quot;they admit it in the MSM&quot;, we are actually referring to a very important notion of game theory.</p>

<p>On September 11 2001 now. That event is the keystone of our modern edifice of lies. Once you taste the red pill on 911, you never come back, and you eventually taste all the other red pills. It&#39;s a very powerful gateway pill. And it&#39;s the most accessible pill also. It&#39;s right there, it&#39;s easy, it&#39;s tempting.</p>

<p>Seriously. What kind of idiot can believe the conspiracy theory of bearded aerobats who throw passports out of aircraft cabins seconds before bringing down three steel skyscrapers with two aluminum planes? Come on.</p>

<p>But that has been true for a long time. So what changed? Actually, everything changed a few days ago.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is now common knowledge that &quot;politicians are corrupt&quot;. Trump just got elected saying that. Everyone saw that everyone saw it. It&#39;s not a controversial thing to say anymore, it is the new mainstream. </p></li>
<li><p>Operations like Infowars, Drudge or Breitbart are now part of mainstream news. Like Fox News during Bush 43; still not part of the establishment, but an acknowledged &quot;institutional&quot; current. Roger Stone essentially spoke for Trump with Alex Jones during the whole campaign, and everyone knows that everyone knows, Hillary even made a speech denouncing Alex Jones by name.</p></li>
<li><p>It is established by actual fact that the global elite and politicians delve in occult beliefs. It is the new secret de Polichinelle. The Podesta emails are soaked with references to Spirit Cooking and back-yard ritual sacrifices of Galliformes in honor of Moloch. So that Stanley Kubrick movie was actually more like a documentary? This fact is not common knowledge per say, although it is a common knowledge contender, as it is not ridicule anymore to say you think so, as mainstream opposition says it (we&#39;ve moved from ignoring the notion to fighting it, admitting it would amount by definition to a new common knowledge).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the Podesta dumps and Eyes Wide shut, there is Bohemian Grove. Lagarde&#39;s Magick number 7. The dead pig fucking. The mock execution rituals. The elite&#39;s well-known penchant for gnostic superstitions. The ubiquitous symbols. The affairs. The testimonies. After all, they talk about it very nonchalantly, exactly like if it were <em>their</em> common knowledge. That&#39;s the real news. All this corruption, abuse, hermetic bullshit: it&#39;s normal for them. No big deal. Nothing new or extraordinary.</p>

<p>The edifice of lies is close to tumbling, but it has not yet fallen. They want a controlled demolition, we want the truth. It has one Achilles&#39; heel at the moment: September 11. Given time, they can probably spin it (e.g. turn against Saudi Arabia somehow). Today, 911 represents the first (and only real major) geopolitical event for much of the Internet generation. If the common knowledge on 911 changes, the whole narrative fails. The whole propaganda is quickly exposed. </p>

<p>So, as of today, even if the government is forced to say &quot;oops, turns out someone we know did 911, here, the culprits are him, the dancing Israelis had nothing to do with it whatsoever, don&#39;t worry the new bad guy is getting waterboarded, next?‚Äù it wouldn&#39;t work. Everyone would hang. Even intellectuals would start questioning things. If you understand 911 as a false-flag you quickly understand it as a hermetic ritual. Similarly we would question money. We would question aliens. We would question history. Atheists would question God. Everyone would understand what force turns everything upside down. Without guidance from above, lemmings would turn to the collective consciousness that is the Internet, en masse, for an answer. To Reddit and Youtube as their new piper (I&#39;m talking about bathroom justice militants offended by sexist nosebleeds - they would snap out of their cognitive dissonance).</p>

<p>So, the time is perfect for getting this done.</p>

<p>The key message: anyone who believes the Bush/Obama conspiracy theories on 911 are fools. If you believe those, you are in the minority. Poor you. Everyone thinks you&#39;re stupid. Please, avoid saying so in public. No, really, for your own sake.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not clinging and scratching to be heard anymore. We&#39;re not &quot;defending a theory&quot;. We&#39;re in the mainstream now. It is those who suggest the outrageous conspiracy theories of magical planes and the transubstantiation of steel that have the burden of proof.</p>

<p>It is very important the narrative be thus changed. We need to meme the shit out of this. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t you hear? A majority of Americans knows the government system is systemically corrupt. Clinton, who could very well have become President, received hundreds of millions while she was a public employee. The Clinton Foundation was the billing department of the State Department. Don&#39;t you read Wikileaks? Clinton, Bush and the media are all in together. Everyone knows that. This is not a partisan thing at all, I&#39;m astonished you haven&#39;t heard of it. You should get up to speed. Stop peddling conspiracy theories about government benevolence and charitable souls among the billionaire elite class, you&#39;re ridiculing yourself.</p>

<p>That is the meme. That is what I believe you will achieve, here from Reddit.</p>

<p>I start with the image posted <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Hm8gE">herein</a>. Just a humble example. There are millions of possibilities and thousands of formats. Others are infinitely more imaginative.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve read this far, you deserve the explanation on the island.</p>

<p>Imagine there&#39;s only 1 blue-eyed islander. When the troll speaks, that islander understands he must have blue eyes, since he doesn&#39;t see (and has never seen) anyone else with blue eyes. So if there&#39;s at least 1, there can only be 1, and it must be him. He therefore logically leaves at dawn.</p>

<p>If there are exactly two blue-eye islanders: when nobody leaves at dawn on the day of the announcement, they understand they must blue-eyed too. Indeed: they only know of one other blue-eyed islander. Therefore, he should have left on that first dawn. Because he didn&#39;t means he, too, sees another blue-eyed islander. But that blue-eyed islander can only be him, because he can only see one. They both leave on the second dawn.</p>

<p>If there are 3 blue-eyed islanders, they expect the other 2 to leave on the second day as per above; because they don&#39;t, each one knows they must have blue eyes, and all 3 leave together at dawn on the 3rd day. </p>

<p>This inductive argument holds for any k &gt; 0, where k is the quantity of blue-eyed islanders. When k &gt; 1, no islander learns anything new from the announcement; the upheaval happens solely based on common knowledge. </p>

<p>The proof you came here looking for? A free and competitive market will always produce an exponentially growing quality aggregate. Thus is (human) nature. Emergence of the beautiful unknown out of the stochastic and unilateral trial-and-error. This means a better comparison of truths tends towards greater Truth. Reddit epitomizes this. All message boards do. Understanding the information presented herein has to spread out of them. 911 is self-evident. </p>

The assassination of JFK raised a lot of pretty big questions and conspiracy theories that were even featured in mainstream media and blockbuster movies, yet nothing changed. Everyone knows it was more than just a crazed lone gunman, but no one stood trial and Bush Sr was elected later to be president. The emperor has no clothes, we all talk about it, but it will never be official. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the contrary, everything is pretty clear. </p>

<p>On that question about 911, I suppose you&#39;re being sarcastic. Unless you DO believe in the transubstantiation of steel and magical airplanes. </p>

<p>The logic is that since now it is common knowledge the government is corrupt (i.e. everyone knows that everyone knows that, it is the new mainstream opinion), now is a good time to feed the red pill to the remaining normies who still cling to the crazy 911 conspiracy theory pushed by the corrupt media/elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I start people off with footage of building 7 &quot;collapsing.&quot;  There is one video that shows several angles, and after a few takes shows a side by side comparison with an actual controlled demolition. No commentary. No political motives or finger pointing. Its stands alone. They will inevitably, in a confused tone, ask if that building was hit by a plane. Simply tell them &quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>Multiple angles:
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bWorDrTC0Qg">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bWorDrTC0Qg</a></p>

<p>This one shows side-by-side with controlled demolition (turn sound off when showing to avoid spookiness)</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EOslOtFZNgs">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EOslOtFZNgs</a></p>

<p>They will start to ask questions about what caused the collapse. From there, answer their questions directly and briefly: &quot;the report is that fires were started as a result of burning debris from buildings 1 and 2.&quot; Offer no additional information, or motives unless they ask you directly.  If you start spinning the webs and connecting dots, you will lose them and cognitive dissonance sets in. </p>

<p>If they stop asking questions, they are probably uncomfortable at the implications of the truth. Don&#39;t push them any further. Let them mull it over on their own. Humans are curious creatures, they will start to dig on their own if they are ready.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official 9/11 fairy take violates Newton&#39;s 1st and 3rd laws pretty blatantly.</p>

<p>The footage on all the major media outlets of the buildings falling shows them falling way too fast for it.  Even ignoring any structural integrity the buildings had and assuming a fly could have landed on each piece and turned it to dust, conservation of momentum tells you as the part falling at any instant hits another not yet moving floor, it will slow down a bit transferring momentum to that added floor.   This alone would bring the collapse time to ~45s.   The <strong>only</strong> explanation for it happening faster is that the lower floors were actually destroyed first, as in controlled demolition.</p>

Also there is just no explanation for it(i mean the NIST report but even that can be used as good evidence for us because in it our government admits it fell at freefall speed), hell the 9-11 Commission didn&#39;t even mention it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pedophile ring is what&#39;s going to crack things wide open IMO. It&#39;s been documented and suppressed for so long in every single culture; there are so many people who know something is up based on something heard or experienced themselves, but don&#39;t speak up because they know how complete the cover up has been - the know they will be silenced or dismissed as insane. </p>

<p>But this is a crime no one can justify, and when it b comes common knowledge it provides a gateway into the occult side, and the scale of the global conspiracy that makes it all possible.</p>
