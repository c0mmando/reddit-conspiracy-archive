    <div class="md"><p>A perversion of knowledge maybe. Considering it is the structure of space according to a savant. <a href="http://www.livescience.com/45349-brain-injury-turns-man-into-math-genius.html">Link</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/576rx8/jason_padgetts_structure_of_space_deja_vu/">Link 2</a></p>

<p>Edit also let us not forget Nassim Haramein also established that the hexagram contains infinity and finite structure in one symbol. The symbol from my very basic knowledge (based on his video black Whole) is a way of depicting infinite division within a finite structure. Yin/Yang. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I will put it this way. I had a book and man I wanna get that book again but anyways. I had a book that described all the different drugs and their effects because i am a book worm and Peyote is the one Psychedelic that does not cause physical problems or mental problems. All the others have &quot;the potential&quot; to escalate a underlying mental problem. This was great for me because I was seriously traumatized many times as a child. I always tell people about peyote because it has helped me at least deal with my problems as a adult or at least in the frame of mind as an adult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea LSD was the one I wanted the most and yet I turned it down last year because at this point I have heard the call and don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; to return.

    <div class="md"><p>Naw i mean legit bro, I have mental issues. If I smoke It sure does help me deal with the shit going on but truly I do procrastinate because I am too satiated at that moment to do anything productive. I mean I can woop some ass on some games like you would not believe but try to see me get a job while high or look for that matter and it aint gonna happen. I am just being honest. I love Cannabis. It is the healer. Though It has its drawbacks sometimes. I mean look at Graham Hancock. He was told in a ayahuasca trip that he was abusing Cannabis. It is all subjective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I actually did not but I believe just like hippocrates said. All diseases start in the gut. Trust me look at Chlorella. Look at who studied it. Also there is a page that explains what it does and trust me it does a lot for the body but I cant remember right now. BUT. I remember taking 20 grams and literally I saw the light of my eyes come back.. somthing you would have to see for yourself to believe. When you get the toxic shit out of you, your body responds quite accordingly. I used it so much till Fukashima because it is grown in Japan. But seriously look at the wiki page because a lot of people that we talk about have studied it after ww2 and it was because of the atomic bomb. IF we could grow that stuff and crack the cell wall in the way it needs to be, we could literally stop world hunger. It only takes sunlight and water plus whatever way to crack the cell wall. It is 50% protein and the rest is basically vitamins and minerals. </p>

He said that type of radiation is nothing to worry about but I still have my reservations. Either way I cannot trust it unless I grow it myself. Also do not be fooled. We are not invincible, trust me. I know full well what a human can take from psychological trauma and emotional trauma it does effect you deeply even without your knowing of it.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Following global fears of an uncontrollable human population boom during the late 1940s and the early 1950s, Chlorella was seen as a new and promising primary food source and as a possible solution to the then-current world hunger crisis. Many people during this time thought hunger would be an overwhelming problem and saw Chlorella as a way to end this crisis by providing large amounts of high-quality food for a relatively low cost.[3]</p>

<p><strong>Many institutions began to research the algae, including the Carnegie Institution, the Rockefeller Foundation, the NIH, UC Berkeley, the Atomic Energy Commission, and Stanford University.</strong> Following World War II, many Europeans were starving, and many Malthusians attributed this not only to the war, but also to the inability of the world to produce enough food to support the increasing population. According to a 1946 FAO report, the world would need to produce 25 to 35% more food in 1960 than in 1939 to keep up with the increasing population, while health improvements would require a 90 to 100% increase.[3] Because meat was costly and energy-intensive to produce, protein shortages were also an issue. Increasing cultivated area alone would go only so far in providing adequate nutrition to the population. The USDA calculated that, to feed the U.S. population by 1975, it would have to add 200 million acres (800,000 km²) of land, but only 45 million were available. One way to combat national food shortages was to increase the land available for farmers, yet the American frontier and farm land had long since been extinguished in trade for expansion and urban life. Hopes rested solely on new agricultural techniques and technologies. Because of these circumstances, an alternative solution was needed.</p>

<p>To cope with the upcoming post-war population boom in the United States and elsewhere, researchers decided to tap into the unexploited sea resources. Initial testing by the Stanford Research Institute showed Chlorella (when growing in warm, sunny, shallow conditions) could convert 20% of solar energy into a plant that, when dried, contains 50% protein.[3] In addition, Chlorella contains fat and vitamins. The plant&#39;s photosynthetic efficiency allows it to yield more protein per unit area than any other plant—one scientist predicted 10,000 tons of protein a year could be produced with just 20 workers staffing a one-thousand-acre (4-square kilometer) Chlorella farm.[3] The pilot research performed at Stanford and elsewhere led to immense press from journalists and newspapers, yet did not lead to large-scale algae production. Chlorella seemed like a viable option because of the technological advances in agriculture at the time and the widespread acclaim it got from experts and scientists who studied it. Algae researchers had even hoped to add a neutralized Chlorella powder to conventional food products, as a way to fortify them with vitamins and minerals.[3]</p>

<p>When the preliminary laboratory results were published, the scientific community at first backed the possibilities of Chlorella. Science News Letter praised the optimistic results in an article entitled &quot;Algae to Feed the Starving&quot;. John Burlew, the editor of the Carnegie Institution of Washington book Algal Culture-from Laboratory to Pilot Plant, stated, &quot;the algae culture may fill a very real need,&quot;[6] which Science News Letter turned into &quot;future populations of the world will be kept from starving by the production of improved or educated algae related to the green scum on ponds.&quot; The cover of the magazine also featured Arthur D. Little&#39;s Cambridge laboratory, which was a supposed future food factory. A few years later, the magazine published an article entitled &quot;Tomorrow&#39;s Dinner&quot;, which stated, &quot;There is no doubt in the mind of scientists that the farms of the future will actually be factories.&quot; Science Digest also reported, &quot;common pond scum would soon become the world&#39;s most important agricultural crop.&quot; However, in the decades since those claims were made, algae have never been cultivated on nearly that scale.&quot;</p>

I have no doubt TPTB are hiding that from us. I mean why not, If we were all genius&#39;s we would have zero problem defeating the tyranny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t subscribe to that stuff, no offense meant but I can relate. The one thing that blew my mind from psychedelics was that i had sympathy toward everyone after the experience. Instead of hating everyone and blaming everyone for my problems, I took responsibility for them and understood why others cannot. (destruction of the ego) I still battle with the ego in every day life though, because those who have not destroyed their ego are still well....egocentric. I hope we dont have to resort to abducting people and electroshocking them to get them on the right track lol. Sounds a lot like MK Ultra. :D </p>

I actually have compiled my Magnum Opus and shared it One time on reddit then deleted it because no one could appreciate the hard work that I put into it.
