<p>A &quot;shill&quot; will comment in a way to upset someone into defending an argument (mainly one that doesn&#39;t need defending) look at their post and comment history and you&#39;ll see a pattern of trolling.</p>

<p>They will post right wing posts to liberal boards and visa versa. They will post nonsense to conspiracy to make the board look crazy, or they wont have any posts at all.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing with the paid posters is to look at the Trends of what they post. At the height of shilldom before the election were posters who quite obviously just spit out talking points that almost literally resembled what the MSM or Campaign officials said. Also you can see their post histories were 99% <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, their usernames were first_last or something dumb making fun of people they didn&#39;t agree with like Uvon_the_deplorable (analogue to Uvon_the_terrible, a Trump supporter), and they almost always had accounts &lt;6 months old or multiple years old with barely any karma. </p>

<p>If you go to CTR&#39;s website, you can view information on the Barrier Breakers project but that&#39;s not the only example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always ask myself, &quot;do they have any business posting this opinion here?&quot;</p>

<p>For example, you don&#39;t go to r/fugal and tell the users they&#39;re just being cheap bastards, so why would you go to r/whereisassange and tell people they&#39;re just being conspiracy theorist?</p>

<p>Also, look at age of account, length of posts, content of posts, and verified email addresses.</p>

<p>Shills will often use 1 or 2 liners, while skeptics are willing to defend their views. Its harder to weed out the trolls if anything because that can be a trait of either a shill or a skeptic, but generally trolls have nothing of value to say anything, so might as well ignore them too for the most part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A shill is somebody is in on the scam.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>noun
1.
an accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic &gt;customer to entice or encourage others.
verb
1.
act or work as a shill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This term has been colloquialized to have a broader meaning recently by it being thrown around at people who have legitimate concerns and voice those concerns. This is one of the more sinister effects of shills. They kill any legitimate discourse by making everyone question each others motives and intentions, which poisons the well for the original community. See <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a>, there was a recent post by a mod, which basically told the community at large that the people questioning the status of wikileaks and Assange are all &quot;astroturfers&quot; which is another word for shill.</p>

<p>An example of a shill is CTR. These people are in on the scam. They are paid to spread the talking points of the cause they are working for, and to undermine and discredit anything that is working against their cause. </p>

<p>An example of a skeptic is somebody who has a real reason for the way they think that isn&#39;t influenced by their relationship to the topic at hand. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/shill:">https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/shill:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>An accomplice of a confidence trickster or swindler who poses as a genuine customer to entice or encourage others</p></li>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Using those definitions, we conspiracy theorists are the &#39;skeptics&#39;  and anyone who has a vested interest in denying our skepticism is a &#39;shill&#39;.</p>
