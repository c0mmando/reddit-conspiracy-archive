<p>We&#39;ve all be programmed to do things we don&#39;t like or think are wrong, for years and on various jobs , it&#39;s just a matter of variations are how we objectify that, and more importantly, are we even conscious about that.

    <div class="md"><p>They buy into the ideology of lack.  Lack of food, shelter, etc.  This allows them to be controlled through fear (the fear of NOT having enough of x, y, and z).  These people are essentially in a level of consciousness that equates to survival mode.</p>

<p>They do not operate out of love or a desire for truth.</p>

<p>Many of them are so deeply enmeshed with the perversity of the control system and identify so completely with the very system that enslaves them that they will defend it to their last breath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not so much Brainwashing per say, but more like subversive indoctrination of oppressive programs by controlling the perceived Norms of the populace. These individuals have an NSA/CIA/FBI/whatever badge that leads them to believe they are working for the better good of the country. </p>

<p>One should not forget that in the late 1800&#39;s most of the superpowers in the world were heavily invested in Psychology(how the mind works, and why it works) the Elite know the ins and outs of your mind, yet you have never though to investigate Psychology. </p>

<p>in my opinion the understanding of Psychological mechanism and processes are vital in the age of information. Knowledge is power, and Psychology will help you in your journey.</p>
