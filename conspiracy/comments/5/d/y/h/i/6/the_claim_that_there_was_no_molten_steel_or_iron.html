<p><strong>The Claim that There Was No Molten Steel or Iron in the WTC Buildings</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li>The claim that no evidence of any molten steel or iron was found in any of the WTC buildings is strongly <strong>refuted by three scientific reports,</strong> one from a government agency (USGS).

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/articles/WTCHighTemp2.pdf">Extremely high temperatures during the WTC destruction</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2005/1165/508OF05-1165.html">Particle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust</a></li>
<li><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/cache/nyenvirolaw_WTCDustSignatureCompositionAndMorphology.pdf">The RJ Lee Report - WTC Dust Signature</a> </li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcqf5tL887o">John Gross’s claim</a> that <em>“no eyewitnesses said”</em> that there was molten steel (or iron) was strongly and repeatedly contradicted.</li>
<li>The claim that molten steel or iron would be irrelevant because it could have been produced in the combustion pile: <strong>This would mean claiming, with no scientific evidence and no plausibility,</strong> that combustion in an oxygen-starved pile of rubbish could have heated steel to at least 1500°C (2800° F).</li>
<li>With regard to the NIST claim that molten steel or iron is <em>“irrelevant to the investigation of the collapse”</em> because <em>“it does not provide any conclusive information on the condition of the steel when the WTC towers [including WTC 7] were standing”:</em> Given the fact that <strong>the <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/moltenflow.jpg">molten steel</a> or iron in the debris could not have been produced without incendiaries or explosives</strong>, the presence of either of them indicates that some of the steel was melted before, or during, the final moments of the collapses.</li>
<li>With regard to NIST’s statement in its post-report publication that there was no evidence for <em>“the melting of steel in a jet-fuel ignited fire in the towers”:</em> This is a statement that is truly irrelevant. <strong>The whole point is that the presence of melted steel and/or iron is an indication that the buildings must have been brought down by something other than fire.</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>None of the official claims about the non-existence of molten iron or steel in the destroyed WTC buildings withstand scrutiny. </p>

<p>The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact. </p>

<p>Especially dramatic evidence of various types was provided by several facts: that the original RJ Lee report showed that there was almost 1,500 times more iron in the dust than normal; that the rubble contained steel with gaping holes, manifesting a <em>“Swiss cheese appearance”</em> that shocked the three <em>“fire-wise professors”</em> from Worcester Polytechnic Institute; <strong>that lead had been vaporized; that molybdenum had been melted; and that the metal pools contained iron that had been heated, as shown by the orange color, above 2,000°C (3,632°F).</strong></p>

<p>When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, <strong>the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible or believable</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have discussed this with people who believe the official story, one of whom is a commercial airline pilot. He understand the science behind metal melting points, but he just cant accept it. He also acknowledges the speed and maneuvering limitations of the aircrafts allegedly involved (he flies them every day) and still, he wont buy it.</p>

<p>I challenged him to perform the same flight in a simulator (a mutual friend has access to a military base flight simulator) and he claims he could do it.</p>

<p>I showed him a video of a veteran pilot (many years his senior) making several attempts at the 9/11 flight path, all resulting in structural failure of the aircraft, and he still wont believe it.</p>

<p>My point is, that people will believe whatever keeps them happy and their world spinning. The implications of a conspiracy are too great to comprehend, which is why we have such an uphill battle exposing the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell him about the physics doesnt work there, specificaly the theory about conservation law. The buildings when they start falling gain speed, accelerate downwards, instead of being slowed down by the structure underneath. Do some research about it yourself maybe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My research on 9/11 is extensive. My point was, even while pointing out how the laws of physics and thermodynamics were violated on many fronts of the official story, people will still find a way to rationalize why your wrong for telling them that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My biggest question is: if we assume that Wtc towers were brought down by bombs, where were these bombs planted, when were they planted, how did no one notice anything?</p>

<p>One explanation could be that the bombs were planted in the steel beamd, already when it was built, no one noticed since those who inspect the metal was in on it/didnt look after it/planted it</p>

<p>This scenario at least the two last point I consider among the more unlikely scenarios</p>

<p>Do you think the removal of bomb sniffing dogs was instantaneous or over a little while, and who gave such an order?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who gave the order I don&#39;t think has ever been discovered or disclosed, though Marvin Bush [Brother of GW Bush] was on the board of directors of the company that handled security.
And the sniffer dogs were removed on Sept 6th. So on Sept 5thh they were there as normal, and the next day they weren&#39;t. They did not return before 9/11.</p>
