<p>Just wanted to say there is a man possibly there that is actually exposing governments who is mysteriously absent for many weeks. And a handful of people out of the millions in that area give a fuck about it. That seems like a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Swedish lawyers didn&#39;t interview assange in person. They made an agreement with Ecuador to allow an Ecuadorean prosecutor to put the questions to assange, and relay back his responses. They also would not allow Julian&#39;s lawyer to be present.</p>

<p>EDIT: does anyone have a source to clarify that Swedish prosecutors did not actually sit face to face with assange? I recall reading that multiple times as it was occurring, but am having trouble finding a legitimate source now. Want to clarify for accuracy.</p>

<p>Swedish prosecutor. FTFY.</p>

<p>Assange&#39;s Swedish defence lawyer was not invited and so he had no legal representation. The only people present were Swedish and Ecuadorian government officials. But I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything strange about that either.</p>

<p>This is useless. &#39;Tonight&#39; means NOTHING in a global world. Instead, &quot;Force their hand: Let&#39;s make #WhereIsAssange trend on &lt;date and time in UTC&gt;&quot; would be better (with multiple reminder submissions), so people are prepared, and unified on a hashtag (seriously, let&#39;s stick to one).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think where is assange is the psyop, everyone wants to see him at the window but thatd prove he is accessible through that window, YOU KNOW THE SAME WINDOW SOMEONE TRIED TO BREAK INTO A COUPLE MONTHS AGO OR DID WE CONVIENENTLY FORGET ABOUT THAT?</p>

<p>What else does this whole thing do? It&#39;s trying to discredit wikileaks and cast doubt about the proof currently in front of our faces, what does discrediting wikileaks do? It shifts the paradigm back to the msm possibly looking credible or confuses people completely into thinking the evidence was destroyed again. How nice that would be for them, discrediting wikileaks was the plan no matter who the winner of the election was.</p>

<p>Now lets look at the john piliger interview and how convienent it&#39;d be for them if they could somehow edit it do discredit piliger as well as further push this narrative that wikileaks is compromised using the newly emerged prominent investigative mindset of the internet that was looking for little clues and rabbit holes to follow. What if these edits and such were meant to be found in order to again, further push the narrative that wikileaks is compromised?</p>

<p>Also notice how wikileaks claimed a video from 2014, i believe it was a 2014 video couldve been a 2012 one cant remember exactly, but anyways the video was claimed to be brand new after the blackout ddos attack that occured on the US. In this video assange details exactly what they claimed was happening around the day his internet was cut. The heavily armed teams seen outside the embassy on a wednesday, etc. Next they released a michael moore picture claiming it to be new when it was obviously from months ago, i believe june specifically. Wikileaks was trying to tell us THEY WERE RECYCLING PAST INCIDENTS TO DISCREDIT (TERMINATE) WIKILEAKS</p>

<p>The compromised wikileaks sub deleting any thread pertaining to this in order to cause a streisand effect that, how convientently again, gives a false sense of credibility to this narrative that wikileaks is compromised that is systematically being pushed daily. Look at how systematically &quot;the wikileaks is compromised&quot; narrative is being pushed. The fat is almost too percectly trimmed from this narrative that puts together each one of these events that seem to convienently fit together perfectly to make people believe wikileaks is compromised. Who benefits the most out of wikileaks looking compromised and everyone thinking assange is already missing or dead? </p>

<p>Another piece used in the wikileaks is compromised is the airport near the embassy being shut down via chemical attack. A very interesting piece of this puzzle indeed certainly. Possibly a false flag to further give credit to the &quot;wikileaks is compromised&quot; narrative.</p>

<p>The perfectly put together pictures of a supposed wikileaks insider 4chan posts, trying once again give a false sense of credibility via riding on the coat tails of fbi anon</p>

<p>I could be completely wrong but what if im not and wikileaks is falsely discredited? What if enough doubt is cast that they find an elaborate escape route from all that wikileaks has revealed about these elite circles? It just seems too convient for those involved in the evils revealed via these leaks that wikileaks looks compromised. It&#39;s really their only escape is to convince everyone that wikileaks is compromised and that the evidence has been tampered with.</p>

<p>TL;DR: EXPLOITATION OF THE STREISAND EFFECT TO DISCREDIT WIKILEAKS</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange fled around 15th october. When &quot;they&quot; discovered Assange was on the run, they implemented a damage control plan (the airport, the plane, the &quot;wikileaks is compromised&quot; story). </p>

<p>They don&#39;t know, as we don&#39;t, if he is alive or dead and where he is. Wikileaks knows he&#39;s fled but I think very few people know where he is. I think Trump knows (that&#39;s why he never mentions anymore Assange or Wikileaks).</p>

<p>Thinking Assange as dead is best for everybody, us and them. And Assange too. We will see him again on 21th January, when he&#39;ll get his pardon in front of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt a pardon would protect him from a vengeful pol who was exposed as a result of the leaks. Even if a worldwide pardon existed, he has made far too many enemies now to ever be safe. I hope he can remain obscure and safe for the rest of his natural life with his family. He&#39;s given up a lot to bring this information to light, it&#39;s what he deserves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think part of the problem is that if you truly ruly believe Assange is dead then you think &#39;hell yeah let&#39;s go to the embassy&#39; but then you think &#39;faaark if he is really dead, nothing I do is going to make a difference &amp; I could well get myself put on a database&#39; &amp; if Assange is dead that database that&#39;s real nasty shit in a Assange is dead world.  And on the other side if you think maybe you a just being a little paranoid, then when it comes to actually standing up &amp; doing something about it, on the day you&#39;re like &#39;meh, I&#39;ll look like a fool or if it&#39;s not just paranoia then..&#39; back to the database conundrum.</p>

<p>That and here in the U.K. (unfortunately I&#39;m in Wales and tbh I feel that I need to think of my two toddlers before mummy goes and outs herself as an activist &amp; yes I am aware that inaction is also potentially bad for them) I would not be at all surprised if there isn&#39;t some kind of gag order regarding Assange because there has been very little in the MSM about him here in the past two months. Just enough to not raise suspicions perhaps, but really very little at all, so unless they are in a forum like this, I doubt very much that Londoners are even aware of some of the odd things that have happened. I had thought he had a big contingent of supporters here, but from what we see on the media not even they have made much of a peep, although apparently there were some at the Embassy the day the Swedes took his statement, so here in this country you kind of feel like there is nothing you can do, especially if his usual supporters seem mute.</p>
