       The "Israelis " use this tactic on the WORLD. They run the studios. They control the industry. And all those free tube sites can't possibly be being run as for-profit businesses. Not when you consider the bandwidth required. They are mind control and social conditioning.

       What do you want a return to Victorian style hypocrisy?

       I don't doubt there is bad intent behind a lot of this, but people need to take some reponsibility for themselves.

       How does one "take responsibility" when the entire superstructure of bourgeois culture has been proliferated by insane madmen for the purposes of destroying culture and exploiting (often manufactured) divisions for the acquisition of power and profit?
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't to say that people are completely helpless, but for those who are trapped under the weight of this system escape is nearly impossible. That some have become aware of these issues is a huge step forward. However, resorting to what is essentially victim blaming and saying "man up", or whatever, doesn't help anyone and only obscures the problem. Social problems must be dealt with socially. It isn't simply a matter of individuals acting in individual interests. Nor can one reasonably be expected to draw many of the right conclusions on their own. Simply yelling "wake up, sheeple" or "you have to take personal responsibility for your actions" isn't helpful to anyone or anything but the individual ego. I don't know where most went to school, or how far they got, but if their education was as devoid of substance as what I witnessed growing up, then it's no wonder that the level of social consciousness is so low. If you want to help people (say, with pornography) then offer advice and resources to understand the world as it is and to be able to respond appropriately to their place in it.

       Absolutely they are trying to survive.  Don't forget their history without a homeland and heavy persecution of not only through the Catholic Church over the millenia but bakc to the Greeks, Babylonians, and Egyptians.  They are an incredibly ethnocentric community that has as us vs. them mentality to this day.  Study the history of international banking and you will discover a power greater than kings and it was controlled by one very powerful Jewish family.

       Maybe but given as I have no clue where the proverbial buck stops it's hard to go down that rabbit hole as you will not get to the bottom of it. We don't really know,we are not privy to that world.

       It is interesting, I think people need to get upto speed with what is right in front of their noses i.e. the change in their pockets.

       We've been hacked.  The crux of human cultures around the world will be forced to change and bow down to virtual goddess worship. Every religion, family value, and moral belief will lay dead in porn's wake.  Think about what they did with the Ashley Madison "hack".  Wait until the ISP's get hacked and it is public knowledge who visits what website.  All of those christian conservatives family values people are going to have a rough time.  The end game is the break down of the family and religion through social shaming so that it is replaced by the societal values.

       As a matter of fact , I could say that there's been a major production coming from eastern europe, former eastern block, now 'liberated' by Nato and EU. Whether it's a pure coincidence, fruits of democratic liberation or a major conspiracy, that I can not say.
