    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;Israelis&quot; aren&#39;t forcing people to make their own or watch it.<br/>

I don&#39;t doubt there is bad intent behind a lot of this, but people need to take some reponsibility for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does one &quot;take responsibility&quot; when the entire superstructure of bourgeois culture has been proliferated by insane madmen for the purposes of destroying culture and exploiting (often manufactured) divisions for the acquisition of power and profit?</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say that people are completely helpless, but for those who are trapped under the weight of this system escape is nearly impossible. That some have become aware of these issues is a huge step forward. However, resorting to what is essentially victim blaming and saying &quot;man up&quot;, or whatever, doesn&#39;t help anyone and only obscures the problem. Social problems must be dealt with socially. It isn&#39;t simply a matter of individuals acting in individual interests. Nor can one reasonably be expected to draw many of the right conclusions on their own. Simply yelling &quot;wake up, sheeple&quot; or &quot;you have to take personal responsibility for your actions&quot; isn&#39;t helpful to anyone or anything but the individual ego. I don&#39;t know where most went to school, or how far they got, but if their education was as devoid of substance as what I witnessed growing up, then it&#39;s no wonder that the level of social consciousness is so low. If you want to help people (say, with pornography) then offer advice and resources to understand the world as it is and to be able to respond appropriately to their place in it.</p>

Don&#39;t forget their history without a homeland and heavy persecution of not only through the Catholic Church over the millenia but bakc to the Greeks, Babylonians, and Egyptians.

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve been hacked.  The crux of human cultures around the world will be forced to change and bow down to virtual goddess worship. Every religion, family value, and moral belief will lay dead in porn&#39;s wake.  Think about what they did with the Ashley Madison &quot;hack&quot;.  Wait until the ISP&#39;s get hacked and it is public knowledge who visits what website.  All of those christian conservatives family values people are going to have a rough time.
