       I'm not even going to link the moon walk videos which show obvious wires and pulleys connected to the astronauts. Or the ISS green screen videos. Or how we didn't have the technology in the 60's.

       I think there is a secret black budget space program that has technology that can easily get us to the moon and Mars and maybe even beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe we went to the moon, but I doubt we did that using rockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a great documentary about a possible secret spacecraft that has been around for a while:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in 1995, Ben Rich, CEO of Lockheed Skunkworks said “we now have the technology to take ET home”:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.mufon.com/video-testimonies-3/in-1995-ben-rich-ceo-of-lockheed-skunkworks-said-we-now-have-the-technology-to-take-et-home-as-can-be-seen-in-this-video">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's more evidence there is a secret black budget space program. Nasa is most likely a smokescreen, a PR campaign to keep us occupied and the real technology hidden.

       I'll check those docs when I get home.  But when you get into these "space" agencies you need to study how they were formed.  Starting with operation paperclip, Von Braun, Jack Parsons, JPL, crowley, hubbard. Also note that mkultra and all the intelligence and signals crap from WW2 had reached it's maturity.

       Yes I agree. That's where it all started. And there might be different factions as well. Some say the Navy has their own space program called Solar Warden and then there's other programs within the secret black budget world, most likely dominated by private industry.

       The Flat Earth theory is in my mind, probably a psy-ops campaign to steer people away from the secret black budget space program.

       Well, at the very least entertain the thought for a few days.  Just pretend that the Earth is flat and live with that mind set to test how your thoughts fit it. No need to make up your mind on it.  An advanced mind is one that can entertain thoughts like this without becoming a "believer".

       The Earth is like the UN logo and Antarctica forms an ice wall around the outside.  The Sun and the moon revolve around this plane - net.  Ask why nobody (not in the elite) is allowed to explore Antartica. Attempt to study it.  Attempt to find the edge. I dare you.

       So when I look through a telescope, and I see round planets, I am to assume that all of those planets have their flat side oriented towards my direction!?! All of them?  Why wouldn't a percentage of them look like a thin line? Or is earth the only flat planet, and all the others are round?

       Who knows what planets are.  But here are more questions for you to study:  Why is moonlight colder then in shadow?  Why does GPS not work over large areas of the Earth (oceans)? Why don't surveyors ever take curvature into their equations?  Why are there tons of videos (not shot with wide angle or fish eye lenses) that show the Earth flat at the highest altitudes?

       I have never experienced moonlight having an effect on temperature, and I live in an area that ranges from -20 to 100.  Why point a directional antenna, at the ocean? You know GPS is an array of satellites, right?  You are lacking scale, it seems you think the earth is somehow small... Surveying is done on a local scale, curvature of the earth is negligible at these distances, unless you were to build a 10 mile long warehouse and wanted a flat floor from end to end.  Provide these videos that make your point. 
Do you have any books that you can recommend on this subject?

       Back to my previous question.  Are you claiming that all other planets have their main surface, not the edge, facing directly at earth?  What force or circumstances make this so?
       <br/>
       If the earth is flat, the entire earth should experience dawn and dusk at relatively the same time, not hours apart, how do you account for this NOT being the case?
When you go outside on a clear night and you look at the sky, what do you think the little lights are?

       I don't know what planets are and cannot truthfully answer as I cannot prove anything about them other then what I can see of them through a telescope.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the sun and moon, what do you see every day? It's exactly as you observe it.  The sun comes into your perspective and then leaves it as it orbits around like a groove in phonograph plane.  Within this large orbit the shape and size of the circle provides the seasons.   Since it's not XXX millions miles away and instead only a few hundred miles (see how the rays of sun go through a cloud?) it's only illuminating a specific section of the land at any one time.  Want to really go for a trip?  Start questioning gravity as that is also just a bullshit theory to help explain BS classical physics.  Tesla was right, Einstein is a fraud along with all the other high priest scientists.

       People get VERY edgy and defensive when discussing FE.  It's the most dangerous of all topics as it's usually one of the first things we are taught about our world.  You're rocking the foundations that so many other beliefs are formed upon.  But, question everything!

       So you give up?
I am just asking questions.  I know nothing of flat earth.  Though, it seems about as easy to prove a sphere as it does flat.  We can't see shit from our tiny perspective on the surface of this massive object.
What are FE thoughts on gravity?

       I'll check those docs when I get home.  But when you get into these "space" agencies you need to study how they were formed.  Starting with operation paperclip, Von Braun, Jack Parsons, JPL, crowley, hubbard. Also note that mkultra and all the intelligence and signals crap from WW2 had reached it's maturity.
