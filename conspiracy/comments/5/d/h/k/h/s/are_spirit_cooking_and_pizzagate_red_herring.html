    <div class="md"><p>For the sake of accuracy, those aren&#39;t mugshots they are sketches done by investigators based on witness statements. Also, more importantly, they are two renderings of the same man. A couple saw a man carrying a young girl, they believe to be Madeleine and reported it. Then two different investigators made sketches based on the couples&#39; statements and that&#39;s what they each came up with. So it&#39;s inaccurate to represent them as images of two different people, or brothers -- the testimony the sketches are based on is clear that there was one man.</p>

<p>Q:  &quot;People do not realize how enormous this whole situation actually is&quot;
    Can you elaborate on that?</p>

<p>A:  The real point of interest is the Clinton Foundation, not the e-mail server. We received the server from Benghazi, then from the server we found data on the Clinton Foundation. Then we realized the situation is much worse than previously thought.
...</p>

<p>Q:  What do you think of this, &quot;Sources say that the investigation will conclude shortly&quot; meme?</p>

<p>A:  Mainstream media is shit. Who cares what they say. They are attempting to distract by putting the focus on Hillary&#39;s emails and not the Foundation.</p>

<p>Q:  How do we fix this? and be we i mean you guys lmao</p>

<p>A:  We have our hands tied. My message to you and everyone on this board is do not get distracted by Clinton&#39;s e-mails. Focus on the Foundation. All of the nightmarish truth is there. The e-mails will pale in comparison.</p>

<p>Q:  Do we have any real reason to believe this person guys? I&#39;ve been lurking and I just want to believe so bad. But it would be so easy for this to be top tier trolling...right?</p>

<p>A:  If you dig hard into the Clinton Foundation and make it the sole point of your focus, you will remember this thread when the truth is revealed.</p>

<p>Q:  How do I adequately dig in the Clinton Foundation and help prevent it from being forgotten? I&#39;m about to start googling after I post this comment but I feel like that&#39;s naive.</p>

<p>A:  Promote and discuss it everywhere. Ask questions. Read the news on it. Post articles everywhere. Pirate Jerome Corsi&#39;s book (so people can&#39;t say I am shilling) because he does have some things right.</p>

<p>Q:  Could the release of this information cause a civil war in the USA? Leak it. Do it. The day of the rope is nigh.</p>

<p>A:  Yes.</p>

<p>...etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree 100%. I hope Pizzagate is nothing more than carefully planted misinformation designed to put investigators onto a wild goose chase.  Think about it - these emails were not secure govt email.  They had to know they might be hacked with Wikileaks, Anonymous, etc in the world.  They create an elaborate side show that is infinitely more compelling than the truth.  Think about it, find clues and try to tie it all together to bring down the cabal that has secretly been running this planet for centuries, using pedo and satanic rituals?  You can join the ultimate final battle of good vs. evil!  It sounds like a video game type plot.</p>

<p>The true issue is probably the CF and HC&#39;s efforts to destabilize Syria in exchange for kickbacks from the usual Arab suspects for that gas pipeline they want to build (defeating Russia and Iran) in the process.  Includes creation of ISIL by CI a and the Saudis, possible election rigging through uses of MSM and SJW brainwashing and groupthink, etc.  very heinous crime if true, but much more mundane than the occult stuff</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I think spirit cooking is kind of over hyped and pizza gate probably is about drugs and not fucking children.</p>

<p>I think the idea that this could be a red herring is stretching things massively. If they couldn&#39;t manage hilary beating Donald trump in the presidential election, do you really think they could play the meta game of planting emails from years ago to lead an investigation in to a fake story about child sex rings to distract from an investigation in to a foundation that probably doesn&#39;t commit acts as bad as child sex ring years before there is any suspicion? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizza gate is really real, frighteningly so. </p>

<p>The reason why it&#39;s a Pizza parlor and Ping pong is specifically because it attracts young kids, and unsupervised kids. The point of playing ping pong and why they&#39;re are so many &#39;regulars&#39;, when a kid comes in, with or without their family, most would want to play ping pong. </p>

<p>If they came alone they would have to play with someone there, opening them up to interaction. While that in itself isn&#39;t saying anything, but if the person who is interacting with them is working to warp their emotions, mentality, whatever they can twist up and use against that kid, to whatever means they can, it leaves the kid quite vulnerable. </p>

<p>Ping pong and Pizza is an &#39;easy&#39; avenue into bringing children around into your life, especially if you&#39;re running a pedo ring and the whole block is seemingly in on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that cut and dry. I think that there is definitely a pedophile ring of some sorts but I do think 90% of the stuff coming out about it is garbage. I think James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong are involved with the Clinton Cartel in a child trafficking manner and it all leads back to the CF anyways. But people are being lead away from the real pizzagate clues and being fed all kinds of hidden message online scavenger hunt bullshit. There are leads to get on the ground and actually talk to people who worked there and were involved and may know things. But you don&#39;t see a rush to do that because that would actually be getting somewhere. However 4chan will spend hours going over photos of people eating pizza for hidden messages. Even if they were concealing their porn or messages digitally, you won&#39;t have the key to decipher so it&#39;s near futile. People need to start getting boots on the ground in DC. If I were states side I would but that&#39;s not the case. We have actual witnesses that need to be spoken to. That&#39;s the real leads. </p>
