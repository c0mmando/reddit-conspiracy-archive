       Today I saw this... in germany the "Time" magazine of Germany, essentially, is saying that the election of Trump is "The end of the world" (Das ende der Welt).
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://cdn3.digitalartsonline.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3642626/cw-uelfweaaoud6.jpg">
        http://cdn3.digitalartsonline.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3642626/cw-uelfweaaoud6.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We are seeing this exact messaging in the US too. Both before and after the election, the media has been almost unanimously saying  "Trump is the worst thing ever, literally Hitler. Literally the end of the world."
      </p>
      <p>
       So seeing this messaging being pushed on the public, all around the world, I have to wonder... Either the people who own the election system are fighting with the people who own the media systems and creating this conflict, or (much more likely in my opinion) they are pitting the two against each other to create cognitive dissonance in the public, by creating the appearance of a great emotional disparity between the imagined/desired reality versus what is actually occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are they doing this? It could be natural, just a natural result of the chaos of this overly-complex system we call American society. Or it could be planned, to try and create unrest. Knowing how consolidated and owned everything in America is, I would guess it's the latter. So if they're doing it on purpose, why would they do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly owning a stable country is preferred to owning an unstable one. However, if it has become apparent that due to circumstance (like an economic decline that is now baked in the cake), stability is no longer an option, then it becomes necessary in order to maintain control, to drive the unrest as to capture it. Lead false movements, publicize them using the media. Even if it's the hatred of the media rather than adoration, it is still big publicity. Which is the same as how Trump won. Because people hate the media, so if the media hates something, people decide they love it. But it's still coming from the media, and they know we hate them, and they know how to play the public to get a reaction, just like happened with Trump. Getting public reactions (positive or negative) is literally their life's work, so they're quite good at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, from where we are standing, if we see the messaging from the media is "Trump is the end of the world" the appropriate response is not "Boo, down with Trump!" because that's exactly what the media wants. Most people see past this. However, the appropriate response is also
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       "Well I love Trump because you hate him so much, screw you media!" because that is
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       what they want. This is also letting the media control you.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, if the media says "Trump is the end of the world" The appropriate response is "The media wants this election to matter as some emotional pivot point for the public, so therefore I will disregard it as important." Boom, done. They want it to be important, you don't think it's important. After all, doesn't the media ignore the seriously important stuff and hype the mediocre stuff? So if the media thinks something is super important and is harping about it 24/7, they probably want you to think that it's important for a reason, regardless of if you have a positive or negative reaction to it, as long as it's a strong one.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take this approach, then the media narrative has lost all power over you, and lost the ability to emotionally control you. This gives you freedom to develop your own narratives, and avoid poisonous top-down media-controlled groupthink.

       The refusal of acceptance is the most hilarious and depressing part. Everyone was so wound up and sure of the fact that Hillary would win and Trump would be a sore loser and raise a big stink and refuse to concede. But because it's Trump that won, I guess it's OK to be hypocritical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I overheard someone recently bragging about how they had a party last weekend and they made piñata's shaped like Trump's head. All I could think of is how unimaginably angry they would be to see young Republicans whacking a piñata of Hillary's head. That shit probably would've made headlines. The party goers would be instantly vilified. I'm sure they'd hurl all sorts of choice words, including "racist" and "misogynist". But because it's Trump, it's not only acceptable but it almost seems to be encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Double standards and hypocrisy are insanely commonplace these days.
