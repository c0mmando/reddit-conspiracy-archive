If they can get people to believe &quot;Fake News&quot;, the sky is the absolute limit. It is thought policing 100% in my mind. It is probably the most dangerous concept I&#39;ve seen pushed through the news that I can remember. The potential is very scary. </p>

<p>&lt;&lt;THIS INFORMATION REDACTED UNDER SECTION (VI.)(F)(6) FEDERAL FAKE NEWS ACT OF 2017 &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Of course &#39;Fake News&#39; has TPTB&#39;s power behind it, so it has the advantage of being able to be spread over MSM. But I just can&#39;t help but feel the &#39;energy&#39; (for lack of better description) of the two stories has been increasing at the same rate.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but think these stories will crescendo within hours of eachother. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. And for those who can&#39;t donate, the least you can do is click ads etc on the news sites you frequent. TPTB is such a huge force. They will need all the help they can get if the &quot;fake news&quot; idea really gains followers.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t want to believe it will, but I&#39;ve been surprised before. It sounds like a fucking headline out of a dystopian orwellian cartoon ffs!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;fake news&quot; is AFAIK about websites with one page only that have names that sound like traditional news companies, such as &quot;The X Herald&quot;, but in reality don&#39;t exist. The website contains only one page with the fake story they want you to push around. It serves the same purpose as an Internet chain letter, but it&#39;s supposed to look more credible by being hosted online.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not against your infowars and globalresearch. They have more than one page. Anyway, this is a short-lived post-election media craze that you&#39;re reading too much into.</p>
