       I can link some articles for anyone who doesn't see what I mean, but I think most of you guys have seen these articles firsthand in the same places I have. If they can get people to believe "Fake News", the sky is the absolute limit. It is thought policing 100% in my mind. It is probably the most dangerous concept I've seen pushed through the news that I can remember. The potential is very scary.

      <p>
       &lt;&lt;THIS INFORMATION REDACTED UNDER SECTION (VI.)(F)(6) FEDERAL FAKE NEWS ACT OF 2017 &gt;&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course 'Fake News' has TPTB's power behind it, so it has the advantage of being able to be spread over MSM. But I just can't help but feel the 'energy' (for lack of better description) of the two stories has been increasing at the same rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't help but think these stories will crescendo within hours of eachother.

       That happens constantly. Rather than look at the actual facts and put them together, they just look at the Snopes/Politifact article and don't see through the selective omission or spin that those outlets approach the story with.

       Notice that Julian Assange is conveniently missing while this is happening? Wikileaks was a truth baseline, now the only baselines we have were already bought by larger media sources (snopes, etc)

       Exactly.  If it's up to us to spread awareness, then I think we should help others who already have the set up to share truths with many people as well.  We can't do this alone, so let's do all we can.

       Agreed. And for those who can't donate, the least you can do is click ads etc on the news sites you frequent. TPTB is such a huge force. They will need all the help they can get if the "fake news" idea really gains followers.

       When the news is as bad as pizzagate, then claiming it is fake is the best defense, or maybe even the only defense they have. Besides, it is ALWAYS how pedophiles operate. ANY source that exposes them will be attacked with everything they have got. I'm speaking with the voice of experience.

       it's very possible. imo, it's more than one thing, also the fact that MSM miscalculated the (s)election. i always assumed that alternative news (&amp; the internet) was gonna be targeted, at some time; evidently that time is now. let's hope we can keep it from happening.

       There was a hit piece by Heat Street (which I see as an add from Facebook) which didn't elaborate on why it's not true other than that it is a "conspiracy theory" and that 4chan is a part of the investigators

       What frightens me is how after the election, Google and Facebook instantly jumped on the bandwagon vs 'Fake News'. It's almost like the phrase was coordinated and planned by an external authority...

       The globalists fund and encourage the protesters.. It's really not much of a stretch to say that the fake news disinformation campaign is just another arm of the globalists information efforts. It has many different uses and purposes.

       The "fake news" is AFAIK about websites with one page only that have names that sound like traditional news companies, such as "The X Herald", but in reality don't exist. The website contains only one page with the fake story they want you to push around. It serves the same purpose as an Internet chain letter, but it's supposed to look more credible by being hosted online.

       It's not against your infowars and globalresearch. They have more than one page. Anyway, this is a short-lived post-election media craze that you're reading too much into.
