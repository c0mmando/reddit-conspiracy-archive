       Hell, look at
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       . It seems like ALL of the "real" news sites are saying every single person who could possibly be associated with the Trump staff will be a complete disaster and are all monsters. It's insane that this is what virtually all of our biggest news sources are doing, and worse that so many are believing every word. It's starting to feel like we're about 5% more of the US becoming brainwashed by the mass flood of bullshit away from being a complete dictatorship with the feelings and views of the majority being told to them by the "news" at every turn.

       Have you seen the comments that infect news articles on most sites that aren't Reddit? 
3/4 of them are barely comprehensible, non-topical, spam, or just plain terrible things to say. Aint nobody in the news industry got time or money to separate the wheat from the chaff anymore.

       I think it's easier for news sites to push their agendas with comments sections. By curating people's comments, they're able to better drive their narrative and manufacture consent. Sheeple gonna sheep.

       Letters to the Editor, back then it was harder to censor because the local paper was a few blocks away (or less in Australia) and there were a variety of competing papers happy to call out a rival for a bigger audience (broader circulation leading to more ad revenue).
      </p>
      <p>
       Simplistically: City paper 1 not publishing a correction from a letter to the editor would see a full article in City paper 2.

       I guess you didn't read the rest of the thread. Considering that when you bought a newspaper, you bought it to read the news. Your comment section was whatever unfortunate soul was within earshot. Now, you're going to a website to read the news and you've got social media platforms (which the media sites use) to comment in. A news site (or paper) isn't obligated to give you a platform to voice your opinion, especially since the entirety of the internet is there to do just that.

       Yeah, they have a nice consistent presentation. The range of stories is really good too. I used to be a huge fan but they pushed their bias into propaganda territory, or maybe I just finally noticed. Still pop in once in a while but take everything with a grain of salt. I also notice a ton of stories featuring Jews or Israel.

       Yeah the Jews and Israel was first, only because nobody could face the native American tragedy.  Then it was blacks in the 60's, then they won so it was gays/Mexicans in the 90s, then they won, now it's Muslims.  If the Muslims win then they'll kill the Jews and the whole thing starts over.

      <p>
       I always wonder if it's this an intentional thing to paint Jews and Israel in a favorable light to serve some purpose, or if it's a natural side effect of having such a huge portion of their employees being Jewish. I mean if everyone who comes up with the stories are Jews then those people will know a lot of Jews and so we'll hear 30 minute segments about their friends picking wildflowers in Israel. It's probably both.

       Agreed, I think it's a little of both. Maintaining the victim narrative is a goal for some factions. It is unfortunate that discussing Israel critically is essentially taboo.

       NPR removed their comments section during the DNC when Hillary was getting a lot of bad press and the comments were overwhelmingly agianst her.  It was very obvious what they were doing.

       This is a legitimate question and hopefully will get people thinking about the morality of our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, who is MORE morally culpable if human beings are killed in an unjust war (Iraq for example)?  The order giver (Cheney/Powell/Bush lying about WMD's etc) or the order follower (military/media/intelligence services) actually inflicting death and violence upon others?
      </p>
      <p>
       There IS a right answer to this question but many people will try to rationalize away their actions.

       This really comes down to whether we can sneak an actual, critical thinking human neutral into this equation to give context. The left was first to address "fake news" with any actual intent to define it, which means that what the media is calling "fake news" right now is mostly alt-right, right, or conspiracy right news sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left is just as guilty of producing fake news, I think people often forget that even though the corporate elites rule our lives, the two parties of the government are competing for the attention of those corporations. This means that while most news is bullshit, there are two sources of the bullshit working against each other. Unless you are one of us (a person who can see the corporate machine) you are going to think that 'your' news source is correct.
We need Julian. Or at least some other base-line in truth. People need to see that both sides are competing for who gets to brainwash us.

       Yes, the MSM is essentially brainwashing that people voluntarily submit to.

       I recently had a discussion with someone I genuinely care about involving the high degree of polarization in the US populace leading up to the election and his suggestion was that "if the side that normally watches FoxNews had to watch MSNBC, and vice versa that people would relate to each other better."  LOL

       My response was that the solution to brainwashing is NOT MORE BRAINWASHING.

       Without getting into a deep philosophical discussion, the fundamental issue is whether or not objective Truth exists.    It raises issues of solipsism, moral relativism, "perception is reality", etc.  Sadly,  most people today are simply not capable of or (even if they are capable of) willing to engage in discussions of this nature.  This is partly due to the mindnumbing effect of the messages they are constantly bombarded with from "the media."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is another way to think about whether consuming MSM is in one's best interest.  If you found out your source of drinking water was thoroughly poisoned to a point that filtering was not practical or effective would it make sense to keep consuming it?  Now let's say that someone, say your neighbor who you rightfully distrust, suggested that HIS source of drinking water was free of the pollutant in your water.  Unfortunately, you happen to know for a fact that your neighbors water also is compromised by a similar unfilterable poison, that while technically distinct is also extremely harmful to your health.   Would it make sense to start consuming your neighbor's water?  Would it make even more sense to continue to consume your source of water and drink ADDITIONAL polluted water from your neighbor?

       Most "real" news sites have yet to find a reasonable way of dealing with bots and real commenters who refuse to discuss a topic without a series of insults and lewd language. This is why the more controversial pieces often have comments disabled.

       They don't want to pay moderators to sort through all the dross, that's all. "Fake" news sites don't have to be as careful about the comments they leave up because they have a smaller audience, they receive fewer comments and fewer people see the ones that are left.

       Yes, because the fake news sections are full of "concern troll" bots designed to make it look like you're onto something, whereas the real news sites tend to turn them off to prevent gullible third parties from being indoctrinated by people pretending to be [whatever] in the comment section.
      </p>
      <p>
       perfect example is the guardian, 90% of the commenters are right-wing anti-left trolls, but there's enough of them "concern trolling" (ie: pretending to be lefties to make real lefties look bad) that you can see entire, hundred comment arguments between two people who don't realise the other is reading from the exact same "how to troll in 10 easy steps!" step-by-step guidelines almost.

       You just said what I said but in more detail. I know the reason behind not allowing comments. Your reason being that the comments will influence people more than the article is awesome and I agree. When people comment about an article and provide more information than the article, well, that can be embarrassing for the company. Hence, turning off comments so you only read what the company want's you to read.

       What you and I are doing is not allowed on some news sites. News sites that provide information. Their information.

       To be fair, some MSM news sites do still have comments sections.

       But without exception, they are all heavily moderated. Say the wrong thing and your comment quickly gets deleted (censorship).

       Absolutely!  As one small example, whether you love or hate breitbart, they not only allow comments but also allow links out to external sources of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is important since it enables others with competing or adverse viewpoints to present evidence to the contrary in the comments.  Meanwhile, the "real" sites more often than not don't allow comments at all or certainly don't allow external links in comments to refute the content/opinion of the "news" article.

       You can always leave comment somewhere on the internet. That reminds me, I have a comment i was going to post on r/mensrights but i'm banned for dissing anime so here is probably good enough.

       Yo fuckbrains bernard matthews wanted to spread bird flu on purpose, it was only when it started interfering with chemtrails that they started dealing with it so they could garner goodwill when they revised the recipe for their supervirus (also known as hep C, spread in 2008 so don't trust the media if they say it was around earlier). I don't know where you get off trying to lecture everyone about medicine and how to seduce chicks, but "firmly approaching her and letting her know sex is on the cards early on" doesnt work and I should know because I eat pussy like a Texan at a Chinese buffet. The first step is not looking like the meth-addled accountant that your r/amiugly post outs you as.

       It's an interesting observation, but it appears to be a symptom of prescriptive morality journalism rather than a real vs fake news difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       A comment section can draw an audience on it's own, we know from stats that this audience is slightly more male and slightly more hispanic than the general population.  Turning off the comments is likely to have moved that group away from many of these news sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seem plausible that a group could have made an effort to make curating those comment sections too much work aiding in the disenfranchisement of comment section users.  Since reddit is sort of a universal comment section, you can bet that many went here.

       I guess you didn't read the rest of the thread. Considering that when you bought a newspaper, you bought it to read the news. Your comment section was whatever unfortunate soul was within earshot. Now, you're going to a website to read the news and you've got social media platforms (which the media sites use) to comment in. A news site (or paper) isn't obligated to give you a platform to voice your opinion, especially since the entirety of the internet is there to do just that.
