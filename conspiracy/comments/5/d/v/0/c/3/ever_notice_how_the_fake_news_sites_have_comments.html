<p>Letters to the Editor, back then it was harder to censor because the local paper was a few blocks away (or less in Australia) and there were a variety of competing papers happy to call out a rival for a bigger audience (broader circulation leading to more ad revenue).</p>

<p>Simplistically: City paper 1 not publishing a correction from a letter to the editor would see a full article in City paper 2.</p>

<p>Discourse and fact checking, as well as asking questions to understand any poorly explained material in a published article.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not everyone reading articles uses them or will congregate on the same site, aside from arguments of censorship on sites that allow comments or places people go to for discussion of the story.</p>

<p>I remember checking it out. There were some nice last hurrah type comments and lamenting.</p>

<p>Yeah, they have a nice consistent presentation. The range of stories is really good too. I used to be a huge fan but they pushed their bias into propaganda territory, or maybe I just finally noticed. Still pop in once in a while but take everything with a grain of salt. I also notice a ton of stories featuring Jews or Israel.</p>

<p>Edit: NPR is npr.org in this context. There are affiliate station sites that do their own thing.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I always wonder if it&#39;s this an intentional thing to paint Jews and Israel in a favorable light to serve some purpose, or if it&#39;s a natural side effect of having such a huge portion of their employees being Jewish. I mean if everyone who comes up with the stories are Jews then those people will know a lot of Jews and so we&#39;ll hear 30 minute segments about their friends picking wildflowers in Israel. It&#39;s probably both.</p>

<p>For example, who is MORE morally culpable if human beings are killed in an unjust war (Iraq for example)?  The order giver (Cheney/Powell/Bush lying about WMD&#39;s etc) or the order follower (military/media/intelligence services) actually inflicting death and violence upon others?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This really comes down to whether we can sneak an actual, critical thinking human neutral into this equation to give context. The left was first to address &quot;fake news&quot; with any actual intent to define it, which means that what the media is calling &quot;fake news&quot; right now is mostly alt-right, right, or conspiracy right news sources. </p>

<p>The left is just as guilty of producing fake news, I think people often forget that even though the corporate elites rule our lives, the two parties of the government are competing for the attention of those corporations. This means that while most news is bullshit, there are two sources of the bullshit working against each other. Unless you are one of us (a person who can see the corporate machine) you are going to think that &#39;your&#39; news source is correct.
We need Julian. Or at least some other base-line in truth. People need to see that both sides are competing for who gets to brainwash us.</p>

<p>I recently had a discussion with someone I genuinely care about involving the high degree of polarization in the US populace leading up to the election and his suggestion was that &quot;if the side that normally watches FoxNews had to watch MSNBC, and vice versa that people would relate to each other better.&quot;  LOL  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without getting into a deep philosophical discussion, the fundamental issue is whether or not objective Truth exists.    It raises issues of solipsism, moral relativism, &quot;perception is reality&quot;, etc.  Sadly,  most people today are simply not capable of or (even if they are capable of) willing to engage in discussions of this nature.  This is partly due to the mindnumbing effect of the messages they are constantly bombarded with from &quot;the media.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is another way to think about whether consuming MSM is in one&#39;s best interest.  If you found out your source of drinking water was thoroughly poisoned to a point that filtering was not practical or effective would it make sense to keep consuming it?  Now let&#39;s say that someone, say your neighbor who you rightfully distrust, suggested that HIS source of drinking water was free of the pollutant in your water.  Unfortunately, you happen to know for a fact that your neighbors water also is compromised by a similar unfilterable poison, that while technically distinct is also extremely harmful to your health.   Would it make sense to start consuming your neighbor&#39;s water?  Would it make even more sense to continue to consume your source of water and drink ADDITIONAL polluted water from your neighbor?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nah, that&#39;s a blatant misrepresentation of it, it&#39;s this:</p>

<p>Bob says: &quot;there are a bunch of obvious trolls, concern trolls and shills in our comments. Maybe we should turn them off to stop the more impressionable readers being indoctrinated by people who explicitly state they&#39;d prefer we didn&#39;t exist&quot; billy says: &quot;good idea bob&quot; </p>

<p>And if you think it&#39;s anything other than that, you&#39;re obviously a fucking retarded autistic cancerfaggot or some kind of paid disinformation agent from trump or some shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just said what I said but in more detail. I know the reason behind not allowing comments. Your reason being that the comments will influence people more than the article is awesome and I agree. When people comment about an article and provide more information than the article, well, that can be embarrassing for the company. Hence, turning off comments so you only read what the company want&#39;s you to read.</p>

<p>What you and I are doing is not allowed on some news sites. News sites that provide information. Their information.</p>

<p>I think your swearing needs work.</p>

<p>Obviously not, since what you said is wrong, and what I said is different to what you said. </p>

<p>And I think people who judge based on swearwords (which they are perfectly entitled to use too) are cunts who don&#39;t deserve to be listened to</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely!  As one small example, whether you love or hate breitbart, they not only allow comments but also allow links out to external sources of information.  </p>

<p>This is important since it enables others with competing or adverse viewpoints to present evidence to the contrary in the comments.  Meanwhile, the &quot;real&quot; sites more often than not don&#39;t allow comments at all or certainly don&#39;t allow external links in comments to refute the content/opinion of the &quot;news&quot; article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can always leave comment somewhere on the internet. That reminds me, I have a comment i was going to post on r/mensrights but i&#39;m banned for dissing anime so here is probably good enough.</p>

<p>Yo fuckbrains bernard matthews wanted to spread bird flu on purpose, it was only when it started interfering with chemtrails that they started dealing with it so they could garner goodwill when they revised the recipe for their supervirus (also known as hep C, spread in 2008 so don&#39;t trust the media if they say it was around earlier). I don&#39;t know where you get off trying to lecture everyone about medicine and how to seduce chicks, but &quot;firmly approaching her and letting her know sex is on the cards early on&quot; doesnt work and I should know because I eat pussy like a Texan at a Chinese buffet. The first step is not looking like the meth-addled accountant that your r/amiugly post outs you as.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an interesting observation, but it appears to be a symptom of prescriptive morality journalism rather than a real vs fake news difference.</p>

<p>A comment section can draw an audience on it&#39;s own, we know from stats that this audience is slightly more male and slightly more hispanic than the general population.  Turning off the comments is likely to have moved that group away from many of these news sites.</p>

<p>It seem plausible that a group could have made an effort to make curating those comment sections too much work aiding in the disenfranchisement of comment section users.  Since reddit is sort of a universal comment section, you can bet that many went here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you didn&#39;t read the rest of the thread. Considering that when you bought a newspaper, you bought it to read the news. Your comment section was whatever unfortunate soul was within earshot. Now, you&#39;re going to a website to read the news and you&#39;ve got social media platforms (which the media sites use) to comment in. A news site (or paper) isn&#39;t obligated to give you a platform to voice your opinion, especially since the entirety of the internet is there to do just that. </p>
