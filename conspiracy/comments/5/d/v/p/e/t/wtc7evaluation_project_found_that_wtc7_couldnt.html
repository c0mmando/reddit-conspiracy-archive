       More to the point, if it turns out we have to take this all the way to the world court and hold the US government accountable for the cover up, it will look bad for Trump.  He has a real opportunity to open a dialogue with the public and tell us the truth.  He doesn't want to do the other thing. Because too many people know now about the continuity of government, about wtc7 being demolished, about Giuliani taking away the steel and being part of the cover up; etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't hide.  We may take much longer but we'll get the truth and make damn sure the public knows who helped us and who didn't.

       Yeah.. the problem is he won't do the right thing if he is indeed a puppet to the jesuit overlords / elite banking cabal, regardless of how hard you try

       His choices for important positions is more proof he is probably a puppet IMO

       Accomplice might have been a better word than co-conspirator, but it stands to reason that to pull off something of that magnitude would require the complicity of the NYC mayor.

      <p>
       Specifically, he mobilized a group of 120 dump trucks almost immediately to haul away all the dust and steel, which would have been impossible in Manhattan unless they were already standing by ready to clean up the evidence.  You're likely aware that the US Geological Survey dust samples showed extraordinarily high levels of radionuclides like barium, strontium, lithium, lanthanum, and more which indicate 9/11 was a nuclear event, and this would explain the need to attempt to rapidly remove all that rubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah and the steel was expeditiously sold to China and India.

       What scares me is that to cover all his lies, Trump will need a major event like 9/11 attacks. This time it's Iran that is the target. His CIA boss has been criticizing the Iran deal from day one, and Netanyahu was jubiltaing when Trump won the election. No good days in perspective.

       I'm not sure I want another government investigation of 9/11.  At this point I'd be happy to let the law suits against the Saudi's proceed with government support. That could be Billions for the victims and a few months wages for the Saudi's. Not going to get more justice than that from where I sit.

       You imply that everyone saw it but this is wtc7, not 1 and 2... and no, you did NOT see it because there was a media blackout about 7 that lasted for several years.  It wasn't until 2004 or so that people even heard about building 7 beyond people who were there.  EDIT or people in the UK watching it on BBC (jane standley's fuckup--she reported solomon building fell to dust...but while it was still standing, lol)
      </p>
      <p>
       In october of this year WTC7 evaluation finished it's main tests and their conclusions are that it was impossible for wtc7 to fall due to fire.  It used advanced, but specifically realistic physics, and highly accurate modelling of the building to prove this.  They showed this by making an accurate physical model and demonstrated that NIST's model was amateurish and incorrect, the connections were all wrong and their assessment deeply flawed.  The ppl running wtc7evaluation are structural engineers who apparently are far more skillful than NIST; they've presented to other engineers and are moving forward into lawsuits in the world court to compel the us government to either reinvestigate or be held accountable for lying to the public and covering it up
