       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out the article above first.  TL;DR - Soros is buying a large stockpile of gold and gold mines while selling all his stock holdings.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has bothered me for a while now why a sociopath like George Soros, who cares about nothing except money and power, was funding far-left groups like BLM and funding the current Trump riots.  It never seemed right that he invested so much in to Hillary Clinton.  Until I read the article above.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is gonna sound far-fetched, but he's literally playing out a version of the plot of "Goldfinger", the James Bond movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start at the beginning.  Soros has been funding the DNC and Clintons for a long time now.  He has Hillary under his control as the e-mail leaks have revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       His original plan entails the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Buy a large (and by large I mean hundreds of billions) stockpile of gold and gold mines, as stated in the article above.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Have Hillary be elected by fueling racial tensions thru activities like BLM.  Try to sway public opinion that racism is a real problem and thus artificially generate empathy for the Democratic party, which supposedly is the party against racism.  Meanwhile, he uses the power of Media Matters (which we all know he owns) to make the protesters look like the good guys.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         But realizing that Hillary is the weakest candidate in history, he uses the media to make sure the RNC nominates Trump by giving him 24/7 coverage during the primaries.  Soros thinks Trump is the only candidate that will lose big to Hillary.  Did you notice how the media COMPLETELY turned against him once he was nominated?  Media Matters was once again deployed to completely tilt public opinion for Hillary.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Once Hillary is in office, have the government run up national debt to unprecedented levels through uncontrolled spending and horrible fiscal management.  Continue civil unrest and make the CREDIT RATING of U.S. Treasuries fall.  Even worse, make the debt so large that the US is in danger of defaulting on a payment.  Worse case, have the country fall in to a partial civil war.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Economics 101.  In times of uncertainty, there's always a flight to quality with gold being the ultimate safe haven from economic turmoil.  Soros will no doubt short U.S. Treasuries and as the market tanks, the value of his gold holdings goes up 10x~50x, while at the same time, his short positions on T-bonds will net him billions upon billions.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Soros becomes the richest man in the entire history of human kind.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This was his plan from the beginning.  Unfortunately (or rather fortunately) his plan has backfired because TRUMP WON!  He had underestimated the power of social media, 4chan, and The_Donald.  He is now trying to figure out a way to still make his plan work.  He is using hive-mind drones to riot and trying to influence the electorate to vote against Trump.  He is using every dirty trick he can think of to get Hillary in to office.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is straight out of the plot of "Goldfinger" except instead of contaminating the gold supply at Fort Knox, he's polluting the politics of the US to achieve the same result:  To make his gold stockpile skyrocket in value.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to stop this.  This man, George Soros, is literally the mad genius villain in Bond movies.  He is Blofeld/Specter.   Wow, my head is spinning.  I hope no one suicides me.  If I'm found dead, you know I will have hit a chord of truth with this theory.  May God be with us.

       Soros has grander plans than that. You can read lots of academic, peer-reviewed articles about the man, and you'll see his end game is a one-world government. His argument essentially is that a complex global economy requires a global government to manage it. This is why he's trying to foment unrest while also attacking the sovereignty of individual nations. And he's going to do all of this without telling the public about it because he thinks he's a god and knows what best.

       That is true.  And to achieve his plan, he will need a godly sum of money, which I believe he's in the process of making right now, through this election.  He literally has God complex.  He's 86 years old now but thinks he will live forever.  Who knows, with enough money, maybe he can even cheat death.

       No one cheats death. Soros is already a has been. His power has always been his secrecy. Now that he is exposed, I expect his relevance to disappear fairly soon. He'll probably die from a kidney infection within a couple of years and everyone will forget all about him. His legacy and influence will fade into the abyss of the information age within a decade.

       If enough governments decide they've had it up to here with Soros, they could just say his money's no good.  If he goes guerrilla to counter it, then we'll have a short and messy war and it'll be all over for him, and the Rothchilds will clean up the mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't fool all the people all the time, and all the people other than Soros and his consiglieres would rather not have a Soros-led government.  He would just about have to make the world literally blind to get far enough to have nations fighting on his behalf.

       I would open to hearing ideologies and reasons why a 1 world government would be a good thing. The problem I have is that all the people pushing for it are parts of a secret society that kill/rape children and pray to Satan or satan-like gods. Hurts their cause IMO.

       Exactly. A one world government
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be a great thing, or it could be an absolute disaster. It all depends on who is leading it and what safeguards there are in place to limit abuses of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I don't support the people that are currently pushing for a global government. They are doing it covertly without public discussion and debate, which is a huge red flag. They also favor chaos, and the death and destruction that it entails, to further their agenda. They also seem to place wealth and power above the common good. All of these facts lead me to believe that a one world government under their control would be very dangerous.

       Yea I have to agree. I've often contemplated whether or not a 1 world government would be such a bad thing and that maybe (since "they" are soooooooo enlightened) "they" feel all the subversion is necessary to drag humanity kicking and screaming with them into this new world order. I liken it to a parent having to drag their kid kicking and screaming to the doctors because it is truly best for them despite it not seeming that way to the child.
       <strong>
        pertinent question
       </strong>
       What nations, groups, ideologies, etc... generally and openly exhibit behavior in line with that concept? There are at least a few obvious choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that throws up red a flag for me is that if they are willing to commit such horrible atrocities in the name of "the ends justifying the means" then it makes it really hard to believe that humanity's best interest is truly what they have at heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Libya for example.
       <strong>
        If
       </strong>
       what I've learned is true, most Libyans absolutely loved Gaddafi because he truly did provide for them. They had access to free college (until graduate school), some free housing initiatives, they had relative freedom to live how they wanted, and they were generally afforded a lifestyle that the people of many countries (especially in the area) strive to obtain. I have no really good reason to believe that what I've learned isn't true since much of it was told to me by a relative who lived in Libya for a decade until shit hit the fan there. I think most of us by now have at least narrowed it down to a reasonable conclusion of why we decided Gaddafi had to go. "We" guess that it was generally done to maintain U.S. hegemony and the dollar as the global reserve currency (gold Dinar, African Central banks, etc...) because that fits an observable pattern that has developed for a while now (people who want to make currencies that subvert the FED system tend to end up dead...we know this).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question I still mull over is, why is THAT concept (U.S. hegemony and the dollar as the GRC) so integral to building the NWO? Is it likely to be happenstance because the dollar is already the most penetrating currency on Earth (possibly capable of crashing the world economy if it fell) and is being used to establish the framework needed to force us into a position where we gladly accept this NWO after a global financial fallout? Am I on the track leading to even a partial answer or the one laid out for me to follow off of a cliff?

       Edit: Just want to clarify and for emphasis, my relative who moved there was natural born American citizen who went to Libya with a group of people helping with a clean water problem and ended up staying and relocating her family there because she (and subsequently her family) loved it so much...doesn't sound like it was such a terrible place to live under Gaddafi as we were repeatedly told.

       You know what - her doing an AMA could be pretty cool. I bet people ( including myself) would be really interested to know more about Libya! I mean the media narrative against it makes it seem like a horrendous third world dictatorship..

       It looks like there have been a few similar to that already which you might like to browse through (tried "Libya AMA" in search bar). Her point of view though would be unique from anything I saw with a quick look. It sure can't hurt to ask.

       Satan, prophecies about the end times, and the one world order all align with biblical prophecies occurring before Jesus returns to save the world from totally self destructing. It will be Satan, ultimately behind the one world order. So, these people being Satanists is really shocking and vindicating. Many fantastical scenes from Daniel and Isaiah &amp; New Testament gospels and Book of Revelation are more understandable being familiar with modern technology. Natural disasters may be consistent with climate change. These were written to show God's case for Himself. Should consider.

       I personally think it would be an absolute disaster.  If we think there's wealth inequalities now, it will be nothing if/when this happens.  I think it's an idea that sounds good in theory (maybe to some?), but with how corrupt people in power get, why would you want to give them even more?  That's any person.  Anyone can be corrupted in the right circumstance.

       In theory, a one world government kindof makes sense. Take the worlds riches and distribute it across across everyone to destroy poverty and starvation, install civil rights to end the abuses against minority groups, allow free travel and trade to anyone and everyone across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that, in reality, a single worldwide government would need
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       to run it, and that amount of power sequestered into the hands of one or several people will undoubtedly be abused.  A distribution of power across many competitive world leaders at least helps keep them all in check, albeit the competition sometimes turns ugly.

       I'm fine with a one world government. Just not how these assholes are trying to do so. The first steps should be to go about automating economies and introducing national basic incomes along with other services like healthcare. Unless you set those systems up first, it will only bring about further inequality and a global civil war as many get left to die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only problem with a socialized one world government being the permanent under class it would create until the idea of money itself is eliminated. I'm not sure we can ever cooperate for long enough to accomplish this due to all the propaganda against the idea.

       I don't see basic income working. Scarcity/Difficulty obtaining something equals value. Give everyone a free 100 dollars a week, and all you have accomplished is lowering the value of the dollar. So then you say well then we eliminate money. Ok now your in a barter economy where people have to sell toilet paper or lighter fluid to each other. Or will we all just become pets to the state with all basic commodities provided for? Fed well, taken on walks, and maybe a pat on the head if were good? Ok guess it works, and most everything is automated but who draws the short straw for robot repair duty instead of art school utopia life? Also good luck finding a government honest enough to manage that well, and not cause mass starvation like Soviet Union, and Communist China did.

       The Chinese (propaganda) film Hero centres around the idea of "One Sword". The protagonist (Jet Lee) early in the film has his tribe wiped out by the emperor. He sets out on a quest for revenge. He is warned by those that traveled the same path that he would not go through with it. In the end he becomes very powerful and gets the opportunity to assassinate the emperor but decides against it and sacrifices himself. The reason? If there is two swords, or two great powers there will inevitably be conflict and death. The only way for peace is if there is one sword, one great power. Kind of like "one ring to rule them all". Or the neocons "full spectrum dominance". Also the CFR has spelled it out for you if you're interested.

       Find out who dumped $10 billion in bonds last weekend (bond market holiday). That crashed the price of gold and pretty much all precious metals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not many people have that kind of pocket money laying around and no one has ever said who did the dump. It could be a single person or more likely a market house representing the big boys.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes perfect sense. Everyone knows the market is fictional money. Those at the top can manipulate the market up. Convert your fictional wealth into real assets and leave all the little people cover the losses. It's not just Soros. All the big players including Central Banks and countries are maneuvering to screw the people over.

       You are right in the sense that hedge funds, mutual funds and pensions funds do move the markets due to their incredible sizes, and that they want huge movements to benefit, but it wasn't due to their play, but attractive returns somewhere else than gold. When gold falls, it means that the market is getting safer.

       Thanks. I missed the follow up on ZH. So it's getting pretty obvious there's quite a few countries taking preemptive currency devaluation ahead of having to renegotiate trade deals.

       Actually, the bond market fell last week, and so did gold as well, because there is no longer a need for flight to quality, and the big movements were due to sector allocation. From previous profitable sectors such as technology to healthcare and biotech due to Trump winning the presidency.

       Excellent breakdown. I'm still not 100% sure Trump isn't a prop, but I'm leaning to the "Trump is genuine" side, for all his faults. If he's real, you're right; Soros's immediate ambitions have been frustrated. (The thought of his reaction to Trump winning in this scenario makes me smile.) I wonder how this will affect his endgame in Europe.

       Trump can't be a prop.  If he was, he would have purposefully lost.  Watching him for the past 3 months, I've never seen anyone so driven to win.  Giving 5 rallies a day.  Non-stop.  No days off.  He really is a mad man.  I have huge respect for him.

       Soros is literally meeting with top DNC heads this Sunday in Washington in secret 3 day closed door meeting. He's going to indoctrinate them with promi$es and continue with his bullshit.

       This is really alarming. I believe Clinton was forced to step down due to Weiner's laptop evidence, she was threatened to be exposed of her depravity and crimes. Now Obama saying he will stick around to help transition. He had already planned to remain in city supposedly for daughter to finish HS.  Seems like they want to continue their agenda to consolidate power in the Oligarchy. Both parties bought and paid for. Trump is wildcard but will be reigned in by both parties.  Rigged election now showing popular vote is increasing for Clinton. Why?  Seems precarious victory to have *neverhilkary, bec they are not done.

       Its quite simple: Did Soros meet with DNC heads in Washington for 3 days in closed door meeting, Yes or No?

       Nothing really about having any of this backwards. Its a simple, yes or no. You can research what Soros is up to and get all the facts and see he donated to Hillary.

       I don't know if this is news to you or not, but r/conspiracy is not exactly trusting of the msm or snopes. And we have good reason not to be. In fact, I bet more people here are suspicious that you work for CTR or some other shill network to downplay this topic than think you're just locked in the msm brainwashing. Either is possible, but it's proven that whether you like it or are a part of it out not, there is indeed a conspiracy between the members of the DNC, the media, and high ranking officials to rig this election. They pay people to shill, they prep chosen candidates, they control there narrative, they have been proven to work with groups that openly advocate and plan voter fraud. So how do you prove a lie? Well if it comes from this group of people, who are proven liars, then you should start with the idea the there is reason to be skeptical.  These types of meetings happen all the time. I'm sure you think politics is overrun with corporate power and money.. what, Democrat money can't buy a secret meeting or two? Prove it wrong or you're shilling, plain and simple

       Honestly we don't know how deep any of this goes, more things may be connected at the top than we thought possible. So Trump may very well be connected. What would he have to gain out of it I don't know.

       I'm not sure he really cared about Trump or Hillary winning. These types of puppet masters always play both sides of the field. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if Soros purposely sabotaged Hillary's campaign from the inside - maybe he was the one who came up with the DNC rigging scheme in the first place, and maybe he was the one that leaked it just days before Hillary's confirmation.  All the Hillary leaks suspiciously had very little implication of Soros despite how powerful we all know he is within the DNC. Soros will split a country's population in two and letting them fight; in Ukraine it was/is pro-Russia and pro-EU, a conflict Soros added some fuel  pushed into a pro-Soros Revolution. I think Soros saw an easy opportunity to split our country into Red and Blue, and I think a Trump win furthers that split. I bet he see the left, liberal, progressive side of America as more likely to protest and riot, and right on queue after the Trump election he flares up protests all over the country, trying to appeal to liberals who feel disenfranchised with our system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he's hoping the protests escalate and turn the country's politics into a quagmire, tanking markets and US dollar and making him a quick buck. He doesn't need a specific winner, he just needs conflict, and he got that with this election.

       It's an old transparent tactic.  He bet against the pound in the eighties doing the same thing and made his money.  He's a shorter.  He dgaf about ideologies, he just want s to make cashola because he's obsessed.  It's just about ego.  It's nothing more.  He wants automatic fawning and knee bending wherever he goes, that's all there is to it.

       I disagree. Soros made all the money he needs when he crashed the Bank of England. It's been known for awhile that Soros is an ideologue. He seeks to create a more consolidated global government, but this requires a chaotic catalyst first.

       I get where you're coming from, but he's also an old man thinking about his own thrills.  Well, it just looks like he overplayed his hand in the US.  Or maybe not.  Giuliani and Bolton in the cabinet could be a repeat of the Dubya years.

       But his funding of leftwing agitators is pretty transparent now.

       Why throw all that money at Hillary if Trump got in office with a paired back campaign?  Why rig the voting machines if he came out on top?

       If we assume for a second that Soros' goal is consolidating governments through chaos, then the best argument I can make is that he rigged the machines in order to give HRC the popular vote, but give Trump the win. HRC winning the popular vote basically acts as a dogwhistle for his protesters to start stirring up trouble. At the same time, these protesters need to be passionate about the cause if the hope is for the protests to deteriorate into violent riots. This passion wouldn't have been created without Soros heavily funding his various superPACS that have influenced public perception.

       The longer of tooth I get, the more I realise most people are making it up as they go along.  Business owners are no different.  My last boss, the business owner just wrecked the morale of the place because he obsessively cut costs and badgered the staff, just so he could have a few extra grand at the weekend to spunk away at the casino to impress his mates.  With ideological rich types, the ego game is virtue signalling.  Maybe being known for large contributions to the church, whatever.  Or being good with betting against nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I do NOT for a moment think he shouldn't be utterly held to account for his nation wrecking attempts.

       I think you got the idea of Trump wrong. Trump has promised a combination of spendings (trillion dollars in infrastructure spending, increased military spendings etc) and reduce the federal income by unprecedented tax cuts. This can only happen if he borrows more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more likely that Soros is speculating on gold and at the same time is betting on turbulence in the currency market. Perhaps that China will offset its trade surplus in gold instead of US bonds or that the Euro will buy gold as an attempt to restore confidence in EU's faltering currency project.

       If Trump was a conventional politician, I would agree with you 100%.  However, Trump isn't.  One of his priority is reducing national debt without raising taxes.  You may say that's impossible, but here's his proposal.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Repatriate trillions of dollars in profits that corporations are holding outside of our country because of high corporate tax rate, by giving a one time 10% repatriation exemption, which is a bargain.  Expect at least a trillion in tax revenue from this move.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Levy a 30% tariff on U.S. products made in foreign factories which are then exported to the U.S.  In other words, if you are a U.S. company and you make your products in foreign factories, you will be taxed unless you bring the factories back in to the U.S.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Renegotiate NAFTA.  Scrub TPP.  Impose a fair tariff on imports as opposed to the one way freeway that exists in trade today.  This will reduce the trade deficit as well as generate tariff revenues.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lower corporate tax rate to stop "inversion", the practice of U.S. corporations moving HQ to other nations with a lower corporate tax rates.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Reduce government inefficiency by eliminating 50% of needless regulations and oversight laws concerning business (especially small and medium).  This not only encourages growth, but eliminates the billions upon billions the government spends just to enforce these statutes.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       All this is pretty hardline stance on trade, but that's precisely why I voted for him.  America has been too lenient on protecting it's borders not only from illegal aliens but from foreign goods.  Will I pay more for my iPhone?  Sure.  But I'll gladly accept the rate hike if it means more factory workers in the U.S.

       Trump is in because the powers that be want him in. The Trump victory is the one that's going to generate the most civil unrest. They have been planning for race wars since Freemasons started buying up slaves in the south. Order out of chaos, New World Order to be precise. Martial law coming soon. Manson was tied into these people. Helter Skelter is coming down fast. Google Zebra killings. I had this information confirmed to me by a former participant.

       He's in because there are tens of millions of middle class families fed up with our current government. Hillary would've been more of the same. At least with Trump there's a chance he might do good. He isn't the ideal option, but he has continuously said he wants to rebuild our middle class. And do some critical thinking, he isn't causing civil unrest, it's the citizens freaking out before he's even in office. He even told the very small portion of his supporters that are racist to stop. I don't have the exact quote but he essentially said he wants to bring us together. not divide us further.

       Your thinking is what the NWO (Rothschilds, Soros, et al) is banking on. Trump did not win the popular vote, he won the vote of those "500 unnamed people in a back room." How easy would that be to influence/manipulate? I don't understand how anyone can believe the most powerful people in the world would leave this election up to the "unwashed masses."

       True.   But here's the thing.  Shorting the dollar requires going long on another currency.   Problem is, the dollar is the usual safe haven so there's no way to predict what would happen to the counter currency when the dollar devalues.   But more importantly, a straight short bet on the dollar would give away his intentions and his manipulation.   It would look bad from a pr perspective and come back to haunt him.   Buying gold is the right move.

       Mmm I didn't know that, but I was thinking more along the lines of a collapse of the US economy rendering all shares and bonds worthless and the dollar would follow as it is based on debt that would then be unrecoverable.

       Hey there. You're right to believe that a movie script like 007 can be put into the real-life theatre. This has been done in the past with movies by Stanley Kubrick. Looks at the list of movies in the pic I've shared. They are all about the relationships between the so called illuminati and the rest of the world. Listen, I just joined this sub and I've never been one for conspiracy theories, however- I myself have become illuminated much like our friends in this sub. 
Now this is important: I walked through the new WTC and noticed some things about it. 1) it's called the oculus. Translation=eye, we've all seen the American currency and the symbols there so no need for me to go into detail concerning that. But the "shining" oculus on our bill is also represented in the new WTC. Go ahead and google aerial view and you won't find a result. But if you were to find one elsewhere you'd see it is clearly an eye with eyelashes and was supposed to be able to open. Inside oculus you will see how illuminated it is- much like in space odyssey 2001(interesting year title) where on one side of the obelisk it's black- but once you enter to the other side it's illuminated. "Full of stars". What was once the twin towers is now a building designed like a pyramid. My point is that these people get off on doing this all right in front of us. Anyone have trouble googling certain things over the past 2weeks concerning the election? Not with bing though. Let's look at the symbol for free-masons and compare it to googles symbol. A huge relationship between Hollywood/celebrities/ and the rulers of the world. So what's NATO have in store for us. 
P.S. Anyone want to pm me to discuss this topic and share each others insight is seriously welcomed.

       Soros's investment planning is simpler than that, and saner.  China is in a bubble and that bubble is about to collapse, as
       <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-20/soros-says-china-s-debt-fueled-economy-resembles-u-s-in-2007-08">
        Soros himself predicted
       </a>
       .  He has been leveraging financially to profit off of the massive collapse of the yuan.  Democrats in power would mean the passage of the TPP which would severely hurt both China's stake in trade with its Asian partners and it's stake in trade with America. Trump's election and backing out of the TPP amounts to a windfall profit for China: the nations that would have been in the TPP are now going to be in China's trade agreement, which will heavily strengthen the yuan, preventing the very Chinese marketplace collapse he was waiting for.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words he was counting on the US to out-leverage China. The American public decided to allow China to out-leverage us by electing Trump, and now it will probably be the dollar and the US economy that tanks again, not China's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why Soros dropped his investment in gold and then instead
       <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/markets/soros-fund-swaps-gold-for-china/news-story/705eff0057fd09476226e426753916fc">

       All your conjectures are sound and logical.   But there's no denying that Soros funded BLM and is funding the current protests.   If he was only strategizing instead of directly manipulating, I doubt he would be doing all that.

       Consider that George Soros has funded Democrat causes in the US since 1979.  That's a really long time to be playing one particular market game. As someone whose financial success is dependent on international currency and market events, it seems reasonable that he would want to have a say in influencing how those go.  The American political system is set up in a way that's  insanely easy to influence with money.  So he chose a political party and he invests money to see towards it's success.  Does an 86 year old billionaire know anything or care anything about the black community? No, but black people vote Democrat and BlackLivesMatter excites that community out to vote. Same thing for any other liberal cause, like the current protests.  It excites their base, increases the influence of the party his money is with, and thereby increases how much of a say he has in the issues that actually matter to his investments

It took the gold price to increase 10x from 1970 to 1979, and it took almost 200 years for it to go up by 50x. Gold prices don't increase that much in a short amount of time, and especially not that that gold prices are its highest. Even during the financial crisis 07-08, it increased by 160%.

       That benefit of the doubt giving logic actually doesn't work in this case, however.  If you had, say, $100 million and a viable company, that right there would be enough (more than enough) to pass on to your family.

       Na, man.  That doesn't pass as "just passing it on to my family" justification.  At all.

       Speculating can be good in that it helps one sometimes come across what does and doesn't seem good, plausible, etc.

       It would seem that one can regularly enough make a decent assessment of a person's character by taking stock of their actions and what they do though.  As such, even though I think what you say is valid in that it doesn't seem we can really know
       <em>
        for sure
       </em>
       what one's true motivations are, I would say that we can get a pretty decent indication of them by simply looking at how one acts and what one does.

      <p>
       Greed does seem to be a mental problem/imbalance - especially the type of greed Soros seems to be afflicted/infected with.

       He bet on gold earlier this year:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But he then sold the gold late june, and since then bought into a pipeline company:

       Would be curious if that pipeline company is related to NoDAPL at all.

      <p>
       Also, what are his "tells" for how he sets up dominos in order to wipe out the currency of any specific nation? And of the top billionaires on the planet, which ones have cooperated with him on anything spendy in the past 5-10 years?

       There's a fundamental difference between Rothschilds and Soros.  Rothschilds influence policy and politics to make their businesses generate more revenues.  So banking, energy, pharma, etc, they want policies that are favorable to their plethora of companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, Soros is a destroyer.  He thrives by shorting securities/currencies and creating havoc on the economy.  For him, politics is just a method of making the markets move in his favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see the Rothschilds and Soros being not very friendly to each other as they have different methods to achieve their goals.

       As for Israel, I have no idea.

       that george soros, 1 man from hungary worth only US$24.9 billion, is single handedly influencing the DNC OR Republicans, who both get corporate money from big oil &amp; big pharma &amp; gun manufacturers and warmongers, vastly, VASTLY outweighing any amount of the 24.9b soros may actually be spending (even if that's the full 100%). You think in a country worth like 2 trillion a guy with that little money compared to any big group (such as oil, pharma, arms dealers etc) gets to control the entire country?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you fucking mad?
      </p>
      <p>
       the rockefellers for example are worth $340b and have a much, much more obvious say in american politics - everyone knows they pay for shit to get it done, you're telling me a man worth less than 1/10th of that overrides them?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the rothschilds? and the hiltons and co? All these other big american political banker "global elite" families with much, much more than a $24b worth, you think they just decided to stop and that it's this soros guy's turn to run the game?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I just looked it up, the rothschilds (famous right-wing donators) are worth 3-5 TRILLION dollars, which is more than the actual united states itself is worth. Tell me again how they're gonna let a random hungarian worth less than 1/100th of their wealth control the country?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it friend, you've been totally brainwashed. No part of your entire argument makes any sense when you think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the people who have paid trillions to run america since the late 1800s let some random hungarian guy that isn't even worth 10% of what they are have a say? Seriously?
      </p>
      <p>

       You didn't do your research.  Yes Soros has $25 billion personally.  But he controls and mostly owns Quantum Fund.  The most closed, secretive, largest hedge fund in the world.  It's so secretive that nobody even knows how much assets it has.  You can bet it's close to a trillion dollars.  And with leveraging, which I know he does quite a bit, funds at his disposal are virtually limitless.  In fact, you don't even have to have a lot of cash at disposal if you use futures and other derivatives to leverage your position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rothchilds and other billionaires have money yes.  But those others contribute and meddle in politics to steer policy their way.  To change politics to align with their political views.  Soros is a different beast altogether.  He's manipulating politics and the DNC to make money on a killer trade.  It's a fundamental difference from the goals of other billionaires.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand your skepticism, but you also should know that he has used this tactic at least 3 times in the past to net billions.  British pound, Thai Baht, and Ukraine were all targeted by Soros and it caused massive market crashes and recessions that lasted a decade.
He got to where he is now by destroying countries and whole markets.

        As of 2011
       </a>
       , reported by the financial times and other actually reputable sources, quantum paid out all outside investors and now exclusively manages george soros 24.9b fortune. Everything you said in this comment is therefore incorrect as it hinges on him having money, power and leverage that he does not in fact possess in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike the rothschilds, who keep breitbart infowars etc funded, who spend their 3-5 trillion dollar fortune dividing america and electing trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, now we've established soros is worth what I said he is not what you said he is, how do you figure people like rothschilds who have over 1000x more money than him ar gonna let one comparatively poor random hungarian run their country?

       So, is your whole argument just simply the fact that he isn't the richest person on the planet, thus cannot be doing anything you morons, who don't know he isn't the richest man on the planet, say he is, because the richest people on the planet have more money?

       erm no, my argument is that there are a lot more people who combined are vastly, vastly, vastly richer than he, who are proven to actually be getting involved in politics in the way that he is accused of. Therefore it doesn't make any sense that all of these people who are proven to do it would suddenly just step back and let him have a go, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously money buys power, and if you're george soros despite how monstrously rich you are there are a lot of people with a lot more money than you have who have been invested in something for longer than you've been alive, let alone managing hedge funds, and they don't wanna lose their money, how come you are magically in control? Their argument doesn't make sense.

       So, regarding this reply, your point is exactly that he doesn't have as much money as others so cannot be doing what is being accused of him.  That is all you are bringing up.  Maybe the R&amp;R's are only concerned about their wealth, and have no need to feel in control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the evidence that the Rockefellers and Rothschilds have meddled in U.S. or another countries political platform?  I've seen the video of Soros stating he doesn't care about the economic or social downfall of the shit he has done in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, where is your evidence?  All you are spewing in this argument is that there are wealthier families in America.  Where is the evidence those wealthier families have been meddling in any political platform?  Everyone is talking about Soros because he's thrust himself in the lime light with all these bullshit "protests" over the last year.

       No, I'm not saying he "cannot" be doing it, i'm saying that given the fact there are a lot of people who are, altogether, a lot richer than him doing what you accuse him of, if he were too, there'd be actual proof for you to link right now. The fact you haven't linked any proof whatsoever pretty much invalidates your entire argument (which is a rebuttal stating that my stating psy_raven's argument is incorrect, is incorrect). Such as the bilderberg group for example.

       I don't need any, it's common knowledge the rothschilds &amp; co have been buying elections for centuries, look it up if you don't believe me. Hell, they even ended the 100 years war by backing britain against france near a hundred years ago, these trillionaire people have been investing in their version of the new world order for near 200 years, you think they're gonna let some random hungarian billionaire fuck it up? You really think people like the bilderberg group and the actual illuminati would stand for that? seriously? Some hungarian leftist banker ruining their party? really?

       no everyone is talking about soros because of a ridiculously pathetic attempt at narrative forming by the "alt-right", using typical neo-nazi tactics, which less informed persons such as the redditor I was originaly replying to always fall for - it's been the recruiting tactics of the far-right since the 1930s.

       You're really relying on the tactic that lost this presidency and made half the country look like fucking idiots.  I'm asking for evidence and all you can say is "you're not serious are you?".  Then you go on to say you don't need to provide evidence.  Now it's your turn, are you fucking kidding me?  I don't need to look it up because I'm asking you.  If you have proof then provide it.  You think you're going to win people over by telling them to look it up?  You're not serious, are you?  Then you go on to just assume, assume, assume.  And then you're editing you're own post before I reply, telling me to give up and go to 4chan, another assumption.  You can't be this dumb, can you?  You realize you're using the tactics of the shills?

       No.   That quantum fund that was disbanded was after he took a loss in a bad bet and it was publicly known what it was worth.  I remember clearly as I was also a fund manager at that time.   Since then he set up a new fund that is shrouded in secrecy.   People say it only manages his personal assets but that's just speculation.   No one knows for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, he is a master of using derivatives to manipulate markets.   Leveraging is his Forte.   And to be honest,  even 2 billion is enough to influence elections and social groups like BLM.

       A deliberate misrepresentation of what he does. In fact, it's not just a misrepresentation but an utter lie. He did not manipulate the market to crash the british pound, he just saw an oppertunity and cashed in, according to this, which is sourced from both his and his ex-business partner's own words, including numerous secondary and tertiary sources:

       Simple fact of the matter is this: soros is worth 24.9b the rockefellers, rothschilds etc combined are more than 5 Trillion.

       You think misspelling Rothschild and Rockefller is a slip of the keyboard?  No, misspelling in with on is a keyboard slip.  You can't even use slip of anything when typing.  Do you not reread things you submit?  Are you dumb? Or are you just spewing bullshit?

       Well... All hedge funds are secretive, they are not required to disclose the same amount of information as other types of fund. How do you even know that they are the most secretive HF in the world, when others are as closed as another?

       He hasn't failed when Trump enters presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is elected by Electoral Mandate which means that 500 or so shady nobodies and hacks that nobody can seem to name had elected him to become our next president, and it's obviously not for a good purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also did you notice 4 out of 6 times a president was elected by shady electoral colleges, they are all Republicans? This means that electing Trump could be a psyop to make the Republicans look like unconstituional dictators.
      </p>
      <p>
       But back to Soros.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume that Soros wasn't suprised when Trump won; He is one of the Oligarchs who controlled America's economy, so he should have a good grasp on the electoral colleges. Moreso, it could be his plan all along to discredit him as much as possible and set stone for a "Purple Revolution" which will end up with all out civil war, mass purges and an Hillary eternal presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though this does not happen, there's a fat chance that Trump will be an unpopular president if he survives as he makes numerous unpopular policies and breaks most of his promises before election, making him a second Hitler; An oaf betraying his nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be noted that he was basically elected via un-democratic means (A shady group of nobodies in a closed, dark room) like George Bush, so it won't be suprising that he would betray everything he promised.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the rest you are mostly correct and up to the point, excellent analysis, thank you.

       No, I'm not saying he "cannot" be doing it, i'm saying that given the fact there are a lot of people who are, altogether, a lot richer than him doing what you accuse him of, if he were too, there'd be actual proof for you to link right now. The fact you haven't linked any proof whatsoever pretty much invalidates your entire argument (which is a rebuttal stating that my stating psy_raven's argument is incorrect, is incorrect). Such as the bilderberg group for example.

       I don't need any, it's common knowledge the rothschilds &amp; co have been buying elections for centuries, look it up if you don't believe me. Hell, they even ended the 100 years war by backing britain against france near a hundred years ago, these trillionaire people have been investing in their version of the new world order for near 200 years, you think they're gonna let some random hungarian billionaire fuck it up? You really think people like the bilderberg group and the actual illuminati would stand for that? seriously? Some hungarian leftist banker ruining their party? really?

       no everyone is talking about soros because of a ridiculously pathetic attempt at narrative forming by the "alt-right", using typical neo-nazi tactics, which less informed persons such as the redditor I was originaly replying to always fall for - it's been the recruiting tactics of the far-right since the 1930s.
