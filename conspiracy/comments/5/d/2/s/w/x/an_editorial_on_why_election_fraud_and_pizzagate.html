      <p>
       I've been posting on reddit for many years, and lurking and posting in this sub for at least 5 of those years. I recently created ant alt account, for my own reasons, for posting to 2 or 3 subs only.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mention this because in the past, this sub has covered topics ranging from cannabis cures, to JFK, to aliens, to NSA spying operations, to CIA black ops and more and more and more. Visit archive.org and select a few dates in time to see what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've covered crazy fucking stuff in this sub. Some of things have been really far out there but just as many have been almost spot on the mark.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has recently been a lot of complaints about the politicization of this sub from both the left and right arms of the spectrum. I personally agree the sub shouldn't be a poster board used to further a specific agenda and I would like to call on the mods to begin clearing our blatantly partisan posts. Posts which have no relation to conspiracy need to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, however, there are many posts which
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       partisan because the content of the (suspected)conspiracy directly confronts one side of the political spectrum. These need to remain. Unfortunately I don't really know a good way to accurately separate the wheat from the chaff.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This brings me to my point, and the title of the thread;
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We are currently confronted with a real legitimate conspiracy which is a genuine threat to the republic. There is volumes and volumes of evidence pointing towards voter fraud, corporate and media collusion, political back room dealing, and digital infiltration. We have all witnessed evidence of all of this during the recent election cycle and as we transition past the election day the detritus of corruption continues to present itself, but in an evolving form. It is like the head of the hydra has been cut off but now 2 more have replaced it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally there is brewing evidence of a grander scheme of pedophilia  permeating through government, media, and the elite class. In my opinion I feel the evidence is a little shaky but there are many of those who feel the evidence is indictable and others who feel the evidence is pure flight of fancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many posters on the sub have lamented the "good old days" where r/conspiracy didn't spend its time on political tirades. Many of those have suggested a new sub, or clearing out those posting in this sub. "Go back to the_donald", or "You're a CTR shill" are pretty common here now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's unfortunate, because we are faced with at least one (possibly two or more) verifiable conspiracies and instead of focusing our collective power to unravel the tangled yarn of the conspiracy we are in-fighting over the few scraps of web space we are allotted on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have begun to pull the curtains back on a real conspiracy that was attempted to be (and likely still is) perpetrated upon the American people. This sub, more than any other, has the thinkers and researchers and writers with the experience and knowledge to dig down deep to the roots of these schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should not focus with laser intensity on these conspiracies alone. There are other avenues of interest many of us hold, and I enjoy reading about all of them. With that said though lets stop with the marginalizing of the Election fraud conspiracy and pizza gate. It's ironic that many of the posters on this sub are here because their own theories have been dismissed as too far out, but many of those same people are now dismissing the new school of thought as being too crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. - lol I will likely add a few edits to this because I usually only catch grammar and spelling errors after I post.

       I think it's funny that pizzagate is brushed off so much in this sub.  This could possibly be a real life conspiracy unfolding before our very eyes.  Vindication even.  I agree, everything is circumstantial, but damn, they are bad optics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I have been here for 8 years, I am all for 9/11 truth, vaccines, Dulce, OKC bombing, Icke and his reptilians, Morgellons etc.  All that is great, but we have real evidence now to unravel.  I am tired of running in circles reading the same tired conspiracies.  I mean, there is a lot going on right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if someone believes DJT is part of the Power Structure, which he most likely is, it is painfully obvious there is some in fighting going on right now.  The veil is partially lifting.  I don't know if we will benefit from the infighting other than factions dumping info on the net, but it is definitely happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Where have all the mass shootings gone?  I love me some hoaxes, crisis actors crack my shit up.

       PizzaGate is the conspiracy of all conspiracies. It is everything they have been hiding probably for millennia.

       We must come to terms that the ruling elite, are pedophiles, are satanic and are in many instances cannibals.

       Imho, the emails aren't solid proof. I agree they are sketchy, and Comet Pizza and Spirit Cooking is weird as fuck, but much of the investigations smells a lot like the Satanic Panic in the 1990's or McCarthyism in the 1950's.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all the pizza talk in the emails, I'm thinking sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. God knows we eat a fuck ton of shitty pizza at my job because it's cheap, easy to order, and everyone eats it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I'm open to the theory and I've participated in a couple of discussions but the evidence of the emails just isn't convincing enough for me. I've said this before, but sadly I'm going to need someone to provide irrefutable evidence of the whole shit show before I commit to the idea. If Wikileaks drops something, or the FBI announces photos or video, or if /pol/ cracks a server... I'm in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you, if Pizzagate is real, it's the mother of all conspiracies (except maybe Roswell, lol).

       The cognitive dissonance is real, even with the evidence sitting in front of people's faces. I've talked among friends and coworkers about pizzagate, and they've just laughed it off or said it's too crazy to be true. I divide the discussion between the hard evidence (the emails, money, symbolism, social connections, and previous events that have made the news) and present the circumstantial evidence around that. Even as they begin to connect the dots and open their minds up to the possibility of all of this going on, "because it's not on the news it can't possibly be true" to which I present the MSM/Clinton communications and they double down on the emails all being bogus. These are blue collar coworkers, white collar friends, neighbors and family.
      </p>
      <p>
       It feels as if everyone is so bogged down with getting through their lives, that they're completely disconnected from the government that controls.

       I think the bigger focus (right now) should be a pursuance of plots around the election itself. We are still seeing paid involvement from outside powers (suspected Soros) fueling the media and protestors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've opened a lot of eyes with one simple approach - I tell people to look it up themselves. Point them in the right direction and allow them to see the proof with their own eyes. It's an amazingly effective method.

       Why has there been such disinterest in the Franklin Scandal here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Somebody posted Dave McGowan's "Pedophocracy" chapter from Programmed To Kill here in this subreddit a couple of days ago.  There's more information in that single source than all the Pizzagate posts put together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet there were zero comments in that thread.  And only a few upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate hysteria smells like a psy-op with the lopsided attention.  If all these new usernames on this subreddit really cared about elite pedophilia, it wouldn't be selective to certain scandals but ignoring others.
       <a href="/r/thePedoFile">
        /r/thePedoFile
       </a>
       has been around for years.  But this subreddit doesn't want too much attention drawn to that subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate hysteria smells like shit.  Smells like exactly how the elites would create diversions and Red Herrings.  CaucasianEagle is right about the Franklin Scandal being ignored.  Proof is in the pizza.

       I'm trying to remain open to the idea. I suspect there is more to come from the FBI and NYPD/Weinergate, and that stuff might begin to tie things together. It's partly why I'm trying to remain open.
