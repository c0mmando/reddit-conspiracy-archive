       Yeah whatever happened to Hillary having like 97% odds of winning according to the NY Times? Became clearer to more people what utter propaganda the media is. Those who are still asleep are at least more uncomfortable right now in their cognitive dissonance.

       The misprojection of the election results were a product of political correctness where no one wanted to come out a say they're voting Trump.   It's the same phenomenon that's happening to Obama's approval rating.   No one wants to come out and say that a black president is doing a bad job.   It is ludicrous for him to have nearly 60% rating when midterm elections overwhelmingly went Republican and they even lost the white house while Rep kept control of Congress.   It's all a sham.

       Nobody can definitively say the exact reason they were so off.

       One thing that is clear is that they were very confident in their ability to shill for Hillary and they obviously thought it was far far more effective than it actually turned out to be.

       The dishonest behaviour of the polling organisations, and their complicity with the Clinton team is a major conspiracy of this election (and Brexit for that matter). People don't like to vote for a loser, so if the polls always put your guy behind, that can dampen turnout, and the compliant pollsters went to some effort to ensure Clinton always appeared to be in the lead, even if that meant some obvious tweaking of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple of weeks before the election, they went full retard and put Clinton ahead by a ludicrous 11% - possibly in an attempt to kill off the Trump challenge for good - but it didn't work. Instead, as election day loomed the pollsters realised their reputation would be trashed unless they could bring down Clinton's "lead" to something plausibly deniable when she lost. Fortunately, (or by design?) Comey's brief re-activation of the email enquiry gave the pollsters the excuse to slash Hillary's fake poll lead without too many questions being asked.

       They control the voting systems too though... I don't think the disparity between what the media thought would happen, and who actually got elected, was an accident. I think discord is being intentionally sown in the American public by the powerful elite. But perhaps I am being paranoid. Perhaps it is the media elites fighting the elites who own the voting machines, two different factions. Just some possibilities.

       I think this election has shown exit polls are terrible predictors and have hidden biases that aren't accounted for, and aren't able to get truly random samples of the population. But you do have a point. However if they own all the media, they can make the exit polls look however they like, too.

       huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's kneejerk virtue-signalling to be 'fair and balanced'...but no, you -cannot- always say that 'well, both sides are equally X'.  e.g. 'bad'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's see...we've got the MSM narrative....blatantly biased...that's one side....and the 'other' side is...what?  Trump HQ presumably?  lol.  What 'misinformation' are they outputting?  They hardly say anything.  Hell, they've been criticized for not returning the lying-media's phone-calls! lol
      </p>
      <p>
       There's only ONE side on MSM...the shadow-gov's side.  It's blatantly obvious that the MSM is 'feeding' the riots...whipping them up...along with a thousand oh-so-hip regurgitator-sites like Slate, TPM, Huffpoo etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ, just look down the list of thread-titles (headlines) at r/politics !  99% of them are -designed- to goad the brainwashed conformists to even greater mouth-frothing madness.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now the MSM joins with the oh-so-hip tech firms like Google, FB, et al, to demonize, censor, and eradicate indie-media that doesn't toe the approved narrative.  I.e., Huff-poo gets a free ride, while Zerohedge is blocked/banned/ruined.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the amount of 'misinformation' is NOT great from 'both sides'.  Just from one 'side'...the side of the powerful and corrupt...the establishment/MSM/SJW narrative 'side'.

       The corruption of the left has been exposed. We have seen the mainstream media blatantly and arrogantly forcing one candidate down our throats. We watched as the Democratic Party torpedoed a more popular candidate in favor of their chosen nominee. Lies from the president, the sec of state and the entire administration have been uncovered. All of these things supported by irrefutable evidence. It is as if a giant spotlight has been turned on and directed right at the party that half the country blindly supports.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you should be asking yourself, is who is holding that light? Is it a coincidence that all of this damning information has suddenly been uncovered and proven that the corruption we have all been warning about and fighting against actually exists?
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it more likely that what we are actually seeing is the destruction of the credibility of one choice so that the other choice will seem virtuous and right. We are being shown a fairy tale in which the corrupt establishment of the elite has been exposed and the people have chosen a new leader against all odds whom will save us from the traitors and cut out the cancer in our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the same story they told the left 8 years ago to put them to sleep. The white knight is riding to the White House to save 'murica. Everything is ok now...
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the media expose crimes that it was implicit in commiting? Why would the media give so much time to a man it supposedly hated, when ignoring other candidates had destroyed their campaigns? Why would the so called 'savior' be a friend of the establishment's candidate and have donated to her campaigns in the past?
      </p>
      <p>
       The interests that control this country are not elected. We elect the puppets, not the puppeteer.

       Agreed.  I've read several quite credible analyses now, which postulate that Trump was -intended- to win, as the fall-guy for the unavoidable huge crash-and-burn that's already underway.  To totally discredit nationalism, so we'll all beg the globalists to take over...

       Oh people are waking up. The election was proof the Media lost it's claim on the masses. Now that the masses in the US largely ignored the Media lies,they have moved to censor us by Google, Facebook and Twitter. The stench of desperation from these losers is heavy now. We know what the "fake"news outcry is all about. How dare we think outside their bullshit? lol

       It would take 25,000 years at 100 pages a day to read all US laws applicable in 2016. So basically the law is enforced on whims because no one can know the actual laws because they're too complex. So they can basically lock anyone in a cage at their discretion because people commit an average of 3 felonies a day, it's just that no one knows or goes after them. It's a very abusive and deliberately over-complexified system, imo. It's like the legalese version of the IT adage "security through obscurity"

        I think I started to change direction once John Kerry told Equador to cut off Assanges internet at the Embassy, and the raid on the embassy and how nobody else was reporting it but I saw it first on here.

      <p>
       John Kerry is a menace to society and should have not been allowed to be Secretary of State. J.K.'s character was first brought into question when a university student asked him too many questions and was body slammed, choked and tazered while John Kerry watched and said or did nothing to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing that John Kerry would cut off or raid the Ecuadorean Embassy is not at all surprising from John Kerry. It reassures assumptions about his character. Perhaps John Kerry signaled the university student to be taken down because he didn't like the questions:

      </p>
      <p>
       When I first watched about the Collateral Murder leaked video my thought wasn't that a news organization should be raided or a person exiled and killed. My thought was pride that I lived in a place where we could know that information and that the people in power needed to tread lightly. The Obama response has not and cannot and will not destroy leaking. What it did destroy was peoples' respect for Obama or the US Government. The election of Trump is one small part of returning America back to its entrepreneurs.

       Then I found out over half of US presidents were/are in it, and those are only the known ones. Then I found out there's like 10 million people in it. Then I found out many of the 33 levels are named after Mt. Zion and rebuilding the Temple of Solomon. Then I found out about modern Zionism and its relationship to the Rothschild Family and Israel. And then the Rothchild relationship with central banking. And central banking's relationships with all the governments of the world. Once this started to click, there was no going back to seeing things how I saw them before.

       Don't down vote this guy for being honest! I'm all for serving our country once they prove its something worth fighting for. No way in hell would I join the military now, but right after 9/11 was a different time. It took me a while to see it for what it was too, once all the 'united we stand' bullshit faded away and the dust settled.
      </p>

       Point being, this dude joined the military trying to help protect people like us and deserves some respect for that; that'd a pretty big sacrifice to make and the intention was good.

       we still need the passion, skill and bravery that the military claims to be about, and at some level probably still is for the people who enlist. we just need to get more wise who the enemy is, and how to counter attack. I like your position!! just what we need. It's painful as hell to realize some of these deceptions are here. we get tricked so deeply - we shape our lives around these lies.  it's a strange strange thing to realize each one of the deceptions. but it's really nice to apologize to those you gave a hard time to who were trying to tell you about it, I think everybody who has realized stuff knows there is this natural defense reaction -- and they try not to take it personally -- how can we really it's a part of the conditioning to vehemently resist realization. but it's nice to say what you are saying!!! warms my heart. ;) fight on.

       The main reason they did 9/11 was so that they could kill and maim a good amount of potential revolutionaries in fake wars.

       How does a bullet goes through a steel plate?
      </p>
      <p>
       A 676 flies at 525~ mph while cruising, a bullet flies at 1,700 mph. So, that's third the speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, a 676 weighs 395,000 pounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems simple to me, with that weight and speed, and the structure of the 676 and the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=814rcm4KC5w">
        angle it went through
       </a>
       it would easily bend steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you can make a easily

       If that bullet had proportionally thin wings, would they go through?

       For all the bad rap people give researchers or "conspiracy theorists" as they say derogatorily, this sub has some of the most socratic and open-minded dialogue ive ever had the pleasure of reading and engaging in.

       He's not either.  Trump's election was a rejection of Clinton and the inherent corruption they represent.  But none of that matters.  He's the president now, and since we know what we know thanks to WikiLeaks and the embarrassment of the main stream media's obvious bias it is up to us to keep him accountable for his words.

       I think the assumption is that those guys are going to be telling Trump what they plan to do. I mean of course Trump will have input and want them to do his bidding. But I just can't see Trump controlling those figures like Giuliani or Christie. But we will have to wait and see.

        But Mercer’s ties to Trump go beyond Super PAC donations. In 2011, the conservative billionaire provided a $10 million lifeline to a floundering Breitbart News. The site has since exploded from its niche on the paranoid right to mainstream prominence; in August, Breitbart CEO and Trump Svengali Steve Bannon took over managing the Donald’s campaign. Bannon is reportedly “tied at the hip” to Mercer daughter and cookie entrepreneur Rebekah Mercer, who has emerged as the family’s political power player.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rebekah Mercer, whose wealthy family has sought for years to reshape conservative politics with a populist, anti-establishment message, was named to President-Elect Donald Trump’s transition team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mercer, the 42-year-old daughter of New York hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer, will serve as one of 16 members of the team’s executive committee, the group said in a statement Friday. It’s a sign of how the Mercers’ longstanding effort to influence the direction of the Republican Party is paying off.

Nowhere is this more glaring than in the case of Chris Christie. Christie's name appears as a possibility for Attorney General and three secretary positions: Homeland Security, Interior and Commerce.

       I mean, seriously.  It's a who's-who of insiders, billionaire elites (and their children), lobbyists, and political professionals...you know, just like every other Democratic and Republican cabinet ever.  If you think they'll be bowing to his wishes any more than they would to any other politician, you're delusional.  He did a song and dance and baited the hooks, you're just one of the millions of marks that bought it.  The only difference between Shillary and Trump is the specific billionaires that own them and the specific laws they've broken to Fuck the working class of this country.  Otherwise they're both criminal elites sucking off the middle class teat.

       i'm not sure about this spirit cooking thing -- but on first glance Id say it is a planted story. the thing about these conspiracies is there are A LOT of planted conspiracies. planted by the CIA (maybe) or whoever -- somebody like the CIA. they "leak" images, stories, etc. and it's like candy for the people who are just starting to realize all is not as it seems. but ---- unfortunately it's a jungle out there of real conspiracy and planted conspiracy. I'd say Edward Snoeden and Wikileaks are very likely planted. meant to confuse, subterfuge and derail your research. but you shouldn't take my word for it -- everything deserves it's own vetting -- but just know some conspiracies are there to detract your attention from more real realizations.

       Not OP, but what really brought me full throttle were Adam Curtis' documentaries (eg Century of Self), and from there down the rabbithole. And as each conspiracy "theory" is proven fact (eg elite pedophilia rings, mass surveillance, CIA terrorist involvement) the rabbithole only got deeper

       Public intelligence analyst. I like it. "Conspiracy researcher" still makes people uncomfortable, and even "truth researcher" was smeared by MSM after the 9/11 truth movement. I'll be borrowing that, if you dont mind.

       The mark of an intelligent mind is that it can consider ideas without having to believe that they are true. Be careful what you choose to believe. Beliefs are like computer code. They will change the way your mind operates. Beliefs elicit emotions, support and create ideas, and change behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mistake many people make us to jump from consideration to conclusion and rigidly hold onto beliefs with insufficient evidence. It can make them unhappy and unhelpful.

       That's good advice, and that's exactly what I had to do.  It was very overwhelming at first, especially since I was the only one out of anyone I knew who was digging into this.  My friends mostly dismissed it and told me that they only reason they weren't calling a mental hospital for me, was because they knew I was a rational person who didn't just make shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had to give it a rest after about 3 weeks of barely sleeping (3 hrs a night) and reading nonstop.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have since been able to show my friends enough information to where they are all believers that something really messed up is going on, and that our government is lying to us.  Once people understand that, it becomes much easier to grasp the rest of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, at least now I don't feel crazy and alone, just slightly crazy. :)

       I'm still not ready to call 9/11 an inside job, though it is without a doubt, and entirely historically accurate to say the Government had prior knowledge of the entire plot, and used to go further into an surveillance state.

       "inside job" isn't the right term, they had help, outside and inside. coverup is beyond doubt, pre-knowledge almost too but it's not like the cia rigged those towers, imo mercs or most likely israeli's.

        September 11 - The New Pearl Harbor

       by Massimo Mazzucco is excellent.  It's 5 hours long, on 3 dvds (if you go that route), and he encourages people to freely distribute it.

       Don't let some of the rough editing and slightly lower budget feel to some of the post production elements turn you off, as it's the most comprehensive critique of all aspects of that terrible day in one place that I have seen.

       The 9/11 conspiracy is what sent me here just a few months ago. Honestly this place is the true place for skepticism. We know how far the rabbit hole goes down here and we also know there are shills and disinformation agents everywhere to distract/confuse/distort the truth. Its up to us to spread the truth. Welcome!

       This sub survived a lot of shilling and astroturfing from the election cycle, and it was the only place I could get trustworthy news during the whole Assange losing the Internet ordeal.  What once was a stigma should now be a badge of honor, people who are always watching and calling bullshit when they see it.

       Pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kevin orders cheese pizza, leaves a sign on the door that says "backdoor please", pizza guy arrives and rams into a statue of a little boy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kevin's actor grew up and is now in a band called the Pizza underground
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think home alone is really about rape, and the two bandits are actually interested in Kevin and not the house. Even the dialogue the scene immediately before the pizza delivery is his brother saying he doesnt care that he is "getting it in the butt"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also pizza place was called Lil Nero's, and their catchphrase was "No Fiddlin Around"

       imo, the statue looks more like a miniature bugler or mailman than a little boy. Also, Little Nero's is a parody of Little Caesar's and "No fiddlin' around" is likely a reference to the saying that Nero fiddled (played music) while Rome burned. Seems to me that they're all just details that could be interpreted as related to pedophilia but probably not.

       Good for you for recognizing that you've been deceived. The thing with everything here is you never take it as the full facts or absolutely right and this skepticism is healthy.

       That's the article that was posted on this sub, saying that leftists jewish students painted the swastika. It links this site as its source:

      <p>
       <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/national/students-charged-painting-swastikas-trump-campus-chapel">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowhere on that site does it mention the students being jewish or leftists. It's right there in the article and this sub still upvoted it to the front page

       The disclosure demographic are nuts, as far as I am concerned; what they want will never eventuate.

       I also can't see a new 9/11 investigation, unfortunately.  Although they're getting older, most of the people who were involved in that are still around, and are probably still able to exert sufficient influence to block it.

       ha. unfortunately true. but you can socialize too, start a meetup in your city, I did, it's fun we have drinks and talk about stuff you are not supposed to say. it's not an action movie but it's still better than sitting on computer all day.

       Ahh 9/11. Biggest gold and information heist in america. Amongst other consequences, like the continued never ending war and industrialized military complex taking over america. The fall of many world governments and the ever expanding reach of the world bank. Terrorists.  Terror. Terrorists.  Terror. Jihad terrorists. Terrorists. Terrorists. That was shoved down Americans throats for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself, why did every American have to switch to digital television?  A better picture. More news sources.  More fear. 24×7, free.. Easily persuaded public.

       Thanks a nice post!! 9/11 was my first eye opener, a couple years ago. I gotta say I'm still realizing things about that day, 'no planes' and 'no floors' seemed like "too far" to me for a long time. but there came a point I realized "inside job" isn't even a full explanation here -- some, or perhaps a great deal, of what we think we witnesses  that day was theatrics, in fact a lot of the identities of the victims seem to be falsified. I don't know if you've dared to go to those depths yet -- but there is so much to realize about 9/11, even further down than inside job --
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, nice post!!!!!

       thats cool you tried it,
      </p>
      <p>
       the first time I looked at it I felt embarrassed for myself, I came out to the living room , told my bf I've finally gone too far on the internet and he was like : good. Im glad you realized, lets watch TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       but then it just bugged me, that what i had seen was still something i was thinking about, so I watched a little more a few days later, it took me months of just pondering and being in disbelief that I was pondering this -- and research - and field trips --- to realize --- HS!!! the globe can not be true, Im not embarrassed any more. the truth is more powerful than social acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
       in my opinion there is so much to question at once - I think when you first look into it sometimes it just feels like to take any part of it it's like pulling a stone out of a wall and the whole thing could come tumbling down. and you have to build up preparedness to have further curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       but to each their own. we all have to figure stuff out in a manner that is personally vetted by ourselves,
      </p>
      <p>
       (my BF now knows it's flat too -- because I spent the next few months, after I realized it for myself explaining it to him.: )

       no, its because there are actually a shit ton of people that disapprove of Trump, myself being one of them. Have you seen the vote count? We are a divided country.

       personally I voted for trump but ALL my friends voted for Hillary and I love them just the same - they love me just the same perhaps because they are blissfully unaware of how i voted, but still. I love that he talked sht about the media, on the other hand ---- I'm waiting any day for the bubble to pop and me to realize for sure he is just one of them and a pretender to the people. it's kind of already popping really. freedom lies in us - as people -- not in whoever they let us elect.

       conspiracy theorists that are onto major conspiracies that determine major policy shifts have to deal with the most shit. considered no better than terrorists, regularly abused ostracized surveiled and sometimes assassinated.
while the flat earth brigade continues unmolested by authorities since there is absolutely no relevant shift in policy that would be effected either way, and therefore no motive for them to give a damn.

       personally I voted for trump but ALL my friends voted for Hillary and I love them just the same - they love me just the same perhaps because they are blissfully unaware of how i voted, but still. I love that he talked sht about the media, on the other hand ---- I'm waiting any day for the bubble to pop and me to realize for sure he is just one of them and a pretender to the people. it's kind of already popping really. freedom lies in us - as people -- not in whoever they let us elect.
