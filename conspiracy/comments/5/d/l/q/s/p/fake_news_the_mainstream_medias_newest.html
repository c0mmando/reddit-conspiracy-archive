       Theres llike 30 more articles like these that are exactly the same, I just got tired of linking them all.

      <p>
       I've been following shit like this for a while, and this is the single most obvious coordinated narrative I've ever seen from the media. "Fake News" is a term that wasnt used once in the lead up to the election, and then all of a sudden, we get 30 different outlets posting the same shit on the same day. This is "Gamers are Dead" on steroids, they are using "Fake News" as a way to attack any media outlets that did not toe the establishment line. If we allow this to happen, then for example, any articles or sites that expose conspiracies or information that hurts the establishment will almost certainly be labeled fake news
      </p>
      <p>
       I just searched "fake news" on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . 50 hits on it in the last 14 days, once you get past where the narrative initially popped up, there were only 50 hits on the term over three years. Do they actually think they will fool anyone with this? These guys are so fucking scared of media outlets they dont control lmao.

       "Fake news" and "alt-right" both emerged from the ether seemingly in the last 2 or 3 days.  This is obviously a coordinated effort.  My question is whether this is a reaction or preplanned.

       It only became a big bad after the election though. Before that the media treated the alt-right for what it actually is, a bunch of bored 4chan trolls.

       There is definitely fake news on social media.  Outright false and made up information.  A lot of people here don't use social media but its crazy to see so many people reposting and commenting on reports, both pro and anti Trump/Clinton, where a google search finds 0 corroborating reports.

       This might be what they are using to justify their claims but people are interpreting it as sources like Breitbart are "fake news" which is false.

       Im more likely to believe  fake news than rl news at this point.  I have always kept abreast with current events (keeps me in rl) but recently msm has lost all credibility with me. Drs like to tell me i have mental illness when it suits them, idk if im slipping or the world is slipping even the medical establishment is losing credibility. So freeking out over this media deal lately. Think i need get back on the smoko and watch sum RT lol

       Haha i hear you, a little mj keeps me sane i think :)

      <p>
       And I've been low key freaking out for weeks now and have straight up questioned my sanity. I'm very thankful that so many other people here are seeing the same things and after reading through the evidence --- to me, either I'm having my first psychotic break or these connections are real and they are horrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       It bothers me as well, that there are some people who are going to see this "fake news" bs and eat it right up --- because these idiots like to feel superior and safe.

       Fake news has been around for a while, but the "alt right" was really pushing it in this election cycle.  We've always had it on this sub, because of the anti-establish anti-msm bent we have.  The mods are pretty good and parsing it and the community is pretty good about seeing through the bullshit.  But I have seen a notable rise in it lately with few months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some of the recent "fake news" sites I've seen pop up for the alt-right.  And it's not like googles is going to decide on a case by case basis.  They're going to act like a reddit sub and just filter the entire site.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         thepoliticalinsider.com
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         yournewswire.com
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         thegatewaypundit.com
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         worldnewsdailyreport.com
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       then you have "alt media" sites/ tabloids which aggregate and spin and vary between "fake" and real news (even the national enquirer prints real stories sometimes), but probably have a little more money and political weight behind them:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         the inquisitr
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         breitbart
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the observer?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         dailymail
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I think, though, you're also going to get other "alternative media" and conspiracy sites in trouble because of the effect "fake news" has had recently, and the attention that's being paid to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       you have obviously questionable sites with differing credibility, but which cover real news that the msm blacks out or spins, like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         godlike productions
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         natural news
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         infowars
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         zerohedge
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         veteranstoday
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       by excluding them from google "news" or autosearch or ad functions, you're really  limiting access to information.  but my question is when this "fake news" begins to be applied to functioning journalistic organizations that are biased against US imperialism:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         RT
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         PressTV
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Intercept
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wikileaks
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         GlobalResearch
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Bureau of Investigative Journalism
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and at what point do editors refuse to run stories simply because the establishment will cast doubt on them and it could effect the site properties search rank?  Would the Post or London Review of Books still be willing to publish seymour hersh?  Will newspapers refuse to print greg palast or greenwald or scahill?
      </p>
      <p>
       and do these filters apply to liberal sites which don't have much editorial oversite, like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Huffpo
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         DailyKos
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         buzzfeed

       Fake news comes in two varieties. The first is government propaganda, this recent fake news scare being a perfect example. The second is commercial clickbait: you won't believe what she looks like now; you wouldn't believe what happened next; this one trick the insurance company doesn't want you to know; &amp;tc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of what they are afraid of would not exist if they governed transparently to begin with. The government's secrecy is what provides the space for the craziest tin hat stuff to run and run like the Energizer Bunny.

       All those sites are themselves unreliable news but so are alternative media.  I think we should take some action to lesson the amount of misinformation.  I'm not sure what, but there has to be some way to improve the situation.

       I think the prime example was "The Guardian Denver." Basically set up a website in the style of the guardian, with a fake address in real life, and pretended to be a US-based branch of the guardian. Of course, trying to fight this might result in other, smaller websites being forced out as "fake."
