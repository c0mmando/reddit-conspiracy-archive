<p>Theres llike 30 more articles like these that are exactly the same, I just got tired of linking them all.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following shit like this for a while, and this is the single most obvious coordinated narrative I&#39;ve ever seen from the media. &quot;Fake News&quot; is a term that wasnt used once in the lead up to the election, and then all of a sudden, we get 30 different outlets posting the same shit on the same day. This is &quot;Gamers are Dead&quot; on steroids, they are using &quot;Fake News&quot; as a way to attack any media outlets that did not toe the establishment line. If we allow this to happen, then for example, any articles or sites that expose conspiracies or information that hurts the establishment will almost certainly be labeled fake news</p>

<p>I just searched &quot;fake news&quot; on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. 50 hits on it in the last 14 days, once you get past where the narrative initially popped up, there were only 50 hits on the term over three years. Do they actually think they will fool anyone with this? These guys are so fucking scared of media outlets they dont control lmao.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fake news has been around for a while, but the &quot;alt right&quot; was really pushing it in this election cycle.  We&#39;ve always had it on this sub, because of the anti-establish anti-msm bent we have.  The mods are pretty good and parsing it and the community is pretty good about seeing through the bullshit.  But I have seen a notable rise in it lately with few months.</p>

<p>Here are some of the recent &quot;fake news&quot; sites I&#39;ve seen pop up for the alt-right.  And it&#39;s not like googles is going to decide on a case by case basis.  They&#39;re going to act like a reddit sub and just filter the entire site.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>thepoliticalinsider.com</p></li>
<li><p>yournewswire.com</p></li>
<li><p>thegatewaypundit.com</p></li>
<li><p>worldnewsdailyreport.com</p></li>
</ul>

<p>then you have &quot;alt media&quot; sites/ tabloids which aggregate and spin and vary between &quot;fake&quot; and real news (even the national enquirer prints real stories sometimes), but probably have a little more money and political weight behind them:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the inquisitr</p></li>
<li><p>breitbart</p></li>
<li><p>the observer?</p></li>
<li><p>dailymail</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think, though, you&#39;re also going to get other &quot;alternative media&quot; and conspiracy sites in trouble because of the effect &quot;fake news&quot; has had recently, and the attention that&#39;s being paid to it.</p>

<p>you have obviously questionable sites with differing credibility, but which cover real news that the msm blacks out or spins, like: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>godlike productions</p></li>
<li><p>natural news</p></li>
<li><p>infowars</p></li>
<li><p>zerohedge</p></li>
<li><p>veteranstoday</p></li>
</ul>

<p>by excluding them from google &quot;news&quot; or autosearch or ad functions, you&#39;re really  limiting access to information.  but my question is when this &quot;fake news&quot; begins to be applied to functioning journalistic organizations that are biased against US imperialism:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>RT</p></li>
<li><p>PressTV</p></li>
<li><p>The Intercept</p></li>
<li><p>Wikileaks</p></li>
<li><p>GlobalResearch</p></li>
<li><p>The Bureau of Investigative Journalism</p></li>
</ul>

<p>and at what point do editors refuse to run stories simply because the establishment will cast doubt on them and it could effect the site properties search rank?  Would the Post or London Review of Books still be willing to publish seymour hersh?  Will newspapers refuse to print greg palast or greenwald or scahill?</p>

<p>and do these filters apply to liberal sites which don&#39;t have much editorial oversite, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Huffpo</p></li>
<li><p>DailyKos</p></li>
<li><p>buzzfeed</p></li>
</ul>
