       I know this is kind of a broad question but what conpiracy theory/theories cause the most debate when brought up? Especially in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also is there a conspiracy theory that you just can't accept as fact no matter how hard you try to believe it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: thanks for the responses I didn't think flat earth would be the most controversial. Looks like I have some research to do.

       Making the connection from all reality being energy and vibrations; there being infinite expressions of possibility. Using this knowledge to show everyone's reality is their own and seeing the tragedy of how society has a perception deception put on them as they don't realize their own power and are put in a limited possibility box (little me) and that most likely it was some kind of other intelligence that is intentionally using manufactured human suffering for food or energy.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        About a decade later, I was camping with three friends at Island Lake near Nevada City, California. A couple of us decided to take "heroic" doses of Psilocybe mushrooms one evening. I chewed down four grams, retired to my tent, closed my eyes, and got horizontal on my air mattress. As the effects of the 'shrooms came on, my inner vision revealed what looked like a dank moss-green hospital emergency waiting room. I seemed to be sitting on a bench in this room, and it occurred to me that it was odd that there were no patients being wheeled in or out. Kinda quiet for an ER. After some time, I noticed a few off-white football-sized larvae floating three or four feet off the ground in various spots. Following one of these with my eyes, I then saw an insectoid entity about the size of a small dog, whose back was facing me. It had a long mosquito-like proboscis that I could only partially see. Suddenly, it turned, and--realizing that I saw it--it made a high-pitched buzzing/shrieking sound. (I got the impression that it was sending out a warning alarm.) The entity then initiated telepathic communication with me, explaining that it was quite surprised that I could see it, as this usually didn't occur. It said that it lived by extracting human thought/emotion. Human thoughts were both the currency of its species, as well as their sustenance/energy source. (The needle-like proboscis was looking less friendly by the minute.) I was given the impression that--as the coin of its kind--different types of thought/emotion were valued differently; those with a more intense energy charge, such as fear or love, were worth more. The entity explained that it existed in another dimension so that it could feed off of human thought unhindered. (I got a feeling that the relationship wasn't symbiotic; perhaps these "thought drainers" somehow suck life energy from humans, along with the mental energy.) It claimed that it was the psychic equivalent of an actual insect that feeds on blood, skin, etc., with regard to the extent of any damage it might do to those on whom it fed. Yet I had a nagging feeling that it might not be telling me the whole truth. Maybe these creatures had some influence on inciting wars or disasters in the human realm? The experience left me feeling unsettled for some time afterwards.

       Most controversial? Discussing anything that happened during the Holocaust that goes against the narrative (it's actually illegal in some parts of the world to discuss said theories). So I'd say that.

       I'm still getting my feet wet with the idea. It's confusing and everything around it is unintuitive. The incentive for doing it is also quite a bit less significant than say, 9/11 or Iran/Contra. Further, there is no way to objectively discuss the death of first-graders for most anyone who isn't a sociopath.
      </p>

       If I found a good source from someone who's not a gun-nut, I'm pretty likely to believe it at this point. The CIA seems to have their way.

       Everyone so far has brought up excellent examples.  The WW2 generation?  Perhaps it's the holocaust.  Babyboomers?  Let's look at the moon landing. Further generations?  Perhaps the inner-city cracke cocaine infiltration.  More recently?  Sandy Hook.  Are there others?  Yes.  From my understanding there are many inter-generational issues that influence the mood of conspiracies.

And Uncle Sam? And Timmy's Hamster? Most of these can be tied to the basic CIA conspiracy, but...what about the liberal media conspiracy? How is it they are owned by Westinghouse, G.E., Disney and other parts of the conservative conspiracy? But then, all the conspiracies are so interlocked and interwoven that when you start looking into one, you inevitably end up being sucked into another and another.
       </p>
       <p>
        One can endlessly explore the world of conspiracies, intricately detailing it's works, mapping it's eddies and flows, it's secret, subtle currents, it's dangers...but one risks succumbing to it's apparent friendliness and charm. For it contains within it so many infinitely varying conspiracies of fanatic interest that there's BOUND to be a conspiracy JUST RIGHT FOR YOU! There are certainly plenty to go around.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet none of these thousands of "little conspiracies" are nearly worthy of our grandiose, all-powering Hate. They're not part of the very AIR we BREATH, like the BIG conspiracy. They're real enough, but they themselves don't even know who they're really working for. Many of them even "mean well"! But all are just RAVENING MOUTHS for a vast hunger with no body.
       </p>
       <p>
        The conspiracy that we truly hate, the real Conspiracy, isn't one of these fiendishly clever ones. It doesn't even know it's a conspiracy! It cant. It's a faceless confederacy of dunces, so vast and so broad that it underlies all the lesser conspiracies and permeates all human reality. Quite the opposite of devious, it dominates by merely exploiting the overall, mealy- mouthed, chickenbutt-kissing "Code of Normality" (or CON) of ALL the Pinks, norm-worms and mere-humes at large. There is no more insidious and subtle a weapon than that.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Conspiracy has no face; we know it only by it's desires...a great Mirror of Disfigurement, it reflects what is wrong with everyone. Politics and the petty squabbles of nations are only part of what The Conspiracy manipulates. It is MUCH BIGGER than gods or demons, Republicans and Democrats, or Presidents and interlocking corporate directorates; it's everything from the school bully to the wimp principle, from Mom and Dad to the Bobbie in the Billybong.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than anything else, The Conspiracy is an attitude - a fear - a PINKNESS. A cancer of the imagination, the hatred of the real, the yearning for "cuteness," the eagerness to obey... Oh sure, people LOVE new things - like Michael Jackson is "new" compared to The Beatles. But if, say, a REAL JESUS were to appear, well, it might look just a bit TOO new to be allowed to run loose for very long.
       </p>
       <p>
        This fear of the unfamiliar permeates society; it's what let's the CON get away with REAL MURDER on a massive scale. Guaranteeing obedience requires little effort on the part of any Conspiracy "ringleaders"; the stinking Normals happily supply the obedience themselves. The obvious injustices and insanities written into law books by Illuminati bigwigs are insignificant compared to the little things - the unspoken agreement with the status-quo, the unthinking daily cowardice, the petty subtle put- downs, the judgmental gossip and all the mundane venalities that make up human nature: the Hanna-Barbera cartoons, the "infotainment" programs, those day-glo Rush Limbaugh bumper- stickers, the Caucasian Christians for Commerce, the grade school "Turn In Your Parents" program, the saccharine voice of "Barney," the fashion masters, O.J. Obsession, MTV-style hamburger commercials, the Denver Boot, Line Dancing, Professional Victims, Health Fascists, the Super Mario Brothers, Steven Speilberg, Chuck E. Cheese, Robert Dole, Mickey's Toontown, cute boxer shorts with "hip" designs, people who spell their names with all lower case letters, ect.
       </p>
       <p>
        This nation, this WORLD is BLOATED and SWAYING DRUNKENLY with the stench of Pinkness on it's breath. So...it isn't YOUR fault if things just continue to go more and more wrong until one day you SNAP OUT OF IT and realize that there REALLY ARE billions of TORMENTED SOULS BURNING IN HELL, and YOU'RE ONE OF 'EM...That last, frantic, dying shriek of your soul going under will be the only sign that you have made the transition into the peaceful netherworld of blinkered Pink indifference.
       </p>
       <p>
        WAKE UP AND SMELL THE SODIUM PENTOTHAL!! IT'S WHAT YOU DON'T SEE THAT SELLS YOU
       </p>
       <p>
        But why should the Pinks worry? Even if there was a Conspiracy (yuk, yuk), it wouldn't be after them, would it? "I pay my taxes," they think. "I obey the law. I'm not strange or out of the ordinary. Why should I care?" And they're right. The Conspiracy doesn't have to "get them" because THEY'VE BEEN HAD ALL ALONG. That ring has been in their nose so long that the scars have completely healed and even a sharp YANK on the chain doesn't hurt anymore. They're safe all right. Safe as a fish in a seafood restaurant tank.

       Ok, so for the first, in short the
       <em>
        Secret Space Program
       </em>
       because its existence is only based on whistleblowers that have somehow remembered most events after they went through a 6 week long memory wipe program, and corroborating testimony from people that have worked on projects linked to manufacturing large craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SPP implies and involves negative polarized humans that have essentially created a breakaway human race, and a partnership (circa late 60's - early 70's) with an alien race known as Draco. This alliance has more recently created the "Dark Fleet", which goes on exo- planet and conquest missions causing exo-planet genocide to take resources from them (not unlike in the movie

       Anything to do with the shape of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main reason for this is that it is impossible to conclusively prove the shape of the earth with any one experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ground based tests are not much help, because the surface of the earth varies

       If flat earth is true, it plays into literally everything else, including satanists/masons/jesuits/skulls/fucking everything.  The fact that there are people out there who will openly discuss these secret societies and actively/vehemently refute flat earth theory is simply proof that secret society members are very active in flat earth threads.  IMO that's the reason it is so hotly contested on this board.  There is a good amount of information on youtube that will ensure you never wholly believe round earth again.
