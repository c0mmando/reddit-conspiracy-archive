       Hopefully if we can get it to take hold sprinkle a little kek magic on it and shout down these self aggrandizing scumbags. They are pig shit on your boot. We take back our language or freedom our own understanding. They will try to manipulate us in every way possible they are obviously at the bottom of their barrel of monkeys. Lets kill this disease by redefining it for the apathetic normies with adhd ,one single word. Its simple and concise and using it strips them of even attempting to soap box or steal the high ground dont let up a single inch push these sick fucks into the dirt with your words. I can smell victory. Push hard now. They are weakest at this moment, liberals are starting to believe their government gods might be lucifer. Reassure them.

       Anarchist incites class war. This post has the air of a pitchfork wielding lynch party. As much as I would like them swinging from lamp posts, we should be promoting the
       <em>
        legal channels to document, prosecute, expose, and punish the guilty
       </em>
       else we become a mob, and give the elite the excuse to murder us all, and they can!

       Have you ever seen the movie Ghandi? Its long starts with probably one of the best quotes ive ever read. Just watch the first minute of it. Then in the middle everybody takes a beating and gets back up and intent on taking another beating. That is how this ends.

       Ghandi was a lawyer. We need the laws enforced against these pedos. To avoid the glaring light of exposure they have the will, the perversion, the resources, and the sociopathic/materialistic armies to begin hurting us, as they enjoy hurting people. Danger! Rabble rousing will backfire, plus, the OP doesn't sound like Ghandi. It needs to be laser-like police work, hearings, and task forces.

       Im not inciting anything other than using their own tricks to destroy them in the minds of the most dedicated devotee. When they begin to scatter for their own survival we will have won. Not until. Inform your grandmothers have them share with their bridge partner. It wont be televised, if you have friends that cant turn on the computer, tell them. Everyone must know why. Its very easy to get someone to turn on a pedo. This is why they are trying like hell to make Trump in some way equally horrible and its not possible or believable. Only another pedo can be this bad in peoples eyes. Its unacceptable and reprehensible . they know this. All thats left is the death throws.

       Addiction and appetite doesn't work this way. They will not stop. If you have enough money you can indeed have privacy. With resources and coded symbolism and dedicated rendezvous locations, like Epsteins Island and "Lolita Express" you can
       <em>
        get away with murder!
       </em>
      </p>

       We have the tools, the recently created surveillance state installed after 9-11. Of course they are compromised, infiltrated. It's amazing what people can ignore for MONEY. We need men of integrity to turn the engine of suppression into an evidence gathering, documentation tool. Then we need brave men to gather them up, package them, prison or execution bound, these freaks need to suffer in the full light of day.

       Don't know that Ghandi's being a lawyer was a bad thing let alone "worst" as it was his sharp mind and knowledge of the law the made him effective at throwing off the British rule. We just need some just people to insist and pursue the pedos in and out of power. We need to crash their parties and if need be, crash some skulls as well. The net result should be public trials.
