       I've been very depressed with the state of the world for a while and I've felt hopeless thinking about how asleep people are. When I found this subreddit, it was extremely inspiring and you guys are doing a great thing and I'd like to contribute to it. So what should I be telling people to get them to wake up?

       A good introductory red pill.. Look up "david wheeler sniper".  Why does the fbi have a supposed weapons expert carrying a rifle by the magazine as if it were a suitcase?  Why does this sandy hook sniper look EXACTLY like david wheeler, the grieving father?

       Is the conclusion dependent on the truth of that antecedent?

       That's right, no, it's not.

       The way you convey a point is key. The most you can do is study and research, Knowledge is key! If you present stories in a susceptible way, and can back them up facts, that's all you can do really. A lot of people are not ready to be woken up. Waking up is not an easy process. It will change the persons whole life.

       There is also a sticky of confirmed conspiracy on our side bar.  You can read those and if you find any that average citizen can swallow, show them the proof.  Specifically because then you have evidence to match your claim.

       I like to explain that by questioning something, entertaining the idea, doesn't mean you have to agree. I think people believe if they entertain a 'wacky' idea it makes them crazy by default. No, it's just keeping an open mind and being respectful of differing views.

       People don't like being woken up in a literal sense, they like it just as little in a metaphorical sense. Most people don't even realize they're brainwashed.

       I given this advice here and on
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T
       </a>
       before, but I think it comes down to understanding where the person's coming from before you offer any facts of your own. It almost has to be a one-on-one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, try to probe their worldview to see what they already question. Is it government corruption, money in politics, wealth disparity (this seems to work on the younger generations)? Food security and GMOs, pollution, climate change (whether they think it's real or not, it can be a good starting point)?
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is to see what they already question, and just push that a little deeper. Get them to ask questions they might already be thinking of, but push them further or in directions they might not have considered. You kind of want to "incept" the thoughts, if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, if you're depressed, it's because you're focusing on what's wrong in the world instead of what you're doing to fix it. I know you want to "wake people up," but most people are not going to want to wake up from a peaceful if false dream into a hellish nightmare. That's why so many go back to sleep, and why you're feeling depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Build something in your own community: plant a garden, teach a class on survival or other self-sufficiency skills or learn them yourself, participate in the informal economy. Create the type of life that you can invite people to join in and that they
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to join in. You have to offer a better alternative to what they have, and merely seeing the world for what it is, with all its warts, is not a good enough alternative for most.

       Honestly i was thinking about all this situation today. I'm now more confused than ever before. Before the election it was ok, you read the conspiracies, some you believe but now i dont really understand what is really going on. Maybe we stepped the line guys, maybe we did get paranoid and so involved with the conspiracies that we now see only what we want to see. Maybe we're the ones who fall under an elite propaganda and we play their game. I'm telling you, i don't even know what to think anymore. And all this info lately make my head hurt, is it what i see? Is it not? Did i get played? Many questions but nowhere to go for answers. At the end i get all this info and i dont know if what i'm reading is reality or conspiracy. Then i look for an answer from other people, i come here and agree with almost all the people, who literally feel like i do, then i say let me see what the other side is saying, so i go there and see an extreme opposite view on things. So who the hell is the crazy side? Maybe we have to acknowledge that we lost it guys, and go seek help, or maybe we really see the true light and we should keep the fight to enlightenment. I just dont know anymore, it gets me sick and confused. How long is this going to stay like this? I'm already feeling crazy, if it wasn't for you people that make me think that there's more people like me i would have went to a mental hospital by now. This are signs of schizophrenia and paranoia. Or maybe it became common this days and we're all a bunch of schizophrenic conspiracy theorists...

       You know where i got scared with this? Last week i was reading an argument that earth is flat and i literally had to spend 4 days of full research to debunk the claim. If you take the NASA pictures out and you try to look at the claims with open mind and creativity you will really have a hard time disproving it. Most of pro sphere arguments can literally be as true for flat earth if you are willing to accept a different mechanics of how things work. Finally, i found 2 things that can not be explained based on flat mentality. There was not a clear answer on sun changing size while it moves and also that on sunrise and sunset the sun can be seen lighting the clouds from under. I really shit my pants on this one, it would have rocked my world if i couldn't debunk it. I literally spoke with scientists and begged them to disprove it, but their arguments come from books mostly and conclude to a specific idea because it was either there first or its more widely accepted. Some got really pissed by being asked to debunk this argument. Also i dont take answers easy, i usually look on the other side more just to make sure i am right and i can prove it. So they would give me an explanation and i would say, well the other side claims this, and its possible if you think differently, then they would reject it but say its just absorb to think that way but not provide a full explanation that can make it impossible, so would rate it 50/50 and move on something else. Those are the 2 arguments i believe can't be explained and earth is a sphere :) the NASA pictures you just need to believe because i  did not go to space so i can't say they are 100% real. This is how insane i am right now.....

       Exactly my point. Not only i try to debunk the new stuff but i now have to start over and debunk what i thought was facts. You for example, have you ever really thought that earth is not a sphere? I knew what i learned in school and the various history around the subject but back then i was young, i was very naive, so i thought scientists and the pictures and the books say it is so went with it. Now i said wait a minute, how do i really know that its true? Based on what is happening now everything is game on, so i went psycho on the subject....

       It's the mainstream media and their new tactics of psychological warfare. I'll give you two examples off the top of my head. It's becoming almost a daily occurrence. The first was a snippet on Fox News where they were debating the controversy of Twitter, and Facebook banning what they considered fake news. I won't get into the whole clip. I'm sure you can find it easily on YouTube. In the segment one of the liberal speakers mentioned Alex Jones, called him a liar, and then straight out lied. She said the story of there being paid protesters at the trump rallies was debunked. Even though we have video proof now. What should of been a open and shut case was now being called a lie and the other two people on the show didn't argue with her. This is important. This is controlled oppression. When no one debunks an outright lie people will unconsciously not question it themselves, the elite know people especially Americans have memories and attention spans like goldfish. They exploit this to no ends. (I happen to believe these msm talking heads are CIA trained at manipulating people.) The second example is an article where the New York Times says globalism is a right wing conspiracy made up by Donald Trump. really? I don't even need to get into this one, there is proof of this right in front of us. President Obama was on tv talking about how globalization was in trouble. So you see it's a mind game and you add all the trolls in the comment sections agreeing with the liberal pov or article. There is no doubt it will fuck with your head. It fucks with mine. But you know the facts. They are dying and trying every last trick to keep control. But it's falling apart. Conspiracy theories all end with Wikileaks. Always remember that.

       Agree, everything you said is spot on. I have countless of examples like this also. They happen every day and make me want to bang my head on the wall. You know what blew my mind with the documentary? First is well made and puts facts in a nice timeline. What i liked its when it said about actors in the news and everywhere and techniques they use to make people believe. One of them is crying. Well, 3 days ago i was watching cnn and they put a guy on a live interview and tried to push their usual propaganda. Well that guy seemed very knowledgeable and he started going on the anchor. Then they suddenly went to commercials but when they came back the guy was not there anymore. It pissed me off because i wanted to hear what he had to say. Instead after the commercials they showed a woman who supposedly died, i dont know her, but the anchor cried and said his goodbye whatever and then literally put a smile on and went on to a different interview. It blew my mind that they did that  live and acted so chill when to me was so obvious what they did. So the anchor crying makes sense now, its a fucking book trick.....

       What do I think about Trump? Complete confusion! I went from patriotic, 4th of July enthusiasm. Really, believing things were gonna get better. To being extremely, depressed, wishing the world would end,.It's the goddamn Washington post and New York Times. They keep going on with this narrative that his supporters have been swindled. That he's filling his cabinet with Wall Street, Goldman sacks, and neocons. Then you have the 60 minute interview where he backpedaled on half his campaign. That didn't give me a lot of confidence. I know he hasn't got into office yet and I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt. But Right now, I'm really upset and feel like shit.

       Agree, same here. Not sure what you mean about the 60 minute interview though. I even found that a bit calming he will go thru. As for the administration picks i hope its just picking up independent not controlled people that he can control later on to follow thru with his plans. I did become skeptical too, i really felt he might be the next JFK. It will literally make me loose every single hope i had if he doesnt follow thru, i will literally drop everything and get out, maybe go to fucking Alaska, away from everyone.

       Honestly, it's pointless. People are dumb, don't want to know the truth, and well trained to stay asleep. I was thinking about that when I went to vote. Looking at all the people in line, and thinking about how probably none of them read Wikileaks or had any idea about how the world really works.

       Haven't you heard? Trump has brought in the Post-Truth Age. This means that facts don't count as much as beliefs. So believe what you want, and it becomes real.....for you.

       Agree, same here. Not sure what you mean about the 60 minute interview though. I even found that a bit calming he will go thru. As for the administration picks i hope its just picking up independent not controlled people that he can control later on to follow thru with his plans. I did become skeptical too, i really felt he might be the next JFK. It will literally make me loose every single hope i had if he doesnt follow thru, i will literally drop everything and get out, maybe go to fucking Alaska, away from everyone.
