<p>They&#39;re laying the groundwork for a massive campaign to censor everything on the net - shutting down or blocking access to websites they don&#39;t like, and stifling any speech that exposes or messes with their agenda.</p>

<p>The plot has been in the works for years, but has taken on a new urgency following Trump&#39;s &quot;impossible&quot; election - thanks to the work of &quot;commoners&quot; on the web.</p>

<p>Yes, the &quot;danger&quot; is the threat to their power to manipulate and control the peasantry through a &quot;spell&quot; of coordinated propaganda.</p>

<p>An open internet allows people to communicate in ways that have never been possible before - and the Elite Oligarchs and their political puppets are desperate to put out this &quot;fire&quot;.</p>

<p>New York, NY, May 31, 2016 [Links in original]</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/miscellaneous/adl-and-european-partners-to-expand-cyberhate-tool-to-europe.html">ADL and European Partners to Expand ADL Cyberhate Tool to Europe</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Anti-Defamation League</strong> (ADL), the <strong>European Jewish Congress and European Union of Jewish Students</strong> announced today the expansion for European Internet users of <a href="http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/cyber-safety/c/cyber-safety-action-guide.html#.V02GsfkrLcs">ADL’s Cyber-Safety Action Guide.</a></p>

<p>This announcement follows today’s agreement among leading Internet companies, including <strong>Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft</strong>, and the European Commission on a <strong><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/files/hate_speech_code_of_conduct_en.pdf">“Code of Conduct” to address online hate speech</a></strong>. [WARNING: PDF LINK]</p>

<p>“The Code of Conduct announced today closely tracks <strong><a href="http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/cyber-safety/best-practices/#.V02HJ_krLct">ADL’s Best Practices for Responding to Cyberhate</a></strong>, originally released in 2014, following months of discussions and deliberations by an industry Working Group on Cyberhate convened by ADL,” said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. “Empowering users to better report hate speech is an integral part of these efforts, and we look forward to working with EJC and EUJS to bring our Cyber-Safety Action Guide to Europe.”</p>

<p><strong>ADL’s Cyber-Safety Action Guide features tabs where visitors may access information on submitting complaints and reporting hate speech to the major U.S.-based online companies, including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter</strong>.  The ADL resource provides quick links to each company’s cyber-bullying and harassment policies and terms of service, as well as links directly to online complaint forms.  It is currently available in English and in Spanish.</p>

<p>More Stink at the Link.</p>

<p><strong>This article is months old</strong>, so we see that US companies like Twitter, Google, YouTube Facebook, Microsoft and MANY others have been quietly conspiring with the <strong>ADL</strong> and its international counterparts to launch this massive censorship campaign for well over a year.</p>

<p>NOW, some would argue that the ADL is harmless - that its heart is pure and its only desire is to protect us all - <em>especially minorities</em> - from &quot;HATE&quot;. </p>

<p>To that I would respond: <strong>BULLSHIT</strong>. The ADL is a Zionist front organization. In the 1990&#39;s it was BUSTED for SPYING on dozens of US organizations, politicians and other individuals and groups on the behalf of racist state of Israel and Apartheid South Africa. The LA Times documented the events as they unfolded. See some of these articles in their archive -  <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/roy-bullock"><strong>HERE</strong></a> and <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/tom-gerard"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p>

<p>This is the group that is presently working in the US and Europe to CENSOR all speech, and to shut down and SHUT UP any news, opinion or commentary that contradicts their own racist agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly - by spreading the word, informing as many people as possible.</p>

<p>But it would have to be done very quickly - because before long speaking of such things will be forbidden - and its is difficult to warn people of a threat when speaking of the threat will get you silenced.</p>

<p>Also, when the US entered Europe during WW2, did we identify enemy by name? Did we say that we need to fight <strong>THE NAZIS</strong> or did pussy foot around, saying shit like <em>&quot;we need to go fight in Europe because some Europeans are bad guys&quot;</em>...?</p>

<p>If this is to be fought successfully, the organizers and leaders MUST be identified for WHO they are and the agenda that they represent - and simply identifying them AS such would undoubtedly get one ATTACKED as a racist/bigot/Nazi or WHATEVER - and THAT THREAT ALONE will frighten most people into silence.</p>

<p>So, is there anything that can be done to stop this? You tell me.</p>

<p>Not much at stake, really. Only the First Amendment - the cornerstone of Liberty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So are you saying we are defined by our benevolence toward government? Waking up to a systemic problem is not the same as giving up. Its understanding where our energy is misplaced after realizing what something truly is. Government has been and always will be a system of control. That&#39;s not giving up, that&#39;s waking up. Maybe you are not ready to realize that yet.</p>

<p>Did you know that everyone that runs for congress who wants funding has to sign the AIPAC Treaty? Its a pledge of allegiance to a foreign country. Israel also happens to be war criminals since the are violated the 4th Geneva convention due to the collective punishment they are imposing on Palestinians on the Gaza Strip. That makes everyone in congress a war criminal and all laws passed by any of them null and void. The problem is bigger than you can imagine and its not going to be solved by putting new people in office.</p>

<p>You need to look at this like a business. We are the owners and these people are employees. The company has been taking over by corrupt employees. You can&#39;t hire more employees to replace the corrupt ones because all employees now answer to a criminal mafia that sits behind the scenes telling everyone what to do. If they don&#39;t do what this mafia wants they&#39;re either killed or forced out of the company.</p>

<p>The best course of action at this point would be to dissolve the company and regroup since its doing more harm than good. Then maybe establish a new system that isnt so easily manipulated.</p>

<p>Stop thinking like an employee and start thinking like an owner. This isnt a game where there are winners and losers. That&#39;s social conditioning talking right there. They convinced you that if you give up you will lose. It doesn&#39;t work like that. There&#39;s only the people that feel they have choice and the people that feel they dont have choice. The people that feel they have choice know better not to support something that makes them party to a crime, and then there are the people that dont feel they have a choice that go along with it because its the only thing they know how to do. </p>

<p>which group do you want to be in?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never said we are defined by our benevolence towards govt. Nothing even close. I said a great man can inspire others. We need to blow the system up I think, if Trump can&#39;t right the ship (not fix it mind you).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with a lot of what you said above, I was making a point before. I&#39;m not for this corrupt government, but lets give a businessman coming in a chance. We still have a partially functional government, that is thoroughly corrupted.</p>

<p>So, let Trump the Businessman do what he can do. Society is way far from being able to run itself as they have been dumbed down. It is going to take some time to get there but I agree with your premise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Its not hard to know, its easy. You just dont want to face the truth like 99% of the rest of people because you have been conditioned to second guess your own intuition. Thats how the control system works. It disempowers you by making you think that your range of responses will hurt your chances. Thats exactley what a slave on a plantation would say. You are acting like a slave.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if you think you got it figured out and give in</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re repeating yourself and wasting my time. I already responded this.
When we choose to stop playing the game we dissolve the facade of presumed authority over us. <strong>To destroy a lie, you have to live the truth. Regardless of what you might think will happen.</strong> Its called waking up. You dont help the establishment by withdrawing consent, you starve it of what it needs most, Legitimacy. Its vulnerable to that because it requires our continued co-operation for it to maintain that illusion.</p>

<p>Dont get me wrong, its most definitely going to get worse before it gets better.</p>

<p>Calling it &quot;giving in&quot; is conditioning from society that you have allowed yourself to become subjected to. Learn to think for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro, you are the one that said this is called &quot;Giving in&quot;. That is not what this is. its a self-knowledge that you need to come to on your own. Until you do, you will be looking to other people to  tell you what to do. &quot;Giving in&quot; is societies way of saying that we cant give in. Its a misunderstanding of nature the of self-empowerment. I know because I have studied this and put this into practice in my life and have seen the results. </p>

<p>I have said everything I need to say on this. If you dont want to see the truth in it, and make choices that empower you, fine. But don&#39;t talk to me if you dont have anything positive to say that is going to move us forward with out subjecting us to more of the same tyranny thats happening now. its common sense not to support tyranny. Basic simple knowledge that everybody should know. Dont act like you cant know this. Dont blind yourself.</p>

<p>No matter how bad things appear, we still don&#39;t know what will happen. Things don&#39;t look good, I agree there. Just the final outcome is unknown.

    <div class="md"><p>We are part of each other, not part of a larger system. Systems are tools, they either serve or harm us based on our awareness or lack of. Systems can also destroy us when we dont recognize  when its time to let go of them and form new systems and relationships that serve us.</p>

<p>Im not even talking about how things look. The final out come is based on our decisions, we are directly responsible for the outcome. Holding off until something happens isnt going to change anything. Putting trust in a system that is controlled by outside forces that are not aligned with love and respect of all mankind is a terrible tragedy. Everybody needs to take a stand on that, right now and refuse to support it. Thats how you make a difference. You let people know what you stand for. That brings strength, not looking to the ruling class to make things better, its never going to work its been like that for hundreds of years and the people that know better are tired of listening to people that think a new presidency is going to bring change. STOP MISLEADING PEOPLE AND START ACTING ON WHAT YOU KNOW IS TRUE.</p>

<p>Love is important, but expressing that love, self-love though awareness and knowledge  and acting on that knowledge for yourself and others is more important than words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. All MSM news is scrpted to the big lie plan and mostly ignores telling actual news. They believe they create reality with the script, as the election showed it hasn&#39;t been working lately.
There have recently been changes in default settings that allow for example firefox to block &quot;dangerous and deceptive content&quot;, In order to uncheck this you have to also uncheck block dangerous downloads and warn me about dangerous downloads. So to get the last two you must agree to censorship. This is happenning now realtime and there is other evidence that censorship has ramped up considerably since election finished</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I have seen rise of weird mainstream media propaganda method that has not been heavily documented on alterntive-media communities... I call it counter-propaganda... When alternative thinkers or researchers discover an scandal that usually is not talked about by mainstream media, then after some while mainstream media fabricates like counter-propaganda which basicaly says that someone did the same thing, but in this case mainstream media uses it the candidate that they smear not the candidate that they defend and who&#39;s scandals they are silent about.</p>

<p>For example few days before so called &#39;Trump audio sex-talk tape&#39; was released, just few days before that folks here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and other alternative communities found out more info related to Bill Clinton rape scandals and other similiar scandals from Clinton side and boom, just few days after that so called &#39;Trump tape&#39; gets released.</p>

<p>I even noticed another sick method of this in my country&#39;s mainstream media. Basically they said that Trump supporting sides tried to influence the election result by information techniques and etc... Which is pretty much what the other side that mainstream media defends has tried to do all the time...</p>

<p>My theory is that they do this so in that case when someone of us tries to enlighten a sheeple with info that we have found on our side, so the mainstream media-believer reacts like: &#39;Hey isn&#39;t that what Donald Trump/someone/someone2/etc did? So that it is harder to get them out of the deinformation loop/cycle...</p>

<p>I hope that someone read this as I have feeling like I am onto a new propaganda pattern... Someone needs to do more research on this!!</p>

<p>If ever there was an appropriate time to use the logically fallacious &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument, this is it. This is terrifying. The government is literally telling the American Public that we are too stupid to verify information, aren&#39;t they so nice to do it for us?</p>

<p>So let&#39;s speculate for a moment and assume Facebook might borrow technology from Google&#39;s fact checking system. Google announced they would be highlighting articles in the future using the HTML markup system ClaimReview which will be supported by the International Fact Checking Network developed by Poynter.</p>

<p>The grants funding this &quot;fact checking&quot; system originate from the National Endowment for Democracy, which is primarily funded through congressional appropriations and State Department grants.</p>

<p>Abstract: the government will quite literally be deciding what news is fake and what news is real. At least Russia is upfront about state funded media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>who s in charge of this nonsense? i dont fuckin know, he&#39;s probably an ugly bastard...but it also seems he is absolutely not allowed to mention one word of pizzagate. Maybe this push for control of the info bottleneck is essentially a checkmark on their list of insurance requirements. Like in your car insurance policy &quot;only the person named in this policy is covered...&quot; etc. If all the scums implicated in industrialized child abuse were known to the public, all hell would break loose. So, NDA everyone and everything to oblivion, including vast swaths of the fuk un internet, and everything&#39;s &quot;kosher&quot;! The cover story is preposterous, and the real story is that, totally disgusting, and illegal if investigators are given access to evidence. If any implicated official is questioned, their lawyer can say &quot;these sources have been floated around fake news, so inadmissible&quot; and the croney paid off judge slams the gavel</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen. It&#39;s weird that this all started after Clinton lost and the mainstream media turned out to be grossly wrong about the outcome and everything. And now Trump followers and nationalists are being banned from Twitter while Islamic extremist groups on Twitter stay. </p>

<p>And the mainstream media narrative has been back in full force, nitpicking and crying with hysteria at everything dealing with Trump. And it was Trump who was praising Wikileaks and Assange and now Assange suddenly goes missing. </p>

<p>Yes, the &quot;danger&quot; is the threat to their power to manipulate and control the peasantry through a &quot;spell&quot; of coordinated propaganda.</p>

<p>An open internet allows people to communicate in ways that have never been possible before - and the Elite Oligarchs and their political puppets are desperate to put out this &quot;fire&quot;.</p>

<p>They have EVERYTHING to lose.</p>
