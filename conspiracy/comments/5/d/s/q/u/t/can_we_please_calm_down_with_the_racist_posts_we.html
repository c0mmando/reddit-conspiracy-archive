There is indeed a conspiracy to get rid of the white race through means of decreased birthrates, immigration, miscegeny promotion in the media, and many other means.

<p>In testimony in front of the Senate in March, Holder, who is now the U.S. attorney general, seemed to lament the position government enforcers had found themselves in. “I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if we do prosecute — if we do bring a criminal charge — it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.” - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/magazine/only-one-top-banker-jail-financial-crisis.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be clear, the decision of whether to indict a corporation, defer prosecution, or decline altogether is not one that I, or anyone in the Criminal Division, take lightly.  We are frequently on the receiving end of presentations from defense counsel, CEOs, and economists who argue that the collateral consequences of an indictment would be devastating for their client.  In my conference room, over the years, I have heard sober predictions that a company or bank might fail if we indict, that innocent employees could lose their jobs, that entire industries may be affected, and even that global markets will feel the effects.  Sometimes – though, let me stress, not always – these presentations are compelling.  In reaching every charging decision, we must take into account the effect of an indictment on innocent employees and shareholders, just as we must take into account the nature of the crimes committed and the pervasiveness of the misconduct.  I personally feel that it’s my duty to consider whether individual employees with no responsibility for, or knowledge of, misconduct committed by others in the same company are going to lose their livelihood if we indict the corporation.  In large multi-national companies, the jobs of tens of thousands of employees can be at stake.  And, in some cases, the health of an industry or the markets are a real factor.  Those are the kinds of considerations in white collar crime cases that literally keep me up at night, and which must play a role in responsible enforcement. - <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-lanny-breuer-speaks-new-york-city-bar-association">http://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-lanny-breuer-speaks-new-york-city-bar-association</a></p>

<p>Criminal proceedings were brought against Wachovia, though not against any individual, but the case never came to court. In March 2010, Wachovia settled the biggest action brought under the US bank secrecy act, through the US district court in Miami. Now that the year&#39;s &quot;deferred prosecution&quot; has expired, the bank is in effect in the clear. It paid federal authorities $110m in forfeiture, for allowing transactions later proved to be connected to drug smuggling, and incurred a $50m fine for failing to monitor cash used to ship 22 tons of cocaine.</p>

<p>More shocking, and more important, the bank was sanctioned for failing to apply the proper anti-laundering strictures to the transfer of $378.4bn – a sum equivalent to one-third of Mexico&#39;s gross national product – into dollar accounts from so-called casas de cambio (CDCs) in Mexico, currency exchange houses with which the bank did business.</p>

<p>&quot;Wachovia&#39;s blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations,&quot; said Jeffrey Sloman, the federal prosecutor. Yet the total fine was less than 2% of the bank&#39;s $12.3bn profit for 2009. On 24 March 2010, Wells Fargo stock traded at $30.86 – up 1% on the week of the court settlement.</p>

<p>The conclusion to the case was only the tip of an iceberg, demonstrating the role of the &quot;legal&quot; banking sector in swilling hundreds of billions of dollars – the blood money from the murderous drug trade in Mexico and other places in the world – around their global operations, now bailed out by the taxpayer. - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/03/us-bank-mexico-drug-gangs</a></p>

<p>NEW YORK — British banking giant HSBC agreed to pay a record $1.92 billion settlement Tuesday after a broad investigation by U.S. federal and state authorities found the bank violated federal laws by laundering money from Mexican drug trafficking and processing banned transactions on behalf of Iran, Libya, Sudan and Burma .</p>

<p>The settlement, a combination of forfeitures and civil penalties, shows the London-headquartered financial powerhouse for years deliberately channeled hundreds of millions of dollars of the prohibited transactions through its U.S. arm.</p>

<p>&quot;HSBC is being held accountable for stunning failures of oversight — and worse — that led the bank to permit narcotics traffickers and others to launder millions of dollars through HSBC subsidiaries, and to facilitate hundreds of millions more in transactions with sanctioned countries,&quot; said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer in announcing the largest settlement of its kind.</p>

<p>&quot;The record of dysfunction that prevailed at HSBC for many years was astonishing,&quot; said Breuer.</p>

<p>HSBC shares were up 0.5% to $51.82 in afternoon trading Tuesday. The shares also traded higher in London.</p>

<p>&quot;Obviously, $1.9 billion is a very large number, but it&#39;s very manageable&quot; without affecting HSBC&#39;s bottom line, said Ian Gordon, head of bank research for Investec Securities in London. &quot;It&#39;s clearly within market expectations.&quot; - <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/12/11/hsbc-laundering-probe/1760351/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/12/11/hsbc-laundering-probe/1760351/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys this is just anecdotal. But I&#39;m Black. And literally my friends and family was just talking about this the other day. A lot of us notice that the media is using decisive language both online and in news media. People are buying into this shit and you don&#39;t know how frustrating it is to read every where I look &quot;Blacks are so dangerous, they hate white people etc. Nobody benifits from us being divided more than the elites. Look to slavery where we were HEAVILY divided. The rich elite made a fuck ton of money. So did they in the civil rights era. </p>

<p>Crime is the lowest it has been in a generation. It is not on the increase, so why within the last year or so have we been seeing all this divisive rhetoric? Police are also safer then they&#39;ve been in a generation (look it up). But the media is making everyone think that it&#39;s BLM and Black people in general vs the Police when it&#39;s not. They are trying to make it seem like Black people are killing more cops than ever, when they are literally at their safest levels right now. Just research for yourself. Relations were a lot worse about 20 years ago. Even 10 years ago.</p>

<p>I think they are planning something big, and they need to court the nation to fight and divide. We really need to come together and unite.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let them make you afraid of me. I am human just as you are. From my looks, usually in a blue hoodie and headphones, you wouldn&#39;t know that I&#39;m a college instructor and working on my dissertation. You would probably just peg me as &quot;statistically more violent than you.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m kinda tipsy right now as I just got back from a mid-day mixer. But I can tell you that I notice when I go on a walk and people lock the doors as I go pass their car. Or that I listen to students argue about how Black protesters are terrorist, but not the heavily white crowds that block traffic for environmental purposes or that literally arm themselves like in Oregon, or how I legit heard someone say that America would be a better place if all the Black people left, and then defend it by saying he isn&#39;t racist (what will qualify as racist then?) as he has a Black friend and I don&#39;t really &quot;act Black&quot;. </p>

<p>We have different personalities just like white people do. We bleed the same blood, and die from the same poison. </p>

<p>Can we just fucking get the fuck along and live life together? And focus on the ones with the real power to harm us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like a rational person, but shit like this is also part of the problem. &quot;Don&#39;t let them make you afraid of me&quot; Seriously, who the fuck does this. Where have you even heard anything close to this except maybe on Fox or from people in comments? The majority of the shit being pushed is that white people/cops are racist greedy fucks who will pay the lowest bidder to shoot minorities so that we can keep our property values up. And then 1 comment slips through to mainstream media that is maybe slightly critical of black people and everyone acts like that is the real problem. It&#39;s not. We have a fucking black president. Guys, get the fuck over it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I can tell you that I notice when I go on a walk and people lock the doors as I go pass their car. Or that I listen to students argue about how Black protesters are terrorist, but not the heavily white crowds that block traffic for environmental purposes or that literally arm themselves like in Oregon, or how I legit heard someone say that America would be a better place if all the Black people left, and then defend it by saying he isn&#39;t racist (what will qualify as racist then?) as he has a Black friend and I don&#39;t really &quot;act Black&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guess what, people lock their doors if anyone is walking around near their cars. It&#39;s not cuz youre black. And all the rest of the shit you said, that shit was said all over that the Oregon people are terrorists, same with the pipline protestors. Stop hearing only what you want to hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><del>Ok. Im not going to argue with you (person who is most likely not black) over this.</del></p>

<p>Editing this comment because it did seem childish and without context.</p>

<p>Also editing because multiple people are saying similar (valid) things and because it wouldn&#39;t be worth to go through every single comment for the same answer. I have gotten into many debates on reddit over race an not one single one have gotten anywhere. </p>

<p>The response above is someone that was trying to invalidate what I was saying by saying it happens to everyone. 
I stop using my old account because when ever I tried to explain something about race it never got anywhere, and people would spam my inbox etc for me to respond. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think a debate only anecdotal evidence will get anywhere. It&#39;s just you&#39;re right and I&#39;m wrong from both sides. Now if someone wants to get into an argument over how racism isn&#39;t real, where we can look to facts and statistics and objective statements rather relying on personal experience. </p>

<p>I also never debate just to prove myself &quot;right&quot; and that is something that annoys me on reddit, that people literally will reject everything you say for the sake of having an argument and being &quot;right&quot;, and not have any intention on changing their minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait.. so just wait. I upvoted your original comment, and then I upvoted this comment because I thought you both made really valid points.</p>

<p>Are you actually just not going to discuss your differences with this person because of their race? You said &quot;I&#39;m not going to argue with you (person who is most likely not black) over this.&quot; </p>

<p>So it&#39;s not worth explaining your point to people who aren&#39;t black? Judging from your original comment, one would think you would encourage conversation between black people and those of other races- as a way of furthering your point and helping to increase this idea of unity which you hold so highly.</p>

<p>This sounds really salty/racist or whatever, but you can&#39;t honestly tell me in good conscious that you will deny a debate with a person depending on their race. Surely you understand how you just made your original point invalid through that sentiment. Either that or you just don&#39;t understand what you are trying to convey.</p>

<p>I am white so I won&#39;t be offended if you choose to ignore my comment. I am not black, after all. Why should you expect my inferior mind to comprehend your words? It&#39;s just not logical, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apology accepted. I am confused about your edit though. Your anecdotal evidence was cancelled about by anecdotal evidence which you are right, neither can be proven. We can both agree racism is real. My point though was that racism is blamed more times than it actually should, and that also mainstream racism is nowhere near pointed towards black people.</p>

<p>This was your original question:</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really answer this because it&#39;s kind of a dumb question that answers itself. What&#39;s to be gained financially? Idk maybe...finances! Alongside receiving lots of funds from Saudis (who have already at least once fucked over America) Jack Dorsey is also known to heavily support Deray McCocksucker who is as close to a leader of the BLM movement as there could be. Which as we know, BLM is all about racial tension. </p>

<p>You really need to ask? Reddit, Facebook, CNN, etc</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think they are prejudiced against white people? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious paying attention to any mainstream media source that everybody including white people are prejudiced against white people. Ever hear the term white guilt? Ever just browse the front page of Reddit? Every visit Facebook? Ever  just speak to anyone ever? White people are lame, greedy, racist, oppressive, etc etc. </p>

<p>So whether through malicious reasons or just plain retardation, they definitely are prejudiced against white people. And that&#39;s not even to mention all the trending hashtags that they censor to favor whatever the identity politics movement of the week is.</p>

<p>I kind of answered your questions but I also kind of weaved around them because you really should just read around in this thread or this subreddit. Your original comment is shit regardless</p>

<p>lmao so wait.. you think everybody, including white people, are prejudiced against white people? Putting aside the mainstream media having an agenda, which they very well might, you then go on to mention the front page of Reddit, &quot;Facebook&quot; (any particular page, or all of Facebook is prejudiced?), and then ask if I have &quot;spoken to anyone ever&quot;, as if that would somehow be proof that everyone is racist against white people? Holy fucking shit, this is exactly what I was talking about.  Are you sure you&#39;re not schizophrenic? Because you are drawing wild unsubstantiated conclusions based on very limited correlative data.  </p>

<p>The only thing here that is shit is your deductive reasoning.  Provide <em>actual</em> details and evidence, or you come off sounding like some foaming at the mouth retard yelling at people at the bus stop.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like having a discussion about quantum physics and someone comes in and wants an explanation for why 2+2 = 4. Excuse me for not having the patience to spoon feed you when again</p>

<p>Also, only a true fucking retard gets hung up over the use of everybody. Anyone who isn&#39;t autistic knows that it doesn&#39;t literally mean EVERYBODY. It doesn&#39;t literally mean 100% of people.  I&#39;m sorry that me questioning if you&#39;ve ever spoken to anyone has triggered you. I know not everyone is capable of social situations.</p>

<p>If I come off as a foaming at the mouth retard yelling at people at the bus stop, you come off as the junkie whore trying to seduce people into fucking you for $20 and then seriously questioning them when they turn you down.</p>

<p>Dude, just read all the replies here to you from other people. The consensus is that you&#39;re an idiot that is asking other people to spoon-feed you information because you can&#39;t rationally think for yourself.

You labour under these tags that were created and perpetuated to divide you. The President is mixed race. Half white - half black. But the twisted idea of ethnicity that&#39;s been imposed on America won&#39;t even let you appreciate how influential his collective ancestry has been on his life. In the same way that exposure to the collective ancestry of the world has made melting pots like the US and England the ambassadors to the world.

<p>Question? Yes, it has lead me to question their motives. Has it proved anything about them? No.  See, you don&#39;t seem to understand the concept that the greater the claim you are making the more evidence is required to convince someone of it.  You are suggesting that there is an agenda to wipe out white people en masse and yet you scoff at the idea of having to provide more evidence to support it than other more plausible, less fantastical theories.  Why is that?</p>

<p>And making assumptions that I will not heed &#39;a thousand more examples&#39; is born out of doubt on your own behalf of what you are saying.  If you really believed what you were haucking, you would not give up so easily.</p>

<p>The quote at the end is a nice touch, but again, if you want me to think that that somehow is indicative of a massive plot to eliminate an entire race, you&#39;re going to need more <em>compelling evidence</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Posts about blacks and muslims will divide us</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re not posts about race or bigotry, or &quot;blacks and Muslims&quot;, they&#39;re posts about the <strong><em>blatant hypocrisy and bias</em></strong> in the way that the policies of Twitter are being implemented. </p>

<p>This bias is <strong><em>not</em></strong> happening by accident, and you will soon be seeing similarly biased and heavy-handed censorship in places like Google, Facebook, and across the net in general.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that this coincides with the propaganda blitz attacking so-called <strong><em>&quot;fake news&quot;</em></strong> websites - again, no coincidence. </p>

<p>This is all part of a highly coordinated <strong>assault on the First Amendment</strong>: The strategy is to use private companies - social media, search engines, ISP&#39;s, and web hosting companies - to enact heavy censorship on the public - especially in the US. </p>

<p>This has been the goal of certain groups for decades. They repeatedly tried - and failed - to impose censorship through legislation. Now they are circumventing the First Amendment by convincing/coercing <strong>private companies</strong> to modify and enforce their <strong><em>Terms of Service</em></strong> policies to achieve the same effect: CENSORSHIP.</p>

<p><strong>Divide and Conquer?</strong> Yes, that is also one of their primary goals.</p>

<p>Your headline:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Can we please calm down with the racist posts?</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By asserting that the posts are &quot;racist&quot;, you&#39;re not helping. Unconsciously, you&#39;re falling right into with their Divide and Conquer trap, and adding fuel to the fire and stoking the hate further.</p>

<p>Think of illegal dog fights. The dogs themselves have no natural animus toward another, rather, THEIR HANDLERS force them into a situation where BOTH feel threatened, and they are taunted and goaded until they become ENRAGED - tearing one another to shreds.</p>

<p>Who &quot;wins&quot;? THE HANDLERS, not the dogs.</p>

<p>If  you want to stop this thing, drop the &quot;racist&quot; bullshit and do your best to let <strong>everyone</strong> know that we are ALL being played against one another.</p>

I mean, I fucking hate Bush, but at least you know what you&#39;re getting when you elect a Bush.
