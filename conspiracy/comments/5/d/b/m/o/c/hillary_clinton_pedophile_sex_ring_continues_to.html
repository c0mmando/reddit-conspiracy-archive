    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe this at all. I think the sources in the NYPD and FBI are probably reliable, but I think Comey is trying to squash this. He sends a letter to congress stating that the evidence uncovered by the NYPD is pertinent to the e-mail case. They seize all the evidence from the NYPD. Then, a week later, they say there&#39;s nothing incriminating in the e-mails. It seems like they basically took whatever evidence the NYPD had to sit on it. </p>

<p>I will eat a shoe if it turns out Comey is actually trying to make a case here. It seems to me that he&#39;s part of the cover up. I&#39;m sure he and a lot of others inside law enforcement know just how far this scandal would go if it broke, and I&#39;m almost certain he&#39;s trying to minimize the damage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is not part of the coverup... The &quot;email server&quot; was a smokescreen to publicly show the justice system wasn&#39;t playing nice. He wrapped up a perfect case in a bow and Lynch dismissed it... And the whole world saw that. </p>

<p>It seems like he dismissed all the stuff in the email server... but really what he said was &quot;our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.&quot; Either referencing how it would be political/literal suicide at this point... or how the specifics of her handling the email server were so minor compared to what he was secretly working on that it would be silly to bother with... Like a parking ticket for a schoolyard shooter. </p>

<p>HRC&#39;s blackberry setup is chump change compared to the arms dealing and shady shit he heard from all the people that he gave immunity to. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent hours poring over Comey&#39;s words and actions... and tthis guy is a straight shooter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of her supporters are <em>still</em> living in a bubble. I can&#39;t say that Donald Trump is in any sane way a good candidate for president, but, amazingly, <em>he</em> is the lesser of two evils. Hard for many people to wrap their heads around, but I think still worth getting the word out. If there is a prosecution, I want people to be ready for it. I can already predict the rhetoric from the other side, &quot;This is just a witch-hunt!&quot;</p>

<p>Clinton supporters: open your eyes. People have been telling you the Clintons are sociopaths <em>for decades</em>, and it wasn&#39;t just the &quot;right wing loonies&quot;. Time to take off the blinkers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not even their fault though. Every major news outlet besides fox has dismissed the emails entirely.

    <div class="md"><p>I am guilty of it too, and to be honest it really took me subscribing to the_donald throughout the election to see it.  Granted, they are extremely biased as well, but once I began seeing how blatantly dishonest the major media outlets were being towards him, especially in regards to Wikileaks, I realized what what was going on.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve red pilled a few friends with the Soros/Podesta emails from wikileaks , but it&#39;s extremely difficult to get people to see it on any large scale because the major media isn&#39;t confirming any of it and that&#39;s who they trust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is nearly impossible to get someone to support Trump once they have made up their mind... but it is really easy to make them downright disgusted at HRC and her cronies. Before the election I don&#39;t think I got anyone to vote Trump... but I got a lot to not vote for HRC... and thats all that was needed. </p>

<p>The media is realizing they need to straighten up... anti-Trump bias is sliding away... Hell... I know a few people that had never even heard Trump speak aside from the &quot;grab the pussy&quot; soundbytes... and they were blown away by his speech on election night because they hadn&#39;t been allowed to see him talk before... </p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to redpill anyone right off the bat... just let em know HRC was selling our weapons and secrets... and taking a lot of bribes.  Thats all ya need to start opening eyes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine what could happen if certain classified material got in the wrong hands. This info was on a LAPTOP, something that could easily be forgotten in a cab or coffee shop. Intent is irrelevant; look at how carelessness led to Huma, Weiner, and Clinton&#39;s maid all getting access to classified information.</p>

<p>She was said to have special access programs that list, for example, the locations of missile silos.</p>

<p>And the names of spies working undercover, which would mean their death if it got out.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been rumored that the stuff on Weiner&#39;s laptop would be enough for several nations to declare war on us, although the exact reasons were not stated. But use your imagination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the same feeling when I am reading or listening to him.  The big thing is in watching the hearing about the email server alone Comey does not get rattled.  He has some pretty nasty shit hurled at him but he just takes it and stays calm. What he does do is provide more information and try to continue to explain his perspective.  I admire that.  It is actually signs of a great communicator.</p>

<p>I have my doubts about him given his past but people around him say he is a straight shooter.  I think we wait and see what happens.  I think it is also possible the evidence that was pulled from Weiner&#39;s computer may not have changed the email server investigation but instead be used for something much more serious.</p>

<p>hugest and still, after losing the election, powerful political machines.</p>

<p>At this point, I would doubt that. Bill was impeached, Hillary has been defeated twice, Chelsea has no desire to run for office and, even if she did, she started investigating the Clinton machine herself. The Clinton dynasty is over. With the emails, the failed campaign, the impeachment, health issues, etc I don&#39;t think they can resurrect this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the Clinton&#39;s don&#39;t have hundreds of millions dollars, they don&#39;t know everyone&#39;s secrets, or have political allies stretching the entire planet. Hillary may not run again, but she still has political and financial debts to pay. You think the companies and lobbyist that spent millions are simply going to give up and stop pressuring her to do w/e it takes to get the legislation they want?</p>

<p>You must think being Impeached means something much worse than it is. Being impeached simply brings formal questioning, and if you&#39;ll remember Bill was acquitted by the senate. And even if he wasn&#39;t, who really gives a shit if he got a bj from some nobody. </p>

<p>Comey is probably a good guy that wants to do his job as well as he can and suddenly, your superiors, HRC and Obama, are the most evil people on earth. What do you do? </p>

<p>He did what was needed to be done - he created enough attention so she couldn&#39;t win the election without spilling what is potentially very damaging information. Fuck, I know that so many people would go berzerk if they knew what these people have done.</p>

<p>His strategy is this: Act like you are still subordinated to the POTUS (Obama). You sign that document freeing HRC from charges, but you make damn sure that the damage has been done. The beast is bleeding. You know that Trump will come and most probably, drain the fucking swap. </p>

<p>After Trump is president, and there is an uncorrupted system of justice and prosecuters... then, you start investigating again. And then, you put HRC behind bars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A honeypot attracts attention. Say, hacker intrusion attempts, and records them. Often for prosecutions. It&#39;s like entrapment. So, in this case, I&#39;d argue the publicity around government run satanic pedophilia rings is primarily to attract anti-government activists and record who they are. Those most active might find themselves tricked into downloading child pornography. In which case, they either get busted or compromised. </p>

<p>Which doesn&#39;t argue that intelligence agencies wouldn&#39;t use child prostitution to compromise powerful executives or elected officials. Because they also do that. Only that these citizen investigated satanic pedophilia scandals are likely promoted by law enforcement and the intelligence agencies too. Because COINTELPRO. </p>

<p>I want to start by thanking the FBI employees who did remarkable work in this case. Once you have a better sense of how much we have done, you will understand why I am so grateful and proud of their efforts.</p>

<p>I know there were many opinions expressed by people who were not part of the investigation—including people in government—but none of that mattered to us. Opinions are irrelevant, and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation, because we did the investigation the right way. Only facts matter, and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way. I couldn’t be prouder to be part of this organization.</p>

And they chose her opponent as the lesser evil (they probably have some dirt on Trump to control him, but it probably isn&#39;t as bad as Hillary&#39;s; she is after all a security liability for the USA as proven by her illegal use of a private server to send classified info).

<p>Comey has much more than 40 on his side... They have whole new FBI buildings populated with &quot;Untouchables&quot;... I&#39;ve been calling them white knights. The Clinton email server was a way to stress test the justice system and flush out the corrupt... a smokescreen to keep the foundation off balance while he analysed her playbook to cockblock every move they had planned... and I think they had a lot of nasty contingency plans. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also toss in the mix that Weiner might have had CP taken from facebook via the NSA... or evidence photos of sexual abuse/CP from federal court cases. </p>

It would take an operation of the grandest scale to end this corruption... and I&#39;d assume they have been working for a very long time to end it... the evil is vastly outnumbered and their confidence has turned to complacency. Comey is the frontman for destroying the whole evil empire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, Satanic paedophiles are the fevered fantasies of some religious folks with some overactive imaginations? America has seen the Satanic Panic a few times over the course of the 20th century, the overwhelming majority of which was made up.</p>

<p>The problem with a repressive culture shot through with paranoia is that this stuff tends to float up fairly often and I&#39;m sorry to say it&#39;s often bullshit.</p>

<p>Zero.</p>

<p>They use that as evidence that he was in on it... He wasn&#39;t even aware of the satanism until his time in the FBI was over and he was investigating The Finders as a PI. </p>

<p>By that logic I am also a Satanist because I have never arrested one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk Nessie seems to be pretty much disproven at this point. If nothing else, she&#39;s dead. There are not many large creatures with such small habitats that survive 1500 years. Not saying it&#39;s impossible, just improbable. Very little evidence, very few photos, almost no videos, most have been debunked. </p>

<p>&quot;Bigfoot&quot; on the other hand has been photographed/videotaped many times, in many different geographic areas. He&#39;s much smaller, so able to subsist on a much more limited diet in his local area. I&#39;m more keen to believe in a smallish apelike creature that has been able to survive for many many years in relative isolation. After all, there are around 100 uncontacted tribes of humans around the world (that we know about, and most only recently). It&#39;s gonna be a lot harder to hide a tribe of a couple hundred people than it is an almost-extinct animal population. Didn&#39;t we recently find a dog breed that was thought to be extinct in Australia?</p>

<p>The context was during testimony Trey Gowdy expressed that he felt Comey was fucking up and dishonoring the FBI. Comey busted out that line...</p>

<p>The WWIII implications are my own theory based on overwhelming amounts of information... I think these riots in the streets were just one tiny part of a huge plan to destabilize the US and force us into nuclear war with Russia... and Comey and his homies have thus far averted the largest parts of the pre-planned disasters. He just has to play his cards very very very very closely to his chest until everything is on lockdown. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am mostly on the same track with you. yet i just can&#39;t buy that Comey is somehow on &quot;our&quot; side, or on the constitutions side instead of TPTB. there hasn&#39;t been a single action taken (in the public view) that anything is being done about any of this.</p>

<p>my concern boils down to &quot;this was done by pros, in the right way&quot;, which could mean that they&#39;re just scrubbing and vacuuming ALL OF IT and writing history as it fits them. or are they actually working 25/7 on catching this whole pedo/occult scheme, cause it sure as fuck goes up to rotschilds/rockerellers/whoeverellers who own the banks. 
or are they working their asses off to pin this shit on minimal number of people (HRC huma wiener would be my go-to scapegoats).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is focused on the email server... And thats the way the FBI needed it. They don&#39;t announce that they are in the middle of an ongoing investigation. Nobody does that... Not even police... no one knows what is going on until charges are ready to be filed. Why would Comey send a letter to Congress about DOJ cockblocking his report if he was one of the bad guys? </p>

<p>This won&#39;t bring down the rich elites... but it will throw a wrench in their works. Human lives are just pawns in a sick game to those people... but they there is an honor amongst thieves and they play by the rules. They don&#39;t do things illegally... just immorally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OMG. This whole &#39;Comey&#39;s a good guy&#39; is such BS!  Look at the freaking <em>history</em> of Comey for G-d&#39;s sake! Going back to the Clinton presidencey, Comey absolved Clinton of any wrongdoing during his admin.  Forget which scandal it was (there were so many), but he&#39;s a sold bill of goods people.  Stop this disinfo crap.</p>

<p>Heck, Comey&#39;s <em>brother</em> works for the freaking Clinton Foundation (do a web search as this info has been out there for months.  At work so can&#39;t do this).</p>

<p>While there are definitely good FBI agents, that agency has been proven corrupt ever since J Edgar Hoover took over (um, the beginning!).  Read a few of the unauthorized bios of Hoover, that cross-dressing, mob purchased, homosexual, if you have any doubts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  This whole thing boils down to using reason and evidence to come to the most likely conclusion.  Scientists do this all the time.  In scientific method, you examine the data, develop a hypothesis which you think will make sense of the data, and then test the data to see if that hypothesis works.  If it doesn&#39;t, you discard hypo., and start again.  Some anons are doing great work here of bringing data to the fore and finding plausible hypotheses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously. He&#39;s from Chicago and is flying in pizza and hot dogs.  And there&#39;s a no outside food policy but he&#39;s .... the fucking president.  Or maybe it was for everyone but him.  Or off grounds. Or whatever other minor factor needed to make it ok.  I just don&#39;t see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure the &quot;no outside food&quot; policy is for tourists visiting the White House.  You can&#39;t bring food into the Smithsonian either but I&#39;m sure the workers there still bring their damn lunches in.</p>

<p>As someone who is born and raised as a Chicagoan I will say that you get the craving for some Chicago deep dish or a Chicago dog BAD and nothing will stop it until you get that authentic Chicago dish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup and it takes several days for them to ship it to you.  I believe what Obama was talking about was chartering a private flight to deliver pizza and hot dogs to him.  That would explain the hefty price tag ( I think it was like $60k ) more than &#39;PEDO SEX RING!!&#39;</p>

I put my faith into the FBI and the triple letter folks, that they have much more solid evidence than we do.  I mean, look at it like this.  Think of how much access the FBI has, all the info they&#39;ve gathered.  What we&#39;ve found is PUBLIC, imagine what is private.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much as I believe all of this to be true,  I have absolutely zero faith that it will ever come to public awareness in any meaningful way.  It&#39;s not just hillary and a few washington elites in the US - this involves political elites and the ultra wealthy from every major nation on the globe.  The group of offenders involved here has a history that goes back centuries.  And Hillary (while not by any means at the top of the food chain) is high up enough that to prosecute her publicly would innevitably result in the implication of the people who in reality run the world.   It would unravel the facade that the public takes for granted as the world-as-they-know-it (I.e., the narrative that representative democracies actually exist, that world leaders have the public&#39;s interest at heart, that the monetary system has legitimacy, that capitalism is a valid mode of civilization, etc).  The elites behind the child trafficking and other crimes against humanity are the same who have spent centuries crafting the exploitative state of existence that we call the world as we know it.   They will never allow this to come out.</p>

<p>Which sucks pretty hardcore.  I would personally rather the world end than continue as it is.  But I&#39;m not in charge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way. Hillary molested me when I was 14 years old. I didn&#39;t say anything till now because I sort of really liked it. She was only in her 40&#39;s then and still pretty sexy in a nerdy sort of way. It was around the time of the &#39;stand by my man&#39; video. Go watch it and tell me she wasn&#39;t sort of sexy. She was. You would have done it (and liked it, a lot) too so don&#39;t judge me. Bill was supposed to watch us (that was his thing, I guess) but she told me he had literally eaten 2 buckets of KFC earlier and was sleeping it off. Technically the timeline doesn&#39;t really make any sense but I&#39;m pretty sure Chelsea is my daughter. She&#39;s doing so good. I&#39;m proud of her big time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was indirect verification, though kinda weird.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a 4chan frequenter, but checked out the &quot;FBIAnon&quot; summaries from there. Apparently, on 4chan there was a weird theory about how Trump inherited time travel technology from his uncle who had some of Tesla&#39;s notebooks. I won&#39;t legitimate the theory, but the starting point, that his uncle had Tesla&#39;s notebook, is actually . . . true.</p>

<p>The verification came when the weird tweets came out of the FBI Records Twitter account. They released the FBI records for Trump . . . . and Tesla. As I said, it&#39;s indirect, but that&#39;s a strong hint for those who know to see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He wants to go back to his people on mars and I have undeniable proof. </p>

<p>Elon spelled backward is Nole, Nole stands for North Pole. At the North Pole Santa and Obama are both building rockets to bomb Jupiter (home of the original Chinese). After they bomb jupiter, Elon will contact the martians to come pick him under. After that Elon, Santa, Obama, And Jesus Christ stop at one of the famous intergalactic pizza shops. Of course it was all a front to harbor alien sex-slaves. Obama eventually falls in love with one of the brothel workers and they decide to get married and have a kid. (This is where it gets a little wacky, but just hold on till the end). That kid was none other than Tesla himself. With the time-traveling technology left behind by the Tesla in the past, the future tesla is able to go back in time to create his inventions on Earth. There he invents the Trumpinator, an evil businessman tasked with dominating the globe. After he completes that, he will switch the the 5th realm where he and his daughter arent related and they end up fucking all night long. Turns out, his daughter ends up giving birth to Chelsea Clinton, who, using Teslas time traveling device, goes back in time to fuck her grandpa. You see Chelsea Clinton is Hillary Clintons mother but because shes a product of the 5th realm she doesnt age as fast as us. With my estimations she is over 1.6 quadrillion years old. The Clintons were created by Nikola Tesla to take over the world. </p>

<p>The car crash is definitely something to be concerned about. People have demonstrated how easy it is to hack and control a modern car remotely. Id assume its even easier with a car thats basically a computer on wheels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forget about the election, this is why facebook/google are putting out their new &quot;rules about fake news&quot; .... They are preparing for this story to hit the alternative news networks, before it gets picked up by Fox and others. They are already looking for ways to discredit the truth </p>

<p>The left , whether it be on a certain politics sub, or any other liberal majority discussion, have become accustomed to ignoring and dismissing any story that comes from a right-leaning site, because they just refuses to acknowledge anything outside of their views. They scoff and dismiss it as being racist/bigoted/anti whatever they feel like saying.</p>

<p>They stick their heads in the sand and hide from everything that makes them look bad . Now, instead of just turtling when the going gets tough, they are looking for ways to legislate their will and partner with left leaning companies like twitter, facebook and google to suppress any news that goes against them   </p>

<p>I say this because if we are talking about Clintons, then we know that they will flee the country if they had any inkling that there is evidence implicating them in Wiener&#39;s laptop.</p>

<p>If there was any real evidence then it would be expected that NYPD and/or FBI would make arrest first before proceeding to build the rest of the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anyone has any doubts that the good guys could actually pull this off... I have some ideas about that...</p>

<p>The FBI has always existed in a world where a file could be shredded, or evidence could be lost. The chain of command prevented any agent from really knowing too much about the big picture... your case could be handed off to &quot;someone else&quot; and that would be the end of it. The agents only really communicated with their superiors and a few people in the office.</p>

<p>Now we live in a world where instead of being shredded that same file can be instantly duplicated a million times and flung across the entire globe in a split second... agents can communicate and coordinate without relying upon the old chain of command... a single pipeline of info is easy to cut off... but a web of information shared can let the good ones piece together the whole thing without tipping off the few corrupt ones in control.</p>

<p>A suspicious suicide in a local newspaper would hit a readership of 3,000 and be lining the birdcage the next day... lost forever. Now it is preserved online and shared with anyone interested to look at it. They got away with this type of shit for so long by hiding each puzzle piece as it came into play. Now is the first time in history that we can all collectively gather enough pieces of the puzzle so we can put together the big picture. Sure there are a few pieces missing here and there... but enough of it is intact that you can step back and soak it all in.</p>

<p>I honestly believe we are witnessing something major here... something beautiful... I don&#39;t want people feeling scared or angry... I want them to kick back and enjoy the show, we are about to witness history in the making... The good people in the FBI have been working 100 times harder than us at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> have been... trying to unravel these mind boggling mysteries... only they have been training all their lives for this and they have tools at their disposal way beyond Google and Safari... and look at what we all have done with just those.</p>

<p>The FBI does have a shady history, but that is all about to change... the good guys are sick of looking like dirtbags because of the greed of a minority in power. These men risk their lives to do what is right... some fat fucker behind a desk can&#39;t stop them anymore.</p>

<p>I just hate hearing &quot;an anonymous whoever said...&quot; because it&#39;s easy to make stuff up. If this stuff is true (and a lot of things are really connecting here) then hopefully someone goes from &quot;anonymous FBI&quot; or &quot;anonymous NYPD insider&quot; to an actual person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI has always existed in a world where a file could be shredded, or evidence could be lost. The chain of command prevented any agent from really knowing too much about the big picture... your case could be handed off to &quot;someone else&quot; and that would be the end of it. The agents only really communicated with their superiors and a few people in the office.</p>

<p>Now we live in a world where instead of being shredded that same file can be instantly duplicated a million times and flung across the entire globe in a split second... agents can communicate and coordinate without relying upon the old chain of command... a single pipeline of info is easy to cut off... but a web of information shared can let the good ones piece together the whole thing without tipping off the few corrupt ones in control.</p>

<p>A suspicious suicide in a local newspaper would hit a readership of 3,000 and be lining the birdcage the next day... lost forever. Now it is preserved online and shared with anyone interested to look at it. They got away with this type of shit for so long by hiding each puzzle piece as it came into play. Now is the first time in history that we can all collectively gather enough pieces of the puzzle so we can put together the big picture. Sure there are a few pieces missing here and there... but enough of it is intact that you can step back and soak it all in.</p>

<p>I honestly believe we are witnessing something major here... something beautiful... I don&#39;t want people feeling scared or angry... I want them to kick back and enjoy the show, we are about to witness history in the making... The good people in the FBI have been working 100 times harder than us at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and <a href="/r/wikileaks">/r/wikileaks</a> have been... trying to unravel these mind boggling mysteries... only they have been training all their lives for this and they have tools at their disposal way beyond Google and Safari... and look at what we all have done with just those. </p>

<p>The FBI does have a shady history, but that is all about to change... the good guys are sick of looking like dirtbags because of the greed of a minority in power. These men risk their lives to do what is right... some fat fucker behind a desk can&#39;t stop them anymore. </p>

HRC doesn&#39;t play by the rules of all those &quot;evil&quot; bankers like Soros... they might not have morals, but they play by the rules they are given. HRC doesn&#39;t play by the rules or have morals... she was too dangerous for the world. If the fucking Amish figured that out... you know the FBI did long ago. She had a lot of scary stuff planned for the world... win or lose. And all of it has been cockblocked at every turn. I think she&#39;s prolly been in custody since election night... carefully allowed those 2 speeches under supervision. Only thing left hanging is if a reporter assassinates Trump before inauguration... and teeny tiny tinfoil chance of more earthquakes/tsunamis.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man I&#39;m tryin so hard to believe you but this shit is centuries deep. If they go down they&#39;re sure as hell not goin without a fight. And if they&#39;re not going down than we are def not &quot;out of the woods&quot;. And the reason I appeal to &quot;God&quot; is cause no natural force, &quot;Good-guy&quot; FBI or otherwise can separate the chaff from the wheat as it were, all the while leaving the wheat unscathed. If I wasn&#39;t a parent to two beautiful children I honestly could give two shits about this stuff but the thought of me bringing them in this world and only seeing their faces for a short time longer is a fear you can&#39;t describe to someone that doesn&#39;t have kids, and a feeling you don&#39;t need to to somebody that does. So if there is a God I&#39;m imploring Him right now to intercede on all our behalves cuz the future is only looking bright bc that&#39;s how nuclear fission works. I realize what I sound like right now and I apologize but man this shit is kinda intense. Like on a existential level intense. Anyways I&#39;m done. Here&#39;s hopin for the best.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of hours of reading packed in there... then you can do the same for every other .gov website or twitter account too... The good ones have been out in front of this for a long while. This isn&#39;t something you can just sum up with an image macro.

<p>To start with: This question is irrelevant, because the outcome is the same: the shadow government is illegitimate--they are either criminals or they are psychological terrorists who have declared war on the public.  The only way to find out is for the public government of white hats to detain their network and go through their files and figure out the truth of the matter, making it fully transparent to the public.

<p>Fair enough.  If you are right and I&#39;ll assume you are, then I&#39;ll keep thinking postive thoughts and do what I can to help.  I am very glad that I helped participate along with you and others here and on CST to stop Clinton from getting into the white house.  I wish Trump would acknowledge the role of this sub at the least by maybe helping us help him too; or at the least not becoming corrupted by these people (fingers crossed it hasn&#39;t happened and that trumps moorings to the old guard like gingrich and giuliani were just mistakes of ignorance)</p>

<p>No politician is a saint, and many are quite tainted by the touch of evil. Madness and insanity and bad behavior does not play favorites and is not the exclusive domain of any political party.</p>

<p>Of course, corruption and perversion never extend to your own partisans, and is always assumed to exist in your opponents.</p>

<p>this might not be wise</p>

<p>Modern psychology has a hard time dealing with evil, often labeling a wide range of behavior as &quot;kinda normal&quot; even if it is destructive and broadly non-survival.</p>

<p>See for an unrelated example, the Hoffman Report on psychologists supporting torture</p>

<p><a href="http://pro.psychcentral.com/the-hoffman-report-the-american-psychological-association-apa-investigation">http://pro.psychcentral.com/the-hoffman-report-the-american-psychological-association-apa-investigation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pentagon has internal players and outside players they call “creatives“. Creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses, malcontents, extreme hackers, or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas. A Pentagon program called Cicada 3301, which we have reported on previously, was created by several of these talented civilians. The program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors, using what is called a dead box whistleblower encryption method so the non-corrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain saf</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia claims it&#39;s a secret society, and others comment it&#39;s a singularitarian cryptoanarchy group with gnostic / crowleyan ideology...the belief in a solid state intelligence that has simulated the world is a de facto a gnostic idea ( see elon musk&#39;s simulation propabability), though christers call it luciferian it actually predates lucifer culturally, and is an idea more akin to manicheanism of ancient persia or yazidism</p>

Weren&#39;t the FBI agents staging a walkout when Comey didn&#39;t recommend charges? Wasn&#39;t Hillary supposed to steal the election? Has anything posted by &quot;an anonymous FBI source&quot; on 4chan actually come true so far? Please tell me, because if true it would be great to see these people face justice. But I tend to think that most anonymous posts like that are trolls or honeypots, especially based on the track record so far. Would welcome someone proving me wrong by showing any actual evidence that the anonymous 4chan FBI posters have gotten anything right so far regarding the Clintons or the election.</p>

<p>comey being one who had to know trump would win. so did his thing to curry favor with the soon to be president trump like you said. embarrassed Hillary by saying the email investigation was reopened, that was a sign to trump he&#39;s on his side. but no actual repercussions came of it, can&#39;t actually put someone like Hillary, who is in the club, in jail. that&#39;d be unthinkable!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re assuming elections aren&#39;t rigged. But people have claimed under oath that elections are rigged. If you accept that, then you may see that the moment the FBI said &quot;Hillary&#39;s good&quot; was the moment they made their final choice for the next POTUS based on the new emails (from Weiner&#39;s computer) incriminating her beyond help. And they chose her opponent as the lesser evil (they probably have some dirt on Trump to control him, but it probably isn&#39;t as bad as Hillary&#39;s; she is after all a security liability for the USA as proven by her illegal use of a private server to send classified info). They had no reason to create a scandal right before the election when they can just wait until January 21st to proceed with the investigations and public announcements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He wants to go back to his people on mars and I have undeniable proof. </p>

<p>Elon spelled backward is Nole, Nole stands for North Pole. At the North Pole Santa and Obama are both building rockets to bomb Jupiter (home of the original Chinese). After they bomb jupiter, Elon will contact the martians to come pick him under. After that Elon, Santa, Obama, And Jesus Christ stop at one of the famous intergalactic pizza shops. Of course it was all a front to harbor alien sex-slaves. Obama eventually falls in love with one of the brothel workers and they decide to get married and have a kid. (This is where it gets a little wacky, but just hold on till the end). That kid was none other than Tesla himself. With the time-traveling technology left behind by the Tesla in the past, the future tesla is able to go back in time to create his inventions on Earth. There he invents the Trumpinator, an evil businessman tasked with dominating the globe. After he completes that, he will switch the the 5th realm where he and his daughter arent related and they end up fucking all night long. Turns out, his daughter ends up giving birth to Chelsea Clinton, who, using Teslas time traveling device, goes back in time to fuck her grandpa. You see Chelsea Clinton is Hillary Clintons mother but because shes a product of the 5th realm she doesnt age as fast as us. With my estimations she is over 1.6 quadrillion years old. The Clintons were created by Nikola Tesla to take over the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine what could happen if certain classified material got in the wrong hands. This info was on a LAPTOP, something that could easily be forgotten in a cab or coffee shop. Intent is irrelevant; look at how carelessness led to Huma, Weiner, and Clinton&#39;s maid all getting access to classified information.</p>

<p>She was said to have special access programs that list, for example, the locations of missile silos.</p>

<p>And the names of spies working undercover, which would mean their death if it got out.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been rumored that the stuff on Weiner&#39;s laptop would be enough for several nations to declare war on us, although the exact reasons were not stated. But use your imagination.</p>
