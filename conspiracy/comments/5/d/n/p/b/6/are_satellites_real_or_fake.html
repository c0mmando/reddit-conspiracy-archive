       If they were real, why is there not imagery for all of these missing planes?  Also, why pump wifi to airplanes from the ground or film football games from blimps?  Can someone please provide conclusive proof that these are a thing and not simply a land based technology?

       Because of confidentiality agreements and NDAs, I can't really provide you any proof that they are real. BUT, I do work for Echostar Technologies at the Cheyenne uplink. Echostar is the uplink and downlink for Dish Network, and I can assure you that satellites are very real.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have one satellite that has an active camera pointed at the earth. We also have a few government contracts. Not really sure what goes on back there. It's hush hush. But as a systems administrator I do have to go in that area occasionally and there is a lot of satellite tracking systems and live video from the satellites.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years back i helped with Dish Network Brazil services. We had to get the broadcast signal from Brazil to Cheyenne for customers. That system works just like all of other satellite operations, and it is very different than any of the IP based systems that are used for the Hoppers/Joeys.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the best I've got for you. I've explained this to other people in the past. Some choose to take my word. Some don't. I'll let you draw your own conclusions.

       Everyday the iss orbits the earth 16 times. You can see it muiplte times thru out the day almost all across the earth.

       The ISS is 249 miles above the surface of the earth. You simply can not see an object the size of the ISS (slightly larger than a football field) from that distance. You also certainly can't see satellites with your naked eye.

       Where are your supporting facts that the naked eye can't see a satellite?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you tell me what state you live in, I can tell you when you can see the space station fly over you. I used to do this every day when I was in 5th grade. I have a telescope that's as tall as me. And I have been star gazing ever since I was a kid.  I have seen multiple satellites in the sky. Best viewing takes place at sunrise and sunset.

       Knowing the position of the ISS has nothing to do with object visibility at a distance. Just like how you can't see a bumble bee 100 feet away from you, you can't see an object the size of the ISS 249 miles away from you without telescopic aid. As an object becomes further and further away from you it appears to get smaller and smaller because of your perspective. The ISS would take up such a marginal portion of your field of vision that simple math can demonstrate how impossible an object that size would be to see at a distance of 249 miles. What you might be able to detect is the luminosity much like you do with stars, but that's not the same as seeing the object.

       I'm saying where is your supporting evidence that you can not see the space station from that distance? You throw out miles and distances like you know this for certain and like this is physical laws at play. But all we have is you saying it can't be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am willing to tell you what time of day you can go outside and I will tell you what direction you can look, and you can see something you have never seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously tell me roughly where you live, I will provide the time of day, and the direction of the area and sky you can literally watch the space station fly by at 17,500 mph across the sky.  When you see it you will think it is a UFO

       I'm well aware of the blip of light that travels across the sky and can easily be tracked by googling "how to spot the ISS". You need to read what I said closer. I'm not going to explain the inverse-square law to you or do the math for you because I don't need to, you need to do that for yourself. You also can't see mars or any stars for the same reason, but you can detect their luminescence and that is what you see in the night sky when you're "looking at stars and planets". There is a huge difference in seeing an object and detecting its luminescence. This has been a fantastic chat though.

       Wait what? So can you see mars? Or not?
And can you see the space station?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is not the space station that is flying around us 16 times a day, what is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about Jupiter and its moons? I used to track their orbit around Jupiter with my telescope, what is Jupiter if the earth is flat? Clearly with a telescope you can track the solar system, and see planet and some of their moons. If the earth is flat what are they?

       Editing a comment on me eh,
       <br/>
       So you say you can't see the iss you see it's luminescence. I ask you what's the difference? Visualization of the space station of course is dependent on its reflection of light. I don't get your point then.

       The reason you can see it is because of the sun reflecting off of it. It has enormous solar panels, and is roughly the size of a football field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same way that someone lost in the wilderness can signal for rescuers in helicopters with a tiny mirror reflecting sunlight. Size of the mirror doesn't matter, just the sunlight that it reflects.
      </p>
      <p>
       The space station is only visible with the naked eye when it is dark on the planet, but there's still sunlight reflecting off the station from below the horizon (this usually only happens around dawn or dusk). And similar to the mirror example above, all people can see is a light moving across the sky like an airplane (but not blinking). If someone has a really good telescope and good tracking, they can see a bit more detail, but not much.

       This is exactly what I described in more technical terms. It doesn't matter how coherently you're speaking or how precisely technical you explain something, if the listener is navigating and skimming over your words emotionally trying to rapidly form a defense against what they perceive to be an argument. The light reflecting off of the solar panels and the small mirror in the forest are visible because as they reflect light they become more luminescent. Seeing light bounce off the surface of something is not the same as seeing the thing wouldn't you agree?

       The moon is a satellite. So, yeah satellites are weird. The blimp thing is for an Ariel view. They're much cheapest for a company instead of building and launching a satellite.

       you mean why don't we film the football game from a satellite instead of a blimp? There is a bit of difference in altitude for one. If satellites don't exist how did all those phones work wirelessly before cellular towers existed? How do they work now in areas with no cell towers? Why is there no footage of missing planes? a) how do you know there is no footage b) you have to actually point a camera at something to film it

       oh man you're clever as fuck, asking how phones work wireless-ly before cellular towers existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       " Hand-held radio transceivers have been available since the 1940s. Mobile telephones for automobiles became available from some telephone companies in the 1940s. Early devices were bulky, consumed high power, and the network supported only a few simultaneous conversations. Modern cellular networks allow automatic and pervasive use of mobile phones for voice and data communications."
      </p>
      <p>
       What they had mobile phones in the 1940's?! Gee I wonder when the first Communications Satellite was launched "The first artificial Earth satellite was Sputnik 1. Put into orbit by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, it was equipped with an on-board radio-transmitter that worked on two frequencies: 20.005 and 40.002 MHz. Sputnik 1 was launched as a step in the exploration of space and rocket development."
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh but wait, that one wasn't used for satellite phones, the first time a satellite was used for phone communication was from the Telstar 1.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstar">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstar
       </a>
       "Telstar 1 launched on top of a Thor-Delta rocket on July 10, 1962. It successfully relayed through space the first television pictures, telephone calls, and fax images, and provided the first live transatlantic television feed."
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder how all those phones worked wireless-ly before 1962, must be magic.

       Several years ago, the National Reconnaissance Office donated several spy satellite busses to NASA that they didn't need anymore... the satellites were very similar to Hubble, but much more advanced (I heard from someone at NASA who's worked with spy satellites and space telescopes that Hubble was heavily based off of a spy satellite design from the 70's. Even with the same prescription of mirror, but with different cameras and sensors).
      </p>
      <p>
       ...NASA has so little funding that they haven't even been able to do anything with those satellites. They're still sitting in storage. NASA barely even got Hubble off the ground, yet the NRO had spare more advanced 'Hubbles' just sitting in storage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently I was talking to a recruiter who works with the NRO. He couldn't tell me what he does, but he said it "was some Tom Clancy shit"

       There are reports that the moon emits its own lighting.  Alternatively, it is supposed to reflect the light of the sun.  (Frankly, the moon is a pretty big indicator that the official story is ... inaccurate .. but that's another story.)  There are apparently 2700 satellites in space.  Never do you see any drift in front of this light source/reflector.
