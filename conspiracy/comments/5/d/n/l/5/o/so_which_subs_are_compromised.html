       Oh, I'm sure it is infiltrated or at least monitored and observed. But IRC and imageboards are obvious, just pay attention to certain posts and chat logs, you'll start to notice the posters and threads that have an agenda behind them. A lot of it is in the timing and phrasing or completely irrelevant content. Or even slightly irrelevant content. When Wikileaks was getting big again for example, on 4chan it would be common to see Lauren Southern threads or Taylor Swift threads, or dumb "lol trumptards btfo" threads to incite arguments and distract everyone.

       I didn't say you threatened anyone! Jesus Christ, is everyone twisting words today in order to form their arguments and act like a victim? I've also never posted on the_donald, ever. You're welcome to criticize all you want. He's not a role model for anyone. But many users are not "just" criticizing.

       "threatened"? lmao you've got to be kidding me.  Trying to silence this guy speaking the truth about Trump being pro-authoritarian by falsely portraying him as being a 'dangerous malcontent' is not in line with your

       Are you both ignorant of English? Threatening the arrival of some unsubstantiated event and threatening someone personally are very different things. I didn't claim the latter. You can chill with the lecture. No matter how you spin this all of you are trying to predict the future and in a very negative manner. That's the truth. I didn't silence anyone and it won't be true the next time you try to say as much either.

       You clearly said he was 'fear-mongering', which is defined as spreading fear for the sake of spreading fear, when all he was doing was expressing concern about a legitimate problem.  He isn't portraying the situation in a manner that is any more negative than the facts dictate, yet you tried to suggest he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is that Trump has surrounded himself with pro-authoritarian individuals and has himself expressed fondness for things like the Patriot Act.  Those aren't vague assumptions, they are cold hard facts that imply very clearly he is an authoritarian himself, which makes it perfectly reasonable for someone to point that out without having to worry about being labelled a 'fear-monger'.

       You're right about one thing, though, you didn't silence anyone.

       Yeah, you clearly just changed your tune and backpedalled away from that condescending quip about "threatening" too. Maybe understand what is being discussed before you jump in and give a haughty lecture. When you people speak of the country collapsing and things going horribly wrong that haven't, that's baseless fear mongering and it's exactly what you're doing. I'm out. No argument here.

       Good job describing yourself.  It was you who threw in the towel when you got confronted making accusations you couldn't substantiate. There was never any debate about you using the word 'threatening' in a personal context, you just pulled that argument out of thin air to 'save face' as you describe it, because otherwise you would have had to acknowledge that you used it to create a false perception of honkimons intentions.  Then, when confronted about using the term fear-mongering, you completely disregarded the fact that what was stated by honkimon was not in any way fear-mongering, but based on an accurate assessment of the
       <em>
        facts
       </em>
       and instead doubled-down without giving any evidence to prove your claim that he was actually spreading fear over an issue where you believed none was warranted.

       direct threat of authoritarian rule and censorship under Trump, and no evidence or supporting material to back the claim. You're confusing facts with triggered emotions. I didn't do anything to twist his intentions, I took them at face value. And every time you add a little condescending quip to the end of your comments you just make it easier for me and others to see how arrogant you are.

       Now you are trying to shut me up by linking me with "SJW's" and suggesting that 'others' will see how 'arrogant' I am.  This is a poor strategy, man.  Can't you come up with better methods than trying to silence those with opposing points of view?

       Trump openly supports the Patriot act.  That is about a positive an affirmation of his authoritarian nature as anyone should need.  You need more evidence than the man himself admitting he supports authoritarian measures? I can't even..

       Nobody is silencing, shutting anyone up, or censoring others. I have no idea why you're playing that broken record on repeat, but you just admitted to taking a remark by Trump about the Patriot Act as evidence that he will be an authoritarian ruler and censor us all. This is called a jump to a conclusion. I also like to call it a stretch. And since it's a negative one based on fear and speculation, I am calling it as I see it.

       I said it was clear evidence he was authoritarian, which it is.  How much clearer could it possibly get? Do you even know what the Patriot Act is?

       You can't switch between defending your own words and another user's as a way to hide from certain discussion points. I quoted the user as saying exactly what you said he didn't say, and now you're nitpicking elsewhere to avoid admitting to another blatant error. Remove "censor us all"  even though it was directly implied, I don't care. The rest of my point still stands on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is that you're taking passing remarks of Donald Trump, who is not the president yet nor has he ever held public office, as hardline policies that will inevitably arise in the future. We can argue semantics all day, but you do not have a rebuttal to the fact that these things haven't occurred, you're speculating, and you have no idea what the future holds anymore than any of us (even though you clearly think you do). Just chill for a while, observe, and see what happens.

       I didn't say you threatened anyone! Jesus Christ, is everyone twisting words today in order to form their arguments and act like a victim? I've also never posted on the_donald, ever. You're welcome to criticize all you want. He's not a role model for anyone. But many users are not "just" criticizing.
