But IRC and imageboards are obvious, just pay attention to certain posts and chat logs, you&#39;ll start to notice the posters and threads that have an agenda behind them. A lot of it is in the timing and phrasing or completely irrelevant content. Or even slightly irrelevant content. When Wikileaks was getting big again for example, on 4chan it would be common to see Lauren Southern threads or Taylor Swift threads, or dumb &quot;lol trumptards btfo&quot; threads to incite arguments and distract everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly said he was &#39;fear-mongering&#39;, which is defined as spreading fear for the sake of spreading fear, when all he was doing was expressing concern about a legitimate problem.  He isn&#39;t portraying the situation in a manner that is any more negative than the facts dictate, yet you tried to suggest he was.  </p>

<p>The fact is that Trump has surrounded himself with pro-authoritarian individuals and has himself expressed fondness for things like the Patriot Act.  Those aren&#39;t vague assumptions, they are cold hard facts that imply very clearly he is an authoritarian himself, which makes it perfectly reasonable for someone to point that out without having to worry about being labelled a &#39;fear-monger&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good job describing yourself.  It was you who threw in the towel when you got confronted making accusations you couldn&#39;t substantiate. There was never any debate about you using the word &#39;threatening&#39; in a personal context, you just pulled that argument out of thin air to &#39;save face&#39; as you describe it, because otherwise you would have had to acknowledge that you used it to create a false perception of honkimons intentions.  Then, when confronted about using the term fear-mongering, you completely disregarded the fact that what was stated by honkimon was not in any way fear-mongering, but based on an accurate assessment of the <em>facts</em> and instead doubled-down without giving any evidence to prove your claim that he was actually spreading fear over an issue where you believed none was warranted. </p>

<p>direct threat of authoritarian rule and censorship under Trump, and no evidence or supporting material to back the claim. You&#39;re confusing facts with triggered emotions.
