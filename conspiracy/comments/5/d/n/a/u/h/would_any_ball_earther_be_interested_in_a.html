       <strong>
        As it turns out, so far no ball earther is willing (or able) to come up with 10 proofs of their model and have them scrutinized. How strange, seeing that it should be the easiest thing in the world to do. GO FIGURE.

       <strong>
        This post is only for setting the terms of the debate if it happens
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth posts gets derailed and argumentative pretty quickly, so we would need someone to moderate based on the arguments presented. Would be awesome if one of the r/conspiracy mods could volunteer to moderate?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest the following format: (Your suggestions welcome.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Each side has to present 10 proofs for their argument, one talking point at a time. Thread can go on for a while, doesn't have to be over a specific time period.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Side A has made their first point, they get awarded 1 point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side B gets to do a rebuttal, and if successful (based on argument presented), Side A loses the point and it goes to Side B.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side B makes their first point, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any takers or suggestions?

       I would like to keep this post for getting the debate thread going. If you're new to the flat earth phenomenon, I highly recommend watching this video. It's presented well and is mostly based on books written on the subject. It covers all the basics. Running time 2 hours.

       What's the benefit in tricking people that it is round? Do you also believe that all the other planets, stars, and moons are flat? Do you believe in gravity? Do you think that every scientist is in on it? Do you believe in the planets orbit around the sun? How do you explain day/night? What's on the other side of the flat earth?

       The why is a good question, and one that should definitely be asked. But how would anyone know for sure? Also that question should not detract from the facts of the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best guess on this is that normal everyday people have been sold an entirely fake worldview. Almost nothing works the way we have been taught - government, politics, the economy you name it, right down to the nature of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not getting into the proofs in this thread - I'm hoping the debate (if it happens) will answer a lot of questions for everyone.

       I like to entertain the idea and think its certainly possible, but I  put the chances pretty low. I subscribe to the belief that no one really knows the truth and every idea should be considered unless it's overly ridiculous.  What's the best evidence out there for flat earth theory?

       Vsauce has a video about flat earth you should check it. He's a pretty smart guy and tend to take his word as very credible. Don't get me wrong, I love the flat earth videos and what not. They are very entertaining to watch but not much science behind it.

       Okay, well ever since I was a kid I used to star gaze. I lived in a desert and had a telescope taller then I was. I used to print out the logistics to track the iss and mir space stations so I could see it fly over every other day. Consistently. The mir is no longer around, but people can still see the space station regularly from the ground with their naked eye. If the earth is flat what is orbiting the flat earth? And how does the sun rise and set?

       Here is earth curvature at 121,000 feet.

       the funny thing is a flat earther took this video, and didn't show the end of it claiming for it showed earth is flat.

       I'm with you. This kind of shit just gives conspiracy a bad image and that's why the majority of people dismiss any other claims of conspiracy. Many people have traveled around the globe... how many people traveled to the "edge"? If OP or any other flat earth believers want to prove their theory they could just travel to the edge and take a pic.

       That video is filmed with a fisheye lens. It's going to make everything look curved whether it is curved or not. Fisheye lenses are absolutely unreliable for gathering empirical proof of the shape of an object.

       I have stood on a hill overlooking a beach and seen the sun set over the ocean and then on the beach while I was still in the Sunshine.  That doesn't fit with a flat Earth model does it?

       Yup. If the earth was flat, we could use the same telescopic cameras that we can view the moon with, aim them, say, east (if you are in the US) and easily see across the Atlantic Ocean and check on Europe, look at mountain ranges in other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course then a flat earther would say you couldn't because our world isn't laid out like known maps because that's a conspiracy too. You could offer proof involving satellites, gps, planes, ships, etc and a flat earther will always just say it's part of the conspiracy

       Yes it's very tough for most people. It's not easy (or sometimes even possible) for people to question the fundamentals of what their entire worldview is based upon. I mean when do you see a ball earth model for the first time? First grade? That model then gets reinforced over not only your school years, but also on TV, movies, logos and all kind of other more subtle ways. I read somewhere that repetition is the most basic form of mind control - and I think that is why it's so difficult for people to even consider this.

       Wouldn't be a easy. First I'd have to reacquaint myself with the evidence, and the arguments of the flat earth hypothesis. Then I'd have to not only remember all the scientific explanations for the arguments but put them forth in a fashion that would convince someone who has closed their mind to rational, scientific, thought processes.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it's easier for those with the burden of proof, which would be you since you're arguing for the existence of something that goes against commonly held theories, to send a drone up high enough to see the truth. Since the photographic proof as acquired by others isn't trustworthy (NASA, etc) I would expect the only proof you would accept is that proof you get for yourself

       No point. There is so much empirical proof that the earth isn't flat and literally zero empirical studies that show it's flat.

       Hi  justinxduff, this is exactly what flat earthers are saying about the globe model. Would you be willing be present your "empirical proof" and do the debate with me?

       Yea they are saying it but the fact of the matter is they have zero empirical proof. Waste of time to debate such nonsense really.

       Hi Nerdherd99, nothing wrong with that idea. I'm just trying to get a conversation going with some structure to it. From personal experience the flat earth threads tend to go off in all manner of directions - it's a HUUUHE subject. Also being in the minority group it's difficult for one person to defend his viewpoint against a ton of other people who are all jumping in on the thread at the same time.

       You should go see if Astronut still posts over at GLP. I believe that shill would tear you a new anus in about 0.05 seconds.

       Yup. If the earth was flat, we could use the same telescopic cameras that we can view the moon with, aim them, say, east (if you are in the US) and easily see across the Atlantic Ocean and check on Europe, look at mountain ranges in other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course then a flat earther would say you couldn't because our world isn't laid out like known maps because that's a conspiracy too. You could offer proof involving satellites, gps, planes, ships, etc and a flat earther will always just say it's part of the conspiracy

       Pro's is something owned by a professional.

       you keep saying pros and cons but what you are really avoiding is any question flat earth doesn't answer
