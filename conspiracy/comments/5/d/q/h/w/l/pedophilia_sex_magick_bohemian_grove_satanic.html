That being said, I do think we are in the Great Awakening, and a elite self fulfilling prophecy is unfolding. The two of those coincide, and the awakening is inevitable, and the elites must contain/control the extent of it. We live in some damn interesting times.. I wouldn&#39;t put it past the elites to go full on Samson, in order to retain control..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gnostics might say that God was evil; he was jealous of man, denying him to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, cursing him with mortality and throwing him out of Paradise; it was the Beast, wisest of all Beasts who taught man much of what he knows, who truly wanted nothing more than that man should be enlightened. If the Illuminati believe this, maybe they are actually working for the good of man, towards greater wisdom for all, but mankind has to step up in it&#39;s moment of need; man has to be tricked into eating from the Tree of Knowledge, gaining Wisdom, Immortality, and taking his rightful place among the Gods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also look-up the strong eschatologic views of ISIS (and you know who is behind ISIS I surmise). Their belief they are fighting in the end-of-days war described in the Coran is an intrinsic pillar of their recruitment message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that many Muslims believe in the Al-Mahdi and Dajjal. I look for partial fulfillment of their eschatology. The Quran and Mahdi prophecies were obviously  writ ten in response to the Bible, so its no shocker that peoples of all three Abrahamic religions will join in unity, destroy each other, be sealed as one of the elect, or find themselves a true martyr for YHWH. </p>

<p>My understanding is that the Mahdi will come out of Saudi Arabia during Islamic civil war. Interesting stuff for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question, but be careful to define which brand of eschatology we are talking about. Props on knowing the word eschatology, but did you know there are several types?</p>

<p>1) Preterism - The idea that the antichrist exists in history. Invented by the Jesuits, this idea is rather unpopular.</p>

<p>2) Futurism - the idea that the antichrist will come in the future. A pre-millenial rapture theory, this Jesuit theory has become so popular (by books and videos such as the Left Behind series, for instance), that most people don&#39;t even know there are other theories (interpretations of prophecy).</p>

<p>3) Historicism - championed almost solely by the Seventh-Day Adventist church, Historicism combines insight from Daniel and another old testament source, to nail down rules for interpretting prophecy, which yeild an advanced interpretation of prophecy worth a look into. The idea came along way since the failure of the 1888 movement, and I&#39;d say beats the Catholic system hands down (but I would say that, as I studied to be an SDA apologist specializing in debate against Catholic dogma).</p>

<p>4) A lesser known and rather new type is called Idealism. I don&#39;t remember much about it, but if I recall correctly, it seeks to prove that the events in Revelations are timeless, and apply to every believer throughout time, in it&#39;s own way.</p>

<p>There may be other theories of eschatology, and of course there are way too many alternative Historicism-type theories, that twist the rules of interpretation, agreed upon by SDA leadership, and yield entirely different views- often an sycretization of the varying types. It seems there are many people who either want to interpret things their way (like David Koresh), or they want to muddle people&#39;s understanding of eschatology (like religion&#39;s version of disinfo).</p>

<p>So with that all said, it&#39;s clear to me that this entire post is based on the premise of futurist eschatology, and by that I would like to protest, saying this brand of eschatology does not represent all of Christianity (though many protestant churches do accept it- not the Baptists).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am aware of this. For my own clarity, I keep end times theology organized as follows:</p>

<p><strong>I. Background Views</strong></p>

<pre><code>  A. Schweizer and Dodds

  B. Bultmann and Moltmann
</code></pre>

<p><strong>II. Millennial Views</strong></p>

<pre><code> A. Postmillennialism

 B. Amillennialism

 C. Premillennialism
</code></pre>

<p><strong>III. Tribulation Views</strong></p>

<pre><code> A. Dispensationalism

 B. Pretribulationism

 C. Posttribulationism

 D. Mediating Positions
</code></pre>

<p>The &quot;isms&quot; you mentioned fall under Background Views (I). This outline is the structure of Millard J Erickson&#39;s <em>A Basic Guide to Eschatology</em>. That book elaborates on a section of Erickson&#39;s <em>Christian Theology</em> (systematic theology) textbook. It&#39;s postgraduate reading, so it may be a bit dry and difficult to follow. If anyone is looking for solid resource material, but doesn&#39;t have a biblical studies background, I recommend picking up a copy of MJE&#39;s primer, <em>Introduction to Christian Doctrine</em>. This author has an impressive resume, and his books have been worth every penny I paid for them.</p>

<p>Personally, I believe that the &quot;last things&quot; began when Jesus ascended. It&#39;s therefore necessary to consider that some prophetic events may have been fulfilled while others have not. It&#39;s important not to assign dogmatic ideology to eschatological views because this limits our understanding, especially considering the difficulty of several passages. I am a Postmillennialist with a Mediating position regarding the Second Coming. I maintain that Christ will come for His elect before the third woe, but after the 144000 have been sealed. </p>

<p>While speculation is healthy, clarity is a necessity. That is what I&#39;m ultimately interested in. That brings me to a huge point of concern- context. Without hermeneutics, you basically end up with 75% of all the end times nonsense on youtube. I guess I&#39;ll leave that alone for now.</p>

<p>You brought up critical concerns, so thank you!</p>

I am unaware of mediating positions. I suppose that is code for positions that don&#39;t quite fit into the other three? If it&#39;s too much to explain I understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the mediating positions will occur some time during the tribulation. In one sense, you could call it &quot;midtribulationism&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t exactly work because opinions will surely vary. Mediating positions covers a multitude of possibilities during a set time (7 years). My position is supported by scripture, but many people are hesitant to be as particular as myself.</p>

<p>To be fair, I have an academic background in biblical studies as well as comparative studies of ancient religions (anthropology). I practiced Toltec shamanism years ago, and that led to entheo/ethnobotany from a anthropological, horticultural, and practitioner standpoint. Ithe wasn&#39;t so long ago that I identified as an agnostic atheist (militant at that). At some point I realized that the movement was really toxic, and it bullied the very people it accused of bullying. I was always angry for some reason. I think even the strongest of believers will go through periods of doubt. I started listening to David Wilkerson on YouTube, and a pastor friend of mine noted that much of what I grieved over regarding Christians echoed the very hearts of Jeremiah, Habakkuk, and many other OT prophets. I&#39;m not claiming to be a prophet, but it did stir me significantly. I read Hume, Russell, Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, Krauss, and others. I realize that the scientific process is as perfect as it gets regarding empirical evidence. While the process is agenda/bias free, humans are not. And science requires funding. That funding comes from institutions that have very strong agendas, and this has compromised our understanding of the cosmos. Science and technology are coming together to fulfill the ancient hope of finding the Philosopher&#39;s Stone (nanotechnology), becoming gods (transhumanism), and even the Axis Mundi (CERN portals). I could go on and on. Most people seem to think I live in fear or Im a prepper. I do have fears, but my personal trials have revealed the mystery of &quot;fearing God&quot;. All I can do is put on the full armor of God and carry my cross. I don&#39;t own a gun, nor do I have emergency supplies of food. Every single Christian that has a cache of weapons, ammo, and supplies hasn&#39;t been reading the Bible. What happened to faith? Sorry to ramble, but I just felt like putting it out there. BTW, the pure bride of Christ was switched out for a whore, and nobody seemed to notice. Obviously this subject stirs something within you. I&#39;m not going to throw Pascal&#39;s Wager out there, but I am going to pray for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I suppose I never answered your question, mainly because I don&#39;t necessarily prescribe to any theory over another (at the moment). I am partial to Historicism (SDA version), so I thought of one interesting note. It&#39;s the relation between the little horn power and a dream in Daniel. The SDA church consider the little horn power to be the Roman Catholic Church itself!
I attended 28 seminars for SDA doctrines, and it&#39;s interesting how it is described, that in 1898 General Bercluthier went to Rome and sacked it, taking the Pope captive, weakening this power, but it regains it&#39;s strength.
To an SDA, the Catholic Church is the throne Satan will sit on, teaching seductive doctrines and ruling from atop Mt. Miggido.
So if you want a conspiracy look no further. In a way the SDA and the Gnostics are very similar (they teach some form of alternative history). It&#39;s just that the SDAs try hard to seem mainstream and open. Talk of the little horn power rarely comes up on the first date though ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Others have said that the Portal to the &#39;Celestial Temple&#39; (Archon/Demiurge supply line) is actually closing, despite the furtive efforts undertaken at places like CERN, and with those odd rites undertaken by certain weirdos at certain groves; the avenues of reinforcements are slipping away, and that them that would seek to perpetuate darkness and false light now scrabble to maintain their sway. There is also talk of the degradation of certain mechanisms at certain levels that indicate the entropic system of control is most certainly in its death throes. </p>

<p>It is said that the circus we see before us now is the last few desperate gambits of them who would seek to perpetuate the system of control in service to them that profit from aforementioned dark workings. I believe that &#39;Their&#39; armies are cut off, their supplies grow short, and their time of loss approaches. </p>

<p>It is also said that the armies of Light are no better than the horde of Darkness. So said, for they are both in service of a false, entropic infernal/divine pretender. A pretender who would trick them who wield infinite power and majesty into forgetting their birthright, trick them into remaining trapped within an entropic sphere of ever diminishing returns. A jail whose only doors are those of perception, whose guards rely solely on the prisoner&#39;s belief that they are securely locked within. Smoke and mirrors.</p>

<p>I believe the so called NWO is the battle plan that was drawn up before a certain awakening occurred, the details of that awakening elude me, perhaps I&#39;ll put a finger on it before I go, nevertheless that awakening, or change, has had a profound impact, to such as degree as dealing a mortal blow to their ultimate chances of success.</p>

<p>I believe those of us who accept with openness, and those of us who pick up the key to our cells and walk away from this silly place with purpose after our corporeal vehicles expire, all have a wonderful experience awaiting us beyond all of this ridiculousness, just outside that swiss-cheese trap... Life here in the interim will be weird, and probably very hard for some of us, because &#39;They&#39; will do everything in their power to ensure it (not to say that we do not have a say in the matter, because we do) but I believe the wheel of carnal torment in service to the entropic pretender has more than a few broken spokes at this point. </p>

<p>So long as we remember in the time we share here that we are infinite beings, beings who by rights care not for the meddlings and mewlings of lesser... entropic entities, and provided that we own up to the reality that we are beyond the control of, and above the sway held by such entities, I think we&#39;ll do just fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See? And how wonderful it is for you to bring your perspective to this discussion. Stop acting like I can&#39;t bring mine.
Stop acting like you can speak negatively to me, because I have spoken in a negative way. If speaking negatively is wrong, then now we are both guilty :p
The fact remains that beliefs must come from somewhere. They can&#39;t just be a conglomeration of the weird shit we see on Alex Jones and in related Disinfo and Misinfo youtube videos, otherwise they are just well...what they are, which is Bullshit.
The commentor started seeming like he/she had a gnostic message, but then it quickly unravelled into meaningless drivel. I don&#39;t think I need to apologize for pointing that out, nor should I leave or cease saying things simply because now you are upset.
Have a wonderful day :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok it&#39;s &quot;the truth&quot;, but is it the whole truth?
Let&#39;s seriously examine what you actually said:</p>

<p>-you have a friend/not friend</p>

<p>-this person is jewish (why is this relevant?)</p>

<p>-that person claimed to be in Syria 5 or 6 yrs before &quot;shit went down&quot; (I can only assume you mean the start of the Syrian border incursion)</p>

<p>-this person has a dad who is cpt on a us warship</p>

<p>-this person may be a spy/knows karate</p>

<p>-this person said something that gave you chills once</p>

<p>-from that you gather &quot;shit is happening&quot;, and you hope trump isnt in on it (lol)</p>

<p>*emphasis added</p>

<p>So overall you really didn&#39;t say much, did you? Your only truth is your unverifiable, unconfirmed talk about someone else&#39;s talk, about yet someone else&#39;s activities.</p>

<p>So how am I supposed to gain anything from your input, aside from general hysteria?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Joshua ray....I had known this guy for about a year...we were coworkers and I  had had him over to my house about 15 times to hang out...got to know him quite well or so I thought.  I&#39;m generally a good judge of character but when he said these things to me one night about WW3, it being Biblical, and asking me if I was afraid to die, I realized that there was something nefarious going on as I could tell that he wasn&#39;t just spouting nonsense....I could tell that he was being quite serious and yeah it fucked me up and I never went back to work again and cut off contact with him.  We were security guards at a marina in Port Moody British Columbia....I&#39;m kind of outing myself by saying that but whatever I guess.  One last thing that I&#39;ll mention as I said there was more to the story is that one morning at work in March of last year I spotted 2 submarines on the surface of the water in the inlet there, side by side traveling slowly in opposite directions.  They were only on the surface of the water for maybe a minute or something but I think they are stored at the marina as before I saw them I had noticed the boat houses on the west side were moving and rubbing against each other making a sound that caught my attention.  I looked out into the inlet and saw no boats or anything that could have created the water displacement.  I thought to myself &#39;I wonder if there&#39;s a submarine&#39; but didn&#39;t really believe it cause that would be so strange but then I saw the 2 subs a few minutes later.  I think that  they are stored in those boat houses at the marina and that these 2 things are connected....the former friend of mine and his apparent involvement in a plan for WW3 and the subs being there.  You can say I&#39;m grasping at straws but based on other info that I have seen online since I think I&#39;m actually on to something.  One piece of information that is worth reading in context to what I&#39;m saying is FBIanon&#39;s  posts on 4chan from earlier in the year...they can be found archived online.  He mentioned that there is a Jewish conspiracy to take over the world that is in the works...hence why I think my former friend being Jewish may be relevant...it&#39;s just another piece of information.  Anyways that&#39;s where I&#39;m coming from....I may or may not be correct about believing that there is or was a plan for WW3 but I assure you I am not lying about anything I&#39;ve said....I have no interest in lying or reason to do so.</p>
