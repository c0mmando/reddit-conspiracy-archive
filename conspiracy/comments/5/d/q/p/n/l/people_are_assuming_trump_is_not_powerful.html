       People have theories where rothschilds, rockefellers, whoever else have trillions of dollars amassed and it's not reported.  My question is, why is it assumed that no one else can play by these same rules?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is listed at 3.9b.  Yet, he has a massive empire.  He attracts A LOT of attention.  He had his own tv show.  He frequently talks as an equal to other people much higher on the wealth list like warren buffet.  It's clear people are afraid of him and pay a lot of attention to what he does.
      </p>
      <p>
       An analogy I have for this situation would be I used to play an MMO(video game) with a wealth list.  Random people would be at the top of it, some powerful, some not.  Random noobs would look at the people at the top and think "wow this guy must be amazing".  However, frequently the most powerful players were at the bottom of the wealth list.  The reasons are simple: they invested all their money into their characters, into various items, and alternate characters.  They had no free floating liquidated income.  It's the same here.  You have no way to know how powerful anyone is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I made this post about a week ago:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5crxgs/i_believe_trump_alex_jones_and_others_are_part_of/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5crxgs/i_believe_trump_alex_jones_and_others_are_part_of/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, my theory was that possibly Trump is part of a different organization.  You can tell people are SCARED of Trump.  A lot.  We all know he probably doesn't pay taxes... so chances are he games the system, hard.  Whether you see that as corrupt or not is irrelevant, the point is that it's clear he is a player as much as anyone.  Some players are in the shadows, some out in the open, some like to show off their money for everyone to see, some hide it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the way fbianon talks about Trump:
       <a href="http://pastebin.com/vvG9PSJN">
        http://pastebin.com/vvG9PSJN
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear, just based on the way he talks about him, Trump may be powerful.  I think there's an assumption that all these elites are all working together to do the same thing.  However, there is no reason that has to be the case.  Remember these people are all human as far as we know, and have their own motivations and goals.  There's no reason someone can't go rogue, screw someone else over, etc.  Think of it as a giant game of risk or some other strategy game.  If Soros does something stupid and gets him exposed, why would these elites not throw him under the bus if they think they can get something from it?  Let's assume Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox, is corrupt as fuck.  Maybe he's extremely powerful.  Maybe Trump is extremely powerful.  What if he decides he's going to ally with Trump and take down the current system so he can profit from it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, there are a lot of possibilities.  However, one telling sign I think is this:  a lot of anit-trump people all started to support him once he won or AFTER they met with him face to face.  It could be people defecting to the winning side to stay in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just some rambling thoughts.  It all sounds crazy, but funnily enough we've reached a point in the world where it's actually plausible.

       Trump is very wealthy and powerful. That being said, he would need the majority of the US military and intelligence agencies behind him, in order to overwhelm (and protect him from) the many more powerful people above him, some known, some suspected, and some we have no idea about... The world's oldest corporation (Holy Roman Empire) ain't going down without a massive fight.. I'm talking Samson level..

       This is my opinion on the research I've done. If you know their names or their names are common knowledge, they are nowhere near top tier. The truly powerful are in the shadows, and have others doing their bidding. The easiest way I can describe this would be a CIA front, to a front, to a front, to a front. The true elites, cast no shadows, for they are not in the light..

       Based on what?  What if a true elite wants to be a star and out in the open.  What if they make a conscious choice to be out and doing whatever and exposing themself.  Where is the evidence that it has to follow this rule?

       I said it was my opinion, made that clear. Anyways, the logic would be, you don't want people knowing you exist. So, you wouldn't be flamboyant and out in the public. Good press - bad press, press is press, which leads to reporting and investigating. You really should research old money families vs. new money families. We are talking about ancient dynasties here, compared to say, Trump or Bill Gates.

       I just don't think that's a thing. If a
       <em>
        true elite
       </em>
       wanted to be a star and out in the open, they'd be exposing themselves way too much to assassins, public ridicule, and the threat of revolution. It's just common sense that it's not a good idea. This is why I think George Soros is a hack. We know nearly everything about that man from when he was 14 to what he's doing now along with his web of companies and all their connections. Nothing is
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       threatening if everyone can see it and I'm 97% sure Soros is just a Palpatine looking window with a store full of Plagueis behind him. Everyone has a boss and the pyramid always goes higher.

       Yeah I've figured that out over the past few weeks. I'm starting to look at the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Morgans, and the like as simply bankers. The bank itself is where the secrets are.

       Just wanted to reply to this so people see all sides of conversation:
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically argument of deleted posts was that Trump is establishment, all the people he's appointing are establishment, and his donors are Saudis prisons and some other organizations.

       I think this is plausible and I'm considering it as well, but I also think it doesn't seem quite right.  It's just a gut feeling.  I think this is plausible but I feel like there's enough evidence that Trump is in some way against some of the people in power.  My argument is that Trump has power as well and can actually influence the system a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  Also want to reiterate again you might be completely right, I just think it's not so clear cut.  It's way too difficult to determine what's really going on, and I think we will have a better idea once Trump takes office.

       I have no idea who is behind him.  I think my argument is that people assume Trump can't be powerful as an individual.  There is no way to know this for sure.  He could have decided to go against the establishment after being part of it for a long time.  I just think my gut feeling atm is that there is some sort of war or greater battle going on right now that we aren't aware of.

       Oh please, Trump is just the white working classes Obama. Preaching hope and change and now that hes elected already retracing his promises and filling his cabinets with snakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Bush 2000 all over again. The left will use him as their punching bag, the right will be defending his shit, and the country will be further handed over to corporations and the military industrial complex.

       Because this is a lot different than any time before it.  Just look at the bigger picture, and you can just see it's not the same as any previous time.  Trump is exposing a lot of shit.  The media HATES him.  There is a lot of weird stuff being exposed, weird pushes to silence alternate media.  The trump protests are something I've never seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Trump is establishment, even then, this election is not the same as the ones before... something is going on.

       The bigger picture? His promise of a renewed war with Iran, bowing to Israel, support of the patriot act, the urge for more stop and frisk, backing of most generals, increasing already huge military spending and lowering regulation and taxes for mega corporations?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the picture his words paint are his donors salivating.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media hated Bush too. Hollywood hated Bush. Green Day wrote ballads against him. Jon Stewart made a living satirizing him. Fox News defended him to the grave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flash to now. The media hates Trump. Hollywood hates Trump. They have a 30 Days, 30 Songs against Trump already released. John Oliver his making a living off satirizing him. Fox News is defending him to the grave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternate media is only being attacked now because it wasnt a big enough or a well respected source as it has become now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Trump protests are Soros funded and I think you forget the magnitude of the Bush protests so let me link you some proof below.

       Read that wiki article and tell me Bush didnt have an enormous group of protesters that sustained throughout most of his presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       So either you havnt seen the Bush protests or you forgot.

       Stop putting your trust into politicians. Youre just the fool who keeps putting his hand into the fire expecting not to get burned again.
