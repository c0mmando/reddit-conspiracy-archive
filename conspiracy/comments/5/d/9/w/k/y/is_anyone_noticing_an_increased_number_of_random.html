    <div class="md"><p>Wrote couple of posts on this subject of harassment calls stimulated by establishment-questioning posts within this sub.  I believe it&#39;s a way to harass dissidents.</p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced, given the timing of posts that question the police, military and the flood of robocalls and FOP/Police/Fire calls that follow within 5-20 min...that there is an automated response mechanism to detect dissidence and autodeploy callbank calls to your number, despite being DNC (edit:do not call)...switching to VOIP seems to have helped, as has reharassing them by telling them that their service isn&#39;t helping america (firefighters excepted)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you post something that says something about the police, an automated system then will call you to make their presence known.  This creates a kind of panopticon, which is a jail where the prisoners can&#39;t see anything but the jailers can see all of them.  The calls then create paranoia and fear of having a potentially overpowered adversary just out of sight...so this keeps you in line</p>

<p>I have a facebook account but haven&#39;t signed on since a few months after I signed up and that tel nbr is no longer the one I use, my email account is ancient, and I have so far refused to add that tel nbr they keep asking for. </p>

<p>Our personal data is the new gold mine. It isn&#39;t the government doing the collecting and abusing. That is only cover story for the private data collectors.</p>
