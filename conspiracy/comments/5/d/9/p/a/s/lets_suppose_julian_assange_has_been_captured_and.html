       I mean, it seems they made even
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5d8fox/proof_the_assange_interview_was_edited_go_full/">
        fake videos of Julian Assange
       </a>
       speaking at the embassy and
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wikileaks-julian-assange-questioned-about-possible-sex-crime/">
        they didn't even let his lawyer see him
       </a>
       while the Swedish prosecutors visited him. It looks like they are working very hard to make us believe he's still in the embassy, but it's obvious there is a huge problem here (no PGP signature, hashes of their latest leaks not matching, weird twitter feed, no internet connection back on).
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The election is over! So why are they continuing or even increasing their efforts to make us believe Julian Assange is still holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy? Maybe Julian Assange was on the brink of revealing something so big that it would shatter our belief in what we thought to be the truth for many years. Just a thought.

        Assange’s Swedish defense lawyer, Per Samuelsson, complained that he has been barred from the hearing.
       </p>
       <p>
        “I’m not on the list of persons that Ecuador has drawn up and allowed to be present,” Samuelsson told the Swedish national broadcaster SVT. “An Ecuadorean lawyer has taken up this question as a formal issue in the introduction of the hearing.”

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Both Assange and his Ecuadorian attorney had requested Samuelson's presence, but the Ecuadorian prosecutor did not agree.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Assange faced the choice not to participate, which was my advice, or to proceed without me," Samuelson said. "He felt at the time it was necessary to proceed as best he could."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Fifty-seven questions were posed about an event in Sweden where I know the facts and know Swedish law, and he was denied that right [to representation], which is serious," Samuelson said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why did Assange purportedly reject Samuelsson's advice and proceed with the interview?

       It remains my suspicion that Assange cut a deal under the table with the dems (HRC &amp; Obama) to dial back the email leaks in exchange for pardon/release.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that the first sign of that deal surfaced in Sept 2016 when Sweden suddenly relented on their otherwise staunch refusal to interview Assange in the embassy - and set a date of 10/17/2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's difficult for me to ignore the proximity of that date to Assange's "disappearance.".  What if "they" knew that Sweden would drop their case on that day, and Assange would walk?   And what if plans, equipment, and teams were already in place to grab him on that day when he was on his way "home" after walking out?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's true that a theoretically more right leaning deep state was the source of the leaks to Wikileaks, and wanted a Trump presidency - and maybe this isn't true - it may provide a motive for killing a deal, nabbing Assange,  and ensuring that the steady flow of leaks continued.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've since seen WL change tone and character.  In some cases wildly.  We've seen WL appear to take personal positions on issues whereas they previously kept a strict journalistic integrity around this.    Posts are never signed now.  WL's assurances around JA's safety etc seem weak and contrived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the problem of bringing him back - if he's even still around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, my 2 cents for the conspiracy du jour.

       Wouldn't Assange have a relatively sophisticated dead man's trigger?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was him, I would have two systems in place. One that I can trigger by doing an action myself and one that will be triggered automatically by a timer and the timer needs resetting for instance every month. If there's no reset within the set timeframe, the release will automatically occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       A dead man's trigger that relies on an action from your side when your in trouble, makes no sense. If you don't have access to the internet you couldn't use the trigger. Surely Assange would have thought about that.

       Thats why its called "dead mans". My guess is torture. They can try to get info out of him. With crypto the absolute must is authentication. No pgp. No dkim. No proof. We know what happened. Thats the beauty of crypto. its either 100% or its bunk. All the assange stuff points to it being compromised.
