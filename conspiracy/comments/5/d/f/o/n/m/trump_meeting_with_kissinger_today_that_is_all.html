<p>What you do need to explain, however, is how you think a guy who has spent most of his life doing billions of dollars in deals with Wall St banks and owns an actual skyscraper on Wall St itself is supposed to be free of suspicion that he is going to favor Wall St? He has associated with that group for decades, and you think somehow, someway, he is going to forget all of that overnight and become a champion of the people? Lmao the naivete is astonishing.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not talking about you. They&#39;re talking about the people who legitimately thought Trump was going to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; of all the corruption.</p>

<p>And really, the choice was between a person who has been caught being corrupt and a person who has been caught being corrupt. We went with the latter.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the comparative level of the corruption wasn&#39;t significant. They&#39;re both lying shitstains who have no business running our country, and neither of them had even an ounce of credibility that might warrant some faith in their ability and/or willingness to govern in the interest of the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d think people in this sub would have learned that nothing is simply black and white. </p>

<p>Is there someone else who had a legitimate shot at becoming President that had <em>less</em> ties to TPTB? No matter how you look at it, Trump was their best bet. It seems like some people here <em>want</em> to live under the impression that there is no way out, and welcome the boot stomping their face as an inevitable fact of life. </p>

<p>Instead of continuing to speculate about his motives, why not just wait and see what happens? Of course he&#39;s going to talk to Kissinger, and everyone else in the chain of power, but it doesn&#39;t matter until he actually does something. Don&#39;t fault people for trying to inject some positivity into the tinfoil shit-cloud of reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know for sure, but you can make a pretty safe bet based on who he has surrounded himself with since the election.  There is a saying that seems apt here: &quot;I don&#39;t need to be an engineer to know a bridge is broken&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to see that he was just saying whatever people wanted to hear while working together with GOP establishment members and former Wall St employees.. hell, it wasn&#39;t even hard to see before the election if you paid attention to who he hired onto his campaign team.  </p>

<p>And he didn&#39;t make people any more aware than they already were.  You forget how much anti-establishment talk there was prior to the election.  It wasn&#39;t like Trump woke everyone up, give me a break.. all he did was ride the wave of disenchantment with the status quo.</p>

<p>Tell you what, I&#39;ll save your comment or you can save mine and we&#39;ll settle up in a few months after it&#39;s become painfully obvious whose side he was actually on.  </p>

Right now I think it&#39;s too early to tell so I&#39;ll stay hopeful, but I&#39;ll definitely give you props if you&#39;re right. Yeah its a bet then.</p>

<p>He made people aware.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t think people were aware before this election? Occupy, Tea Party, <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>, /pol/, InfoWars.... millions of people that were already aware before this election cycle even began.</p>

<p>Bernie and Trump read the room, as they say. They knew the silent majority of people would gobble up the anti-establishment, populist rhetoric, and they both nailed it. </p>

<p>Once Bernie got fucked over by the establishment, Trump had this in the bag. Hillary couldn&#39;t play to the anti-establishment sentiment that was so pervasive in the population because she <em>was</em> the establishment, and her loyal subjects were the cause of the fuckery that knocked Bernie out of the race. All the DNC could do was to hope Donald did something so audacious that people couldn&#39;t stomach voting for him. </p>

<p>The cuts were too deep, though. Even through his horrendous behavior and divisive rhetoric, Trump continued to work up the anti-establishment crowd, including a ton of Bernie&#39;s supporters (the &quot;Bern it up or burn it down&quot; crowd), and he grabbed enough of them in WI, MI, OH, PA, etc., to gain the electoral votes he needed.</p>

<p>So yeah, Trump spoke out against the establishment, but he didn&#39;t do it to wake people up. He did it to play to the anti-establishment folks&#39; confirmation bias. It worked like a fucking charm.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Kissinger was really the acting shadow government President all these years.  Every admininstraition since Jimmy Carter can&#39;t do anything without asking for Kissinger&#39;s advice, even today.  Obama couldn&#39;t take a leak without Kissinger&#39;s approval for some reason.</p>

<p><em>&quot;In November 2002, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to chair the newly established National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States to investigate the September 11 attacks. Kissinger stepped down as chairman on December 13, 2002 rather than reveal his business client list, when queried about potential conflicts of interest.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Interesting of note:</p>

<p>Kissinger is a member of the following groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aspen Institute</li>
<li>Atlantic Council</li>
<li>Bilderberg Group</li>
<li>Bohemian Club</li>
<li>Council on Foreign Relations</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, another the_donald regular. </p>

<p>Let me remind you what subreddit you&#39;re in. 9/11 was not perpetrated by Muslims. Al-Qaeda and ISIS were not created by Muslims. I&#39;d argue that every major terrorist attack that has had traction on the MSM and affected white people was orchestrated by non-muslims.</p>

<p>So who are these new faces on this sub that back a man that promises to CRUSH ISIS &amp; strengthen surveillance. This man is just another flavor of the establishment dropping crumbs for the alt-right this time, perpetuating the division of our country and validating the fake war on terror. Most of our enemies throughout the last two centuries have been manufactured to justify our hatred for these boogie men and to make us feel good about killing innocents in our name and our blood soaked tax dollar.</p>

<p>I am far from apathetic, you are, you&#39;ve been had. You think you can just rest easy because you think your candidate is any different than any that have come before him. You ain&#39;t woke. You&#39;re just a fucking drone like the rest of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL come the FUCK on...</p>

<p>We are talking about the same guy who employs small contractors to do work, and then refuses to pay them until they take him to court?</p>

<p>The same guy that thinks minimum wage is too high, even though a huge majority of his employees work for minimum wage.. Effectively telling most of his work force (who are living in poverty) that they&#39;re over paid?</p>

<p>The same guy that criticizes other&#39;s for putting their businesses overseas, &quot;killing America&quot; with their practice... Only to build his gigantic towers with Chinese steel, acquired through shady loopholes?</p>

<p>The same guy that thinks billionaires are only hoarding their money because they aren&#39;t making enough money, so if we give them more money by cutting their taxes, they will surpass the threshold of greed and pass into generous territory?</p>

<p>Come the FUCK on, man.. I&#39;m by no means a Hillary supporter, but I&#39;m not a god damned fool, either..</p>

<p>The media didn&#39;t tell me any of this, I ALWAYS do my own research. I never let anyone force feed me ideas, and never have been that type for the 30 years I&#39;ve been alive.. The entire establishment that you&#39;re assuming I follow can fucking blow me.</p>

<p>But I would like to hear your ideas on how we are going to prevent private contractors from hiring illegals to build that wall.. Since that should be a more discussed subject anyways. Illegals don&#39;t cross that border and employ themselves. Greedy people who don&#39;t want to help out Americans are the ones employing them. But somehow no one points the finger at greed.. </p>

<p>You think building that wall is going to eliminate the same greed that fuels the illegal job market? HA.. HA HA. Funny.</p>

<p>Oh, so you’ll remember when Trump ordered two priceless sculptures to be destroyed instead of donating them and receiving a huge tax break.</p>

<p>How ‘bout when he hired the 200 undocumented Polish workers to tear down Bonwit Teller?</p>

<p>Or when he claimed to control 50% of the Empire State building, though he never did.</p>

<p>Or his publicly sexist comments directed at his own wife, Ivana, before cheating on her with Marla Maples.</p>

<p>Or when Ivana claimed that Donald had forced her to have sex, aggressively enough to where she felt “violated” by her own husband.</p>

<p>Or when he masqueraded as his own publicist, “John Miller”, intentionally dragging his messy relationship status with Marla into the press in order to feed his megalomaniacal addiction to publicity.</p>

<p>Or when the Justice Department sued his real estate company, twice, for racial discrimination against black people who were denied renting his apartments across NYC.</p>

<p>Or when the New Jersey Casino Control Commission fined the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino $200,000 for racial discrimination.</p>

<p>Or when John O’Donnell’s book came out, in which he quotes Trump as saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or the tenant intimidation after he purchased rental properties on Central Park South, cutting off heat and hot water to the current residents and refusing to make necessary repairs, and then suing the tenants for $150 million when they complained about the conditions.</p>

<p>Do you remember that bankruptcy his company had to file? No, not that one in 1991. No, not that one in 1992. No, not that 2004 one either. Yeah, that one in 2014.</p>

<p>What about that time that Trump’s casinos were fined by the New Jersey Gaming Commission for violating gaming rules? No, not that time he was fined for his father giving an illegal loan of $3.5 million. No, the fine imposed for the lobbying against the Indian casino in the Catskills was breaking New York state law, not New Jersey. Yeah, that time his casino bought mafia-linked gambler Robert LiButti nine luxury cars. </p>

<p>Or when the Federal Trade Commission fined him for antitrust violations in his attempts to buy up stocks of Holiday and Bally’s without disclosing his intentions.</p>

<p>Astonishingly, every single one of these events were in the papers that you seem to think were full of his &quot;good deeds&quot;.</p>

<p>You remember all that? &#39;Cause I sure do. I&#39;ve been alive for all of it. I&#39;ve watched this slimy, shady, conman screw over anybody that he needs to for his own interests, and now I&#39;ve watched him pull his biggest con of all.</p>

<p>But, yeah... he handed a couple Benjamins out to folks when he felt they served and serviced him up to his standards. What a swell guy.</p>

The elites aren&#39;t all powerful, all knowing Gods.  They are pathetic sniveling scumbags.  They are afraid of the people.

<p>Agreed. And some of it is humorous in nature, but it&#39;s impossible to tell without an annoying /s tag. There&#39;s more of that apathy that is serious, than I&#39;d care to admit. I too feel ashamed when I see my fellow humans &quot;curling up without a fight.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>actively trying to convince people that it&#39;s hopeless is evil in my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. And I hope that&#39;s not what you perceive of me. I&#39;m only suggesting that placing that hope (trust) in the political machine, has proven to backfire, more often than not. Even when we did have a president who actively fought this corruption (JFK, and no he wasn&#39;t perfect.) the political machine stepped in and &quot;removed him from the table.&quot;</p>

<p>For me, personally, I&#39;m being patient. I want to see him last to inauguration, and beyond. I want to see what he will do.</p>

<p>But I also believe there is more to the job than either of us are aware. There is a reason Obama&#39;s hair has become so grey in such a short time, and it is, most likely, stress. The stress that comes from knowing what&#39;s &quot;the right thing to do&quot; in a situation, and having your hands tied to the point of compromising your entire belief system. Hopefully he will feel the need to write extensively after he leaves office, for I feel he was someone that &quot;drank the Kool-aid&quot; and honestly believed he would bring about something other than our current situation.</p>

<p>I fear the same will happen to Trump, and regardless of what he wants to do, he will be pressured constantly, to compromise his own belief system.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be watching his hair closely... :)</p>

<p>And it shows, but it&#39;s misguided. If I was apathetic I would not give two shits about any of it. I do care. I care about us all meeting in the middle to burn every last crook at the stake. I wish you and your candidate all the best of luck. I truly do hope he drains the swamp, but fuck his stances on surveillance and the supreme court. </p>

<p>And what is this treasure you&#39;re talking about? I wonder how vague you&#39;re going to keep that National Treasure plot device a mystery to us. If you&#39;re just talking about lots of gold I&#39;m going to be disappointed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not doubting that the Vatican is a major player and has wicked assassins. I&#39;m just saying I don&#39;t see a world where they&#39;re at the top of the pyramid. The bloodlines ruling Earth are older than even the Vatican. There is no one sub-faction that is ultimately at the top. These groups are just outgrowths of a much more unspoken society.</p>

<p>You just got done implying that factions at the top of the power structure wouldn&#39;t put themselves in the spotlight, now you&#39;re telling me &quot;the jews&quot; ain&#39;t players because they&#39;ve never taken this very/highly scrutinized position with the Fed.</p>

The treasury is just the Vatican money and the Rothchilds look after it, they do not own it as is sometimes stated.  The Jesuits/Vatican are a top tier player imo.

<p>He may be a savvy businessman, but you don&#39;t become a billionaire without the blessings of that evil force. His daughter relinquished her own religion to marry into another prominent Jewish real estate family. Now they have significant influence on Trump. That&#39;s what we can see. Imagine the forces we don&#39;t see. His meeting with Kissinger is essentially a primer on what is expected of Trump over the next four years. This was a tumultuous election which has divided the country more than ever and set the stage for Hagelian Dialect and major moves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> used to be anti patriot act, anti 9/11 official story. But now we are faced with a influx of shit stains that spout cuck and insult rather than have a mature objective discussion.</p>

<p>9/11 was not perpetrated by Muslims. Al-Qaeda and ISIS were not created by Muslims.  I&#39;d argue that every major <em>terrorist</em> attack that has had traction on the MSM and affected white people was orchestrated by non-muslims. </p>

<p>So who are these new faces on this sub that back a man that promises to CRUSH ISIS &amp; strengthen surveillance. This man is just another flavor of the establishment dropping crumbs for the alt-right this time, perpetuating the division of our country and validating the fake war on terror. Most of our enemies throughout the last two centuries have been manufactured to justify our hatred for these boogie men and to make us feel good about killing innocents  in our name and our blood soaked tax dollar.</p>

<p>Kissinger has been instrumental in helping the war machine continue on unchecked. Trump is just another of the same ilk and whether the crumbs drop on the left or the right next time, we will be so blindly yelling at each other while they rob our liberty right from under us. The only thing surveillance does is silence dissonance and protect our government from those of us that are truly awake. </p>

<p>I used to believe this as well but I am hoping this election proves me wrong.  If Trump really is the president TPTB wanted the whole time that would make it appear that they are plotting something terrible.  I like to believe that Donald is our chance to finally fight back but that may just be wishful thinking.  I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt for now. </p>

This is a result of MSM slanting all their coverage to Trump&#39;s supposed verbal assaults on women while ignoring all of the damning information about Hillary and the gang. Soros is pouring money into European and American activist organizations, AKA paid protestors, to incite violent opposition. In short, there will be chaos, and Trump will crack his whip which will only energize that group. Civil war is possible. Perfect way to consolidate power even more. Throw in a few terrorist attacks from &quot;ISIS&quot; or some violent Mexican cartels operating close to within our borders and shit will hit the fan as far as our liberties.</p>

<p>Downvoting numerology on this board is a conditional response, for some reason, but it&#39;s clearly in play with Trump. This is a deep topic, but here&#39;s some of the basic info regarding the Saturn cube:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedeepzone.com/2016/11/the-importance-of-planet-saturn-and.html">http://www.thedeepzone.com/2016/11/the-importance-of-planet-saturn-and.html</a></p>

<p>Trump will be 70 years, 7 months, and 7 days old his first day in office after the inauguration. &quot;Saturn&quot; in Jewish Gematria = 511. Trump&#39;s book &quot;The America We Deserve&quot; was released on 1/15/2000, an inverted 5/11. &quot;January fifteenth, two thousand&quot; = 343 in Reduction. 7x7x7 = 343. Trump&#39;s campaign was launched 511 days before the election. The fake assassination attempt in Reno was on 11/5. Even Trump&#39;s birthdate ties to 777 via prime number relationships. 6/14/19/46 becomes 13/43/67/199, summing to 322, the Skull &amp; Bones number. The 322nd prime number is 2137, and 21x37 = 777.</p>

<p>Anyway, whether or not any one of those individual connections are coincidental, it&#39;s impossible to imagine Trump as just a random wealthy businessman who somehow found a way to topple the whole empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prime numbers are very vital in numerology. From my perspective, they are a key mystery to the universe, as no formula that determines whether or not a number will be a prime currently exists.</p>

<p>The beginning sequence of prime numbers is as follows:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41</p>

<p>So in my initial post, where &quot;6&quot; was Trump&#39;s birth month, you instead take the 6th prime number, which is 13. 41, the 13th prime number, is also something you should pay attention to. It is used symbolically far more liberally than 13, as it is less obvious to the unlearned observer. A good example of this is John Lackey of the Chicago Cubs (yes, this extends into sports). He was born on a day with 103/130/31 numerology, wears #41, and &quot;John Lackey&quot; = 41. Naturally, he was slotted in as the Game 4 starter in the World Series, and lost, setting up their 3-1 comeback.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;d like to point out that while I believe numerology is in large part used by the elite to communicate with one another through the media and other means, there is a very real sort of magic to it, as if the numbers themselves have some sort of conscience. So I struggle to figure out what number symbolism we see in our world is human-controlled, and what is naturally-occurring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And your overestimation of how powerful the elite are is why everyone is so hopeless about the situation.  Even after Trump wins this historic election (and brexit) the doom and gloomers are still creating apathy among the population.  This woe is me rhetoric is weaponized but propagated mostly by the lazy, who are really too comfortable with their own situations, probably not working, living off the state or their parents.   People like this are the bane of the revolution.  Trump has proven that the elite  are not as all powerful as we think they are and the revolution is happening as we speak, get on board or STFU.</p>

It&#39;s true, most people are either too busy working to survive or ignore the system because it benefits them, but to say it is an overestimation that these people wield great power assumes that voting counts, both candidates are not theirs, and all wars, conflicts, laws and bills passed were by chance or popular vote. Look at their actions. Who benefits? I hope Trump is the real deal, but I think we&#39;re headed for another disappointment.</p>
