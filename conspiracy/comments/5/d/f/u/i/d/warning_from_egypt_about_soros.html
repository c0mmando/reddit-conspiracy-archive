       Pedes,
      </p>
      <p>
       I am noticing a pattern the U.S is going through that's very similar to that of my own country, Egypt. In 2013 Egypt started some major swamp drainage which still continues to this day. We were getting rid of both cucks and Islamists under president Sisi. We were undoing the dark works of Obama, Hillary, and Soros. Soros fucked with our country big time and Egyptians fighting back to restore their country wasn't easy. We had to go through extremely tough days just because we were getting in the way of the elite's plan to "tame" Egypt and force it to be part of the false song of globalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think Trump's win is it, you're wrong. You're so wrong and if you continue to behave like it's the ultimate win, you will lose EVERYTHING. The elite will fight hard, the media will be ruthless. Violence may increase, your beliefs will be challenged. Trump's win is only the beginning of the fight. All it did is put you in the battle arena. Before that, you weren't even eligible for a fight. A Trump win only means "okay, show me how you fight".
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed a significant increase in shitposts (keep them coming they're awesome) but they can't be at the expense of enlightening posts. Keep digging, keep exposing, make videos, talk to friends. Do everything in your power. Fight! Don't get lazy now! Outside of this arena you're in, being lazy was less dangerous. You can't afford this laziness now. You will get rekt and broken forever.
This is a war between the people on one side, and a monstrous elite armed with insane amounts of money and an overwhelming army of brainwashed citizens. It's not easy folks. It's the fight of your lives. Wake up and fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't hate the other side. Don't forget that you used to be brainwashed too. The message is not to fight your fellow citizen and destroy them. You want them to wake up. Be noble and brave.
Now MAGA!

      </p>
      <p>
       2 : ) the elites fear him, maybe they hate their taxrates going down i dunno lol, the biggest fear of the elite is lower taxrates maybe.

      <p>

       ..no, he's clearly saying Sisi was good, but not enough.
I don't get how r/conspiracy got turned into this Trump shit.
Trump is just has elite as anyone else up in wall street, the fact you pepes actually think he'll drain the swamp is rediculous. Trump was born in and loves the swamp, he'd, if any thing make it worse. The guys is known for insider training...
 I'm just ranting at this point, but I could go on.
But it really blows my mind all these Trumpers  think Soros is behind all anti-Trump shit. Like do you really think you need funding to convince people to hate this facist?

       You're free to believe whatever you want about Trump, but to say Soros isn't behind all the Anti-Trump shit, funds BLM, Moveon.org, all the recent protests, destabilizes countries and profits from it, then you are in cognitive dissonance.

       This guy is clearly behind it all, and just met with the DNC members to continue to plot his bullshit here. Number 1 enemy of the state at this point

       There is a vast network of propaganda outlets that work together in efforts to destabilize countries and inspire uprisings, insurgencies, and regime changes. Soros is a big player, and a fair boogeyman, but there are many more operations contributing to it. To name a few - The Council on Foreign Relations, Freedom House, Google Jigsaw and Alphabet. It's embedded deep into our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe the goal here is for regime change or insurgency in the United States. I believe it is to misdirect liberals with red herrings and strawmen to make them believe when they oppose Donald trump they are "fighting against hatred and bigotry and evil", and this political force can be brought upon him when Trump pushes policies or purges neo cons that liberals would actually favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republican or Democrat, they can't allow any president or political figurehead gain too much popular support and unity in the country, as that would give them to much power and be a threat to their agenda.

I've been in some of those protests, I know people from them. We're all regular people, kinda not very well off. I WISH there was someone funding us, but no, we're using cardboard and printer paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, maybe I'm just lying to throw you off the trail so when you slip I can finally crown Hillary as supreme dictator.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in case you didn't know, since your in your cuck circle, the majority of protestors are not pro-hillary, just anti-trump. I mean I hate Hillary too, she did the coop in Hondurus and much much worse things, and yet Trump scares me more than the crooked dynasty.

       Did you not see the Craigslist ads hiring protesters?

       2) their website shows they are taking applications. Check out where their offices are. I did find it interesting that the Portland protests were so huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Wikipedia says that Ralph Nader founded this non-profit. It's had some controversy for not paying employees minimum wage. Confirmed here, a large class action lawsuit against them:
       <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/07/15/the-liberal-sweatshop.html">
        http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/07/15/the-liberal-sweatshop.html
       </a>
       If you read reviews of the organization on indeed.com, most employees are extremely disgruntled. This is the type of non profit who hires kids out of college and works them to death, canvassing in the streets all day. Most employees only last a few weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) I found some reports of FFPI paying protestors in the past. They put ads on Craigslist for people who wanted to help get Obamacare passed and the second link is another mobilization climate change. Apparently Soros put 5 billion into FFPI and other similar organizations for this purpose.

       5) This points out that many of the umbrella organizations UNDER FFPI are funded by Soros. (So clearly FFPI is as well.)

       As much evidence you can find won't change my mind. Yes people may be getting paid for it, but I do not believe that to be the main cause of protests. Are you still ignoring the fact Trump incited violence at his rallies? Calls for a ban on all Muslims, to deport all illegal citizens. Has been endorsed by the KKK, his supports are extreme facist Nazis, yes I've been on the_Donald and /pol/ that discuss eugenics quite lightly. He has sexually harassed multiple people, and is about to go to court for it in December. And has made fun of the disabled......
      </p>

       But no, the only reason it's popular is b/c people are being paid to say he's bad.

       Give me a bit I'll get the sources. I don't know why you need them since a simple Google will find you anything I found. But give me a bit, I'm at work I got shit to do, then I'll prove you're wrong. But the banning of Muslims and deportation of all illegal citizens is in his first 100 day plan.. and yes Hillary said a KKK member was her old mentor, but I don't even support Hillary, and Trump is currently endorsed.
      </p>

       But let me ask you then, you've never seen any of the stuff I've talked about? Some of your orginal sources were from 4chan so I know you'd be well aware of these facts. But hey I guess I have to go look up the obvious while you look up obscure shit. Like you probably are a little right with Soros funding Some of the stuff, but you're saying all of it is this guy? That's how you make a scapeghoat.

       Fuck race! I'm half black and I stay away from Muslims and stay away from all black neighborhoods. Why?

Islam and the Ghettos are terrible ideologies and cultures and if you protect these sorts of things you are going to pay for it big time in the future.

       SJW and free speech go hand in hand. 
Those violent hell holes are that way because of poverty and society, not race. Poverty is not biological.
We people on the left?(I'm not a liberal, hate them too) are for freedspeech. That's what safes spaces are all about. You don't get to go into a Holocaust remberance social screaming Heil Hitler. It's not about limiting people, it's allowing for survivors of violence to be heard and not told how to feel.

       It's also because of race, religion, ideology, and most importantly culture. Saudi Arabia for example is filled with Oil money in the Billions and they are still producing fundamentalism and spreading terrorism, so "poverty" isn't an excuse.

       Safe spaces is a mental disease. If its unchecked, it can become the next Nazisim by attacking anyone who is against it.

       Well obviously we need to agree to disagree at this point. I would say do more research of safe spaces, they really are about freedom of speech. The fact that you call them Nazis while defending KKK a comment ago is interesting though..
And I never said my world was a happy place to be, in the contrary if fucking sucks, but I actually try to not contribute to this shit stain. But hay if you like shit too, then go for it, I guess I can't convince you not to. 
But to let you know too, freedom of speech is already dead. So hence the "freedom of speech zones" and the fact that protesting is becoming more and more illegal, but no is the SJWs, who are causing facism, not the police state.

       This is the generalization fallacy. No one means that ALL protesters are on the payroll. They don't need to do that and it's a silly assertion. All they need is a few key professional leaders to guide the flock, subtly or obtusely.  Aaron Black has been spotted in the crowds, this guy has been exposed as a literal shill. Perhaps he's the only pro involved? I dunno, but it's not far fetched that someone like Soros is spending shinny penny's to influence, infiltrate, and shape the protests.
      </p>

       Think of how the tea party started with Ron Paul then got co-opted. Or how occupy wallstreet started as a single issue protest but the  evolved into a shit show of protesting everything that isn't the 1%.  This shit happens, and it happens easier than you might think.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're really daring and want to prove it, go to a protest and find out about the organizers, get cozy, and see what it takes to climb the ranks.

       By this you mean you are willfully embracing your cognitive dissonance. As a protester I know that you are actively protesting someone who defeated a known traitor and someone involved in child trafficking.

       As a protester I think that you are a cry baby loser who should have been protesting when the DNC rigged their primary not when their corrupt candidate got her ass handed to her by America.

       Honestly, you'd have to be pretty removed from society to be surprised that people in large cities protested Trump. Almost no one here wanted him to be president, and of all the people that felt the strongest about being anti-him and pro-her were in the same big cities so hello... a little common sense please

       See what always happens with dumb leftists. You say he's hateful. I ask how and you switch to credibility. I ask why they aren't credible and again you will switch back to racism or anti semitism. I love it bc you just discredit yourself that way. Just like the whole dnc and msm did this cycle.

       Name something specific. You can't do it, can you. The "renegade Jew" article the media is parading around was written by a Jew. Name something. Are you one of these people that thinks "feminism is cancer" is a hateful title? If so, then you'd agree that every leftist outlet that says "hey white people, stop doing xyz" or "can white people just stop..." Is also "hateful" right?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fascism"? Lol. And now leftists think enforcing the law is "fascism". If any migrant is here illegally and we lock them up, that's enforcing the law. If any protestor blocks traffic and we lock them up, that is the law. You arguments are so paper thin that it gives me confidence in our future. Not to mention the fact that our side owns all the guns. Do you have a sauer 762, Remington 700 and flick 17? Didn't think so.

       First, still avoid the question. So you slander someone without any proof. That's why the only leftist argument left "you're a racist" no longer works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, "minority"? No we just wiped the floor with the left and trump won more electoral votes than anyone in the last 50 years. It's now been shown also that 3 to 5 million votes for Hillary were from illegal aliens. They have already begun to be purged from the voter rolls (CNN didn't tell you that one did they?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the fact that you think enforcing the law is fascism is why you are a morally bankrupt loser. If you consider the president enforcing the law equally on everyone fascist, then I guess you're right, trump will be your worst nightmare. As Steve bannon brilliantly said, we are in the top of the first in a new Republican Party. We didn't win the war, we only one the first and most important battle. Scream "white privilege" and "cultural appropriation" as loud as you can while those terms still mean anything. You'll miss them when they're gone because you have no other arguments obviously. "REEEEE!!! RACISM!!!" Lol

       Trump won 306.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama won 365 the first time, and 332 the second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill won 370 and 379
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush Senior got 426
      </p>
      <p>
       So Trumps 306 is pretty, well to be blunt, unimpressive.

       Good point. Also, the elites in control are direct descendents of families that have been ruling for many many generations, so they also have a lot of psyop knowledge that most asleep have no clue of - not to mention the technology their money can buy.
      </p>
      <p>
       These much longer timelines allow them to conceal their agendas in plain sight. Like:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why would Netanyahu have anything to do with all this, including playing Trump? Don't be ridiculous man, that's just a conspiracy theory. Isreal is just another country playing the diplomatic game.
       </p>

       Long game beats short game; where players give up, get tired, get distracted, feel defeat again and again... etc.

       For us to win the fight we need everyone to wake up. Most of us in the world are just corporate slaves driving ourselves into a corporate grave. Things look bleak when so many people believe their oppression is progression. Stockholm syndrome is rampant. Still you give hope and we need that more than ever now.

       Because he fucking wants power and the best way to get elected this year was to seem anti-establishment ?

      <p>
       Holy fuck in a conspiracy sub it's a controversial idea that some people crave power.

       Do you think the elite hates their taxes going down or what ? that the industrialo-military complex hates having more contracts ?

       And not every one attacks him viciously, he have one koch brothers in his side and the industro-military complex loves him. there is always many interests in fight, even the elites have infighting between them.
      </p>

       i can rephraze the question, if he's so dangerous for the status-quo, why did the financial markets rise aftet he was elected ?

       OP's analogy to fighting is a good one. However, still rooted in old game style thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       With years of alternative / what some may call pseudo science research, you start seeing that co-creative or our mass consciousness is actually generating our reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means in our current paradigm as more wake up, as truths are revealed, more people think along the same lines, those corrupt must be brought to justice and made an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course fighting is just an analogy, but we need to start seeding this idea that everything starts by thought form. If enough people collectively think those criminals involved at the highest levels of government must go to jail, the higher likliehood this will happen. Good FBI and CIA agents, members of Congress and DOJ will suddenly take the appropriate steps to achieve what we are meditating on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good news is that from a few research data points/sources, we have already reached critical mass in that direction.

       Not so. Morsi was the first (an possibly the last) democratically elected leader of Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt that the Arab Spring was not organic - or that it was manipulated by the likes of those you mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the election of Morsi was an unintended outcome. Morsi started behaving in ways that really pissed Israel and Uncle Sugardaddy off - especially by turning a blind eye to the Gaza smuggling tunnels - allowing not only weapons, but food and medicine and fuel and consumer goods to reach the people of Gaza.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was ruining Israel's siege, and he HAD to be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is when the corrupt Sisi of the corrupt Egyptian Military stepped in and via a TRUE coup, seized control of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Morsi was hated by Obama and Netanyahu, who refused to communicate with him. When Sisi seized power, both Israel and the US immediately reestablished communications - in SPITE of the vicious bloodbath.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following Sisi's bloody coup, some US Congressmen proposed that US military aid to Egypt be CUT to punish them for their actions - but it was NOT cut - because a VERY powerful non-governmental organizations ordered congress NOT to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       That organization was AIPAC - the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

       The kind that are really interested in learning the

       truth, who use skepticism and solid research to delve into these topics.
      </p>

       And then there are the kind that believe Alex Jones.

       So when Alex jones was screaming at the top of his lungs that Iraq wasn't responsible for 911 and it was the Saudis, he was crazy right? How about when he was the first person to infiltrate bohemian grove and showed that the elite do satanic rituals and pray to an owl? He was crazy then too right? How about when he said before 911 that the government records every electronic communication we make. Crazy again correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about when he got behind trump before the primary and told him on air he was going to win the election? This was when every one of you leftist tards was laughing at them both. Was he crazy then too?

       Trump won 306.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama won 365 the first time, and 332 the second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill won 370 and 379

       Bush Senior got 426

       So Trumps 306 is pretty, well to be blunt, unimpressive.
