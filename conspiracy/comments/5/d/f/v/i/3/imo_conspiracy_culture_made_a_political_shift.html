        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Does anyone have any reads or theories on conspiracy culture&#39;s shift to the right?</p>

<p>Perhaps I&#39;m naive, because all I know of conspiracy culture is Art Bell, Coast to coast, and some creepy dude from Toronto who studied ancient history.  </p>

<p>I have a good ear for communications, and what I noticed with coast to coast was a subtle shift to the right, since George Noory took over. It didn&#39;t happen immediately but eventually George started to use buzz words or phrases.  The introduction as aliens being transdimensional demons came around. On a weekly basis I was hearing passing comments of Aliens as interdimensional demons. I never heard of this before, and it had almost become the norm.  The reason I don&#39;t like this take on aliens is simple. On coast to coast it became a pervasive theme/idea, and something that is demonic obviously appeals to god fearing people. A lot of God Fearing (radio listeners) are conservatives. And it only takes a sampling of America&#39;s talk radio culture to know why appealing to this group has market value.<br/>
The other thing I noticed is that very often George Noory would start speaking to the audience directly and stating that people have been getting stranger of late. He said this almost daily for awhile. And when I say awhile I don&#39;t mean a few weeks. He was stating this for years. This is a form of social psychology that&#39;s been around since the days of the twilight zone and war or the worlds.</p>

<p>These are two very simple examples, and they come from the flagship of pop conspiracy culture.  What I want to know is why? Has it been a political motivation, or simply a sell out to gain audience reach, or both? </p>

<p>I enjoyed Art Bell. He was a libertarian who kept mostly on center. Focusing on an informative and fun radio show. 
Coast to Coast used to be fun, explorative, critical, and even had even handed social justice themes. Hell I remember Art used to call out his own guests. Sometimes very creatively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s completely right you know. It&#39;s hard to have a conversation of this nature without understanding the exact description of the politic dynamic. </p>

<p>From a non US perspective all mainstream politics is far right and crazy far right in a classical sense. What makes it even more confusing is the majority of the populus equates as more progressive social values as a defining characteristic of the &quot;left&quot; whereas placing it in a far right grounding economically speaking makes no fucking god damned sense at all. I think that&#39;s one of the reasons the politics is so fucked up over there is that the ability to manifest an egalitarian society without using a grounded left ideological framework to achieve change is fucking wack and everyone goes mental trying to make it work.</p>

<p>Aside; I toyed with using the word socialism but I think most Americans don&#39;t really understand concept very well. That&#39;s not an insult either, just years and years of propaganda and misuse. The same goes for the term &quot;social Marxism&quot; which is completely weak sauce in terms of any intelligent discussion of culture. Wtf has Marx got to do with anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term &quot;cultural Marxism&quot; is often bandied about as though the rotten concept has anything at all to do with Marx. It&#39;s a conception coming largely out of the Frankfurt School and postmodernist philosophy, tendencies that despite their nominal Marxist influence are nothing of the sort. They&#39;re hostile or indifferent to the concept of the working class taking power and view the degeneration of the USSR, the travesty of Chinese &quot;communism&quot;, and the Holocaust as failures of Marxism, which they then seek to amend by the promotion of subjective-idealist concepts of identity politics. This is how we get such absurd notions as &quot;intersectionality&quot;, which says that economic class is only one of many driving factors in politics, lining class up alongside, and often subordinating it to, race, gender, sexuality, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally WE don&#39;t discuss personal political alignment. I can see how you would say that this sub seems alt-right wailings. However, Hillary Clintons &quot;Correct The Record&quot; specifically hired online internet trolls to infiltrate, spread disinformation, and suppress information. One of the places they were sent to police was Reddit. Many political subreddit a were hijacked by these CTR shills and eventually it created an US VS THEM dichotomy where certain stories that were verifiable and sourceable that were posted on niche chat forums were dismantled by: 1.Downvoting en masse 2.Posting INSANELY CRAZY stuff that discredited fine people like yourself on first visit. 3.Actually removing sources from the Internet(which archives exist which only makes them seem more real as a source) 4. Becoming mods on each subreddit and banning and shadow banning just about anyone. Many of those subreddits have been purged by now though. </p>

<p>Basically the CTR attacked Reddits channels of free thought with a CTR title as Wikileaks released emails from 2008-2016 from multiple democrat sources. It would be impossible for r/conspiracy to look anything but alt-right right now. But what I would like to stress is that WE are alt-wrong. We aren&#39;t wackos we are likely, an assumption on my part, people who have been wronged in evil unforgivable and unfathomable ways, and because of this have a distinct lack of patience reserved for blatant evil acts.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes,  but remember that Obama/Clinton were also exposed as corrupt and covertly neo con,  and the hatred of them was as intense as the love for Trump.    Also,  the globalist agenda became vastly unpopular.</p>

<p>The fact that Alex Jones,  Mike Rivero and the others became sycophants for Trump is a sad testimony to the Stockholm syndrome variation,  where they only were given one choice at meaningful opposition to their enemy,  thus were captive to a mafia like gang,   and started to like the company they had chosen to side with,   overlooking the obvious flaws in the mafia faction they had &quot;been forced to&quot; or decided to join.</p>

<p>Now that Trump is &quot;inside&quot;,   he will be establishment.    And these sycophants will give him a pass on establishing his new mafia and continuing the serfdom of the people.</p>

<p>The Trump empire will be the new Bush,  the new Clinton dynasty,  and Trumps kids are being cultivated.    Trump will be committing crime after crime in secrecy,   probably on the model of Berlusconi,  or the Republican governors of Florida and Wisconsin,  Rick Scott and Scott Walker,  perhaps becoming the first trillionaire on the planet.    After all,  he still claims to have invested his own money in the campaign,  and a 10,000% rate of return on his investment is only &quot;fair&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the aliens go, I was told by someone who used to listen to <del>Art Bell</del> George Noory that he had to add those sorts of things to appear crazy or to play the &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; role accordingly.
