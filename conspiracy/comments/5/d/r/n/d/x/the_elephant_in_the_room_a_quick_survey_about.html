       The taboo surrounding discussion of Israel has made it impossible for me to tell how anyone really feels about certain issues. I would love some feedback and thank you for your response.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Is Israeli policy is a significant threat to the well being of US citizens?
       </li>
       <li>
        Has the US has been coerced into leading foreign interventions or wars by Israel or any Israeli factions?
       </li>
       <li>
        Do any Israeli factions have substantial economic control over the US economy?
       </li>
       <li>
        Are any Israeli factions a threat to the sovereignty of the United States?
       </li>
       <li>
        Should Israel work harder to end the Palestinian conflict?
       </li>
       <li>
        Have you ever heard of the "USS Liberty Incident"?
       </li>
       <li>
        Have you ever heard of the "Zionist Occupation Government" conspiracy theory?
       </li>
       <li>
        Were any Israeli factions involved with the 9/11 terror attacks?
       </li>
       <li>
        Do you feel that Infowars.com has a pro-Israel bias?
       </li>
       <li>
        Are you interested in learning more about how you can minimize the influence of Israel on US policy?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I am sorry if I have offended anyone who identifies as Jewish. Jews are clearly a diverse group with many different beliefs.

       Is everyone familiar with Voltaire's view on Judaism?
      </p>
      <p>
       Few probably are, as his article "Jews" is absent from nearly all modern editions of his Dictionnaire Encyclopedique, even in French.

       Zionism is a supremacist collectivist ideology. (if I could speak freely I'd say Jews invented racism with their whole chosenites mantra, but saying so would be illegal in many jurisdictions, so I shall not).
      </p>
      <p>
       The "two-state solution" is a red herring, parroted by the traitors at PA and PLO, and presented by criminal governments as the only outcome to the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only viable solution to the conflict is one democratic state between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean sea. Israel is currently sovereign over the West Bank and Gaza (they control borders, money, taxation, airspace). So Israel is not democratic, as a majority of its population (West Bank and Gaza) cannot vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a Palestinian Gandhi would show up with enough clout and say "stop the violence, our fight is not one for statehood, it is one for civil rights, for all citizens, regardless of race and religion, regardless of where they live between the river and the sea, to be able to vote and be equal before the law; let that future democratic and representative government decide upon all issues we argue about. Eretz Israel." his life expectancy would quickly drop to zero. He'd be right though.

       Unfortunately, this isnt an opinion question. There is well documented evidence that supports all of these questions and much much more. Not liking the government of a country doesnt mean you have an issue with the general population of that country. I'm not a fan of the Obama administration because of the shady shit they've done, that doesnt mean i'm anti-american. Questioning governments is the most patriotic thing people can do. There are many in israel that dont support the policies of their government.

       Exactly. But deeper than this, most Jews shouldn't talk about 'race' since it's got zero to do with the Jewish religion adherents today.  Most of them are Azkenazi, and not true Jews.  I don't know why more Jews aren't upset about this...because the Zionists are destroying the religion of the Jewish people.

       This sub is not scared to tackle taboos - in fact they are a red flag which demand further investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might also want to discuss the fact that Mitochondrial (ie matrilineal) DNA proves that 95% of "Jews" today are of white European origin (the Ashkenazim) and are not semitic at all. They are a cuckoo race who co-opted true Judaism to impart some historical credentials to their pre-existing notion of being a "chosen" people. They have also physically displaced the true inhabitants of Palestine - a land to which the Ashkenazim have no cultural, historic, or genetic birthright.

       It's a very carefully worded survey, the only way to answer without outing oneself as a shill is answering in the affirmative. Though I am aware of some effective means of how to minimize foreign influence on domestic policy, I would entertain a dialogue on the matter.

       Israel is hardly Jewish, fear not. The only people you're pissing off are paid to be angry.

       My only ideas on minimizing Israeli influence on the US are to inform more people of the extent of the influence, and to make sure people are aware of which media sources (Infowars) have a hidden agenda.

       I also think more Americans could become activist/BDS/Socially Responsible investors by using their 401k funds, which are parked and making bad profits anyway for some generic mutual fund.

       Awareness, followed closely by assiduous command of action to yield transparency and redress those policies which stand to harm. Yes, excellent first steps. It's important for us all, as we increase awareness, in increase our exertion of command over our public servants. They are our servants after all, though... they are unaccustomed to taking too many orders of late it would appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I commend the notion of leveraging finances toward action as well. It works for lobbyists, it works for corporations, no shortage of reasons why the people should not profit from the same mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would add, perhaps, that a component of a more long term solution may lie somewhere in a reduction of policy altogether, or perhaps an increase in personal sovereignty, let them who suffer policy pick and choose more precisely which policies they will or won't abide by, and so profit from. (Which is not to say that I do not already acknowledge any person who withdraws their consent to be governed at all... and to elect to be a truly free and private party unto themselves.) Narrowing the gulf between Citizen and Statesperson is one thing I feel will be of great benefit in the long run for not only the American people, but all natural Persons.

       1) No, we can exodus at any time.  We can make them irrelevant by simply walking away
      </p>
      <p>
       2 and 3) Yes: they have BlueStar PR and ADL and JIDF that are basically coming in to our social websites... and propagandizing a certain perspective; meanwhile this same bluestar recruits young jewish in american college to infiltrate the political landscape and promote people who are pro-zionist. As you may have seen from POdesta emails, they get HUGE donations to these foundations and through various PACs and Charities coming from Israel to push their agendae
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile you have this massive and incredibly powerful freemason group that's attempting to politically disarm regular people... and operating the 'arts' sector--music industry, TV and film; they create and groom celebritards that are suceptible to easy reward/behavior operant conditioning and even mind control...and who show an extreme willingness to adopt their gnostic worldview.  This groups intention is to break down the family, mix up genders, mix up sexuality, pit 'political ideologies' against each other and create widespread cognitive dissonance among people to degrade and disarm them politically.  This is collectively called "fashion culture"--fashion means fast money and no political entanglements or having no political concerns.  The B'nai B'rith is similar to freemasons but more specifically Jewish.  Freemasons generally are esoteric judeo-christians who want to rebuild the temple of Solomon where the dome of the rock stands now in jerusalem and want to bring about the end of the world.  But first they want to lead from behind the US to dominate the world and clear out all the opposition at the expense of the US middle class.  Keep in mind, I'm not saying this is an Israeli intrigue...this is an international secrecy group that leans very israel because at the end of the day, it's ideologically trapped within a judeo-religious framework and believes in magic  (kabbalism and numerology)
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Technically, the government can run on its' own without the help of the citizens, and it aims to do so.  This is called totalitarianism or a fascist governement.  This describes not the type of government but the quality of government.  So it could be a fascist republic or it could be a fascist dictatorship or fascists socialism (nazi); but it can't be a fascist democracy :)  That's why you never see democracy in this world.  It doesn't exist.  It never did.  Even in ancient Greece, they called it that but it was really a republic.  Maybe a few years they had direct democracy but it became a unicorn that everyone wants to hold up as something we always want to strive for but never have.  That's what the whole "conical hat on a stick" is about.  The hat is democracy, the stick is representation
      </p>
      <p>
       5) I think Israel would become much more powerful if they ended their conflict and made friends.  The fact that they don't says a lot about who they actually are.  They are terribly antisocial.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Yes. I know.  We didn't do anything about it.  That makes us strong, not weak.  Turn the other cheek.  Forgive.
      </p>
      <p>
       7) No.  Is that like how they participated in 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       8) Yes but I believe they were outsourced by GHWB and the Continuity of Government planning members, along with PNAC and intelligence policy groups.  They were planning this for a long time.  And it's not "zionists", these are actually the nazis, only the nazis weren't nazis they were jesuits and masons... you have to peel away layers through time and then you realize these are the same people that can be traced back to mafias in Venice, Argentine, Switzerland, Germany, and Russia-- it's global fascists...antinationalists...literally the NWO and the easiest place to start studying forward to now is either back to Cecil Rhodes and his using the miners as soldiers; or back to Allen Dulles and 1933 when Hitler was made Chancellor.  If you think for a moment that 9/11 was done "by Israel" then you really don't know anythying about 9/11 and you need to start studying more...they are scapegoats..they always are.  Here's the litmus test: who wrote the protocols of the elders of zion?  Who wrote the documents upon which those protocols were based, centuries before that?  Go deeper.  all roads lead back to rome
      </p>
      <p>
       9) Um, No.
      </p>
      <p>
       10)  No, because I know what needs to be done.   You need to spyproof america.  I think that means you first of all ban government employees from being in secret societies and you have them take a loyalty oath ever 3 yrs after an initial one.  You have them answer a battery of questions like a lie-detector battery while under an MRI so you see their brainscan.  If they lie about their loyalties to freemasonry or some other special fraternity group in college, then they fail and will have to swallow the cost of the test (otherwise reimbursed), which is like 1000 dollars.  So we only really hire people who are committed and able to be loyal to america, and who have no conflicts-of-interest.  And the high cost of failure is a deterrant to keep BlueStar PR people from installing their Zionists into high office.

       38B over ten years is nothing.  Obama raised our debt from 8T to 20T in 8 yrs.  That's &gt;20 orders of magnitude greater.  Most of that going to military and intelligence, to fight terrorism that only exists because they create it for us.

       And yes, I don't see how giving money to israel has anything to do with spyproofing america by eliminating mixed loyalties.  In fact, this whole extortion game cannot exist without mixed loyalties in congress.  So let me redouble my statement on 10--answer is yes

       Thanks. Yes, Infowars used to call out Israel and discuss Zionism, you can still find these videos from like 2007. They seem to have changed strategies by 2011 and there's been hardly a mention of Israel since... aside from the whole David Duke debate fiasco after which Infowars took down their own episode.

       not to impugn any of your views, this is something not enough people know about
      </p>
      <p>
       Gen. 12:3 -
And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is speaking of Israel here, but it's important to note, this was at a time when the nation of Israel was composed of all 12 tribes/sons of Jacob. Later, after the sin of Jeroboam, the nation was split into 2 kingdoms, only the tribes of Judah, Benjamin and Levi were of the Southern Kingdom, which are today known as Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Northern Kingdom was composed of what are now known as the Lost 10 Tribes. Check into Yair Davidy's (BritAm)  research to find that many eastern Europeans/westerners are descended from those lost tribes (maybe even yourself!).
      </p>
      <p>
       the 2nd part of that Gen. quote (and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed) is referring to the Lost Tribe nations, they are also referred to as the salt of the earth
      </p>
      <p>
       also, look into what happened when Balaam tried to curse Israel (before the split), SPOILER ALERT - he couldnt do it, no matter how hard he tried

       You obviously have reading comprehension issues.  The GENETIC analyses prove that none of these Khazarians are Semitic.  You cannot be a true Jew racial member if you ain't Semitic, fool.
