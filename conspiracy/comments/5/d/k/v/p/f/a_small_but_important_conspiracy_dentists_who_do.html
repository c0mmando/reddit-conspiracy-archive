        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">185</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-11-18 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/rabbits_dig_deep.html">rabbits_dig_deep</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This saga began in April when a crown came off my tooth and broke. I had new dental insurance so proceeded trying to find a good dentist in my plan to put on a new crown. It was not easy.  </p>

<p>One dentist sent me home with a &quot;treatment plan&quot; that included oral surgery (cutting away both gum and bone), a root canal and an $800 root planing, aka &quot;deep cleaning&quot;  Total price tag of $2,364 with insurance.</p>

<p>When I asked why I couldn&#39;t have just an ordinary cleaning, which is covered by insurance, they said it would be &quot;unethical&quot; to give me less than optimal care.  This deep cleaning involves pushing a metal utensil under your gums to clean out the tartar that is supposedly creating pockets there. Requires your mouth to be numbed, in two separate visits.  I was told to expect a lot of bleeding. No wonder! My gums are healthy, pink, and affixed tightly to my teeth. There are no pockets and no periodontal disease. If I had consented, I would have paid $800 to be needlessly tortured.</p>

<p>The problem is that having the crown off my tooth (and broken so could not be put back on) made the tooth ache at times, so I wasn&#39;t sure if that meant it was infected. When I asked that question of the dentists, they were all too ready to tell me that yes, it was infected and needed a root canal, or even an extraction and then an implant for $6,174.</p>

<p>One dentist told me that the reason the crown came off is that the tooth underneath had decayed. He pointed to a dark area on the x-ray as a sign of decay. Only months later, when I finally found an honest dentist (not in my plan) was it explained that the dark spot was caused by a leftover remnant of an amalgam filling still stuck to the tooth.  </p>

<p>One dentist was ready to schedule me for a root canal without even putting me in a chair or looking in my mouth.  He looked at the x-rays and told me that because my roots were narrow, there was a possibility the probe could break off in there during the root canal, in which case he would pull my tooth. He asked if I had throbbing pain, and I said no, just intermittent aching.  </p>

<p>He said &quot;pain is pain. Your plan doesn&#39;t cover you seeing an endodontist, but I can do it Weds, does 8 am work for you?&quot;  I checked my plan when I got home, saw that my plan certainly <em>did</em> cover me seeing an endodontist (root canal specialist) and never went back.  </p>

<p>I finally found a good dentist by asking a friend who&#39;s had a lot of dental work done.  I almost cried with relief when the guy she recommended told me that all I need is a regular cleaning and to replace the missing crown.  He&#39;s not in my plan but my total cost is less than with any of the &quot;in network&quot; dentists:  $1,350.</p>

<p>Once a dentist told me I needed a root canal on a different tooth.  Because I had no pain and no insurance at the time, I decided to do nothing and just wait.  It&#39;s now 6 years later and the tooth has never given me any trouble.  </p>

<p>This is a conspiracy because I feel certain that not only the dentists, but their staffs must know that people are being scammed and perfectly healthy teeth and gums are being destroyed so they can charge big bucks.  Caveat emptor!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> My troubles with dentists actually began over 40 years ago when I went 2,500 miles away from home for college.  In my freshman year, I went for a checkup just because that&#39;s what I&#39;d always done.  Reached age 18 with no dental work, now all of a sudden I had NINE cavities that needed filling.  I was aghast but this was pre-internet and long distance phone calls were so expensive that when you moved across the country you hardly spoke to the folks you left behind.  It never occurred to me not to trust the dentist, he was a professional, right?  So I had all 9 cavities filled. </p>

<p>Was he scamming me?  I&#39;ll never know.  </p>

<p>Twenty years later those fillings were failing and all needed to be replaced with crowns.  Another massive dental bill around age 40.    </p>

<p>Now, another 20 years have passed and those crowns are failing and some need to be replaced.  Meanwhile there have been almost no new cavities, all my dental work for the past 40 years is just keeping up the repairs on those original 9 fillings when I was 18.  </p>

<p>Moral of the story:  try hard when you&#39;re young to keep your original teeth.  Fillings lead to crowns which lead to more crowns and unscrupulous dentists trying to sell you root canals and other torture.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dentist keeps trying to get my to &quot;upgrade&quot; to motorized, rotating toothbrushes, because they do a better job cleaning the teeth. At my last visit (two weeks ago) I was told by both the hygienist and the dentist that my teeth looked pretty good (and hygienist even asked me which type of toothbrush I was using).</p>

<p>My point is that within the last year, I was able to take my teeth (which didn&#39;t look as good as they should have) and brush them with my regular old toothbrush to make them look &quot;pretty good&quot; a year later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There needs to be a similar list for crooked Chiropractors. They give legit chiro a bad name. My wife will do stuff and throw her back/hips out of whack, and goes to a good chiro she trusts. In and out, effective. </p>

<p>Yet I hear stories of people who go to a chiro and he &quot;discovers&quot; that they have this &quot;dangerous&quot; skeletal condition and need a series of adjustments to correct the dangerous problem. Typically this is weekly visits over a year and costs $5k or $3k or $10k or some enormous amount of money. </p>

<p>But - But - if they don&#39;t do the series of adjustments they might DIE! GASP! </p>

<p>I know a guy who&#39;s son went in for an adjustment, they found this &quot;deadly&quot; condition - and then said it was hereditary and got the dad roped into the series of adjustments too because HE HAD IT TOO. (they didn&#39;t)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I was surprised he would admit to a mistake like that and give up $700 worth of work. I found him when I had an impacted / infected tooth. He&#39;s bypassed root canals and just filling or using crowns instead because he thought a root canal wasn&#39;t needed a few times, drained an abscessed above a tooth for free, did a cavity for half the cost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only dentists, but every doctor (except the only who are your friends or something) will do the same thing.  Last January, I went to a specialist to see if they can do a procedure.  The doc looked at my file, said yes, then I went to the billing admins and they told me they don&#39;t take my insurance.  I said, thank you and left.  I was sent a bill for $650 2 months ago.  I was so flabbergasted I called and disputed my bill.  They offered to lower it to $180.  I said, fuck you.
I was in and out in 15 minutes.  They never told me there would be a consultation fee.  The doctor did no tests or even took out his stethoscope.  I told them, I&#39;m not paying.  If they send my bill to a collection agency and if it results in my credit score getting lowered, I&#39;ll sue them.  I&#39;m still waiting to see what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had the good fortune to have the same honest dentist all my life. He doesn&#39;t take insurance, but charges reasonable rates. Never attempts to upsell me. He always recommends the most minimally invasive method possible, and stays current with evolving dental techniques and equipment but thinks critically about them, using some, rejecting others. I have no cavities, and a single filling where I chipped a tooth. </p>

<p>My husband has been to a number of dentists due to moving residences over the years, and has a mouthful of fillings. I&#39;m convinced he&#39;s had cavities drilled and filled that didn&#39;t exist - he basically got all the fillings from one dentist over the course of a year and a half.</p>

<p>I stopped going to the dentist in my 30s and didn&#39;t have a professional cleaning for 10 years. Went back to my dentist, he explained that the sonic care type powered toothbrushes pretty much changed the dentistry game and that many people can get away with just using those and flossing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest checking out the many vids by Dr. Tent on the DHS youtube page as you have time. His longer lectures, which go back years, are a treasure trove of information.</p>

<p>The biodent supplement has, I presume, ground up bone and tooth pieces as well as other nutrients and the body assimilates those for it&#39;s own use.</p>

<p>Think about how people used to make broth, they would put whole animal joints into the pot and cook it down.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve taken a lot of it in the past and it helped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve just watched most of the video that you linked. The stuff I learned is scary, and I knew our government was bad... but this is beyond disgusting. I can&#39;t believe this is going on. I had no idea that some vaccines used fetuses, nor did I know the intentional confusion between immunizations and vaccinations. I think that &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; should focus on this, instead of saying it causes autism. They would get so much further, and would be able to prove much more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;One dentist told me that the reason the crown came off is that the tooth underneath had decayed. He pointed to a dark area on the x-ray as a sign of decay.&quot;</p>

<p>yes the xray thing is a scam. I look at where they say they see cavities and it all looks the same, these xrays are blurry and black and white and I have called bullshit on dentists and gotten into arguments over it. If the tooth hurts then I can believe it but no more drilling into healthy teeth for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dentistry is often a scam.</p>

<p>Think in terms of opportunity and motive:</p>

<p>The opportunity is there.  They can say they saw a &quot;cavity&quot; on X-ray, which are open to interpretation, and then eliminate <em>all physical evidence</em> by drilling out the &quot;cavity&quot; and filling it.  It&#39;s the perfect crime! </p>

<p>The motive is also there - money.  More business = more profit.  Dentists are usually small businesses who depend on their own selling and upselling of services for revenue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main reason for such a trend of dishonesty in dentistry is psychological.  Dentistry is the epitome of a profession that one gets into solely for monetary reasons.  Nobody wants to spend their life cleaning other people&#39;s mouths.  This tends to attract particularly scummy individuals.  They also feel justified in it because of the sense of resentment they feel for having to perform such tasks.  Also the reason why dentistry is the profession with the highest rate of suicide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When a dentist does an examination and looks at your xrays, each one is going to see things according to their own opinion.</p>

<p>Imagine posting an article right here. Everybody reads the same article. But the comments are all different. You can expect some similarities in the comments, but everyone will always have their own opinion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with dentists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I asked why I couldn&#39;t have just an ordinary cleaning, which is covered by insurance, they said it would be &quot;unethical&quot; to give me less than optimal care. This deep cleaning involves pushing a metal utensil under your gums to clean out the tartar that is supposedly creating pockets there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first cleaning sounds like a prophy/polish. This cleans off the top part of your tooth and it&#39;s easy to do. The &quot;metal utensil&quot; you mentioned is a periodontal scaler and it&#39;s used for cleaning tartar off the roots of your teeth.</p>

<p>Many people get deposits of tartar below the gumline. You can see them and they don&#39;t hurt, but over time they can cause the bone to &quot;erode&quot; away from around your roots. Lose enough bone and the tooth eventually gets wobbly.</p>

<p>Having said that...</p>

<p>Yeah, dentists aren&#39;t there to run a charity. Every dental practice has a bunch of different costs. Staff salaries, rent, supplies, insurance etc. So when you show up with dental insurance, it represents an opportunity to make money.</p>

<p>Imagine having a meal plan that covers 80% of the bill at a restaurant. You show that to the waiter. Obviously some waiters are gonna show you the most expensive stuff on the menu.</p>

<p>Remember, you said you had dental insurance. To get paid for doing the treatment, a dentist always has to send in xrays/treatment plan and an invoice for the work. Insurance companies always have people working for them who compare the dentist&#39;s treatment plan to what they see on the xrays.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that very few dentists will make a bogus diagnosis. Very few dentists will perform treatment that is absolutely not needed. Those that do wind up getting in trouble at some point. </p>

<p>tldr; Many dentists will try and make as much money as they can, but they aren&#39;t out of control ... doing stuff that doesn&#39;t need to be done. A lot of what needs to be done (and doesn&#39;t need to be) comes down to variations in opinion/diagnosis.</p>

<p>ps. You can consider this comment to be reliable because I&#39;m a dentist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Salesmen selling shit you don&#39;t need that involves fucking body modification? I&#39;ll bet you&#39;d have a different definition of conspiracy if you were duped into paying thousands of dollars for an entirely unecessary procedure by &quot;professionals&quot; you trusted.</p>

<p>In the dental arena, this kind of bullshit is called &quot;creative diagnosis&quot;, and it is a big deal. Altering someone&#39;s body for no reason whatsoever other than to make your employing corporation some bucks is a serious departure from acceptability.</p>

<p>&quot;Salesmen gonna sell&quot; is nowhere near an appropriate response to this kind of fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dentist keeps trying to get my to &quot;upgrade&quot; to motorized, rotating toothbrushes, because they do a better job cleaning the teeth. At my last visit (two weeks ago) I was told by both the hygienist and the dentist that my teeth looked pretty good (and hygienist even asked me which type of toothbrush I was using).</p>

<p>My point is that within the last year, I was able to take my teeth (which didn&#39;t look as good as they should have) and brush them with my regular old toothbrush to make them look &quot;pretty good&quot; a year later.</p>
