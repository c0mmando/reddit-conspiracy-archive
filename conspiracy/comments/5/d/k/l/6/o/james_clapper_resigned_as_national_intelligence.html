    <div class="md"><p>The technology is very impressive. I saw it used to bring Grand Moff Tarkin to the screen for Rogue One despite Peter Cushing being dead for years. I&#39;ll admit that I hadn&#39;t heard about this in advance, and didn&#39;t notice on the first watch until someone pointed it out. However, one it was pointed out, the difference between the simulated Tarkin and a real person became very obvious. Not the case with Assange in that interview, even on multiple very careful viewings.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the claim that the video uses a faked Assange also needs a credible motive to explain why a well-respected journalist like John Pilger would cooperate with such fakery. He&#39;s clearly no friend on the Drumpf regime, as indicated by his new doco &#39;The Coming War With China&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>fair point, HOWEVER:</p>

<p><strong>1)  &quot;The Interview&quot;</strong></p>

<p>So let&#39;s be clear - here is the interview in question:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sbT3_9dJY4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sbT3_9dJY4</a></p>

<p><strong>2)  Theory vs. IRL</strong></p>

<p>frankly, &quot;The Interview&quot; looks incredibly fluid and authentic -- no  &quot;silver faces&quot; etc. (as your tech demo offers)</p>

<p>while your demo is a &quot;THEORETICAL&quot; game changer, it&#39;s clear that the technology is still not real-time video realistic (in terms of delivering truly authentic facial reconstruction) -- assange&#39;s interview looks NOTHING like the tech demo you linked. </p>

<p>assange doesn&#39;t look waxy (or silver)</p>

<p><strong>3) Willful Participation</strong></p>

<p>In-order for the theoretical facial duplication process to work, Julian would need to voluntarily sit in front of a screen for quite some time to &quot;train&quot; the simulator.</p>

<p><strong>4) Voice</strong></p>

<p>assange&#39;s voice is dynamic and unmistakable</p>

<p><strong>5) Topics of Discussion</strong></p>

<p>the subject of the interview remains totally damning to US interests -- something that would have been avoided if TPTB were actually in control of the interview. </p>

<p><strong>6)  Publisher</strong></p>

<p>The interview was conducted by <a href="http://dartmouthfilms.com/">http://dartmouthfilms.com/</a></p>

<p>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pilger">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pilger</a></p>

<p>it&#39;s certainly &quot;possible&quot; (though highly doubtful) that <strong><em>BOTH</em></strong> dartmouthfilms  <strong><em>AND</em></strong> John Pilger are  US puppets, given their respect long history&#39;s of being highly critical of US/Aussie political spectrum</p>

<h1>BOTTOM LINE:  Context Matters</h1>

<p>You are right to question everything!  koodos.  and in about 5 - 10 years, we won&#39;t be able to tell any differences -- which is a CRAZY consideration.</p>

<p>but no ;)  in this case, given the state of the beta tech (and the room full of context), <strong>i firmly believe that assange is alive -- intentionally laying low (and enjoying the dramatic publicity)</strong></p>

<p>/time will tell</p>

<p>I see that statement a lot.  But Ford pardoned Nixon, and I&#39;m pretty sure no charges had yet been brought.   I admit I definitely don&#39;t know how it works.  But I think it works like this: the President can issue any kind of pardon he wants, to anyone he wants.   It&#39;s possible that the pardon might not be legally effective, but as a practical matter the Clinton supporters would be screaming &quot;See!  She&#39;s innocent!&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m betting Obama does a Ford-Nixon style pardon, because I have a hunch he has some exposure.  The  Congressional counter-move should be to investigate it anyway, to torpedo the claims that &quot;Clinton didn&#39;t do anything.&quot;  She did plenty.    And I doubt Obama will have the courage to pardon the whole Clinton circle.</p>

He was looking down the barrel of prosecution. His VP and then president pardoned him for any crimes Nixon committed related to the Watergate scandal. </p>

<p>Obama can&#39;t come out and pardon Hillary and say that he&#39;s pardoning her for any crimes she committed relating to her email server. The FBI found no cause to prosecute her. Congress had hearings and nothing happened. She&#39;s feigned innocence for years and the FBI gave her a pass but she&#39;s suddenly going to admit to being guilty? No way. </p>

<p>Then you get into the aspects of the Clinton Foundation. Obama couldn&#39;t blanket pardon her for every crime she may have ever done. Doesn&#39;t work that way. </p>

<p>The exact opposite is actually settled and the executive has the explicit ability to pardon preemptively.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States, pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, have granted and by these presents do grant a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9, 1974.&#39;&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is the only thing we can go on tho. If it was done before it could be done again. </p>

<p>Fords justification for his pardon comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdick_v._United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdick_v._United_States</a></p>

<p>which suggests &quot;...that a pardon carried an imputation of guilt and that acceptance carried an imputation of confession.&quot;</p>

<p>So I agree that it is not necessarily the letter of the law, yet the precedence has still been made and stands until challenged. </p>

<p>If it happens we will get clarification. If not then thats how it goes.
My <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5dpkqk/to_address_the_pardoning_of_hillaryclapperassange/">post</a> expands on this and brings forth evidence that the presidential power of a pardon is unlimited except in 3 explicitly stated exceptions.</p>

<p>Agreed, Ive just been listening to people argue for weeks about if Clinton could be pardoned before indictment, for non specified crimes. While there are tons of people saying its not possible. No one has made an argument that she could not be. The burden of proof here is on proving that it was in fact an unconstitutional act. This, according to my knowledge, is not possible. If it is possible, I as a &quot;con law junkie&quot; would love to have the argument in my bag of tricks. Still have not seen any evidence to support that any restrictions not explicitly laid out by the constitution or the courts are imposed on this executive privilege.</p>

<p>This is a very non specific way to say &quot;I have no idea&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ford mentioned specifically identified actions of Nixon that were the basis of his offenses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please do share.</p>

<p>You said that a specified offense is implicit in the language. Again Link what your talking about because I know of nothing that would imply this anywhere.</p>

<p>You could make your argument with some esoteric British common law. This would be easily defeated. The fact of the matter is their is no legal way,(to my knowledge) that is not entirely false, or conjecture to defend anything your saying.</p>

<p>Good name drop bro, not really fitting in this circumstance tho.</p>

<p>Again you can tell me congress, the judiciary, whomever would fuck a donkey to stop the aliens from landing. Your argument is hearsay still.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please don&#39;t tell me. And I won&#39;t tell you. And we didn&#39;t see a thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume that this is an attempt to get me to dismiss the argument. Why would I do this when you&#39;ve presented 0 reason for me too. I mean this shit isn&#39;t even that difficult.</p>

<p>You have failed to provide any proof that is not your opinion, or that of another redditor which lends any credibility to your argument. </p>

<p>So prove it, or shut the fuck up :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How in the world is the term &quot;Professor&quot; possibly an insult?
But if you are not a professor, then you certainly should not be called one.  You have not denied being a professor until just now.
I took you for a professor since you seem to be a bit overly fragile while also seem to have some knowledge of the law.  It was an honest mistaken conclusion.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see that Garland adds anything at all to the issue of &quot;blanket pardons&quot;.  The issue in that case was whether an attorney practitioner in the federal bar could refuse to take a new oath to practice in the federal courts.  The fact that he was given a conditional pardon was not relevant to the holding of this case since the decision is based that new condition being ex post facto.
From the decision:  &quot;This view is strengthened by a consideration of the effect of the pardon produced by the petitioner&quot;.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m telling you that you won&#39;t find anything in black letter law that stands for the proposition that the president can issue a blanket unspecified pardon without some level of specificity as to the acts of the pardon subject or particular subject crimes of the pardon subject.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t logically fault me for failing to disprove a negative.  Therefore the burden is on you to show the existence (or at least provide some persuasive authority) of the legal efficacy of a presidential &quot;blanket pardon&quot;.  Beyond that you are conflating &quot;Russell&#39;s teapot&quot; with an argument from ignorance.</p>

<p>There are other resources such as CRS articles and the handful of federal cases in this area.  But none of them really get to the gist of what we are trying to resolve.  Carlesi v. New York, a 1914 case serves to remind that there are real limitations to the presidential pardon authority.  It doesn&#39;t function to keep the state from using the previously pardoned offense as a multiplier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy. No words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the anguish my mistakes over Watergate have caused the nation and the presidency, a nation I so deeply love, and an institution I so greatly respect.</p>

<p>Watergate, watergate, watergate. </p>

<p>No, he couldn&#39;t. You&#39;re conflating two things. There&#39;s a stark difference between a situation (Nixon) where evidence has mounted and prosecution is imminent and a situation (Clinton) where no evidence has been brought and where no prosecution is imminent. </p>

<p>Like I&#39;ve written before in this thread yesterday, the Attorney General could come out next month and say she&#39;s going to prosecute Hillary. Then Obama could pardon Hillary. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 19 May 2016, the <a href="https://cryptome.wikileaks.org/2016/05/manning-016-017.pdf">FBI told a US court</a> that it continues to actively pursue Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. On 15 March 2016, the US Department of Justice filed a <a href="https://cryptome.org/2016/03/manning-012.pdf">113 page document</a> to court saying that there is a pending national security prosecution against Assange and WikiLeaks. A federal warrant from 2012 shows that the WikiLeaks case concerns <a href="https://wikileaks.org/google-warrant/228-farrell.pdf">Espionage, Conspiracy to commit Espionage, Theft of Government Property, Electronic Espionage (classed as a terrorism offence under the Patriot Act), and (general) Conspiracy</a>. Assange’s alleged co-conspirator, Chelsea Manning, is sentenced to 35 years for revealing information to WikiLeaks. <a href="https://t.co/jQLuzITGlE">She filed an appeal</a> against her sentence on 18 May 2016.<br/>

<p>A presidential pardon may be granted at any time, however, and as when Ford pardoned Nixon, the pardoned person need not yet have been convicted or even formally charged with a crime.</p>

<p>Now none of these things has ever been challenged by the court.  According to the current interpretation of Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution. The presidents ability to pardon is absolute. The only thing the president cannot pardon is impeachment proceedings.</p>

<p>So yes I can prove your wrong because what your saying cant happen already has occurred. saying your not wrong doesn&#39;t not prove your right.</p>

<p>Congress accused Nixon of obstruction of justice and was in the process of impeachment before he resigned. He had lied under oath and was caught redhanded. He was looking down the barrel of prosecution. His VP and then president pardoned him for any crimes Nixon committed related to the Watergate scandal.
Obama can&#39;t come out and pardon Hillary and say that he&#39;s pardoning her for any crimes she committed relating to her email server. The FBI found no cause to prosecute her. Congress had hearings and nothing happened. She&#39;s feigned innocence for years and the FBI gave her a pass but she&#39;s suddenly going to admit to being guilty? No way.
Then you get into the aspects of the Clinton Foundation. Obama couldn&#39;t blanket pardon her for every crime she may have ever done. Doesn&#39;t work that way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh and this comment is partially correct in the fact that her accepting the pardon would be an admittance of guilt. This is still possible. Saying that it is not is incorrect. The odds of a pardon being slim, and it being impossible are completely different statements.</p>
