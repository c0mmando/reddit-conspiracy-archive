       For about two or three days after the election,
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       seemed like it was completely rid of CTR and the hate for HRC and the DNC resurfaced. The general idea behind the average post was that HRC failed miserably, that the people need to take the DNC back, and that Sanders had a real shot at beating Trump and the DNC took that away from everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it started again. Every post is a heaping pile of Trump-bashing fear-mongering shit. The blame is being entirely shifted from Clinton and the DNC to alt-right media outlets and "fake" news websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the end goal behind the renewed paid trolling efforts on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       ? I mean... It has to be paid trolling, right? The fact that the sub went back to normal for a few days makes me think it probably is, but I'm honestly not even entirely sure anymore. I guess it's entirely possible that people really have their heads that deep up their asses.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're back to paid trolling on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       though, what are they hoping to accomplish? Are they just pushing the "fake" news crap to actually get people behind the idea of having google and other web giants act as gatekeepers for what's true and what isn't?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just curious to hear other people's points of view on the situation.

       Yea. The sub was fine for a couple of days after the election. Seemed to be mostly Bernie supporters bashing on Clinton and Trump both, but after that it turned back into a CTR-filled shithole.

       I've been following Voat from the start, and am willing to contribute, and maybe some people can toss a few bucks my way. They built their site on  MS tech (Hail Satan - Bill Gates), rather than, open source, us devs work on. Big red flag.

       I agree. That is the catch 22 as a dev. P2p is great an all, but needs people to host content. That content could be illegal. "Encrypted", sure, but still illegal, if de-crypted. And the forces against us are powerful..

       I'm trying man, as a "conspiracy theorists" and web dev/designer.... But shit.... The deck is stacked against us all..

       Ugh that's sad they built on M$ stack. I'm a dev too and would love to work on something that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if said P2P system refused to directly serve any images or video? Liability for illegal porn would maybe then shift to imgur, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say no encryption, the purpose would be permanent content rather than secret content. It does not need to provide illegal content.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure something is out there or being written. I guess I'm proposing something similar to the failed Diaspora project, but for a reddit clone not for social media.

       I have said this so many times and nobody seems to want to listen. They are going to have the electoral college throw the vote from trump. Don't think so, look here at a top r/politics post

       <li>
        Soros paying rioters

       <li>
        Want electors to feel the need to switch from trump
       </li>
       <li>
        4m people signed petition to have electoral college not vote for trump

       It is interesting, but MSM has accepted the Trump presidency I think. Plus if they change the vote, they just might end up with national riots.

       Soros would love riots though. He is already funding the current protests. I think this EC flip thing is definitely something they are going for. But I also think they will fail just as the NeverTrump movement failed at the RNC convention. Another angle to consider is the Clintons/Obama are trying to secure their freedom. They don't want Trump to reopen investigations once in power. This stuff is probably how they are putting pressure on.

       Interesting, but I think Israel is happy with their profit margins. Martial law would ruin that and complicate the takeover of Syria for the Greater Israel mission. Edit: Israel also seems to be fine with a Trump presidency.

       This way all this drama is put to good use. It makes Hillary out to be a savior of the country. She becomes a hero. It's a much better narrative than her winning via the usual corrupt means. It isn't over. She's coming back.

       If you really want to know, I suggest watching this video.  The US has actively been at war within our own Country fighting Communism via a Cultural Marxist movement that has been using the Democratic party to spread their propaganda to unsuspecting liberals who mean well, but are naive.

       r/politics should be non-biased, but instead it's become this liberal echo chamber for pussies to cry over spilt milk. The worst part is that because of r/politics,  the right winged asshats created r/the_donald, a living, breathing, flaming pile of circlejerking dog shit.

       I think the new, unfortunate reality is polarized media. TPTB know the gig is up when it comes to their act of pretending to be neutral... so they've switched gears and are claiming, "we're good news, and they're fake news."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm actually happy they're making it so damn obvious because it's scarier when they try being subtle. Slowly, incrementally censoring shit until you don't know if it's real or you're being paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, half the voter bloc supported a candidate loathed by the usual media outlets. Then there's half of the Dems who supported Sanders and noticed how badly the media was screwing over their candidate. So do they really think that sizable a population is just going to say, "oh, okay, thanks for sheltering me from those evil websites?" Hah, no.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first I was deeply concerned about
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       being censored because I thought it was effective. But now that I've seen so many people see through the bullshit, I'm sort of welcoming it because it hastens the alternative--be it a flight to subs like ours, or the advent of a new site altogether a la Digg style.
