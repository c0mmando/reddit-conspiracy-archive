       You cannot have beauty without the ugly, light without the dark, happiness without sadness. Good times, without sorrowful times. I believe our spirit beings chose to be here, for this very test to ascension.

       . Look inward, and improving your self, helping others will come natural, and eventually you will become the change you wish to see in the world. Hope this helps, a little.

       My secret is that I always have a ticket to some awesome event in my pocket. "The world cant end until my Run the Jewels concert in February" lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       After RTJ concert..."The world cant end until Amnesia Rockfest in July 2017"
      </p>
      <p>
       I just keep it going year after year of concerts, festivals, nhl games, nba games. The kind of stuff that makes you forget about the bullshit we are witnessing day to day. When you have something like that to look forward to you sort of aim to get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       To add to this, material items are just not worth it to me. I put all my spare money towards having fun. Good memories are great for your overall well being. Travel, party, do drugs, do whatever the fuck you want because...YOLO for real. As Killer Mike said....

Smoke kush, fight, laugh hard and live long
That's the antidote
You defeat the devil when you hold onto hope
'Cause kinfolk life is beautiful
And we ain't gotta die for them other men
And I refuse to kill another human being
In the name of a government
'Cause I don't study war no more
I don't hate the poor no more
Gettin' more ain't what's more
Only thing more is the love
So when you see me
Please greet me with a heart full
And a pound and a hug

       i seriously get you here. I nearly had a nervous breakdown when i finally "awoken". I started to question everything about my life. My memories of school became so...scary (saying prayers and singing the national anthem every morning, having a set slave labor schedule, get told when to eat, when to use the bathroom, when to wake up, when to go to sleep...)? Feeling like I've been lied to for my whole life.  I got this strong feeling of "What is the point anymore?". At that point you think about loved ones and they may or may not make it all worth it, everyone is different. If they dont make it all worth it then you need to find something that does. indulge your passions. Fuck what anyone else thinks, do you. Even if it means doing it by yourself. Want to travel to Amsterdam but got nobody to go with? Fuck it, go yourself. Basically be true to yourself always and what these sick fucks have planned is a lot less worrisome because at least you had a good run right? lmao.... ; ;

       Good and evil exist in a perpetual balance. As the world gets darker, somewhere in the world light is becoming brighter. It's up to you which you choose to be a part of.

       I don't think the world is ugly.  The kindness of strangers I have received, has given me a positive outlook on people.  I feel obligated, in a good way, to keep hope alive.  Which really matters most when it's hard to do so.   Don't let them get you down, you keep doing your thing.  Get a thing if you don't have one.  I tried a moustache for a while, but settled back to music.

        Why do you bother continuing to live in a world as corrupt and ugly as this?

       Because it seems we don‚Äôt have much of a choice at this point.  It seems we are not sufficiently evolved yet to keep ourselves from continuing to be taken advantage of and enslaved by whoever/whatever is being responsible for making us reincarnate over and over again on this rock.  It seems the key is to evolve your internal self and abilities, life after life, until you are developed enough to no longer have to keep coming back here.

       You see, that's what they want you to feel... They want to break you down ..
 become hopeless and in return have to rely on them for everything.

       Have faith and truly believe we can change things with our open conscience.
One of the reasons why our government keeps us divided is so we can't come together as one and show them we can really achieve whatever we put our minds to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a group of army ants or bee's their one function is to protect the Queen.
The only way they can continue to have a hold on us is to make us believe we have no purpose here and break through to our strengths
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as we come together and help each other out they have no hold over us..
Peace

       As others have said: Good and bad are part of a greater movement, the dichotomy of is and isn't. We cannot lose because we chose to be on the side of life.

       You are asking the right questions just remember, thesis, antithesis, synthesis.

       I'm an atheist. When I die I believe I'll be exactly what I was before I was born. Non-existent.

       So I'm going to enjoy and experience as much as I can before I return to nothingness.
