       Besides all of the sick stuff and occult imagery, there's another common theme that shows up in all of these posts that is confusing me: they all have references to aliens. They appear in the pictures, we can see them in the murals inside Comet Pizza, and John Podesta even made a name for himself in conspiracy communities because of his interest in aliens. What the hell is up with this? Is there some connection between supposed "alien abductions" and this child abuse? Has nobody else noticed this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: at first, I thought this was posted in r/pizzagate, but I'm happy it's here in r/conspiracy because most of us here already have some background knowledge of aliens. Is it possible that alien abductions are being used as a cover or screen memory for child abductions?

       Alright, so as someone who frequents tumblr, I can confirm that aliens and UFOs are a HUGE thing on tumblr. From what I've seen, it has little to nothing to do with the belief in ETs but is more of an aesthetic. The thing about a lot of these suspicious tumblrs is that they come off as guro aesthetic blogs. There may be more behind them, but from what I can tell, they're just being run by 20 year old emos.

       But it's not just limited to tumblr. I see this imagery in so many of the different links that have been posted in r/pizzagate. Maybe there's nothing to it, but I'll definitely be keeping a closer eye on it from now on

       Once aliens became a popular aesthetic on tumblr, everyone else started copying. Not to mention, aliens, UFOs and government coverups have always been a hot topic. If you look closely, you'll see alien and UFO images almost everywhere and it's been like that for a very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may be something to it tho. Mainstream news outlets aren't treating UFO sightings the same way they did 10 years ago. I remember watching the local news when someone sent in a UFO video and they ripped the guy a new asshole. Now they seem almost scared of every video that comes in.

       This might be related: Aleister Crowley (A Satantist with quite a sordid history) channelled and worshipped a UFO/Demon named Thelma who actually looks a lot like a Grey Alien.

       There's been quite a few UFO researchers over the years. like Jacques Vallee who have concluded that reports of aliens are often indistinguishable from reports of "demons/angels" that our ancestors wrote about.

       I was watching this video.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an interview with this guy, who when he was 20 got involved in demon worship.  He, just before the time he really signs into the cult he becomes converted to 7th day adventist.  It's pretty religious but I found it interesting none the less.
       <br/>
       About 30-45 minutes in (I think...) he talks about "The great ones plan" (Satan's).  At the end of the world, there will be demons desguised as aliens that will come to save everyone from the earth just before it's destroyed, but it is a trick.  I mean, who's to say really but it is interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, there's Cathy O'Brian.  In one of her youtube talks she discusses how the normal people in power use Aliens to scare mind control slaves into thinking that they have no power.  Because this thing, or person, isn't a human.  How could anyone defeat something so over powered.  She has said that their technology is so advanced, by 20 or 30 years (Mind you she said this around when microwaves became popular).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a few other things I recall reading about but not well enough to share.

       Im a Seventh Day Adventist and the person you are speaking of is Roger Morneau. He wrote a book called a trip into the supernatural that talks about his time in and out of the spirtualist/satanic worship. He also has other books about the many experiences he had with prayer and i recommend these books. Im not so sure about aliens coming down, and i dont think Roger Morneau ever in his books were saying that the Devil and his angels will disguise themselves as aliens but we Adventists believe that before Jesus's second coming, Satan will try to deceive many Christians by coming down as an angel of light, mimicking Christ by performing miracles and healings. His demons will also try to deceive people that they are angels or people that have died like your family members. We know that through the Bible like in Ecclesiastes, 9:5 and several other verses in the Bible to supoort that the dead know nothing and will only rise up at Jesus's second coming to face judgement. After Judgement those who have loved Jesus Christ and kept his commandments and had faith in Jesus Christ will have eternal life, but those who followed their own will and followed the desires of Satan will perish and exist no more and will be gone forever instead of an eternal tourmet that many Christans believe in. Even in the simple verse John 3:16 shows For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him, shall not PERISH but have ETERNAL LIFE (Emphasis mine) But we know as Adventists that when Jesus comes, through scripture in the Bible, All eyes shall know when Jesus returns and it will be an event that everyone on earth will know about but he will not be on the earth and not like some kind of silent rapture. Satan trying to deceive before this event will be walking around doing miracles to deceive many with his demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know a glimpse about us, The movie hacksaw ridge that came out recently is about a Seventh Day Adventist who received the Medal of Honor for saving 75 soldiers and never once carrying a gun during his training and on the battlefield. I believe that God truly protected him because of his principle to not take life, but to save life.
      </p>

       I want you guys to know that Jesus loves you and is willing to help you overcome addictions and find peace and love through Him. He cares and loves you so much.

       Im curious about that, does Michael talk back to you? What do you mean you communicate with Michael? Because Adventists believe that the Angel Michael in the Old testament is Jesus as well. If you look closely at the scripture representing Michael.

       I dont know about telepathically, but the Holy Spirit talks to you through your conscience. If so, then you think Jesus is a deception? How can that be if you believe that Michael was Jesus?

       May you describe in detail, citing scripture, what you find deceiving in the narrative of Jesus Christ? The archangel Michael, the name Michael is another title for Jesus Christ and has appeared to several Bible Characters such as Gideon, Jacob, Joshua, Manoah and his wife (Samson's parents) and others.

       I believe that we are getting closer to Jesus's coming and many Christians have been realizing truths through scripture. I believe this pizzagate will show the world the full scope of Lucifer and his demons which plan to cause destruction and havoc and misintepret God not as a Loving and Just God. But a cruel taskmasker.

       Ok, I understand but sorry for being so curious. Im a really curious person haha. I want to know if you believe that Jesus is the Son of God? Futhermore, I'm still itching to know what specific thing you feel put off by in Jesus's life? Also another question, do you think Michael AKA Jesus was created or part of the Godhead? I dont mean to be rude at all, Im just super curious. :D

       ETs as in extra terrestrials? I and Seventh day adventists believe that God, the creator of everything like what you said prime creator, interacts very personally in our lives. He cares deeply about us. I can see it in my life and in others like my friend who was a gangster, was about to be killed by several other gangsters surrounding him, and a bright light flashed, and all the gangsters ran away crying in tears and in deep sorrow. It reminds me of the story of the woman who was caught in Adultery in the Bible how Jesus struck the conscience of those condeming her. I dont believe in the deist perspective of God who doesn't interact with us personally on a deep level. As shown in the Bible, God has a very close relationship with people, and wants to have a relationship with everyone on this Earth. Either we can chose to have that relationship and grow to be more like Him and to be ready for Heaven with our characters or we either think nothing of it or be hostile to God. If you are talking about Extra Terestrials, we believe that yes there are aliens on different worlds but they have not been contaminated by sin, because on each world there is the tree of knowledge of God and Evil but only we have fallen into sin by Lucifer's deceptions and many ETs are watching this battle being played out on earth between Lucifer and his demons and God and his angels. This whole battle was because of Lucifer rebelling saying it was unfair of God to be ruler. Lucifer wanted to uplift himself. When Jesus comes again everyone will know that He is the Son of God who came to save us from sin. He will show his justice and mercy in every part of our lives, from our birth to our death. He will show how he has been walking and caring for us every step of the way, but the people who did not believe in Him will see how it God was caring for them and NEVER giving up on them, but they will see clearly how they have choose to not follow God and realize that God is Just and Merciful. The ETs and the angels will also realize like a jury, that God was Just and Loving, that he was not a lier or a cruel ruler that Satan said he was. Whoo that was long and I'm going to find more stuff on how to clearly talk about this in depth. Im not the best orator or storyteller. :)

       Im sorry, I just want to show people About God's love. What do you mean i read a lot into your comments? I dont understand what you mean by that sorry. Im not trying to chastise at all, Im just stating what i believe in and by no means want to chastise you or make you feel uncomfortable. Im sorry for that, really. Im just really passionate about this because i realize that yes there is a spiritual battle going on with things such as pizzagate and i wanted other people to know that God loves them, God loves everyone and cares deeply for everyone on earth, even those who are bad like Hillary. This type of Satanism has occured in the Bible such as in King Manassehs day, he was the most corrupt king out of Jewish history, sacrificng his children to satanic influences and killing many people. Yet God loved and forgave him and King Manasseh turned around 180 degrees

       I dont understand. It seems like you want to take down the people involved in this pedophilia stuff like from your post. I understand you believe differntly but in the end our moral compasses want to help end things like this and raise awareness for it.

       Im not saying that we should kill or gas them at all, I mean if Hillary is deliberately doesnt care about the lives of children and trafficks them without remorse then she should be sent to prison, not death. The artist that was sexually abused Kim Noble AKA Ria pratt is an example of the abuses she went through and when looking at her art it pained me that she had those experiences. I cant even imagine what that must have been like, being controlled since birth. :( What i want is for this sick stuff to end. For children and adults alike to not have this torture. To not let these practices continue.

       No im not saying that. I was curious on your view on that issue. Its interesting that you know that archangel michael is Jesus. Not many Christians know that. Im sorry to hear that. Im not trying to save you, the Holy Spirit is the only one that can do that. I have no power to do that because the Holy Spirit is the one who helps someone know truly about God. I only try to show people about God and his love for us.

       Sorry, I feel like I'm piggy backing on you and Charleen's conversation! This is probably bad manners, but I'm still learning how to reddit lol. Okay, i should know better.
      </p>
      <p>
       But teslasmuse, I wanted to say that I also think it is very interesting/cool that you look to Archangel Michael. It shocked me, because I do as well and hardly even know why.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would make much more sense for me to look to Jesus (I grew up as a Christian) but there have been a couple of times when I was terrified/in a bad place and without thinking I immediately prayed/called out to Archangel Michael for help and was instantly calmer/felt safe. It could be all in my head, but i dunno, I like him too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charleen, I don't know what to think about Jesus either. I do really like him and definitely if the elites are worshipping and child sacrificing for Satan, I want to worship the opposite of that. So initially I thought that I'd better brush up on my Christianity lol. And perhaps I should.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if these people have been ruling us for so long. If the Catholic Church is the worst of them all --- how can we trust the scriptures? Especially because the Bible was very likely based off of much earlier pagan religions. There are many pagan beliefs that mirror the story of Jesus's birth and resurrection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are lot's of good theories that Satan was possibly based off of Saturn. At this point I genuinely dunno.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I'd settle at this point, for a God/deity that doesn't want to hurt/eat people. Sorry for ranting :)

       Hi Greengrapesx, I am learning about this too with my Pastor and I need to learn more with him too and he said he will teach me next time we meet for Bible study, but in brief he said in the 2nd century the Bible that we see today was in a work in progress. The books were already there but they were canonizing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       His words- The Bible was formed in 2nd century and there was no "Catholic" power by then. There was nothing like catholic and the word catholic was used to indicate the universal church. Many church fathers were not catholic they were just devoted scholars of church
      </p>
      <p>
       The books were already formed before then and was circulated by the believers but it was not complied as one book like Bible, it slowly began to a compilation starting from 2nd century. And defferent Christian groups developed the canonization but it was pretty much formed in 2nd century onwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list of Old Testament was already formed in Council of Jamnia in 1st century

      <p>
       And it was 2nd century when the heretical teaching of Marcion appeared, believers formed the list of New Testament
      </p>
      <p>
       Marcion was the guy who only included 10 Pauline epistiles and the Gospel of Luke with the birth of Jesus removed in the Old Testament
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if we believe on what the Scripture says about the Scripture, (2Tim3:16) even in that process of forming the list of the Scripture, we should give all credit to Holy Spirit that He actually led the work through people. Ans is really interesting that 66 books and the manuscripts found in elsewhere were identical. There is a similar stories with Babylonian literature sharing similar stories
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's talk about this when we meet
      </p>
      <p>
       This will be an interesting and a long story haha

       Back to me: Ill keep you posted of what i learned next week! Super busy with college at the moment, sorry!

       This alien stuff might fall in line with the occult stuff these people seem to be involved with and there are people who believe aliens to be 'fallen angles' or demons. In fact the only entity Aleister Crowley ever claimed to have appeared to him looks a lot like

       You need to make this popular in PizzaGate. The Tumblrs surrounding Rachel Chandler are disgusting and horrifying. Weird emo shit goes down in Tumblr but this is NOT YOUR AVERAGE emo. If you see this in context, PizzaGate is happening for real. The connection between Rachel Chandler and the Clintons are not substantial, but it's definitely worth investigating. She was seen in a photograph with the background that seemed like a private plane or yacht. This is something. Please post it to PIZZAGATE again. God bless

       Their have been many cases of art being wrongly called kiddie porn
      </p>
      <p>
       while i feel there are several very interesting leads in this whole Epstien / Clinton side of the people trafficking / abuse global ring which seemingly goes to the very top of the pyramid - with UK Royalty etc
      </p>
      <p>
       i wonder whether the perpetrators are not in fact laughing as you knee jerk your way around false evidence and pizza bullshit - calling everything you think might be edgy as CP - this shit is complicated - there are laws - unfortunately - its the people who are responsible for upholding these laws that seem to be involved - its disgraceful - and many times i see hysteria in tabloids
and in religious nutjob pamphlets calling everything satanic as an intelligance bait and switch tactic to use mystery and conspiracy
to cover an operation which has bribery and collusion via corruption at its very heart
      </p>
      <p>
       if you feel that any images are in breach of some sort of law - then i suggest you report them
this is your responsibility
      </p>
      <p>
       i am not defending abusers or anything like that - but i draw the line at witch hunts and hysteria.
looking at the fakery going on - a lot of people from all sides of all political spectrums are involved with covering up or trying to implicate muddying the waters.

       May you describe in detail, citing scripture, what you find deceiving in the narrative of Jesus Christ? The archangel Michael, the name Michael is another title for Jesus Christ and has appeared to several Bible Characters such as Gideon, Jacob, Joshua, Manoah and his wife (Samson's parents) and others.

       I believe that we are getting closer to Jesus's coming and many Christians have been realizing truths through scripture. I believe this pizzagate will show the world the full scope of Lucifer and his demons which plan to cause destruction and havoc and misintepret God not as a Loving and Just God. But a cruel taskmasker.
