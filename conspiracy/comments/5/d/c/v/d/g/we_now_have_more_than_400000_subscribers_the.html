       Thousands of people are in prison because of being convicted of conspiracy to do this or that.

       The conspiracy theorist pejorative was created by the CIA to stop people from questioning the Warren Commission report about the JFK assassination. It worked spectacularly.

       DeHaven-Smith has shown that the conspiracy-theory label was popularized as a pejorative term by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a propaganda program initiated in 1967.[20] The program was directed at criticisms of the Warren Commission’s conclusion that President Kennedy had been assassinated by a lone gunman. The propaganda campaign called on media corporations and journalists to criticize “conspiracy theorists” and raise questions about their motives and judgments. The CIA told its contacts that “parts of the conspiracy talk appear to be deliberately generated by Communist propagandists.”

       I second getting a dog. Not only will they keep you company but you can ramble on for hours without judgment. You won't get much of a response but it is therapeutic in that you can externalise your thoughts.

       You will get used to it. You will learn to except that this is the way things are at the present time and you'll then be able to think logically, critically and most important of all OBJECTIVELY at the news, information and propaganda that is being thrown at us on a daily basis. You'll be better equipped mentally to do something about it and wake up the MSM zombies.

       This was me in 2006.  I barely slept for a week. No one else in my life knew about it and I soon discovered that no one wanted to hear about it or talk about it.  This sub didn't exist.  I walked the streets wondering if any of the strangers I saw knew what I knew.  I felt very alone and wistful for my former state of blissful ignorance.

       Now of course I wouldn't have it any other way.  Knowing the truth enables you to make sensible choices for your health, your finances, your relationships.  Once you realize that they want us sick, poor and alone, and how they manipulate us to make that happen, you can fight back and emerge much stronger and happier.

       I've been there. It's tough but it'll pass. Strive to be a good person to others, that's by far the best course of action to take. Keep educating yourself but learn to take breaks and change focus when feeling overwhelmed. Don't panic. Compassion is fortitude.

       It's glorious. What we need to do now (aside from the usual digging) is focus on communicating and uniting. We're all in this for truth. We need to be specific about what we present as opinion, and what we present as verifiable fact. We also need to be accepting of opposing opinions, and we need to be able to admit when we're wrong. We are, after all, one big opposing opinion when it comes to the mainstream veil. And most importantly, we need to be welcoming of curiosity in any form, for that is what brought us here in the first place. Let's keep growing, it's an exciting time!

       Hi I'm awake allright... free thinker # 400.378 (even though ticker still says 400.377, foul play? - just kidding) "Dream" bustet after seeing "Man on Wire" in 2013 P. Petit's story, with the twins blew my mind. I wanted to know everything about the World trade center twin towers, their history, origin, design &amp; construction. Google'd and studied the buildings for a year or so... .. and one day it was obvious... "collapse?" and pancake effect my ass! that's a got be understatement of the millenium! Those two were BLOWN TO HELL top down!...
      </p>
      <p>
       Study architechture terminated... (thanks Philippe!)
      </p>
      <p>
       2014 - present. Study of 9/11 started... read &amp; watch all... ALL! 
Sort shit from cake, stay objective, avoid distractions, read &amp; watch again... keep it simple..
      </p>
      <p>
       Deep breath, Look into your self....

       The destruction of WTC 1&amp;2 to me is like one of those trick drawings where you first only see one thing: a vase ect. 
But once you see the vase as two profiles the vase is gone period and there's no way back. 
Room 4 one more down the hole!? 
Well after some rather manic and intense years of geopolitical, geostrategic and historical studies learning on the fly and developing a healthy sense in picking my sources, while digesting the harsh reality in as healthy doses as possible i seen and read more than enough to see the real and shit-scary nasty picture of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scale of the con, the consequenses so far, the insulting lies, the cognitive dissonans, the cover up, the failure in accurate reporting from MSM, the silence of those with fine educations, who spend half their lifes studying this stuff IT'S PISSING ME OFF!
      </p>
      <p>
       But i have to give it to the man on this one: It's a hell of a swindle!
Disgusting as it is! Every single induvidual who pulled the strings on that operation and it's cover up must be exposed an held accountable.

       Plus, there was the whole part about how they handed out the civil liberties and unity shit to distract from a hopeless lack of economic freedom. So that kind of ruined it all for everyone and keeps the rest willfully asleep--they got theirs.

      <ul>

       While I think people who frequently visit a sub are statistically predisposed to believe nearly everything on that sub, conspiracy seems to still be the best single place for actual people actually thinking and making good posts. But maybe you've been here longer than I have and things seem a lot different?

       Plus, when you're new to this way of processing information, it takes getting used to using your brain, and really researching things because you actually care.  It's something that needs to be learned, schools don't help a lot in that area.

       I was once a fucking idiot and brainwashed by culture/TV/peopl/Media and only woke the fuck up because of drug/alcohol abuse once I reached rock bottom. So basically I was an addicted homeless bum covered in my own puke before I started to question everything and start the years long process of getting Woke.

       I agree every free thinker, critical thinker, is welcome from wherever. What I don't care for is people throwing around Trump memes and slurs and praising god emperor trump all day long.

       R/conspiracy should be about independent thinkers seeking truth, not herd mentality astroturfing.

       You must realize that this sub is attacked at that level. There are posts that come through here everyday with no purpose other than to associate us with the rif raf. However, there are some absolute gems of discovery that r/conspiracy is the first to consider, debate and vet as actual truth or nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say be an active member. Hang out in the NEW posts and give an upvote to those worthy of discussion and downvote obvious garbage.

       I'm on record as welcoming them then and now. As we grow it will be harder for our overall message to be drowned out by brigades or persona managers.

       I think the coffee reference is appropriate. It  comes from a type of WWII  conditioning poster.  The coffee in them was  meant to remind you to  keep your mouth shut about anything that might be a government secret, Here's one.

       All the times over the years we've had people posting requests to change the name of this sub because "Conspiracy" is a bad word and Conspiracy Theorist are seen as crazy...well, there's a reason for that, the Truth IS crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never be ashamed of this label..."Conspiracy Theorist". It was
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to be derogatory. However, I wear it like a badge of honor. Peoples preconceived notions about us WILL change to a positive one. Someday this will be synonymous with Truth...not the "tinfoil hat wearing paranoids" the MSM wants you to believe.

       People usually misinterpret what conspiracy even means. If you break the word down it means "breathe together" so if you have two people "breathing together" aka planning something between themselves that others don't know about, that's conspiracy. Two of your friends could conspire to convince you to go to lunch somewhere. People have been brainwashed to associate the word conspiracy with crazy

       I agree every free thinker, critical thinker, is welcome from wherever. What I don't care for is people throwing around Trump memes and slurs and praising god emperor trump all day long.

       R/conspiracy should be about independent thinkers seeking truth, not herd mentality astroturfing.
