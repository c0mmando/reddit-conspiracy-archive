<p>Anyone who isn&#39;t rich, who can&#39;t afford the means to acquire clean environments will die from the direct or indirect effects of global climate change. Mass sterilization and non-beneficial mutations from unhealthy environments are easily possible for rich and poor alike though.</p>

<p>Some kind of contagious medical condition.</p>

<p>The global war on terror could really go global, beyond the middle east and happen everywhere, which would also kill lots of people.</p>

<p>Nuclear war is also possible. I personally believe in m.a.d. deterrent. So if nukes were used it would be a propaganda move. Maybe after climate change is really bad nuke usage will be common.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the scifi and horror scenarios of course.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know really. Probably not good stuff if history is any indicator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Climate change is more real than you ever can imagine. That ice hasn&#39;t been freezing for a long time, it has been retreating more so than ever this century, but when its gone, when does it return. Without that ice what happens there are still theories on what happens, ice-age refreeze reset, or a dust bowl, and can we mitigate through a question mark, but its result is more extreme weather. Because the more we populate the more we demand land, food, and water. No matter whether or not we lessen those emissions, it will remain an issue, because there are simply far too many of us. The land is saturated in the waste we expunge from non renewables, plastics, coals, gas, and that won&#39;t change until the next epoch in millions of years. The next stupid product we make, only gets turned into another stupid product having even less lifetime doing the same damn thing, while we eat more and more and more despite of increasing GMO gains. But other species are dying so drastically much quicker than any FU. Those reefs are going gone, and that ice is going, fresh water is a huge concern. We have also had record numbers of our species dying from results of the toxic air, as more illness becomes more frequent, but we populate them twice as quick.</p>

<p>But it is being denied, because it plays into an agenda and by denying it that result will be the same, that perhaps it cannot be managed. </p>

<p>Like the good little conspiracist you think that it was all some other kind of a con, I mean how gullible are you? Perhaps we have generated demand for more renewables, because for FFS why haven&#39;t we been using them already</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every year since 1998 has broken global temperature records every month this year has been its highest, and I believe that the figures are being generous, too keep us all spending, traveling, and consuming. Those glaciers have retreated 100 miles this century, not returning. We are about to lose 100s of many miles from Antarctica, Larsen&#39;s shelf is pulling away from the mainland melting, this will go very soon perhaps within a decade or less, and this sets into motion even more decline. This has been happening in the Northern hemisphere drastically increasing so much more recently and the tundra it leaves behind belches methane back into the atmosphere. The planet&#39;s epoch has changed and it has become saturated with waste from the products we use so much more of, and this has only increased far more in the last years, we become more wasteful and demanding the more we populate rapidly increasing in land usage. Heck there is even a cruise holiday passing through the Arctic in water where years ago even an icebreaker would get shafted. We have gained population so much more rapidly in almost every part of the globe quadrupling in a century but in gaining a quarter in about 20 years 6 billion to close to 8 billion today. What about the rest of the species on this planet declining so rapidly they are all practically endangered, and many so much more critically. The reefs are practically dead an ecosystem observed from space taking millennias to regrow, but they won&#39;t because of the acidification caused from a number of factors like waste and also including the increased ice loss.</p>

<p>You might not agree with the term global warming over the term of climate change, but the climate and mankind are changing this planet, and its effects are being felt. Rapidly increasing every year.</p>

<p>Maybe you believe it&#39;s all the matrix and we&#39;re already in some other kind of reality. I mean just who could blame you today? They live, and they are made out of plastic.</p>

<p>Half the jokes on you-tube are some clown getting your hits and making money the more you listen to their absurd crap, and this is often called remote viewing for the selective audience of whack jobs.</p>

<p>Chemtrails increase warming, those planes leave emissions, and this affects weather systems because by flying through a cloud gee perhaps it could cause some rain, and maybe there is an Xfile, but I don&#39;t want to have that debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a god and by accepting god you aren&#39;t believing in life, because you are simply a victim to a higher power, and this affects your state of being. Religion is simply a mechanism of control. And it was often looking for a cause in our existence, and whatever other propaganda offered. I am open minded meaning that by not accepting it I have better options than being controlled by it.</p>

<p>I would welcome anti religion because it often makes people gullible, and it can be easily used to rally control and segregate.</p>

<p>When there is a god, there is a devil, and you are judging them on something else other than humanity giving an excuse for hypocrisy that somehow you were better and that they must now accept to be equal. Not we are all equal and should have simply accepted each other.</p>

<p>The way religion actually works is you are god having the power of life to do with it as you must, but sshh don&#39;t tell them that how are we to control their beliefs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe I am my own god because I am an individual having my own life and consciousness. Having the same powers of a god towards anything else in existence because my actions affect the world around me. </p>

<p>Where we came from is irrelevant, nothing will change that when we are here and we exist. This has been manipulated by religion searching for an answer to that existent or supposedly providing it with some other cause, often giving a cause to manipulate us further by controlling our beliefs.</p>

<p>The timeline is irrelevant upon inserting a random deity, why then when it had nothing to do with when that civilization started, and when it cannot be proved because it was based on paganism, it has inserted random history, controlling everything by formulating it into this random timeline. Finally later along comes science inserting everything else. </p>

<p>As far as creation went come on it is a parable, man is conscious and is not a beast, some naughty woman got snaked but it was her sons that were indifferent when one killed the other through lust, thus starting the cycle of mankind through greed and sin and it just get cornier from there often containing some history etc. Much later another son comes along and starts a war against another religion. Although that was how this new religion was founded by them merging, there is your conspiracy, and he died/martyred on a cross from his own mistakes of warring against another religion, and then that religion is reborn continuing in its forever turning cycles of revelation always trying to create the perfect heaven/world away from any other hells caused, but he might as well have been spartazesus, or any other myth containing whatever hints of reasoning are gained by that control, the same as most its ancestors.</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t debating this because it is massively off topic, believe what you want, just don&#39;t expect the gods to save you from it. But as you can see I am a consciously free thinking individual, and unless there is actual proof not just the contents of another book on mysticism, philosophy, law, and the eclipsed history reworded into its propaganda and the attempts of that control giving cause to the establishment of religion, I am going to deny its tribalism, because I have my own powers of thought actions and consequence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He laughed at me calling me dumb in his opening, and then he reported me, crying to a mod after attacking me. Again proving that age group.</p>

<p>Does me swearing excuse his behavior. Look at how he has rearranged making quotes of something I haven&#39;t even said. He has done this frequently trolling and goading those insults. A typical tactic played here on reddit which also has other features used for attacks like the down vote and bait. But because I have breached the rules am I wrong for calling him a piece of shit and an asshole.</p>

<p>This was against the rules thank you and I accept that. However isn&#39;t that what that person is by verbally lying about what I have wrote by quoting something I didn&#39;t even say, and breaking the rules upon trolling me?</p>

<p>Trolling me by providing no information to my thoughtfully constructed quotes, but simply trash talking me by calling me a dumb liar, and no climate change doesn&#39;t exist because mr.troll hasn&#39;t offered any facts, except for flames.</p>

<p>So moderator I responded in kind. Later now that you have his back, he actually lies about what I wrote by quoting something he has typed. Wasn&#39;t he already doing that from opening.</p>

<p>Thank you for your rule I know I shouldn&#39;t have sworn at somebody I wouldn&#39;t give any other time of day too, simple education doesn&#39;t help. </p>

<p>Now I am left with an absolute shit taste in my mouth, proving this species ineptitude and this media&#39;s agenda, where I don&#39;t even get an impartial verdict, because those mods lack in a better judgement. They simply pick a side and it was often from that phone a friend, how disgustingly generic.</p>

<p>I called it what it was causing your prejudice. But I wasn&#39;t that person needing your assistance or judgement.</p>

<p>Please tell me how can you allow somebody to lie about what another person has wrote? Here is that comment after you deleted mine. Although this what what was done from opening promoting my resentment and I don&#39;t need you to wipe my arse.</p>

<pre><code>I admit that global warming is false

<p>Hey, thanks for that! Why not just NOT shitpost next time?</p>

<p>What is wrong with you moderator? I never typed that quote, by deleting my comments and leaving his you have supported an asshole who was lying and flaming from start and also rearranging my comments. Also making you what for a better word? Somebody in cohesion because hey it&#39;s a forum full of these bigots.</p>

<p>Land “readings” are <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8RwdDFT.png">diverging</a> from satellite data (which <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OISZ078.png">NASA itself says is accurate</a> and should be the standard instead) because over 40% of land “readings” are estimates made for places <strong><em>without recording equipment.</em></strong></p>

<p>To illustratively do something that the psychopaths love to do, I’ll cherrypick the last 20 years to show that there has <a href="http://i.imgur.com/S4Kgh4k.gif">been no warming there</a>, despite CO2 continuing to rise. Even using <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IF42Uf2.gif">just the satellite record</a>, the world isn’t warming. If we refer back to one of the hottest years in recorded history, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4HWcKSz.gif">we see the difference.</a> Never mind that there have <a href="http://www.edsanders.com/global/c02up2.htm">only been benefits to CO2 rising</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Waaaaa! What about the ice caps!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’re not melting. They go through <a href="http://i.imgur.com/px9Zr2X.jpg">cycles</a>. 1974 had <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ShRXILK.png">less ice</a> than today. Oh, and don’t listen to what <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kMGh1nT.gif">scientists</a> say, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/14m2Ix8.gif">whatever you do</a>. Nowhere is melting out of turn, not even Greenland (where it has been <a href="http://beta.dmi.dk/en/groenland/maalinger/greenland-ice-sheet-surface-mass-budget/">growing</a> for something like 30 years).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“But the sea level is rising!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has been rising for 13,000 years. In that time, it has never risen more slowly than right now. Were our ancestors belching out CO2 faster than we were? Maybe they were farting a lot more. It’s rising more slowly than at any time in that history, and it’s also rising more slowly than <a href="http://i.imgur.com/bNUCnvg.gif">any claim</a> made public by any outlet. <a href="ftp://ftp.marine.csiro.au/pub/legresy/church_white_gmsl_2011_tg_list.zip">Here’s the source data</a> for that chart. It’s an FTP link, so it should automatically download the raw file (which you don’t need to worry about, as it’s a bunch of undifferentiated numbers). Turns out that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H1JISaD.gif">NOAA</a> marks the average as 0.63 mm per year. Not 3.3. Not 2.8. Certainly not a foot per year, which is needed for the most modern public “predictions” about this bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“But ocean acidity!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guess what? <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272771410002167">It’s also cyclical.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Okay, not ice caps, but what about the glaciers?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/UGMfILq.gif">They’ve been melting since at least the 1780s</a> when we started measuring them. I also have information for the Alps and other areas. Was our pre-industrial civilization responsible for “greenhouse gases” too?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“But but but but but but but but muh consensus! They agree! Because I say so! That makes what they say true!” </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/97_Consensus_Myth.pdf">Sorry, there never was any consensus.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Then why don’t climate change deniers publish papers?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.populartechnology.net/2009/10/peer-reviewed-papers-supporting.html">Because they do</a> (and because <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12129-009-9149-z">papers often aren’t published</a> because the publishing groups are owned by AGW liars).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every year since 1998 has broken global temperature records every month this year has been its highest, and I believe that the figures are being generous, too keep us all spending, traveling, and consuming. Those glaciers have retreated 100 miles this century, not returning. We are about to lose 100s of many miles from Antarctica, Larsen&#39;s shelf is pulling away from the mainland melting, this will go very soon perhaps within a decade or less, and this sets into motion even more decline. This has been happening in the Northern hemisphere drastically increasing so much more recently and the tundra it leaves behind belches methane back into the atmosphere. The planet&#39;s epoch has changed and it has become saturated with waste from the products we use so much more of, and this has only increased far more in the last years, we become more wasteful and demanding the more we populate rapidly increasing in land usage. Heck there is even a cruise holiday passing through the Arctic in water where years ago even an icebreaker would get shafted. We have gained population so much more rapidly in almost every part of the globe quadrupling in a century but in gaining a quarter in about 20 years 6 billion to close to 8 billion today. What about the rest of the species on this planet declining so rapidly they are all practically endangered, and many so much more critically. The reefs are practically dead an ecosystem observed from space taking millennias to regrow, but they won&#39;t because of the acidification caused from a number of factors like waste and also including the increased ice loss.</p>

<p>You might not agree with the term global warming over the term of climate change, but the climate and mankind are changing this planet, and its effects are being felt. Rapidly increasing every year.</p>

<p>Maybe you believe it&#39;s all the matrix and we&#39;re already in some other kind of reality. I mean just who could blame you today? They live, and they are made out of plastic.</p>

<p>Half the jokes on you-tube are some clown getting your hits and making money the more you listen to their absurd crap, and this is often called remote viewing for the selective audience of whack jobs.</p>

<p>Chemtrails increase warming, those planes leave emissions, and this affects weather systems because by flying through a cloud gee perhaps it could cause some rain, and maybe there is an Xfile, but I don&#39;t want to have that debate.</p>
