If he was killed outright or moved to Gitmo, we&#39;d never hear about it.  The government has no reason to let us know any of this.  If Wikileaks is compromised, theres no reason for them to let us know this.  </p>

<p>Just as with Hoffa, we dont really know what happened to him.</p>

<p>If he died or if he spends the next decade in Gitmo, no access to lawyers or anything, we most likely wont ever hear about it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first interview wasnt an interview at all.  It wasnt even an advertised one.  </p>

<p>For me, the troubling thing is how the Wikileaks twitter has reacted since Oct 17.  </p>

<p>Polling the audience and saying &quot;how should Julian prove he is alive&quot;?  Thats just so bizarre.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s had 2 opportunities to explain what happened.  The interview where he &quot;called in&quot;.  The Pilger interview.  And the Wikileaks statement on the election.  </p>

<p>In all 3 he only gives a basic cursory statement on the situation.  My internet was cut.  Equador was under pressure from U.S.</p>

<p>He doesnt discuss what he has done in the last few weeks.  Or where he was.  What he&#39;s been doing.  Why he&#39;s been lying low and out of the spotlight.  Or the meaning of those hashes sent out before his internet was cut.  </p>

<p>People have been speculating he&#39;s been tortured, killed, extradited.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s never addressed ANY of that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Pilger just tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/johnpilger/status/800093317782503424">this</a> a few hours ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For all those who have been asking, this interview took place inside the Embassy of Ecuador on Sunday 30 October 2016</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone who doesn&#39;t trust Pilger or know who he is hasn&#39;t been around very long or doesn&#39;t do their research. Pilger is one of the most trustworthy journalists in history.</p>
