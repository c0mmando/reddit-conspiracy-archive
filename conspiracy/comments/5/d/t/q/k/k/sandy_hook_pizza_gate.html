       One thing about Sandy Hook really itched part of my brain I have not been able to scratch...
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened to the kids?
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have theories on why Sandy Hook was conducted...a mass psyop to practice false flag events, an effort to demonize assault weapons etc
      </p>
      <p>
       It was undoubtedly an attempt at all of the above but what if it was also a round up of pizza and hotdogs for the pedo cabal as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone?

       There were no kids. That school/district wasn't even operating at the time. Adam Lanza is not a real person, no one died, the pictures of the kids you've seen have been proven to be
       <em>
        other people's kids
       </em>
       and when the government got caught, they quickly changed the photos of the kids. Sandy Hook was a lie from the top down, literally nothing about it was true. Anyone who believes it is simply insulting their own intelligence.

       Thanks for sharing, I'm in the process of watching the video, something that totally blew my mind ~43 mins into the video, the chopper feed specifically -- I was near a school shooting back in 2014 - one that did actually occur in Washington state - at work less than half a mile down the road. I have never seen so many cops and helicopters in my life, EMS (saw three ambulances and one Medivac chopper within the first half an hour) it was absolute pandemonium and couldn't contrast further from that scene which alone I find to be massively suspicious (aside from all the other points I've seen in the video thus far).

       Yeah they handled it in such a sloppy way that you can tell they didn't care if they got caught. There was basically no one there.

       That is true. I really just look at him as a useful idiot. Most people here are convinced he's COINTELPRO but I haven't looked into it enough to say he is or isn't. However, I believe if he ever truly said anything that infringed too much on the status quo, he'd either be dead or in prison on child porn charges.

       The TNN (Tyranny News Network) one?  If so, I fully agree.  The pathetic Sandy Hook "shooting" was nothing more than a massive yet half-assed DHS Capstone event.  Just like Boston was.

       There didn't need to be any. All you have to do is say "27 kids were shot by an edgy teen that likes violent video games with an AR-15" and the damage is done. Most people will live their entire lives never knowing Sandy Hook was fake. Those same people probably donated to the Sandy Hook charities that were set up afterwards. They probably get pics of fake kids in the mail. And they'll never know any better. Emails aren't needed just so long as those damn AR-15s get banned!

       Google Earth shows the SHES parking lot full of cars on 3/29/12.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it makes more sense that the school was in operation during the drill. Otherwise the whole town would say "SHES was closed since 2008". If it was closed, then where did the 500 kids go to school? That's an awful lot of families to "pay off".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think using an operational school and simulating a shooting, like what was done here, makes much more sense.

       It's NOT AT ALL "like" time travel.  They simply used much older photographs of the so-called "murdered" children that were taken of them many years ago.

       Hence the low res "official" photographs looking as though the style of school dress was from roughly a decade ago.

       Does anyone know if Ryan Lanza is still alive?  He was arrested right after the shooting and hasn't been seen since.  I think they "mistakenly" identified Ryan as the shooter so that he couldn't start saying he didn't have a brother before police got to him.  I don't know why if they supposedly had Adams body at the scene.  Ryan was probably killed like his mother.

       Euh. As someone who knew one of the people killed there, and knows some of the kids that actually were in the school at the time, I can say that a lot of the kids that survived are in therapy and have been for a while now. As for funerals, there were funerals and there were bodies. So for the love of gd, knock it off.

       All of the houses in town were sold for zero dollars around the same time or something like that. Does anyone have more specific info on that part of the story? It really was the part of the story that made me believe the entire thing was invented out of whole cloth. Not just the shooting,  but the families, the officials, the teachers, they were all made up.

       Not the town...Sandy Hook is a spook town.  But ALL key participants had their houses on the bank books for $0 "sold" on Christmas day.  As well, nearly every "parent" had moved in just prior, then promptly left after the "event."

       I was a sucker too until three days ago! A teenager told me everyone knows it wasn't true! I felt like I was the only one! I cried for two days! These people are liars and the main stream media are in on it and the government!  The principal who died even has her picture in FOX as a witness to the Boston massacre! No Obama wants to stop propaganda! What a joke! He wants to stop the truth from coming out about his lies to get rid of our guns!

       You're absolutely right.  Barack (Mr. Hope &amp; Change fraud) Obama was definitely involved.  The treasonous idiot couldn't even fake a tear while trying to use this clearly staged event at push exactly what his owners/handlers tell him to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those in all necessary positions to pull off 9/11, those who own the corporate "media," those who lied about how truly DESPISED Hillary was, those who demand the loudest that the PROTECTED CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS of law abiding citizens be removed....are EXACTLY who are responsible for Sandy Hook, Boston, Aurora, Orlando, Nice (for this staged hoax event, Richard Gutjahr and family will show you EXACTLY who "they" are).

       Sure.  That fake name using BITCH is anywhere the truth of Sandy Hook is being publicly discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       His actual name is Leonard P Osner.  It's "funny" how his fake dead son also inherited the stage name he used specifically for this Sandy Hook HOAX.  A manufactured and fully staged DHS - Integrated Capstone Event (ICE).

       There didn't need to be any. All you have to do is say "27 kids were shot by an edgy teen that likes violent video games with an AR-15" and the damage is done. Most people will live their entire lives never knowing Sandy Hook was fake. Those same people probably donated to the Sandy Hook charities that were set up afterwards. They probably get pics of fake kids in the mail. And they'll never know any better. Emails aren't needed just so long as those damn AR-15s get banned!
