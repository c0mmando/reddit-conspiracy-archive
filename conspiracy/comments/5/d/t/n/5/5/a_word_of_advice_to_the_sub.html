     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       Now before anyone comes at me with pitchforks and everything please note, I am coming from a place of pure respect and wish to give advice on what I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       From going on other subs I see how r/conspiracy and its users are portrayed: tin-foil hat "nut-jobs", "crazy schizophrenic delusional people" etc. I DO NOT agree with them. But this is a problem, while I completely understand that the truth will be marginalized and that people will believe what they want to believe no matter what, I still feel like these events and perceptions can be mitigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Philosophically speaking, is the burden on this sub and its users to appear more "trustworthy"? Obviously not. But that doesn't matter when people keep dismissing the things that this sub says that can shed light on how things really work. I think a part of this problem is that there is a disconnect in perceptions between the users of this sub and those that see r/conspiracy as "tin-foil".
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple of things that I think that can be done to
       <em>
        improve
       </em>
       the credibility and good faith of this sub are here when interacting with the mainstream: (Again, you don't have to do any of this, these are only suggestions which I feel are small investments with big payoffs)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        See the situation from the other's point of view. To most people who's minds aren't open to any of this, it seems bat-shit crazy. ACKNOWLEDGE that! Sometimes people just want to be heard. Acknowledge, "Yeah I can see how some of Podesta's pizza gate emails
        <em>
         could
        </em>
        be innocent and we're looking too hard to find something not there." Then follow up with an appeal to your own point of view, "However, from the way I see it, this incident partnered with that incident, partnered with this other event just gives me weird feeling. We know this kind of stuff happens, let's just keep our eyes open yeah?"
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       What this does is acknowledges the other point of view respectfully and courteously while also showing you're a normal person (not implying you aren't) who can agree that some of this shit seems beyond belief. And I know that it won't always work and I know that a lot of the users already do this but I see it happening so infrequently that I think that's why "conspiracy theorists" get a bad rap.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Act in good faith, never lose sight of the big picture. The reason we want to shed light on the truth is because well... We care about the well-being of our country! We
        <em>
         want
        </em>
        the truth to come to light. Again, I acknowledge that those that hide from the truth will do everything to label us as crazy and whatnot but still, we can't lose focus on
        <em>
         why
        </em>
        we care so much about the truth. It's reasonable that people are hesitant to believe such "matrix breaking" truths, they don't want to be awake. But we can't make enemies if we're to be bringers of truth.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In short, I think that r/conspiracy needs to do some damage control in regards to its reputation (even though its not our fault). Yes, I AGREE that it's bullshit and the burden doesn't fall on us to do it, but we didn't start this war but we need to finish it and sometimes it means playing the long smart game and improving certain aspects of ourselves as a community if we want to be effective.

       This sub is made up of about 400k people.  Why do you think anyone here should give a shit about the perceived, intangible "reputation" of this sub?  This is a wholly ridiculous notion and topic.

       I'm not your enemy! Haha, because I come from both spheres of social circles, this one, and "the masses" and I see where the disconnect is. I feel that we could make things much easier for ourselves and give our words more credibility to those who doubt it. Again I'm on
       <em>

       Again, you are trying to attribute people who come to or view this sub as some kind of homogeneous, branded group.  It doesn't work that way.  We don't need etiquette lessons.  I come here to read interesting stuff, it doesn't identify who I am.  You seem to feel otherwise.

       I mean I agree with you. But can't we make it easier? I feel like what I'm proposing is a small act that can reap huge benefits. I feel like pride is only making things harder on ourselves, "If they want to believe cool, otherwise that's on them". I'm just reporting the disconnect of what I see between r/conspiracy and the mainstream. And if we don't care to be taken more serious, it just seems counter intuitive to what we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: What's done in the dark will be brought to light. I agree! But those of the dark make it a lot harder for deeds to be brought to light if our words are dismissed as "ravings".

       And i agree with you, so basically be nicer.

       It has to be more then that its also about how you present it.
      </p>
      <p>
       but it gets so draining to convince people of things, not just conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will often go outside the realms of reality just to keep their current belief system intact
      </p>

       So step one is identifying a way to present it in a way that its undeniably true

       Yes exactly! And you're telling me, it is 100% exhausting trying to show people we are on their side. We
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       the truth to come out. I just feel like as a whole we need to take steps to debunk the conspiracy theorist "stereotype" and part of doing that is speaking their lingo and seeing it from their point of view first, even if it's not fair.

       I agree with you. Conspiracy theorists tend to have a certain ego which in most cases is not deserved (I am no exception lol).

       I agree, it doesn't help anyone for conspiracy theorists to assume that anyone who disagrees with our opinions is 'brainwashed sheep'.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many holes in popular conspiracy theories and rejecting the mainstream lines of thinking doesn't make us anymore enlightened, or any less gullible...

       Yep, we should always make the real life implications of our theories clear. Maybe discussion about more day-to-day stuff like good diets, or spiritual meditation etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too much conspiracy talk surrounds things that we cannot do very much about. Is anyone really willing to launch a military assault on antarctica and risk being killed by the security forces guarding the region?

       Would anyone even want to publicly confront the politicians who rule us?

       You can't change people's beliefs unless they are open to change. It's why religion preys on vulnerable people. We are not magically going to change the minds of others by trying to craft an image or reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd  rather have people in this sub that want to be here. Not others coming to troll or mock us like religious reddits. This is our safe space for open ideas, not self censorship based on what others think.

       I agree you can't change people's beliefs unless they're willing to change but I bet that they are
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       more willing to change if we seek some kind of common ground. I mean, we have to be self aware here as a whole. We know the stereotype and image that comes with r/conspiracy. I don't believe it, you don't believe it, 99% of the subscribers of this sub don't believe it. But many many people out there are dismissive of us because I feel like we lack self awareness as a whole. And I think addressing that aspect and mitigating it are the keys to increasing our credibility! (Not that in truth anything is wrong with it, but in their eyes we increase our credibility). Long story short, I think we can be smarter about how we engage and present ourselves.

       We have no reason to engage them nor seek common ground.  It's not in our best interest.  People with a curious mind will seek out the information and eventually find their way here.  Those without will merely dismiss the effort.

       No it won't matter.  The "masses" are overworked and underpaid, just like the govt wants.  If one steps out of line, he's whacked so the others see it and don't misbehave.  It's been this way since the dawn of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they are "awakened" what are you expecting to happen?  A giant revolt that lynches all of the elite?  Not happening.  In America, people will shrug their shoulders, and go back to watching the Kardashians and playing Call of Duty.

       No no nothing like that. I just see very often on this sub how the masses are "sheeple" and "they don't want to be awake" and this and that. If those that complain about how asleep others are, well, I think that awakening people would be a motive. Unless of course we just complain to complain, which is naturally a human thing to do with not even r/conspiracy being impervious to it.

       It's all good - I personally think that we as a community use sheeple and the masses to dehumanize our fellow people that are unaware or ignorant of what's going on.  I blame part of the popularity of these terms on Alex Jones, but his whole MO is to keep people scared so he can make money, just like the government he reports on :)

       I understand what you're trying to accomplish.  The problem is this....lets say we did get "credibility".  The typical government response it to infiltrate as a member, and then damage the group.  Ever notice a lot of the violence by "protestors" are actually by people working for the government?  Same thing would happen here.  We work hard to gain credibility and someone will fuck it all up.  Repeat until the human race finally wipes itself out.

       Oh yeah I see what you're saying. That's way up like 10 steps ahead stuff. I know I kind of failed in my message (which in all honesty I kind of expected would happen), but this is how I see it:
      </p>
      <p>
       This Pizza Gate stuff is really wonky, I get weird vibes from it. There's definitely more to it. Many who read stuff on it can agree that something weird is going on. If there is a pedophile ring going on around it, then yes, I would definitely want that coming to light and those involved held responsible. The thing is, can you guess what I see when I see it being discussed on the mainstream subs? "Oh great another conspiracy theory" or "go back to your basement and get more tin-foil" etc. Which sucks because reasonable people can be tapped into if it wasn't for the word of a conspiracy theorist being damned before its even listened to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right away many "average" people won't listen to a conspiracy theorist even if they were being told water was wet. I think part of that image came from maybe some fantastical theories. The thing is is that the "average" person will say, this group believed something so "ridiculous" that nothing they say can be taken seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post was just my way of seeing the disconnect between the two groups and offering a suggestion on remedying the divide. That's all. Again I know nothing will come of it but I at least wanted to reach those willing to listen and have a place for me to have it all written down and documented in case someone was curious about the same thing that I saw happening.

       This is ludicrous on so many levels.  Who appointed you leader, and why do you care about "our" perceived "credibility, stereotype, reputation"?  What a load of horse shit.  What a waste of your life to concern yourself with such trivial matters.

       That's fine that you think that. But with that attitude you're fighting fire with fire. You're missing my point, which is fine. I suspected that I wouldn't get through to some people because of how many varied personalities there are and you're unfortunately one of them. I just think that if conspiracy theories are to gain more credibility, this is part of the way to do it. I'm entertaining what you're saying because I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and type back a thoughtful reply, which unfortunately again is met with hostility. This is the very point I'm trying to make because many many people will write off anything you have to say because of how you come off. If you care about any truth seeing the light then you're being your own worst enemy. And I'm here because I wanted to help the community with that.

       As stated before: This sub is made up of about 400k people. Why do you think anyone here should give a shit about the perceived, intangible "reputation" of this sub? This is a wholly ridiculous notion and topic.

       Read the above over and over until you understand it.

       I agree with your thoughtful post. It's just difficult sometimes, and we get burnt out. Overall, we are a fairly cohesive unit as a whole with love and concern for one another. We also have the ability to debate viciously and be friends the next day. Objectivity. It's the glue that holds our tin foil hats on.

       Nah, pass.  People should be skeptical of the importance of connections that we find here.  Striving to be liked cripplingly politicizes the investigation process.  Conspiracy theorists are here to share openly our thoughts on various connections soliciting outside observations.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are quite a few people here either reading or writing in this sub, obviously open speculation is interesting enough to people to be worth maintaining a forum for it.  If someone comes in here with an "am I crazy or..." type post, yeah maybe they are.  They've believed before investigating completely.  Moving from classic education to self directed education is rough, so many people make this mistake of believing the first thing that agrees with their gut.
      </p>

       Let the sub be what it is, if you want to create curated conspiracy hub removing the more exotic conspiracies, go for it; but don't expect it from this place.

       Hey! Sorry, I'm not trying to change the realm of this sub. I agree, it's a safe place for those wishing to speculate to speculate. I'm just pointing out what I notice when us speculators wander into the mainstream subs and try to have a discussion on our speculations. Why our speculations are't taken very well and some remedies or tips on dealing with those OUTSIDE this sub. It's not about being liked per se, it's more about giving our conspiracies more weight. Part of it seems like it's trying to be more "likable" when in reality I'm just looking to find pragmatic strategies for dealing with others who won't give legitimate conspiracies the light of day due to reputation alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should have made it more clear in the post but at least to anyone who cares to read what I write will hopefully see this exchange and understand my intent. I'm all for the exotic conspiracies too!

       I get it, and sort of agree with you.  People should generally understand and respect the type of dialogue people have in other places and adopt the fashion of expression in those other areas without misrepresenting themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key problem is that people like certainty.  I could discuss something like the time traveler Pence thing with my friends because it's pretty far outside of the realm of normal, but pizzagate would be a more challenging discussion because it plays with more real fears of child exploitation and the depravity of the elite class.  The closer it comes to plausible the more the listener feels the need to formulate an opinion.  More likely than not, they will reject the new option for their old simply for convenience sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       This binary method leaves us with a need for a theory to be right or wrong, when the fact of the matter is that most people are uncertain, only seeking more information to formulate a clearer theory.  So, people can keep quiet about their interests, or they can share their interests and hope other people can acquire the taste for uncertainty that we all share here.  I'm not sure there's a better method than just geeking out about conspiracies to outsiders.

       Yeah, ultimately yes I do agree with you. When the truth is a little too big a pill to swallow and the hard concrete evidence isn't enough then I see skeptics like an animal backed into a corner. Unwilling to believe or entertain what's in front of them. This post was by no means a panacea, just a starting point on some of the broader issues r/conspiracy faces when communicating with those that have these preconceived notions of what a "conspiracy theorist" is. Thanks for the reply!

       Seriously right? The only fix I can think of is to respect one another. I see big time how the media tries to divide and conquer. I see so clearly now when gurus and stuff say that respect is the best weapon. Anyways take it easy! Hopefully I'll see you around here sometime!

       How many words does it take to restate "be nice"? If it results in a plausible defense of Pedosta Pizza, then NO! He's already guilty if not of perverted acts or worse, he's guilty of being a twisted megalomaniac. None of you "get" it, his inside joke: he's referring to his jisum, come, man cream, semen i.e. "Podesta Sauce". He's telling his friends he wants to shoot his juice in front of and on them. He's another Weiner. Verdict GUILTY! Pure creep.

       Hey! So it's kind of sort of "be nice" but more like: present info in a way that doesn't hinder the message we are trying to convey. I agree, there's some crazy things going on with this pizza stuff. And yes, I am angry (as I suspect a lot of us are). I'm angry for the innocent kids. I'm angry that the elite making a mockery of us in front of our faces. However, I also believe that we can convey our messages more effectively.

       The content is so wide and the tone so varied,  that any user here is only interested in a portion of the content.    So,  the bell curve here is as large as the total population probably,  and there is no way to apologize for or remedy that.   R/conspiracy is probably one of the least censored subs on reddit.

       If you want a conspiracy site that has its act together,  that would be .5%,  like maybe Kevin Ryan's
       <a href="https://digwithin.net/">
        https://digwithin.net/
       </a>
       ,  or David Ray Griffin's
       <a href="https://davidraygriffin.com/">
        https://davidraygriffin.com/
       </a>
       or James Douglass
       <a href="http://jfkfacts.org/tag/james-douglass/">
        http://jfkfacts.org/tag/james-douglass/
       </a>
       ,  and there are many more credible people,  Stephen Cohen,
       <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/emeritus-professor-russian-studies-stephen-cohen/">

       Here is another thing,  even people like Anderson Cooper or Wolf Blitzer,  who come across as sane,   are sick fucks spreading lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet,  if you doubt the official narrative,  there is a huge psychological price,  or as many think,  its only after you already get psychologically fucked you go over to the deep end.    The stuff on here helps to show the personal price of tasting the forbidden fruit:

       I was kidding.
       <br/>
       I find this sub much less toxic than the ones you think we should be appealing to.

       People have been posting good stuff here for along time and getting derided for it...so...you..know.. fuck them.

       Okay haha, I had a feeling but didn't all the know. No I agree this sub is way less toxic (I mean I am getting reasonable people to discuss this idea with me after all). And I agree too that there's a lot of GREAT content posted on here!

       I'm not your enemy! Haha, because I come from both spheres of social circles, this one, and "the masses" and I see where the disconnect is. I feel that we could make things much easier for ourselves and give our words more credibility to those who doubt it. Again I'm on

       here.

       Again, you are trying to attribute people who come to or view this sub as some kind of homogeneous, branded group.  It doesn't work that way.  We don't need etiquette lessons.  I come here to read interesting stuff, it doesn't identify who I am.  You seem to feel otherwise.

       No no nothing like that. I just see very often on this sub how the masses are "sheeple" and "they don't want to be awake" and this and that. If those that complain about how asleep others are, well, I think that awakening people would be a motive. Unless of course we just complain to complain, which is naturally a human thing to do with not even r/conspiracy being impervious to it.

       Edit: BTW I'm not calling you a complainer! I appreciate the exchange we're having!
