       I loved visiting r/conspiracy because people were actually thinking critically here. But a huge number of users are only here to jerk off to Trump. Why and how did that happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has been part of the elite his whole life. He admitted paying politicians, he lied many times during his campaign. Many establishment figures are part of his circle, Mike Pence is his VP for fuck's sake. He met with Kissinger only recently. What makes people think that he is the 'savior'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, Trump is part of the problem not the solution. (Still happy that Clinton lost, though.)

       During/after the debates, there was a flood of fake/brigading/new username accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before that was a core of only 40-50 maximum daily posters, except the #1 upvoted post, usually artificially inflated to 3000-4000 upvotes, with #2 post only 100-200 upvotes, which started a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now almost all the usernames are new, and even many regular posters before summer have vanished.

       What is it Infowars always says? "There's a war on for your mind" - and it's waged here, too.

       Plenty of people here saw Trump for what he was, what he is - but it's essentially a numbers game and it's hard for the real folks to compete with the propagandist hordes.

       Yeah. There's some weird stuff going on there, too, with the Clinton shills. I'm watching the usual suspects on Twitter do this weird lockstep - first it was "Bernie Bros are threatening me! But I can't show you a single example!," then "You hate Clinton because she's woman, you misogynists!" then it was "The Russians have hacked the election! Trump is a Russian stooge but I have no proof!," then it was "The Podesta emails are fake but I can't point a single one out!" then it was "Clinton lost because
       <em>
        Bernie Sanders
       </em>
       and Jill Stein" which is a total WTF, then, honest to god, a bunch of them started posting "calm down, Trump won't be
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       bad" shit today. And now back to the Russian scare  - hilarious tweeting a "must read" article that "proves" the election was hacked but...quotes a bunch of experts saying, "I don't think the Russians hacked the election."
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, wow, where are these Clinton-shills getting these talking points from and WHY? I can make neither heads nor tails of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do find it funny that conservatives fall for fake news and get histrionic, and liberals don't actually read the articles and get histrionic.

       I feel like conspiracy followers in general terms to slant right. A lot of the Illuminati shit that gets people interested is presented from a Christian perspective, which leads to a more conservative base. Add old time favorite Hillary Clinton to the mix and you're almost begging to attractvTrumo supporters.

       While there are noticeable amounts of Trump supporters frequenting this sub lately, i wouldn't go as far as calling r/conspiracy a Trump circle jerk. The fact is that HRC is/was the greater threat, and has the majority of our attention here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has not even been sworn into office yet. But know that if and when he takes office, and if he starts to fuck up, the vast majority of users here will be on him like white on rice, exposing him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally didn't "support" Trump, (didn't vote), and have frequently advised caution when it comes to trusting Trump....but in the end, I was able to give him the benefit of the doubt that he will keep his word and be the president that he siad he wants to be. Where as with HRC, i had 0 doubt that she was a villain. I think it's safe to say that that opinion is held by the majority of r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: and honestly, i don't think a lot of users will be satisfied and change focus off of HRC until she is behind bars.

       Not a tremendous amount. But more and more people are waking up to the fact that we are in a downward spiral. Waking up to the fact that the system is broken. Without people exposing the sordid truth about these people via the internet, we would be in a much worst place than we are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Approval ratings for mainstream media and government are at all time lows. This is in large part due to the exposing of corruption on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as creating real policy changes by keeping government/media in check via the internet, that is without a doubt going to be a slow uphill battle, but it is better than doing nothing at all. Public complacency is just as much, if not more, to blame than the media/government officials participating in the corruption.

       I feel like it's less pro-trump so much as anti-clinton. There's good reason for that. For now, I think lots of people are happy she didn't get her claws into the Oval Office, but also, most people genuinely want to see her brought to justice in some way.

       The only way the MAGA hype will keep its momentum is if trump delivers on his promises. I guess we'll all have to see how that unfolds in time.

       There is a big part of me that
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       wants to see Trump fail to deliver on all of his big MAGA promises. It's schadenfreude, sure, but I want to witness as realization dawns on all of his supporters that they got played in the same exact way that people have been getting played for decades now.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first, all the naysayers will get downvoted/deleted, much as now. But then some of the more respected posters will come to the same conclusions. And then some more. And then it will become impossible to contain the shift in perception. And then... I guess they come here and bitch about Trump like the rest of us (though I'm not particularly looking forward to them bringing their T_D vernacular, since to me it's just as stupid, frantic, hyperbolic, and unnecessary as Twitch-speak). Or maybe it spawns a dedicated faction of apologists, those who are unwilling to admit that their fealty was misplaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might not ever happen, but it would be a glorious thing to witness. Perhaps it would teach people not to get on the idol worship train so quickly next time. Perhaps people would finally realize that big business cares about big business, not the little guy.

       Dont hold your breath. Just look at the last presidential elections for proof of that. I mean are we really going to sit here and wait for someone to fulfill campaign promises. History tells is its not going to happen. The less attention you give this system, the sooner they loose there perceived authority and the quicker we can take back control over our lives.

       Not been here very long, but I've noticed the Trump mob on other sites.  God Like Productions used to be a pretty good place for information and people thinking skeptically and logically.   I recently was banned though for pointing out his cozying up to the Neo-conservatives as of late....

       Great, now its time to transcend your beliefs about a election result having any real effect on the people in which we are told these organizations represent. Come to your own conclusions about how real change is going to happen and stop relying on other people telling you that more government is going to make things better.

       There is no such thing as "forced choice"
You have a choice, you just chose not to make it because you are too invested in the outcome.

       Anybody that says they were forced into a choice between two lesser evils is deceiving themselves and falling for public opinion. Whoever makes this excuse has weak will and is unable to make choices independent of a political echo chamber.

       The TPP is dead in the water already. He said he would also stop arming the Syrian "Rebels" immediately. And he may take out the Clinton Foundation (the CF investigation is still open and ongoing). TPP has already been accomplished, the next two are very important I believe he will get them done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he made the "globalist conspiracy" mainstream. Before this election, if you used the word "globalist", you were a tin foil nut. Now, it's just common fact that there is an international group of elites trying to control the world.

       He also said that the Assad regime is 'evil', although it was the US that made it seem that way (I'm not saying that Assad's regime was all butterflies and roses). He also said that we have to take out the terrorists families.
      </p>

       What I want to say is that Trump says many things, some of which are true and good ideas. But he also lies, A LOT, like any other politician. He's also part of the Elite, he admitted paying politicians for 'favors'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is not the good guy some people want him to be. But we'll see, only time can tell. My bet is that absolutely nothing (in the grand scheme) will change.

       The TPP didn't lie within his interests, so he ended it. This is (potentionally) a good thing, doesn't mean that he is truthful about the other thing he says/said. But like I said, let's wait and see.

       It isn't. Many people here recognize that he's just another big business fatcat. There just isn't as much interesting dirt on him right now. Yeah, he visited rape island a few times, yeah he probably has ties with Russia or the Clintons or any other number of things. Once this other stuff dies down, I'm sure we'll get back to ripping on him regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also got a LOT of T_D posters at one point (thanks to so much overlap with the CF/Pizzagate stuff), some of whom don't seem to recognize that this is a separate sub. They are usually reported or told to take their frothing idol worship back to their sub. Some are just liberal with their downvotes, sending posts with Trump criticisms into the "below threshold" territory. Some are probably shills, but there's no real way to prove it.

       No one thinks Trump is the messiah (I hope), but he is a huge step up from every president since JFK. And JFK's family didn't exactly gain their wealth honestly either.
