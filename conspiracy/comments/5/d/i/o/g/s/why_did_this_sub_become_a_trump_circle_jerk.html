        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I loved visiting r/conspiracy because people were actually thinking critically here. But a huge number of users are only here to jerk off to Trump. Why and how did that happen?</p>

<p>Trump has been part of the elite his whole life. He admitted paying politicians, he lied many times during his campaign. Many establishment figures are part of his circle, Mike Pence is his VP for fuck&#39;s sake. He met with Kissinger only recently. What makes people think that he is the &#39;savior&#39;?</p>

<p>Long story short, Trump is part of the problem not the solution. (Still happy that Clinton lost, though.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. There&#39;s some weird stuff going on there, too, with the Clinton shills. I&#39;m watching the usual suspects on Twitter do this weird lockstep - first it was &quot;Bernie Bros are threatening me! But I can&#39;t show you a single example!,&quot; then &quot;You hate Clinton because she&#39;s woman, you misogynists!&quot; then it was &quot;The Russians have hacked the election! Trump is a Russian stooge but I have no proof!,&quot; then it was &quot;The Podesta emails are fake but I can&#39;t point a single one out!&quot; then it was &quot;Clinton lost because <em>Bernie Sanders</em> and Jill Stein&quot; which is a total WTF, then, honest to god, a bunch of them started posting &quot;calm down, Trump won&#39;t be <em>that</em> bad&quot; shit today. And now back to the Russian scare  - hilarious tweeting a &quot;must read&quot; article that &quot;proves&quot; the election was hacked but...quotes a bunch of experts saying, &quot;I don&#39;t think the Russians hacked the election.&quot;</p>

<p>Like, wow, where are these Clinton-shills getting these talking points from and WHY? I can make neither heads nor tails of it.</p>

<p>But I do find it funny that conservatives fall for fake news and get histrionic, and liberals don&#39;t actually read the articles and get histrionic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While there are noticeable amounts of Trump supporters frequenting this sub lately, i wouldn&#39;t go as far as calling r/conspiracy a Trump circle jerk. The fact is that HRC is/was the greater threat, and has the majority of our attention here.    </p>

<p>Trump has not even been sworn into office yet. But know that if and when he takes office, and if he starts to fuck up, the vast majority of users here will be on him like white on rice, exposing him.    </p>

<p>I personally didn&#39;t &quot;support&quot; Trump, (didn&#39;t vote), and have frequently advised caution when it comes to trusting Trump....but in the end, I was able to give him the benefit of the doubt that he will keep his word and be the president that he siad he wants to be. Where as with HRC, i had 0 doubt that she was a villain. I think it&#39;s safe to say that that opinion is held by the majority of r/conspiracy.    </p>

<p>EDIT: and honestly, i don&#39;t think a lot of users will be satisfied and change focus off of HRC until she is behind bars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a tremendous amount. But more and more people are waking up to the fact that we are in a downward spiral. Waking up to the fact that the system is broken. Without people exposing the sordid truth about these people via the internet, we would be in a much worst place than we are now.        </p>

<p>Approval ratings for mainstream media and government are at all time lows. This is in large part due to the exposing of corruption on the internet.    </p>

<p>As far as creating real policy changes by keeping government/media in check via the internet, that is without a doubt going to be a slow uphill battle, but it is better than doing nothing at all. Public complacency is just as much, if not more, to blame than the media/government officials participating in the corruption.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a big part of me that <em>really</em> wants to see Trump fail to deliver on all of his big MAGA promises. It&#39;s schadenfreude, sure, but I want to witness as realization dawns on all of his supporters that they got played in the same exact way that people have been getting played for decades now.</p>

<p>At first, all the naysayers will get downvoted/deleted, much as now. But then some of the more respected posters will come to the same conclusions. And then some more. And then it will become impossible to contain the shift in perception. And then... I guess they come here and bitch about Trump like the rest of us (though I&#39;m not particularly looking forward to them bringing their T_D vernacular, since to me it&#39;s just as stupid, frantic, hyperbolic, and unnecessary as Twitch-speak). Or maybe it spawns a dedicated faction of apologists, those who are unwilling to admit that their fealty was misplaced.</p>

<p>It might not ever happen, but it would be a glorious thing to witness. Perhaps it would teach people not to get on the idol worship train so quickly next time. Perhaps people would finally realize that big business cares about big business, not the little guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude you are talking politics. Thats not my language. I dont speak politicaese, I speak man to man language. If you want to be deceived by fictional political talking points you&#39;re the one that is playing into semantics, not me.</p>

<p>You still dont understand the problem. This isn&#39;t our court, it isn&#39;t our rules. It&#39;s their court, and their rules. Why are you playing ball in their court? Stop playing ball in other people&#39;s court and start playing ball in your own court.</p>

<p>P.S Im not playing word games with you. Every word I use means exactly what you think it means, but on a symbolic level. Stop second guessing yourself and receive the message being sent. I&#39;m not using encryption.</p>

Because he&#39;s a bigoted idiot with a lot of bad ideas for government and <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/3696795/you-all-know-that-the-clinton-campaign-deliberately-plotted-to-get-trump-nominated-right/">he only was able to become the Republican candidate for president after his old friend Hillary got the media to elevate him to be her controlled opposition</a>. </p>

<p>Why do people keep spreading this false notion? This is the same shit those dumbass CTR fucks been pulling for a long time now, accusing this sub of being r/the_donald2 or some shit. No. You go try leaving a comment at r/the_donald that points out what I did in my first paragraph and you see how long it is before you&#39;re buried in downvotes, inbox filled with insults, and end up banned from the sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The TPP is dead in the water already. He said he would also stop arming the Syrian &quot;Rebels&quot; immediately. And he may take out the Clinton Foundation (the CF investigation is still open and ongoing). TPP has already been accomplished, the next two are very important I believe he will get them done. </p>

<p>Also, he made the &quot;globalist conspiracy&quot; mainstream. Before this election, if you used the word &quot;globalist&quot;, you were a tin foil nut. Now, it&#39;s just common fact that there is an international group of elites trying to control the world. </p>

<p>What I want to say is that Trump says many things, some of which are true and good ideas. But he also lies, A LOT, like any other politician. He&#39;s also part of the Elite, he admitted paying politicians for &#39;favors&#39;. </p>

<p>Trump is not the good guy some people want him to be. But we&#39;ll see, only time can tell. My bet is that absolutely nothing (in the grand scheme) will change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t. Many people here recognize that he&#39;s just another big business fatcat. There just isn&#39;t as much interesting dirt on him right now. Yeah, he visited rape island a few times, yeah he probably has ties with Russia or the Clintons or any other number of things. Once this other stuff dies down, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get back to ripping on him regularly.</p>

<p>We also got a LOT of T_D posters at one point (thanks to so much overlap with the CF/Pizzagate stuff), some of whom don&#39;t seem to recognize that this is a separate sub. They are usually reported or told to take their frothing idol worship back to their sub. Some are just liberal with their downvotes, sending posts with Trump criticisms into the &quot;below threshold&quot; territory. Some are probably shills, but there&#39;s no real way to prove it.</p>
