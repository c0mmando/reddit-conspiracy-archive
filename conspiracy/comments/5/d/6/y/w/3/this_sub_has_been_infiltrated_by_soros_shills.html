       I am so sick of the Fucking word. I hate trump and Hillary equally. I am actually quite sick of the pro trump post and everyone calling eschother shills. For instance 
P1 "I hate trump" 
P2 "you must be a shill" 
P3. "Maybe you're a shill for calling P1 a shill" 
P2 "you're a shill for calling me a shill" 
P1 "but I hate Hillary to" 
P2 "shill shill shill"

       Fully agreed. I don't like Hillary, but I'm actually afraid to say that in mixed company because there's so much vitriol from "liberals" that they would automatically assume I'm some misogynistic, xenophobic Trump supporter. Which I am not. (and don't believe that all Trump supporters are.) And vice versa, my wife and in laws are conservative and I dare not speak ill of Trump or the Republican party or I'm some goddamn hippie socialist (though my wife says this jokingly, my father in law... Not so much.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This election has been a resounding success if only in terms of absolutely dividing us. It's insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If only people would make up their own minds about things. We have vast amounts of information at our fingertips, we could be educating ourselves about different political systems and practices and deciding what we think is best for our country but instead most people are content to listen to whatever CNN or Fox news wants us to think and use the Internet for bitchy Facebook posts and pictures of cats.
      </p>
      <p>
       I long for the old days when candidates would tour the states and debate for literally
       <em>
        hours
       </em>
       . Untelevised, unedited, and without a fucking makeup artist to make them presentable and palatable for the dumb, shallow masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry this turned into a rant. It just seems to me that the problems America faces lie less in the people we put into office and more in our own dumb sensibilities.

       I actually lost a friendship during this election around the time of the DNC convention because of this. She blew up on me when I voiced my discontent that Hillary was a serious contender for the nominee. This was before bernie was actually out of the running. People are still going crazy over this election

       My circles have absolute discontent in criminals running for president, and have no ambitions to "fear" openly voicing their support for their nominee which very well is Trump -
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a contextual and subliminally discharged opinion which placates a level of advanced psychological damaging affects, to users whom take its talking points in as absolute.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no division in our party, We who choose "Trump"; Choose him for the good of the nation and took no offense to losing company which was too small minded to see that this election was about the continuation of present order; Which was the wrong direction for this once great and now divided empire -

       People have been conditioned to believe they need a group of mummys and daddys 'looking after them' or my favourite phrase "keeping them safe". Then counter conditioned to believe that humans were once running around killing thousands of mammoths, more mammoths than there were humans lol. It's all confusion and distraction tactics.

       You say that, but personally I've never come across any account here that legitimately appears to be a Trump shill, or is even accused of being a trump shill by other users. CTR shills on the other hand totally took over

       as well as a number of other default subreddits during the runup to the election--no one who has done their due diligence can dispute that. I think a number of them are still being paid to distract people on social media from the numerous scandals HRC is involved in. Sure, Trump is an asshole and people need to pay attention to his every move now that he is President Elect, but we have too much damning evidence against Hillary at this point to ignore, and imo she and her foundation are our best bet for exposing the TPTB for the sick and degenerate fucks that they are. As far as I'm concerned Trump may very well be involved, but the Clinton Foundation and the leaked emails are the priorities atm.

       You're absolutely right. The MSM is already bought and paid for, and now they're working on ensuring that social media is totally controlled as well. Things will only get worse unless we can stand united and condemn the misappropriation of news and media outlets by the gov. and private interests.

       I don't know why more people don't acknowledge this.  It is by far the most logical conclusion to come to.  The idea that only the left or right, and not both, are being manipulated is hilariously naive.

       I'm fine with people being "anti-Trump," but at least cite legitimate criticism. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Complaints about transition team being full of bankers and multinationals = valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying things like, "You're naive, gullible idiots if you think he's not controlled" = obnoxious and unproductive.

       The notion that donald trump isn't controlled or at least as full of BS as anyone else on a presidential debate stage is what requires evidence and appeals to his personality or a want to do this out of a genuine personal interest are logically fallacious. Short of that, unwarranted belief in any candidate is foolish.

       Actually, I'm of the opinion that the media--in its ongoing attempt to push a specific narrative and get Clinton elected--pushed anti-Trump propaganda by distorting his comments, making him come across as an anti-Semitic white supremacist, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you listen to what he actually says, he's not any of those things. He has good ideas for the country. Not the best, but not apocalyptic either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have legitimate complaints against Trump's platform, and his choice of the transition team is cause for alarm. But the fact is, none of us can predict with 100% certainty what he'll do in office. Given that I was spectacularly wrong about who I thought would be sitting in the oval office, I'm trying to keep more of an open mind.

       Here is the thing. All of his previous actions point to him being a disingenuous bullshit artist. He comes across  quite simply like a used car salesman.  You have a guy who literally grew his brand from tabloids. He says one thing and says the complete opposite a day later. Then when called on it, he pivots.  He has previous claims in lawsuits, that at best makes him a scummy and at worst makes him a con-artist criminal. From his speech patterns to his public persona, this dude is the embodiment of an upsell. He upsells so well, he has incorporated it into his normal speech pattern. To anyone that can spot the hustle, this dude screams hustler. He literally upsells everything he does. I don't think hes racist or sexist necessarily. I do think hes a scumbag opportunist who will take advantage of every opportunity that presents itself. I do think that will be his ultimate downfall. I do think he is corrupt and because he is a scumbag he is easily corruptible.  I do think he is in way over his head and doesn't fully understand that game that he is playing. I do think he is smarter than people give him credit for, but way dumber than he himself believes he is.

       The media had no need to distort his comments, they frankly speak for themselves. That you are going to sit here and tell me that I'm somehow incapable of parsing Trump's words without being prompted is a bit insulting.

       And what I said was that if you think he's as likely to actually enact any of his "great ideas" then it's as foolish as believing any presidential candidate will stand by their words. There is nothing magical about Trump.

       What are you referring to? Should it matter if it is "anti-Trump" if it is true? I don't think so. I'm still curious as to what type of scrutiny is going to be applied to him during his time in the office.

       TIL if you post anything negative about Trump you are a Soros shill and there are no Trump shills. Up until Elizabeth Warren called him out Trump was filling the swamp with the exact people he called do empty the swamp of.

       I've been here for months and I've always had the sense that the majority of the users here recognize Trump was always a bad candidate. Even with some actively in favor of him and others willing to vote for him as the lesser evil, I still always got the impression that people understand he's bad. In all the comments here where I've directly identified Trump as bad, stupid, bigoted, a puppet, etc., I don't think I've ever ended up with negative comment karma over it. This sub is NOT r/the_donald2.0 or whatever the fuck those dumbass CTR jerks liked to claim while trolling here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are more posts exposing Trump's badness now, it's probably because we don't have daily Podesta emails and an upcoming election that we expected to be rigged pushing us to focus on Clinton. In fact, exit poll data suggests that if anything, votes were tampered with to turn Republican losses into Republican wins.

       I don't think anyone likes the idea of a Republican President by any 
name less than I do and I think the fixation on Soros is extremely misinformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not posted a single  anti-Trump self.post or anti Trump link.  (*typos)
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of us are deeply disturbed about a one party government.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe some of the anti-Trump posts are because of that and not particular to finding Trump unpalatable as a President.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the vote count is final we will probably find more votes total for the Republican House and Senate seats than for Trump, that is where the money was spent and for good reason.  We have seen that can prevent a Democratic President from any say and still protect the Court.

       I honestly don't think this sub sways enough opinion to draw that many real paid shills.  I can easily see a lot of pissed off Democrats venting all over Reddit including here. That is normal after a close election they thought they would win.

       Let's demand a little more logic and supporting info before we post a new thread with only 28 words.
