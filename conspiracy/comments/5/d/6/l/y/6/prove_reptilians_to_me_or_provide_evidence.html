    <div class="md"><p>IMO it refers to bloodlines too, but the problem with Icke is he actually believes they are genuinely lizard people, shapeshifters etc and claims he knows people who have seen members of the Royal Family shapeshift (because of course he has!) 
There are a bunch of people who claims they have seen people shapeshift, or know somebody who has seen it, but there&#39;s no physical proof of this. With video cameras being easily accessible now, why not? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would give this theory more consideration if it was primarily about bloodlines. But as you said, the subscribers to this theory genuinely think these people are lizard people who shape shift. One person I know who genuinely believes this theory is real explained to me that the reptilian people &#39;can&#39;t breed&#39; with normal &quot;human slaves&quot; (those words were actually used) and that they only procreate with other reptilian. I can&#39;t buy into that without more information. </p>

<p>Also - I asked the same person &quot;so these reptilians - are they just a specific race of Alien?&quot; They told me, &quot;no, no, no.. those are two completely different things&quot;. I guess I just think that our perception of what an &quot;alien&quot; is is probably very different from reality. And how can you really definitively distinguish between two different theorized species with no real evidence to even support the existence of one of them? </p>

<p>I would say the root of all this is the babylonian take over and enslavement of the original jews. What do you know about that? The bible is becoming more and more relevant in these times. Read the book of Ezra if you wish to know the history of the Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a guy at work that i used to buy weed from. </p>

<p>One day at his place we both took a few hits and i watched him masterfully play a multiplayer FPS on his PC.</p>

<p>I said in a statement of astonishment, &quot;it&#39;s as if your consciousness is more expanded than mine&quot;. In response without hisitation or ego he said, &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>

<p>I then asked him if he was a lizard person and i asked him if he was a lizard person would he have to admit it. Again without hesitation he said, &quot;Yes&quot;. I then proceeded to ask if he was a lizard person and he very a matter of factly said, &quot;Yes&quot;</p>

<p>He then went on to tell me that another one of our co-workers was a lizard person as well. I didn&#39;t make this connection at the time but I did once I did some research. Supposedly lizard people are predominantly redheads and both of them were gingers.</p>

<p>Now i too am a redhead so i am definitely not saying all redheads are lizard people. </p>

<p>Something that also stood out to me was in his refrigerator he had a pitcher of tap water. On the pitcher he had skull and crossbones picture with fluoride written underneath it. Why would anyone keep something like that in their refrigerator? </p>

<p>Now lizard people aren&#39;t lizards with human skin on or some sort of force field projector showing human form. They are beings From a &quot;higher 4th negative&quot; Dimension who have materialize themselves into the human form. They aren&#39;t all necessarily in positions of power either. Their sole purpose is to keep as many of us reincarnating into this dimension. </p>

<p>We are spiritual beings locked into a physical form but to them we are food.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe what David Icke has said about them using some sort of technology to keep us here. It all comes down to your souls vibrational level. How selfish you are or how selfless you are.</p>

<p>I will say one thing about David Icke Saturn moon Matrix Theory. One night I took a bunch of synthetic psilocybin and stared out into the night sky. Every single point of light was moving wildly except for Saturn. I know this because I had my wife trip sitting with me and she had a start charting app on her phone.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 100% sure we are living in Sauron&#39;s Middle Earth.</p>

If it&#39;s fake l, this is taking up valuable space in our brains. We will definitely know our political leaders of today: which are of the age normal people retire, get put in nursing homes, need home health, die, etc.; are still in power and retain power as our political leaders of tomorrow. I belive there could be a lot more to this but I highly doubt Chris Christie is Barny&#39;s alias.</p>

So just to please her I said fine I&#39;ll go and &quot;be awake to the truth.&quot; I get there and for the most part I was down with what he was saying about  the state of the world. Then he asked if we knew who was behind all this. He said it wasn&#39;t the government, it wasn&#39;t the corporations, it wasn&#39;t the politicians. At this point I was like he is going to say its the banks. Then he said it wasn&#39;t even the banks. I&#39;m like on no, don&#39;t say it, don&#39;t you dare say it. Lizard people! The moon is hollow! It&#39;s an antenna for Saturn and its energies... This was 10 hour lecture. I didn&#39;t stay long after that. I just think there are really shitty people in the world.

<p>Doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Bonus:  Here&#39;s a quick history for anybody interested. Not Icke :) It is written from one inside the programs to other insiders so it might be a bit out of context for us, but still a good read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO it refers to bloodlines too, but the problem with Icke is he actually believes they are genuinely lizard people, shapeshifters etc and claims he knows people who have seen members of the Royal Family shapeshift (because of course he has!) 
There are a bunch of people who claims they have seen people shapeshift, or know somebody who has seen it, but there&#39;s no physical proof of this. With video cameras being easily accessible now, why not? </p>
