       I personally believe this shitstorm is just brewing and something 9/11 scale is coming. There's gotta be a reason Washington and all of the media are pushing these fake news stories trying to incite the 2nd Civil War. They will catch us off guard, then offer a pseudo-solution that will further deprive our rights to privacy. Like Patriot Act's Bi-Polar little brother.

       I don't think so.  They wouldn't get away with it again, and I think they know that.  There are still isolated people who believe in the official story, but the majority are aware that there is at least room for reasonable doubt.  Trump was talking openly about how he thought 9/11 needed to be re-investigated, for instance; and he knew that he was saying what his base wanted to hear when he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the time of using false flags is largely over; whenever a new one happens now, you can get information debunking it within 24 hours of the incident.  Sandy Hook was probably the last major one.

       But, the majority of the masses wholeheartedly believe that sandy hook was real. They aren't awake to it, they call anyone that denounces it as a false flag "insensitive lunatics". They most certainly could get away with more.

       The masses just voted in Trump.  I'm inclined to give them a bit more credit than usual, recently.  I've also seen polls on how unpopular Congress and the government in general are, recently.  The herd are waking up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Left are not the majority.  They try and claim they are, but the groups and perspectives that they speak for, truthfully represent less than 10% of the population.  To the extent that the majority go along with them, it is usually to try and get them to shut up, and the Left themselves know that.  Sandy Hook specifically might still be a bit raw, but alternative perspectives on 9/11 are getting a lot more airtime than they used to, these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baby steps.  The Left need to be pushed back one inch at a time.  We'll get there.

       The kids were fake, the parents were actors and the school was shut down a few years prior due to asbestos. should just search "sandy hook parent laughing before interview" that will start you on the right path. He is preparing for it like he is an actor, which he is.

       But seriously, I suppose they are allowing Obama a smooth exit from the office. Gives those who measure what kind of public trauma needs to be inflicted on US populations plenty of time to manifest a devastating attempt in 2017 at wrecking whatever social cohesion is left.

       I think they know that most people aren't going to fall for it any more.  Add to that, the Muslims are probably really enthusiastic about proving that they are not terrorists these days, in order to ensure that they are not attacked by other groups.

       I could see no major attacks happening during Trump's tenure because they don't have control of the govt to push a specific agenda in the aftermath.

       Right. Guess all we had to do to defeat these incredibly powerful and devious men was to vote for one of two choices in an election they tirelessly promoted. Why were we worried at all?

       The purputraitors protected by Lynch/Holder are afraid they could be prosected by new AG. No cover for false flag terrorism and any actual real terrorists are running for cover from Russian bombs.

       The masses just voted in Trump.  I'm inclined to give them a bit more credit than usual, recently.  I've also seen polls on how unpopular Congress and the government in general are, recently.  The herd are waking up.

       The Left are not the majority.  They try and claim they are, but the groups and perspectives that they speak for, truthfully represent less than 10% of the population.  To the extent that the majority go along with them, it is usually to try and get them to shut up, and the Left themselves know that.  Sandy Hook specifically might still be a bit raw, but alternative perspectives on 9/11 are getting a lot more airtime than they used to, these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baby steps.  The Left need to be pushed back one inch at a time.  We'll get there.
