There&#39;s gotta be a reason Washington and all of the media are pushing these fake news stories trying to incite the 2nd Civil War.

<p>I don&#39;t think so.  They wouldn&#39;t get away with it again, and I think they know that.  There are still isolated people who believe in the official story, but the majority are aware that there is at least room for reasonable doubt.  Trump was talking openly about how he thought 9/11 needed to be re-investigated, for instance; and he knew that he was saying what his base wanted to hear when he did.</p>

<p>I think the time of using false flags is largely over; whenever a new one happens now, you can get information debunking it within 24 hours of the incident.  Sandy Hook was probably the last major one.</p>

<p>The masses just voted in Trump.  I&#39;m inclined to give them a bit more credit than usual, recently.  I&#39;ve also seen polls on how unpopular Congress and the government in general are, recently.  The herd are waking up.</p>

<p>The Left are not the majority.  They try and claim they are, but the groups and perspectives that they speak for, truthfully represent less than 10% of the population.  To the extent that the majority go along with them, it is usually to try and get them to shut up, and the Left themselves know that.  Sandy Hook specifically might still be a bit raw, but alternative perspectives on 9/11 are getting a lot more airtime than they used to, these days.</p>

<p>Baby steps.  The Left need to be pushed back one inch at a time.  We&#39;ll get there.</p>
