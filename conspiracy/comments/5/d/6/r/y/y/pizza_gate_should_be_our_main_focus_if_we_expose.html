       Can you imagine if people found out some of our top politicians and elite are involved in a pedophile ring? This is the scandal that will take them down. Shit like Hillary's emails and Watergate roll off of peoples backs like it's nothing...But having sex with children!? People don't stand for that shit, that is the RED button that will get everyones attention.
      </p>

       Stay on this, blow this shit wide open. Fuck these people, you can tell they're scared because they're deleting comments on the facebook page for Comet Ping Pong, Alefantis deleted his twitter posts, ect.

       We finally have a non-partisan, non-excusable issue and it's still gaining momentum.
       <a href="/r/pizzagate">
        /r/pizzagate

       will be at 10k subscribers soon. Just last week it was at 2k. We've had many people come on here and say they're here because they heard about Pizzagate.

       I am no kiddo, and this is the best opportunity I've seen to actually bring evil to light.

       Amen, if this gets blown open this could stop them in their tracks, or at least force them to backpeddle. The only thing keeping the New World Order afloat is the sheep's trust in the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people find out the system betrayed them, and that they were involved in a fucking pedophile ring (sounds insane just to type it), they will flip shit. This will unify us too, because no matter what political party you're part of, no matter where you lie on the spectrum: Everybody hates fucking pedophiles.

       We need to stay on this big time. Theyre doubling down on everything. Social and mainstream media, as well as the riots. They're scared. You know what they say about a rat with their back to the wall.

       I agree.  The good guys need a win.  This a real life trial of Good vs Evil for the human race.  How do we fight evil??  First off we have to be able to recognize it.  Wikileaks has helped us there immensely, we now know, and others need to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anonymous is pushing stuff out there, but I feel they are pushing the satanic cult too much.  Child Sex Trafficking! Just as bad and regular people understand that it's a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if they understand that the clinton crew and elites are running/protecting it then they will begin to see the facts.  I don't even care about the "cult" shit, all pedophilia and violence toward children needs to be terminated with much prejudice!

       guess it's up us to understand the truth and expose it, and not get distracted by weak disinformation.  Spam/CTR/Trolls will never beat a well thought out response with rock solid logic.

       Shills and trolls aren't intended to beat well thought out responses and logic. Their goal is to keep you talking while they repeat a mostly unified narrative. They have an inherent advantage  in the court of public opinion over investigators into conspiracy; namely, that the public finds a single unified narrative more persuasive than speculation about possible permutations of the true story. The more we interact with them, and the more different people offer different explanations for suspicious information and events, the more they get to repeat the same narrative and make us look crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may be the only person in the world who thinks like this, but I think that in targeted subs like r/wikileaks, r/pizzagate,  and even r/the_donald, draconian policies against concern trolling and other forms of cluster-B social manipulation are not only reasonable, but may be the only way to ensure the long-term integrity of a community.

       That shouldn't deter anyone. Just remember pizza = kids.  If you focus on that the disinformation doesn't weigh as heavily. At this point it's like a 99% certainty the government is a pedo ring

       This is a little off, but how did we end up calling it PizzaGate?
I remember a post that was pretty popular about doing the exact opposite of that, so that it doesn't sound childish or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think the name somehow attracts more attention because it's so ridiculous sounding.
      </p>

       Just curious as to how the name stuck. I'll have to visit the sub I'm not totally up to date with this situation and I'd like to be.

       "Pizzagate" is perfect. It's perfect because it's a solid, single term, that DOESN'T have anything related to "pedophilia" or "kid fucking" in the title. That kind of shit pushes people away and makes it seem crazy. It's an easily digestible term that implies a legitimate scandal that skeptics are more likely to look into and give it a chance before immediately denouncing it.

       I have no doubts that the elite practice pedophilia, we have evidence that Hollywood does so, so its natural the elites in government would as well. Its all apart of the mental illness that attracts these people to those positions in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it doesn't mean much but I get a sick, horrible gut feeling when I look at the Pizzagate stuff. A feeling I only get when deep down I know something to be true. A part of me wishes it was false because I know when we do reveal the truth and we find irrefutable evidence, the elite aren't going to leave without a long, bloody fight

       This is what they're most scared of.  The masses.  They know that no matter how powerful they are, they can't overpower the general population.  "They'll hang us in the streets".  Seems to be a popular saying amongst them.

       Yeah but very suspicious connections could also just be people digging through shit and confirming their biases as they dig deeper and deeper, this shit is getting like when Reddit proclaimed they found the Boston Marathon bomber again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if none of this shit is real we could be ruining peoples lives, because no doubt some of the people targeted in PizzaGate are definitely being threatened and harassed, that's just the way it goes whenever it comes to pedophiles, but also that's how it goes when you toss in the satanic panic spin on everything. I mean pedophilia is fine with religious cooks, they still show up to church every Sunday despite the Catholic Church being balls deep in some kids over the
       <strong>
        centuries
       </strong>
       and they have shown they can be okay with it if Baptists, Evangelicals, or Mormons do it, so the pedophilia isn't always the issue, it's the satanism that makes the people crazier. But more than any of that we seem to be on a witch hunt and we won't be happy until we see who we want to see behind bars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'm all for locking people up for actual crimes if proven guilty, but this whole thing just seems like we're digging through someones trash and presuming everything has something to do with their guilt despite only finding trash.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also doesn't help that I've lost all faith in Wikileaks after their AmA and then after the big to do from r/crypto yesterday, if they aren't compromised they are biased, if they are compromised then we're just buying into propaganda from whatever side that has taken it over.

       I don't think this can be compared to the boston bomber incident, not yet anyway. The main difference here was the sheer amount of evidence compared to pure speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The confirmation bias is a good point, but I try to be skeptical at any chance I get of stuff like this and I'm certainly seeing what looks like a breadcrumb trail of pedos. It's hard to take the stance and argue it as coincedence at this point for the main people involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       However you are right, it could still all just be something completely legal and these guys aren't hurting anyone. Which is why anyone who is defaming these people are fucking idiots because there is nothing concrete to go on.

      <p>
       The biggest thing about this is also the most inflammatory, if you go against the grain and seek to debunk it you're accused of trying to protect pedos or even worse "satanic" pedos, which I hover between atheist and agnostic at this point in my life so the whole satanism thing really just misses it's mark with me. Plus I grew up in NYC and I know artists and people that operate in the art industry, historians, dealers, etc., I know how fucking weird artists can be, especially modern artists and performance artists, so that whole aspect seems like a lot of people seeing this lady's weird fucking "art" and jumping to conclusions, confirming biases.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my point is trying to discuss this with anyone slightly less than rational is going to result in people trying to pin you as a pedo or a pedo apologist, and then you toss in the satanic aspect and it becomes even worse because then the religious whackadoos get involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I will add this caveat, like I said I grew up in NYC, I've worked at a number of Pizzerias over the decades all up and down the East coast, and they are almost always a front for something, drugs, money, laundering, all of that stuff. Also if it's not the owner being directly or indirectly involved then it's the management doing it behind the owners back, which is what happened at the last pizzeria I worked at years ago, the manager was dealing pills and other stuff through one of the delivery guys, eventually the owner walked into the office while he was snorting a rail of oxy. So if there was a place to run something like this through a pizza place, or any restaurant in general, but pizza places more than any because of the availability of cash on hand, would be the best front for almost anything illegal.

       Look at one of the responses I received already, see Pedo is now primed to become the next CTR/Shill crap to drop in this sub, and it's a pretty fucking nasty accusation.

       I was talking about when the site focused in on an innocent Arab dude and started doxxing him and fucking up his life, meanwhile it was the two idiot brothers.

       If you weren't sure what I was talking about how about just simply asking instead of pulling shit out of your ass to confirm whatever bias you were trying to get at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blah blah blah I get it the Boston Marathon Bombing was a false flag, everything seems to be blamed on a false flag lately, Train crashes in Newark, false flag, baby cries in a grocery store, must be a false flag, I spilled my milk, damn false flags! If everything is a false flag or a conspiracy then nothing is, get it?

       Also making everything a false flag or a conspiracy definitely could just simply be gaslighting, are you gaslighting me there pilgrim?

       A billionaire who openly and proudly bought and bribed elected officials just conned people into voting him to the highest elected office in the USA.He immediately begins to fill the Whitehouse with the very same crony capitalists, lobbyists, donors and the insiders he claimed he was going to remove. Then he back tracks on almost every position he took during the election. This is a brand new age of bullshit and there are conspiracies being born right in front of your face. there are perineal old conspiracies being trampled to death too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here you are connecting 4Chan trolls and unrelated emails into a completely fictional pedoring like a red string wielding tinfoil hatted guy off his medication.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are real ones, There are real and active ones. The UK and the Vatican have elements being exposed to daylight right fucking now and here you guys are making shit up out of nothing in the most dangerous and unnecessary online feedback loop I've ever seen thinking you are on to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Grow up, take a step back and look what you just made. Now flush it down the toilet were shit belongs. And wipe your whole body down with toilet paper not just your arse. 'cause you got shit everywhere.

       I agree some of the connections sound weak. but there are several pictures that make me wonder what else it could mean. For instance, why the pedophilia symbol? Why did they remove it soon afterward?

       The only source I've seen for this logo theory is this theory. Can't find any claims for it being a known symbol outside of this shitpile of a theory. And even if it was true, its a geometric shape. Its a triangle spiraling in. So what? Logos use geometric shapes all the time. Its easy and there's no copyright on spirals. What are the odds of a pizza shop selling triangles of food would use a triangle logo?

      <p>
       I'm guessing because someone pointed out to them this bullshit theory about their logo, and someone in charge of PR had a the knee jerk reaction of "They say its a fucking symbol for what?? Take it out then!!" It's generally considered being linked to a child abuse club, fictional or not, is bad for business.

       We have to show them a definitive connection between the government preying on children, and the government preying on THEIR children. Which is exactly what's happening. The system in place is destroying families and children, one family at a time. And everything is going according to plan. It's amazing that the tactics used to destroy families are so similar to those associated with MKultra.  They traumatize you, and beat you down in your emotional paralysis. If you have the strength to fight back, they dismiss you as crazy. It's happening in every city, in every state in the country. Our children are not safe. People need to understand there is no help. Truly. If you demand the system fulfill its duty, they will crush you and prevent you from having a voice, or a life. If it can happen to so many, we are all vulnerable. I tried to warn a mother about a particular risk her child was exposed to, her response was - I don't see that happening. I believe that. That's part of the plan. She looked at me with pity and disgust, and walked away. I wish I could save her from what she doesn't see coming.

       The Lindbergh baby kidnapping was a hoax, but it allowed the FBI to assume jurisdiction over every kidnapping in the nation... so that they could effectively bury each investigation.

       When they discovered the nazi concentration camps, generals told the soldier to take as many pictures as possible because otherwise nobody would believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this aspect, this scandal is similar in the sense that it's so absurd and outrageous that people simply go into denial mode and refuse to believe such evil people can exist. People that they support on top of it??
      </p>
      <p>
       It will take a while and a lot of evidence and tons of patience. Trying to shove it down their throats most likely will just cause people to get even more defensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good news is that the NYPD apparently know all about it and won't let it go until justice is served

       ok, let me follow your reasoning, if at least the police knows or suspects something, dont you think they would have at least interrogated him? they havent talked to them

       Very wishful thinking. So far we have weak picture comparison that only work if time stops, some vague code searching nonsense, and some strange but ultimately benign pictures/videos. A picture with some kid's hand's taped down is odd, but not automatically suspicious, especially if it was a staged promotional video image trying to imply the kid didn't want to leave. Many smart people have wasted decades of their lives looking for codes in the bible. Everything I've seen so far is grasping at straws.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the exact particular points I would focus on if I was to piece together a dissinfo subject to waste conspiracy theorists time, divert their attentions away form Jeffery Epstein, and rob them of click bait ad revenue. Everyone sees faces in the dark, lets present something with vague codes they can see everywhere, we know how much they are a sucker for symbolism. Let's present some odd videos and pictures without context after pre-programming them to misinterpret something nefarious from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I think the Jeffery Epstein/Clinton pedophile and human trafficking link are likely real, this feels more like a purposeful red herring to divert attention into nonsense. I'd love to be proven wrong, but something, anything, with some substance is required, but none...absolutely none...exist for pizza gate. Their is zero substance and all speculation.

       It might not be directly related to Podesta and friends, but it is to show that these things are happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you start listening to the testimonies of people like that, and can clearly depict a patern of practices and behaviors... A situation like pizzagate is not so far fetch anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has been shown from pizzagate is rich and important people being into stuff VERY close to these satanist psychopaths and pedophiles.

       It begs the question.

      <p>
       We need more evidence, I get that, but I think it is important that people keep digging. Why? Because the peoples involve are the people on the top and if they are really doing these things, they will never be the one investigating it.

       There are documented evidence of those. Caselogs, investigations, and convictions. Pizza gate on the other hand is based on picture comparisons that require time to stand still, and looking for faces in the dark with symbolism and code word nonsense, and creepy videos that only are nefarious if you are primed ahead of time with concepts, especially code word concepts.

       To be fair if we're going to use the actual definition of circumstantial evidence, then in a court case a picture of a kid tied up
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       circumstantial. It doesn't prove pedophilia took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying pizzagate didn't happen, but I'm a stickler when it comes to hard evidence. Just think if we crack this thing open wide enough for the public to notice. You know what an inevitable step is? Trying everything in a court of law.

       Its important to note that the government is running its own pizza gate with federal funds its called CPS. They traffic kids through false allegations, schools, fake positive drug tests, children of battered women, and through children who seek protection through protective parents. They have quotas to meet, so they 'find' new reasons to remove children, and receive big bonus checks. They also have a million other ways. If I had time, I would make a better post, but its important to reveal that our own government is trafficking children to abusers while receiving federal funding to do so. They are also paying the abusers to "foster" these #taken children. I believe the elite pedo scandal is a cover for the fact that CPS is trafficking US children "legally" at an increasingly alarming rate, and with CPS/PD/DA trifecta, parents have no recourse. To eliminate the parents ability to recover, they appoint a court appointed attorney who is controlled opposition and furthers the states cause, leaving families irreversibly separated. Never mind those who seek protection, and can't get it because CPS is so strung out on federal funds and trafficking children.

       TO me, the best evidence i've seen is the logo's in the businesses, and how they reflect the FBI pedophile ring symbols. All 3 businesses in the plaza, all three logos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the fact that they CHANGED these logos a few days ago when the leaks came out and started picking up popularity on social media, and that ALefantis deleted his twitter posts. That just spells "guilty as fucking charged" to me.

       Of the logos posted, only Besta Pizza comes close to a solid read for those symbols. Crossed ping-pong paddles(very common theme for theme, emphasizes dueling nature of the game) are a huge reach for the butterfly, and then the bookstore is nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypothetically, what would you do if you owned a pizzeria that only made pizza and didn't rape or kill kids. Then you found out that a lot of people online have this FBI email that says your logo is a dead ringer for boyfuckers. What would you do?

       Full disclosure, I'm an "average sheep" who came to this thread to see what the current state of the evidence was.  I was really expecting something more substantive than this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who wouldn't change their logo when they are told they are pedophile symbols?  The logos, at least the ones I've seen, are pretty nondescript and beyond Besta, they bear very little similarity to the symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also REALLY don't understand why a pedophile ring that goes all the way to the top of government would use LOGOS SAYING THEY ARE PEDOPHILES.  It makes absolutely no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that there have been some true instances of this uncovered recently, and it is certainly possible that something like that could be happening.  But this is not NEARLY enough evidence to prove something of this magnitude in the court of common opinion, let alone beyond a reasonable doubt.

       Re: logos, my understanding is that the owner(s) of these establishments also have prior connections to the pedo ring, with one guy having been in a relationship with a relatively high-profile victim of it. Maybe more, I haven't dug very far into pizzagate, but many believe it is implausible that these business owners could have been unaware of the meanings of the symbols.
      </p>

       Re: broadcasting intent via logos, I have no idea what ultimately drives people to be so brash, but it's weirdly common in these circles.  One of the Rockefellers wrote in a hook about being part of a secret cabal trying to install one worldwide government and (I think) reduce the population by 90%. Ted Turner has said similar things.  George Soros has written in his book and even spoken in interviews about his 5-step plan to overthrow governments, and how he has used it in other countries already. Why do these people broadcast their intentions and work out in the open? I have no idea. Maybe just to make their accusers seem ridiculous. But the fact is that its a common practice among the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: evidence, you're probably right that there isn't sufficient proof yet for either a court of law or the court of public opinion, but a large part of the problem is that most people can't even entertain child sex trafficking of this scale and law-enforcement cover-ups as a possibility. For me, after reading a bit about the dutroux scandal, I'm willing to believe anything about the establishment's involvement in this stuff, until such time as there is full transparency from the establishment on these matters. kinda like with elections, I think we'd be irresponsible to assume anything other than that the ballot counting and casting process is compromised in a potentially catastrophic way until the means of collecting and counting ballots is made totally transparent.

       Re: re: logos, I guess I'd just need to see a source.  What pedo ring are you talking about?  The same one you're trying to prove exists?  I hate to be the logical fallacy guy but that's pretty egregious bootstrapping.  I'd just counter with why would
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       be aware of the meanings unless they had actively sought the meanings out?
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: re: broadcasting of intent, I get your point, but this is a bit different than all the examples you gave.  Your examples are people
       <strong>
        admitting
       </strong>
       to "conspiracy" type intentions/activities.  People admit to doing/desiring unpopular things all the time; I'm not arguing that.  Hitler admitted he wanted to kill the jews. Here, by contrast, the argument is that this is a pedophile ring that is highly, highly secretive, but at the same time broadcasts its intentions to the world in the most public way possible. Why take so many steps to cover things up and silence people just to slap it on a sign?
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: re: evidence, I agree that this is theoretically possible.  However, being theoretically possible does not mean it's going on, and it's going to take a lot more than what you have here to prove it.  You almost seem to say that we should just assume that there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a pedophilia cabal that goes all the way to the top of US government until we are given clear evidence there isn't.  That's absurd.

       Re: logos, I am a conspiracy theorist sympathizer more than a theorist proper, and it is a matter of principle more than research. Consequently, there are better people to ask for sauce on the prior associations of the owners of these establishment. If memory serves, it pertained to a Hollywood pedo ring that may or may not be connected to the theoretical one being investigated at r/pizzagate.  But, you may be misunderstanding my intentions; I'm not out to prove anything to you. I simply took your comment to mean you were interested in researching what exactly is believed 'round these parts and why; if that is the case, then I had hoped to give you an idea of what to look for. Again, I think it had to do with alefantis and Brock, one of them having previously been involved in the hollywood ring, possibly as a victim. Look around, somebody can point you to what they consider evidence. My point is only that the people here aren't pulling this stuff out of thin air, as far as I have seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: broadcasting of intent, symbols have always been used as means of covert communication in public.  Until pizzagate, if I had seen the besta pizza logo I wouldn't have thought anything of it. Many ancient Romans thought nothing of peacock graffiti in the catacombs, until initiated into the secretive society that used it as a symbol. Meanwhile, the other broad-daylight evidence of intent, such as the instagram photos, really isn't anything more than kind of bizarre when viewed outside the context of an establishment with a pedophile callsign in its logo. Within such a context though, the same photos could reasonably be suspected of containing similar symbolism, as they would be bizarre at best in a normal context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: evidence, I am saying something similar to that, yes, but not the same. I believe there is evidence of a pedo ring being presented here.  I do not believe there is proof here, certainly not yet. But proof and evidence are different categories of information. Evidence is the fodder of inductive reasoning and is primarily empirically derived. Proof is the stuff of deductive reasoning and is rationally derived; and, it is exceptionally rare that evidence stacks up to the point of being proof. That is why people colloquially (and incorrectly) say you can't prove a negative; there can never be enough evidence against the existence of something to qualify as proof. However, you can disprove the existence of some things (i.e. married bachelors) on deductive grounds. This is what I am calling for. Conspiracy theories can only be formulated where there is insufficient transparency to rationally disprove the existence of a conspiracy. Increased transparency changes the power structure such that the preconditions of a conspiracy cannot be met anymore than a married man could be a bachelor. This would be proof of the nonexistence of conspiracies (and the end of any that already exist). I say we should assume they do exist because I can think of no other mindset that would motivate people to demand transparency. As long as we assume they don't exist until we see sufficient evidence, we will continue to see every curtain as proof we stand before a benevolent wizard, and every closed door as a meeting that is held exclusively to benefit us. To whatever degree one already suspects a weasely man behind a curtain, he is accepting the premise without sufficient evidence. Curtains and closed doors are meant to separate us from evidence, and until we insist upon seeing what's on the other side, we will be stuck without enough information for reasonable conclusions about the existence of conspiracies or the lack thereof. I'm sorry if you find that absurd, but I fail to see a better option, in a world where conspiratorial child sex trafficking rings are even a theoretical possibility.

       This technique of "cleaning up" after themselves is being used all over the place. James Alefantis (Owner of Comet Ping Pong, and I believe actually owns a few other businesses in the plaza, made his twitter private and deleted his creepy posts about little kids and babies).
      </p>

       If this really was a whacky ridiculous conspiracy theory, wouldn't they just keep their logo's up to show us that they think we're crazy? Why silently and quietly change the logo's on all the signs and websites and pretend like nothing ever happened lol? Why did Alefantis call us "Right wing racist sexist conspiracy theorists" ? Thats what someone who is afraid of being caught does....It's called "sweeping it under the rug".

       For me personally the most convincing things were the Instagram photos from James Alefantis. Maybe one of them could be construed as an off-color joke (like claiming a German baby at $1200 was overpriced) but when looking at the compilation, plus the artists and event planners working there... it's sinister.

       It looks sinister because the social media accounts were mined for anything that would push that narrative. The reaction you're experiencing is exactly what that collage was designed to elicit.

       Dexter firmly established the idea of a kill room in the public mind. An empty walk-in fridge just looks clinical and unsettling, but if you'd worked in a restaurant you'd understand fawning over how spacious it was.

       Thank you for this infographic. We need more infographics like this. most people are not going to spend hours on 4chan or reddit trying to piece together all of the clues. Also, people are motivated NOT to piece things together because the possible truth is very disturbing.

       Give me a moment. I can post one of the photos that James Alefantis took of this underground room he constructed in "Comet Ping Pong". Several of the comments alluded to a murder room. One of them literally says, "kill room". Can anybody help me dig that twitter post up?

       Wonder if anyone is also looking into the people who are liking his post and responding to him, take their username and look them up on instagram and Facebook, some of them have their real names that can be looked up Google and image. 
Like Ionna xatzi, unusual name but  there's like 5 of her on Facebook in Greece. Then she makes a comment on here

       I'm sure an international conspiracy would be foolish enough to allow such potentially compromising material to appear undeterred on instagram, it reminds me of how Soros et al would be foolish enough to post on craigslist looking for clearly paid rioters and shit-disturbers. I believe in the power of conspiracies which act to contrive conspiracies assigned to one's enemies on the other side of the aisle-- it's called postmodernism, cognitive dissonance, the magician's illusion, muckraking and fear-mongering 101. It's not real, guys, particularly as it feels more real than anything could, but is in fact, utterly, unreal. The clear partisianship that produced such narratives during the height of election fever should be enough of a tip-off, as is the obvious online meddling of the alt-right troll factory , but if none of this has occurred to anyone, than we're really more lost in our hunger for truth than I ever believed in the past.

       They enjoy it. And it seems to work. Despite all the incriminating comments and hints, there are still people here who will not believe it. They go as far as they can without actually saying it and because it is so unbelievable, some people won't. They are banking on people like you to make the excuses for them. Seems to work like a treat.

       Nevermind that 16 tons of tomatoes would probably spoil before they could be used, even if they were refrigerated.

       Nevermind that 16 tons of tomatoes would cost a lot of money... money that could probably be better used elsewhere in the business.

       I've been hearing this enough now for me to conclude its being suppressed, most likely by ISP or regionally. They already managed to scrub archives.is backups, which is supposed to never happen. If they are doing this both they are really scared.

       Seriously. This gives us real ground to stand on in arguing with people who are still asleep. Even if there's a 1% chance that this is true, aren't these children's potential livelihood worth that? Who can argue that? We aren't calling for heads to roll or an overhaul of a system (yet). We just want accountability and exposure, even as it exists within the Shit system we have.

       Why would a mainstream media outlet pick up a story about government officials being involved in a pedophile ring? It's never gonna happen, even if this shit was neatly packaged into easily digestable formats. Hell, it could be on the front page with 10,000 likes and they would still cover the same old crap about a squirrel who can water-ski or a touching story about a kid raising money with a lemonade stand to pay for his sisters chemo...

       Because it's fucking great for ratings.  They love scaring people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just not at a stage where they feel like risking their credibility.  Hell, I'm just a normal citizen and I wouldn't stake my credibility on this story.  So far, you guys just have "code speak" (which was originally created on 4chan), social media posts of people in a restaurant, and abstract art.
      </p>
      <p>
       The archives and files found on their server were the biggest breakthrough IMO, but I didn't hear anything afterwards, so I'm assuming they were actually just financial records like that guy mentioned on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to believe, as I know how many pedophile rings have gotten away with coverups in the past, but this case is just incredibly weak right now.

       I don't think you can use subscribers as a substitute for evidence. The two are mutually exclusive.

       I haven't seen any new information come out this week either, I remember developments like finding files on their server, but nothing came of it. So I assume no damning evidence was found.

       It's hard to look at and face this shit..
I have two young daughters and can't deal with this bullshit. It should probably make me more driven to investigate and expose anything I can, but it makes me physically sick to think about.

       I hope these people are brought to justice and tortured for this. I hope they are humiliated in front of everyone they know and end up with their faces and names pasted all over the world for the crimes they've committed.

       I have tried discussing this a bit with a few friends, and one thing that I found interesting is how hard it is for people to visualize or believe that a woman can be a pedophile.  If this had come out about Trump, people would have grabbed it and ran, but because it's Hillary's camp, it's not believable.  It's sad really.

       The rape allegations are most likely false, because she changed her story from losing her virginity to Epstein to losing her virginity to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i dont think its disputable that Trump and Epstein know each other.

       Trump made a comment about Epstein being a great guy who likes young girls.

       Expose it to the people. Like the guy above said, they are innocent until proven guilty in the courts, but they are guilty in the public opinion. The sheep work to our advantage too. They hate pedophilia and child molestation. Couldn't you see some hillbilly from virginia hunting down some of these people and murdering them? Justice is justice, whether served by the courts or not. This event will change the entire public trust/opinion of our government and our system. We trust governement to be our daddy, we look up to them, we rely on them. If we found out they were involved in a fucking pedophile ring, lmao, it's game over dude...I'm telling you.

       Maybe someone should post something about it on the internet.  I heard they can reach lots of people.  That might wake people up.

       Also stop eating pizza and stop supporting these places.

      <p>
       Pick out the best pieces of proof, like the ping pong paddles kind of look like a butterfly.  The blue pail with dirt in it, outside that shack in Hawaii, it was like a TV show.  That proves they are dissolving victims in acid.
      </p>
      <p>
       What else? The dominos references are absolute irrefutable PROOF that in addition to running a political campaign, Podesta has a side hobby as a research psychologist, brainwashing victims with domino tiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's stuff is proven without a doubt. Also the pizza related map on the hanky, that's absolute proof beyond the shadow of a doubt, that a realtor recognized a semen soaked rag on the kitchen counter and realized they she better ask around to see who it belonged to, incase someone wanted to save their semen rag for another day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep the PROOF coming. It's absolutely incontrovertible!

       you missed the fact that Podesta's email ID has an @ symbol.  That in itself is just like the symbols on the block in DC - an outer shape with a smaller inner.  That literally PROVES, for once and for all, that Podesta is guilty.  He uses that symbol at least twice in EVERY SINGLE ONE of his emails!

       Ring the bells and wake the people, he's finished! We got him nailed with this proof. Not a court in the land that can refuse to see what's right there, staring them in the face!

       if you cross into a taboo   you are taken down. We need some additional taboo's like one about psychopaths in positions of power. Taking down the powerful who have crossed into taboo territory works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pope Benedict had to resign after making a statement saying child pornography was almost normal now.  That defined him as a person with a taboo type of personality and no person can withstand the public pressure that comes with that. Once more, we need some better targeted taboo's We have racism, witch burning, cannibalism, and even a new taboo for homophobes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can make psychopaths and sociopaths in power positions a new taboo. and clean them all out by doing so. They just need an appropriate new name  of the type that 'antivaxxer' is.

       I've heard people refer to psychopaths and sociopaths in powers of positions called "globalists". DOesn't have a very positive connotation to it, could be the term your looking for. Doesn't quite have the same ring to it as pedophile or rapist or racist but...

       Globalist has   been burned down as a term  by Alex Jones and doesn't have the amount of impact that's needed. The problem I'm trying to convey is that people with no conscience or remorse have no need to keep their subjects away from harm. They prey on their subjects by creating harm for them and profiting from it. That leads us all to be here in the first place.  Come on cunning linguists, get in here.

       I like it. I didn't mention before the term has to include psychopaths in all kinds of power positions such as policeman, city counselors,  mayors governors, CEO's and so on. They are all attractive positions to people without conscience. People without consciences make every decision based on personal greed alone with no other consideration.

       You seem very unaware of the power in united, concerted numbers.  This is very sad because it ensures that you will remain enslaved by forces that keep you shut down in a state of perpetual bondage - forever shackled to a tether from which you could effortlessly break free if you but made a real effort.

       this is horrible, so out of any sane minds imagination that I really dont know what to think about it.

       They tried to arrest and charge some of the elite for peado things in the UK.  They let some dead celebrities take a hit, then it was all hushed up and the police made to apologise to the fuck heads they wanted to arrest.

       What if pizza really means drugs or...pizza? It would make much more sense. This is a really far out conspiracy that does not make any sense and I just spent the whole day watching Alex Jones and there's no evidence other than speculation online and a voodoo article from Washington Post that doe not indicate anything in the direction of the accusation. If pizza is not kids, y'all gonna eat some crow big time if you believe that.

       Whats strange about this is that pedo rungs have been uncovered within the upper eschelons before.  Why?  Why do people in positions of power adhere to this affliction with so much to lose?  Its not like its marginally accepted as okay.  Shit, our violent offender prison population doesnt even put up with that shit.  Just seems strange that this fetish (or whatever) keeps popping up.

       Oh good, I'm glad it's obvious to others that pizzagate is a psyop. They mined the social media feed of the owner of a pizzeria in DC with a bar, and push anything that smells funny when your pedophilia hackles are up.

       The original handkerchief/map/pizza email was seriously weird. Everything since has been distracting tail-chasing down the rabbithole.

       I've been hearing this enough now for me to conclude its being suppressed, most likely by ISP or regionally. They already managed to scrub archives.is backups, which is supposed to never happen. If they are doing this both they are really scared.

       It looks sinister because the social media accounts were mined for anything that would push that narrative. The reaction you're experiencing is exactly what that collage was designed to elicit.

        but I try to be skeptical at any chance I get of stuff like this and I'm certainly seeing what looks like a breadcrumb trail of pedos. It's hard to take the stance and argue it as coincedence at this point for the main people involved.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The biggest thing about this is also the most inflammatory, if you go against the grain and seek to debunk it you're accused of trying to protect pedos or even worse "satanic" pedos, which I hover between atheist and agnostic at this point in my life so the whole satanism thing really just misses it's mark with me. Plus I grew up in NYC and I know artists and people that operate in the art industry, historians, dealers, etc., I know how fucking weird artists can be, especially modern artists and performance artists, so that whole aspect seems like a lot of people seeing this lady's weird fucking "art" and jumping to conclusions, confirming biases.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my point is trying to discuss this with anyone slightly less than rational is going to result in people trying to pin you as a pedo or a pedo apologist, and then you toss in the satanic aspect and it becomes even worse because then the religious whackadoos get involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I will add this caveat, like I said I grew up in NYC, I've worked at a number of Pizzerias over the decades all up and down the East coast, and they are almost always a front for something, drugs, money, laundering, all of that stuff. Also if it's not the owner being directly or indirectly involved then it's the management doing it behind the owners back, which is what happened at the last pizzeria I worked at years ago, the manager was dealing pills and other stuff through one of the delivery guys, eventually the owner walked into the office while he was snorting a rail of oxy. So if there was a place to run something like this through a pizza place, or any restaurant in general, but pizza places more than any because of the availability of cash on hand, would be the best front for almost anything illegal.

       You seem very unaware of the power in united, concerted numbers.  This is very sad because it ensures that you will remain enslaved by forces that keep you shut down in a state of perpetual bondage - forever shackled to a tether from which you could effortlessly break free if you but made a real effort.
