The only thing that&#39;s getting old and bugging people is when someone will, for instance, mention Billy C riding on Epstein&#39;s jet as absolute proof of involvement but then bristle and try to shut it down when someone mentions that Trump called him a close friend.</p>

<p>We&#39;re as fine with Trump supporters as anyone else, as long as they realize nobody in Washington is immune to conspiracy and scrutiny, especially not the pres.</p>

Epstein is the only big one I&#39;m aware of that we have proof of (from his own mouth no less, AND in Epstein&#39;s leaked book).</p>

<p>I just mean that in general, there seems to be lots of negativity whenever Trump is called out, even if there is evidence proving that he&#39;s at least questionable in some aspect. People blindly defending him from conspiracy or question like CTR shills did for Hillary. It&#39;s the blind defending of him that riles people up here, not that people support him at all. He was definitely the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> preferred candidate.</p>

But is he a child enslaver? There&#39;s a lot worse things to be dealt with as I see it. 
No one is clean, but evil is evil and we have to fight.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking for a free pass here. What I am is looking for
what you have researched and your different point of view.
Real evil exists, like child sex rings in UK. </p>

<p>There&#39;s enough big things to work together on before we come to the things we might disagree about.
There&#39;s a window of momentum. Let&#39;s set our mutual sights on the big conspiracies and act.
Can you do that? </p>

<p>It&#39;s time to expose evil.</p>

<p>Only a month ago Soros was a whisper, and now there&#39;s subreddits dedicated to fighting him.
Let&#39;s work together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some of us here, the bigger issue is not who&#39;s president, but who&#39;s behind the pres pulling the strings.</p>

<p>We all want the same thing, to drain swamp.  But from a conspiracy point of view that&#39;s not something a president can do, because in the conspiracy view the pres actually has no power, and is just a figure head.</p>

<p>A president can&#39;t drain the swamp, but a movement can!  And that&#39;s a job I think the Donald is well suited for.</p>

<p>Together on the field we would be unstoppable.</p>

<p>Then you have to free yourselves of allegiances that can stand in the way. I don&#39;t mind if you support Trumps policies, or not, but I do mind if you just &quot;support Trump.&quot;</p>

<p>That &quot;blind faith&quot; in a &quot;known liar&quot; (politicians) is surely folly, and is not a skeptical view. So as long as you are not blindly following some ideal, or -ism, or politic, then there is no issue.</p>
