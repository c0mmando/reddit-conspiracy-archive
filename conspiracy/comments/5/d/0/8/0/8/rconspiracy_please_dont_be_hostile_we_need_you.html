       Speaking of 4D chess, seems like there are always 2 picks, and 1 pick always has a flaw everyone goes crazy about. Leaving the one he really wants unobserved. I think it's clever slight of hand.

       I don't think most of us are really hostile towards Trump supporters at all, and a lot of us think he's less dangerous than Hillary. The only thing that's getting old and bugging people is when someone will, for instance, mention Billy C riding on Epstein's jet as absolute proof of involvement but then bristle and try to shut it down when someone mentions that Trump called him a close friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're as fine with Trump supporters as anyone else, as long as they realize nobody in Washington is immune to conspiracy and scrutiny, especially not the pres.

       I'm not really well versed in all of Trump's corrupt dealings and connections--few of us are, since there's been no big RNC or Trump campaign links. Epstein is the only big one I'm aware of that we have proof of (from his own mouth no less, AND in Epstein's leaked book).
      </p>
      <p>
       I just mean that in general, there seems to be lots of negativity whenever Trump is called out, even if there is evidence proving that he's at least questionable in some aspect. People blindly defending him from conspiracy or question like CTR shills did for Hillary. It's the blind defending of him that riles people up here, not that people support him at all. He was definitely the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       preferred candidate.

       The way I see it no one is "clean". He's a ruthless businessman.
But is he a child enslaver? There's a lot worse things to be dealt with as I see it. 
No one is clean, but evil is evil and we have to fight.

       I'm not asking for a free pass here. What I am is looking for
what you have researched and your different point of view.
Real evil exists, like child sex rings in UK.

       There's enough big things to work together on before we come to the things we might disagree about.
There's a window of momentum. Let's set our mutual sights on the big conspiracies and act.
Can you do that?

       It's time to expose evil.

       For some of us here, the bigger issue is not who's president, but who's behind the pres pulling the strings.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all want the same thing, to drain swamp.  But from a conspiracy point of view that's not something a president can do, because in the conspiracy view the pres actually has no power, and is just a figure head.
      </p>

       A president can't drain the swamp, but a movement can!  And that's a job I think the Donald is well suited for.

       Well of course it is, that above statement is pretty obvious. Trump isn't a some god who is invulnerable to this. We just love his cult of personality and have
       <strong>
        hope
       </strong>
       that maybe he won't be shit. We can only hope at this point, and hope we will. Unless, of course, a legit revolution happens.

       I think the liberal witchhunting is more about the domreddits hate for sjws and foolish or ignorant liberals. The Donald is a circlejerk and is stupid. I love it, but it is. I am not afraid to admit it.

       Then you have to free yourselves of allegiances that can stand in the way. I don't mind if you support Trumps policies, or not, but I do mind if you just "support Trump."

       That "blind faith" in a "known liar" (politicians) is surely folly, and is not a skeptical view. So as long as you are not blindly following some ideal, or -ism, or politic, then there is no issue.
