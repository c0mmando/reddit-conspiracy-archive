        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know how to cross post, so I copied and pasted this. Just wanted to be sure we have our info dump on this sub. Thought this was relevant. Here it is:</p>

<p>I FOUND SOME VERY ALARMING MENTION IN WIKILEAKS. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to tell anyone about this yet because I need confirmation and I know you guys are the best place to go. This email: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/15526">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/15526</a> from Hillary Clinton&#39;s archive mentions Dyncorps hiring an &quot;adolescent boy dancer&quot; from Afghanistan &quot;for some sort of event that, at least to most folks, looked very inappropriate.&quot; Here is a direct quote &quot;&quot;According to my reporting, the week of April 13th, the DynCorp regional commander from Konduz, Flint Chambers, allowed his men to hire a 15-year-old boy dancer to do tribal dances at a DynCorp party on the training site. Some 15 or so DynCorp employees in attendance pulled out a single chair and had the boy do mock lap dances. This was captured on video. The video shows DynCorp employees putting dollar bills in the boy&#39;s waistband, just as they would a stripper&#39;s garter. The revelry lasted about 45 minutes.&quot; </p>

<p>This is disgusting. I can&#39;t believe the DNC is so corrupt. This is sent directly to Hillary Clinton from Cheryl Mills who is one of her big time lawyers. Why would a LAWYER be messaging Hillary this if she didn&#39;t have direct ties to DynCorp?</p>

<p>I did some investigating into DynCorps and... <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-isenberg/its-dj-vu-for-dyncorp-all_b_792394.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-isenberg/its-dj-vu-for-dyncorp-all_b_792394.html</a> they were involved in a sex scandal slavery in Bosnia in 1999. &quot;its employees accused of rape and the buying and selling of girls as young as 12.&quot; [Quote from article.]</p>

<p>They have a long history of this. In 2005 the Chicago Tribune accused the government of covering up child trafficking. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-0512270176dec27-story.html">http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-0512270176dec27-story.html</a></p>

<p>According to this Portguese article Hillary is in favor of DynCorp. <a href="http://portugal.indymedia.org/conteudo/newswire/25091">http://portugal.indymedia.org/conteudo/newswire/25091</a></p>

<p>In her emails there is another about &quot;inappropriate behavior by department contractor.&quot; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/15562">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/15562</a></p>

<p>Talking more about DynCorp. DynCorp is known for a gross history of sexual assault. The CEO is Lewis Von Thaer. But the parent organization of DynCorp? Cerberus Capital Management. </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton has ties to both Cerberus and DynCorp. Cerberus gave $40,628 to her campaign. <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000021907&amp;cycle=2016">https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000021907&amp;cycle=2016</a></p>

<p>The state department lost $1 billion dollars and DynCorp is to blame. <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/01/25/report-faults-state-department-dyncorp-for-missing-1-billion/">http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/01/25/report-faults-state-department-dyncorp-for-missing-1-billion/</a></p>

<p>What is ironic is they appointed Jack Lew (Hillary&#39;s right hand man, according to the article) to look into it. DynCorp has a history of stealing money. &quot;1991 State of the Nation It appears that Dyncorp broke the original investigation on this. Dyncorp was the accountant for roughly $2.7 trillion missing 1991-2001. Also missing in 1996 or 1997; $60 billion missing out of HUD. Dyncorp appears to be the accounting division of the US government these days.&quot; [<a href="http://www.newsfollowup.com/clinton_9-11_truth_wtc_israel_saudi_arabia_uk_nuclear_demolition_president_election_hillary_bush_2016.html">http://www.newsfollowup.com/clinton_9-11_truth_wtc_israel_saudi_arabia_uk_nuclear_demolition_president_election_hillary_bush_2016.html</a>] </p>

<p>Hillary covered up for DynCorp. </p>

<p>1.The Washington Post wrote about it to her. </p>

<p>2.Later they publish a story saying the DynCorp employee was fired and no mention of the boy. </p>

<p>3.Nothing ended up being done. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101208/00221812176/so-wikileaks-is-evil-releasing-documents-dyncorp-gets-pass-pimping-young-boys-to-afghan-cops.shtml">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101208/00221812176/so-wikileaks-is-evil-releasing-documents-dyncorp-gets-pass-pimping-young-boys-to-afghan-cops.shtml</a> And here are the &quot;sensitive but unclassified&quot; documents from her emails. <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2138241-c05761762.html#document/p1">http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2138241-c05761762.html#document/p1</a></p>

<p>What is most disgusting is we now know Hillary has covered up for Weiner texting an underage girl and Laura Silsby&#39;s crew of kidnapping children from Haiti for trafficking. </p>
