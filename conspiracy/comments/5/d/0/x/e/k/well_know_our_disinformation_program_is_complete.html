        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In light of this election, it&#39;s hard not to look at this quote and think it has come to pass. The media has rattled everyone&#39;s cages so hard with disinformation from both parties, echoing what has happened with the media in recently-destabilized countries like Ukraine. </p>

<p>People like George Soros and the CIA have perfected the science of using media to create division and eventually civil war. When the masses get angry, turn them against each other, which in turn protects the ruling elite. </p>

<p>Time to stop trusting the media. (not that many people do nowadays anyway) Find alternative media. Check out stories from all sides. </p>

<p>Also, time to stop trusting either &quot;side&quot; of our political system, which in reality is essentially a Pepsi vs Coke <a href="https://www.subjectmoney.com/The%20Illusion%20of%20Free%20Choice%20democrats%20republicans.jpg">controlled duopoly.</a> A duopoly run by the military-industrial-banking complex, also known as the deep state. Their Continuity Of Government (COG) programs ensure that their overall directives (wartime profits, central bank ownership of all world governments, and maintaining the petrodollar hegemony) are able to be carried out, using the government, regardless of how the political landscape shifts beneath their feet. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t defend Trump or Clinton. They&#39;re both corrupt. They&#39;re both part of that 0.01% ruling class. It&#39;s so plain to see at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGgxr4Sxoas">2016 Al Smith Dinner</a>. These people are buddies, always have been. </p>

<p>Stop being divided and ruled. Stop it. Stop falling in to &quot;camps&quot; and &quot;sides&quot; on everything! How can they herd us in to their traps if we ideologically scatter like cats? Stay scattered and diverse and unique, except of course for the one thing that matters, actually calling out our abusive owners, the real people that own this country and continually drive it to war, make us pay for it, and leave us out to dry! These companies and individuals are becoming known. They need to be brought to justice, for the betterment of humanity. Don&#39;t lose track of the narrative in these deliberately chaotic times, keep your eye on the ball, and the abusive rulers <em>will</em> eventually be overturned by sheer public demand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. It&#39;s true, lots of people are looking for answers right now, and many feel as though they have no idea what information is trustworthy and what isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>If people explain the truth very clearly and simply, there&#39;s no way it doesn&#39;t wake people up. Once someone understands something is true, they cannot un-understand it, and the same goes for our culture at large. If a concept is important, it needs to be spread and repeated.  </p>

<p>I think more people are taking seriously this idea we must create our culture ourselves, rather than let billionaires write the scripts for us. It&#39;s the only way out of their trap, for good. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so refreshing to see people taking this seriously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The end goal is power. They want more power. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not logical. It&#39;s totally emotional. It&#39;s like a heroin addict who just wants to recreate that first high again, but you need to take more and more each time. These billionaires and political elite have a sick pathological obsession with accumulating power, in order to get the rush that it gives them. </p>

<p>In fact, our whole political system is designed to filter <em>for</em> these people (not against them), because only psychopaths/sociopaths would put forward the effort and two-faced-ness required to succeed, and still be able to sleep at night. Normal people would crack if they had to maintain so much cognitive dissonance, but the psychopath is neurologically built to ignore it, which is why they succeed in that arena. </p>

<p>I&#39;m literally postulating the globe, because of who we let lead it by way of circumstance, has a mental health problem. It is literally sociopaths leading sociopaths. And I mean it in the clinical psychological definition of the term, not the pejorative sense. I honestly think this is the root to almost all of humanity&#39;s problems, is we&#39;re letting psychos lead us around because we&#39;re too afraid to topple them. But they&#39;re not afraid to control us, because they&#39;re psychopaths. </p>

<p>I think this is really the root of all solvable evil in the human world. It has created a culture of incredulity, where many people won&#39;t even <em>entertain</em> these ideas. It has created hundreds of false governments, that lead people around at the end of a gun or with the threat of prison. </p>

<p>People just need to realize it, and it will be over. The psychopaths  cannot trick a populace that understands what I just described above. They take advantage of the good will of the people, the desire to see the best in humanity, and abuse it like a shield to hide behind while they commit more crimes. </p>

<p>I think all positions of power should gradually be abolished. Not just the powerful people, but the <em>positions</em> of power, so that no one can strive toward it. There should become a point where there&#39;s no presidents or congresses or parliaments, as world human culture progresses. I think many people have just about had enough of authoritarianism under the guise of &quot;the greater good&quot;. What kind of hyper-narcissistic phrasing is that? It&#39;s the language of the psychopaths that think they deserve to own us all. </p>

<p>Sorry that got long. Really good question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I think that the Russian government and industry and the US government and industry are two sides of the same authoritarian/imperialistic coin. Good cop and bad cop, and we switch sides every few decades, depending on which countries we&#39;re having a proxy war over at the moment. It is Pepsi vs Coke, making people think they have a choice and that there are options, but the options are all controlled. Just like our 2-party political system, which is a duopoly. It&#39;s a joke, both sides are controlled, and it&#39;s all kabuki theater while they make billions of dollars and control hundreds of millions of people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am aware of ”the illusion of free choice” system of information technology for the years....choice is leading(to some purpose) in this meaning.</p>

<p>Internet forums also....there are various comments and it seems like to everyone enjoying freedom of speach ,freedom of thought...but it can be controlled .This is a tool ”how to think” ”how to regard” ”how to believe” .”See everyone,this thought is good, let&#39;s concider like this”....with upvote or sympathetic comments.  ”See,this a such ignorant thought!everyone not be like such a fool”....downvote or agressive comments,denial...and so on.</p>

<p>Please notice I&#39;m not saying everything  is the way.They uses this tactics for very important to them.So be careful to judge if it is important or critical to them.
I think knowledges are helping judge and choice.We have it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post is spot-on and from this election, I&#39;ve learned to never generalize or stereotype a single group. Not Republicans, not Democrats, not progressives, not Muslims, or evangelical Christians... I&#39;ve resolved to love them all, and exhibit significantly more patience when I disagree with someone. I&#39;ve recognized it as an opportunity to have a discussion where maybe both sides can learn something. I haven&#39;t always lived up to this but it&#39;s part of my overall belief that we have to be in unity to overcome. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to cite that both sides are part of the ruling class, though, I wouldn&#39;t use the Al Smith dinner as an example since they boo&#39;d Trump for half of it. I remember watching it thinking his presidential ambitions went down like the Von Hindenburg that night because he was alienating every elite member in the room. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/the-increasing-nastiness-of-american-politics/504995/">The Atlantic</a> actually had the audacity to claim this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 1945, the Al Smith dinner has been a democratic display of mutual, if slightly forced, respect... they acknowledge a bedrock principle of American society: Even in our most adversarial moments, we’re all on the same team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this hilarious because it begs the question: whose team? The team of the elites attending the dinner? The headline reads, &quot;How Donald Trump broke the Al Smith dinner&quot; and given everything that stupid dinner represents, all I could think of was, &quot;It&#39;s about damn time someone did.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, he probably is going to be a spectacular disappointment, but I just don&#39;t think the Al Smith dinner was a good illustration of your (overall fantastic) point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were still on his team though, despite the booing. They just didn&#39;t want him doing his stump speech stuff, which is what he started doing halfway through. They didn&#39;t want divisiveness, they want to all act like they&#39;re on the same team. The elite team. This dinner is as much a rite of passage as sleeping in the whitehouse for the first time. And the fact it was done literally the day after what was supposedly the most &quot;vitriolic debate in US history&quot;... I think it&#39;s a good piece of evidence, even if they booed him a bit and cardinal dolan had to sit between them.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s all window dressing to the larger overall point that we both clearly agree on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gee. Casey was a true pervert.  He was outed in the Franklin Scandal in two books, and also specifically in the book &#39;Confessions of a DC Madam&#39; by Vinson, which is a new book available on amazon.</p>

<p>According to Vinson, who tells a horrifying story of being set up by a bunch of pedos and CIA and Secret Service blackmailers, Casey was a regular customer and according to the johns, he preferred young blond boys, and had a problem reaching, um, well you know.  He would have these boys massage him and anoint him with holy oil.  I kid you not.</p>

<p>It was info like this that put Vinson in a really bad situation, because TPTB could not let him just &#39;go&#39;, when he refused to get involved in pedos.  He was no angel, but he had taken over an escort agency of someone else, and was providing male of age escorts to homosexuals.  It wasn&#39;t until one of his customers was ordering 20K/month of escorts insisted on &#39;interviewing&#39; him that he was blackmailed.  And followed and harassed by secret service personnel.  And railroaded into prison. TWICE.</p>

<p>So Casey was typical of the evil people who came into gov&#39;t with George Bush and took over the USA.  Truly disgusting when you delve into the Franklin Scandal.  It truly shows that the problem in our gov&#39;t is truly both Republican and Democrat...the whole place is a freaking cesspool.</p>

<p>Edited to add: with Vinson, Casey would request a blond as &#39;young as possible&#39;.  When Vinson stated that all his escorts were 18 or over, Casey would say, &#39;well then a blonde teen who is as &#39;young as possible&#39;.  Vinson refused to participate in child trafficking at all, which is why he had to be framed--they used credit card fraud to charge him with 140+ RICO crimes!, because he wouldn&#39;t agree to work with them.</p>

<p>Is there any chance that Trump is real?</p>

<p>Put another way, are we actually under hopeless total control or is it possible that we just watched someone break the system? </p>

<p>Obviously vigilance is necessary but I have hope with Trump. Too many powerful people said &quot;He must not be president&quot;. </p>

<p>He talks about policy positions that no one has touched in years.</p>

<p>About halfway through &quot;Pence and Rick Dearborn, the executive director of the transition team, are “removing any lobbyists,” a transition aide said.&quot;</p>

<p>BTW I find it hilarious that Trump is essentially ran a &quot;Hope &amp; Change&quot; campaign to replace Obama the &quot;Hope &amp; Change&quot; president :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, Trump is an infiltrator.  He&#39;s never been a politician, never been a real insider above a businessman, never been part of the elite circles.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s been no one like him able to take the Presidency in the history of these United States, and people are missing a real opportunity to help break up the corruption in Washington and help bring those people you speak of to justice. </p>

<p>I could be wrong, but why don&#39;t we just see what happens with Trump at least, I think you will be convinced before long.  This constant weaponized doom and gloom apathy generation isn&#39;t helping anything.</p>
