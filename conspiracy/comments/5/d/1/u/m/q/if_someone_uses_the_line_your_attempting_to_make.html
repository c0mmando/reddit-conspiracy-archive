       The psychology behind this talking point  is that when someone reads that line, they don't want to be "lumped in" as being stupid, so they will disregard the post. Its quite amusing.

      <p>
       Let the vote system do the talking of what should make the sub look bad.

       exactly, it's not a conspiracy in any way. In fact the mainstream media has acknowledged this several times.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if people react badly to the fact that taxes don't fund government spending, how would they react if I told them about politicians being paedophiles, or 9/11 being an inside job?
      </p>

       Most people are simply not interested in conspiracies.

       That's a pretty big claim and as the other guy said - in the short term the government can spend (almost) as much as it likes. Long term is  different story.

       Feel free to look at my comment history, it is clearly not CTR.  If you want to bat around ideas, by all means, do so.  But there's a missing element of "keeping your head" when you say Podestas abducted Maddie McCann.  The ideas should be explored, but the overriding thought should always be, is this more likely than not?

       If we all accept that most people are apathetic more than ignorant, we will quit trying to have a "legitimate" presence . If people want to learn they can look, truth is they don't give a shit, so why should we close our minds to one another? So we can be accepted by the masses? Ain't gonna happen, embrace the crazy, fuck normality.

       I once did a simple magic trick to entertain a few people, when my brother in law lost his shit. He was just so pissed off because, I guess, it made him look and feel stupid that he could be fooled like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You never know how people will react to anything you say or do. They may get pissed off just because you claim that what they believe may be doubtful, and that would make them look stupid, in their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of that. They think they are smart people and simply could not be fooled. So they will not even consider being wrong on anything.

       We consider and reconsider what is right and what is wrong on a daily basis. We are very open to the idea that we may be wrong. And we are discussing why some people cannot fathom that what they consider to be the truth may not be.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: And it isn't a matter of "a bigger chance of being wrong". It is either right or it is wrong. The facts and the evidence will determine what is right or wrong, not someone's perception of what might seem outlandish or what might possibly likely be right or wrong in their minds.

       Let's take this to a logical conclusion. A black communities church was torched by someone a few weeks before the election, and someone wrote "Vote Trump" on the church. It was reported that a Trump supporter must have burnt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But stop a minute. Is this true? Who benefits from this act? Not Trump. Not the Trump supporter. A racist act would just play into the Hillary campaign talking points. Who claims a racist illegal act? No one. Illegal racist acts are done all the time. No one signs it and claims it. No one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But people will do crazy stuff and blame the other side to make them look bad. It's called a false flag incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a Trump supporter really wanted to "help" his candidate or do harm to the opposition, they would have written "Vote Hillary" on the church. But that wouldn't be even remotely believable because Hillary was claiming the high road on racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if a Hillary supporter were to do this, then it would be supporting her weak claims that the Trump campaign and Trump supporters are racist. It actually makes so much more sense that a Hillary supporter would do this, than a Trump supporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       One can only conclude that it was a Hillary supporter who did this.

       I don't like blanket statements like the OP's. Occasionally I see posts or threads that I think don't belong and make the sub look bad. I call them on it because conspiracy work needs more logical analysis and much less BS unsupported crap. Sure disinfo agents argue in similar ways but we all should be able to back up statements anyway.

       Healthy analysis can't be given up to a 'vote system'...sorry.  Shouting 'CTR' at someone is simply the new word for 'SHILL'...

       That's bullshit.  There are plenty of people and groups who attempt to make this sub look bad.  The most obvious example is the fake anti-semites who pop up here and there.

       This is not a forum for people who have anxiety about being "lumped in" anyway. The CTR crowd are such low-IQ herd-mentality losers that they think this this kind of manipulation will get a reaction here. LOL. It actually turns me in the other direction.

       We always talk about reaching the AI singularity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a firm believer that it has already been reached and we are a byproduct of it.

      <p>
       We were lied to about our past.

      <p>
       As to what's outside the dome.. I don't know.. More land? Advanced AI? Perhaps we are an advanced Co2 generator for an organism that survives off our waste...

       I think if you pump enough LSD into someone it can really fuck you up for life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stay drug free these days.
      </p>
      <p>
