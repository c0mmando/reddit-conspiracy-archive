<p>The psychology behind this talking point  is that when someone reads that line, they don&#39;t want to be &quot;lumped in&quot; as being stupid, so they will disregard the post. Its quite amusing.</p>

<p>Let the vote system do the talking of what should make the sub look bad.</p>

<p>So if people react badly to the fact that taxes don&#39;t fund government spending, how would they react if I told them about politicians being paedophiles, or 9/11 being an inside job?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We consider and reconsider what is right and what is wrong on a daily basis. We are very open to the idea that we may be wrong. And we are discussing why some people cannot fathom that what they consider to be the truth may not be.</p>

<p>edit: And it isn&#39;t a matter of &quot;a bigger chance of being wrong&quot;. It is either right or it is wrong. The facts and the evidence will determine what is right or wrong, not someone&#39;s perception of what might seem outlandish or what might possibly likely be right or wrong in their minds.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take this to a logical conclusion. A black communities church was torched by someone a few weeks before the election, and someone wrote &quot;Vote Trump&quot; on the church. It was reported that a Trump supporter must have burnt it. </p>

<p>But stop a minute. Is this true? Who benefits from this act? Not Trump. Not the Trump supporter. A racist act would just play into the Hillary campaign talking points. Who claims a racist illegal act? No one. Illegal racist acts are done all the time. No one signs it and claims it. No one. </p>

<p>But people will do crazy stuff and blame the other side to make them look bad. It&#39;s called a false flag incident. </p>

<p>If a Trump supporter really wanted to &quot;help&quot; his candidate or do harm to the opposition, they would have written &quot;Vote Hillary&quot; on the church. But that wouldn&#39;t be even remotely believable because Hillary was claiming the high road on racism.</p>

<p>But if a Hillary supporter were to do this, then it would be supporting her weak claims that the Trump campaign and Trump supporters are racist. It actually makes so much more sense that a Hillary supporter would do this, than a Trump supporter.</p>

<p>One can only conclude that it was a Hillary supporter who did this.</p>
