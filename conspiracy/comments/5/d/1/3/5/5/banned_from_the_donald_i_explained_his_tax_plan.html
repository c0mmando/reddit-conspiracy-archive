<p>He&#39;s only doing this to get a positive public opinion of himself. In reality, if his tax cut goes through, then the top 20% get about 77.7% of the tax cuts. He saves a lot more on his tax cuts than he would earn by taking the salary. </p>

<p>What are your thoughts on my analysis and do you think i am censored unfairly for telling my intepretation, which i can back up with facts if need be.</p>

<p>flat tax plans with no deductions would very likely increase revenue</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s getting this shit from Benjamin Fulford. Benjamin Fulford is a balding and fat middle-aged geek who preys on people like TeslasMuse, who are honestly well-meaning and looking for good information. His scam is that he&#39;s got the inside scoop on everything happening behind-the-scenes with &#39;the Cabal,&#39; he apparently flies around the world doing backroom deals with his &#39;Illuminati contacts&#39; to broker peace for humanity. It is exactly as insane as it sounds, and probably even moreso. He charges people for this drivel, total fuckin scumbag in my opinion. He&#39;s been blabbering about &#39;mass arrests of the Cabal will be happening next week&#39; for like a decade, you&#39;d think people would have realized like 8 years ago that this guy was full of shit.</p>

<p>The shit would be hilarious if it wasn&#39;t so sad that people waste time and money on these fucks, there&#39;s a video of him on YouTube with a guy dressed as a ninja that looks like it was filmed on VHS.</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t find the ninja one, but found something equally as ridiculous in no time: <a href="https://youtu.be/fNjZZX7M3N0">https://youtu.be/fNjZZX7M3N0</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m just mindblown that people not only pay this guy any attention, but they actually GIVE HIM MONEY. Fuckin crazy.</p>
