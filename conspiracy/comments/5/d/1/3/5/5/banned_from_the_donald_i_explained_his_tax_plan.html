       This was in response to when he won't take a salary as a us president.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's only doing this to get a positive public opinion of himself. In reality, if his tax cut goes through, then the top 20% get about 77.7% of the tax cuts. He saves a lot more on his tax cuts than he would earn by taking the salary.

       What are your thoughts on my analysis and do you think i am censored unfairly for telling my intepretation, which i can back up with facts if need be.

       last i perused it his tax plan involved also repealing all of the deductons bullshit and wizardry that allows groups like apple to pay no taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       flat tax plans with no deductions would very likely increase revenue

       A lot of us are banned from the Donald for pointing things out, far to easy for them to dismiss any form of dissent against the new emperor, as being a shill for Hillary (paranoia runs strong in some mods lol)

       I've seen all the Podesta emails regarding ETs. All of them were from people who he never even responded to. Which email has any evidence that anybody in power is planning to disclose alien life? Not trying to be antagonistic, if there really is one I'd love to see it. As far as the reptilians, antarctica, and space wars go... I would really love to see evidence of that as well.

       He's getting this shit from Benjamin Fulford. Benjamin Fulford is a balding and fat middle-aged geek who preys on people like TeslasMuse, who are honestly well-meaning and looking for good information. His scam is that he's got the inside scoop on everything happening behind-the-scenes with 'the Cabal,' he apparently flies around the world doing backroom deals with his 'Illuminati contacts' to broker peace for humanity. It is exactly as insane as it sounds, and probably even moreso. He charges people for this drivel, total fuckin scumbag in my opinion. He's been blabbering about 'mass arrests of the Cabal will be happening next week' for like a decade, you'd think people would have realized like 8 years ago that this guy was full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shit would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad that people waste time and money on these fucks, there's a video of him on YouTube with a guy dressed as a ninja that looks like it was filmed on VHS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Couldn't find the ninja one, but found something equally as ridiculous in no time:

       I'm just mindblown that people not only pay this guy any attention, but they actually GIVE HIM MONEY. Fuckin crazy.
