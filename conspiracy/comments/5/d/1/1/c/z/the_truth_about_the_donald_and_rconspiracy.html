        We want the same things, we are on the same side.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some respect is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't sweat it that we aint got the same beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm an old fart, been deep down this rabbit hole for a long time and what just happened I was starting think I'd never see.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Trump was NOT suppose to win.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, he was working for "them", but his job was to get H in. (pardon me pedes, that's just my belief)
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've heard a bunch of Diabold machines got taken out and we ended up getting a rather fair election.  (Who cares if this is true or not)
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, he was suppose to lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       This why literally everyone was so freaked out.  They all knew the script, like they always have.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it fucking blew up in their face.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU did that
      </p>
      <p>
       WE did that.
      </p>
      <p>
       We came together under a cause, we turned Trump into movement. A giant fuck you to them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump didn't win, BOTH PARTIES LOST
      </p>
      <p>
       They are scared shitless of us, united against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now is their hail marry, they are trying to DIVIDE us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fall for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We stopped them. Even if just for a moment, it was a monumental moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       DONT STOP. Now more than ever we have a chance to break them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you wouldn't believe me, but there are people on the inside who are with us.

       And this is a fact. Since the day I've first posted here I've openly questioned why people have excused the shit he has done, why they give him a pass and why more people aren't pointing out the hypocrisy. For me it for so bad that I would have to preface posts by stating I am apolitical or some shit because the drones couldn't see the light.

       I dont believe that. If Trump was working for them and "wanted" to lose, why did he go high energy in the last 2 weeks having 5 rallies a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was going to "take a dive" I dont think he would have worked that hard in the last leg of the campaign. It just doesn't make sense
      </p>
      <p>
       It is proven that the Hillary Campaign wanted to face Trump in the general election, but we haven't seen anything to suggest that they were working together. Especially since we have access to the Podesta emails, the guy who was running the campaign, surely there would have been something in there. But there is not.

       They didn't think he would win. The media was so bias through the election that they started to believe their own bullshit. Especially the odds on election day which they gave Clinton a 90-98% chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the question is, is Trump working with them (or will work with them)? That is hard to say. Most of the time both candidates serve the same people.

       I just got banned from participating in r/the_donald because I commented on one of the posts that called him a "god emperor trump" and I dared to say that I didn't consider him to be a god emperor. I was banned about 10 minutes later. Fuck that sub reddit. It's transformed from a movement, into some sick cult. Seriously, fuck r/the_donald and their moderators.

       Yeah, its a fucking joke. They are the mirror image of mainstream media. If you even slightly differ from their opinion and view of Trump as a god, then you are called a terrorist, or troll, or dissenter. Literally anything but a level headed adult. Lol

       A mirror image of MSM?  Help me understand what you mean, bc the MSM I've been watching for 6 months can't see daylight for how far up HRC's ass it has gone.

       I'm sorry, I didn't realize saying trump isn't a god king emperor, Phoenix whatever the fuck was a dick thing to say. I'm one that doesn't drink the kool aid, no matter what side it comes from.

       So the part where I said if you think  of donald trump as a god king emperor then you are the intellectual equivalent of people that used to wear those Obama tshirts. That part? Because that's pretty tame, but also couldn't be more true.

       Yet you attack anyone who doesn't share the belief that Trump is a saviour. You also turned this subreddit into another
       <a href="/r/The_donald">
        /r/The_donald
       </a>
       when this subreddit should be about every conspiracy theory that exist even those  on Donald Trump. The difference between you and us is that we are free thinkers whereas you are biased Donald trump supporters who belong on
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       and not on here.

       I'll ask all of you Trump supporters why are you saturating this board instead of posting on
