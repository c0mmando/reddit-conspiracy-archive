<p>Some respect is needed. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t sweat it that we aint got the same beliefs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an old fart, been deep down this rabbit hole for a long time and what just happened I was starting think I&#39;d never see.</p>

<p><strong>Trump was NOT suppose to win.</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, he was working for &quot;them&quot;, but his job was to get H in. (pardon me pedes, that&#39;s just my belief)</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve heard a bunch of Diabold machines got taken out and we ended up getting a rather fair election.  (Who cares if this is true or not)</p>

<p>Point is, he was suppose to lose.</p>

<p>This why literally everyone was so freaked out.  They all knew the script, like they always have.</p>

<p>And it fucking blew up in their face.</p>

<p>YOU did that</p>

<p>WE did that.</p>

<p>We came together under a cause, we turned Trump into movement. A giant fuck you to them all.</p>

<p>Trump didn&#39;t win, BOTH PARTIES LOST</p>

<p>They are scared shitless of us, united against them.</p>

<p>Right now is their hail marry, they are trying to DIVIDE us.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fall for it.</p>

<p>We stopped them. Even if just for a moment, it was a monumental moment.</p>

<p>DONT STOP. Now more than ever we have a chance to break them.</p>

<p>And you wouldn&#39;t believe me, but there are people on the inside who are with us.</p>

<p>4chan, the_donald, conspiracy, and everyone.  It&#39;s us vs them.</p>

Since the day I&#39;ve first posted here I&#39;ve openly questioned why people have excused the shit he has done, why they give him a pass and why more people aren&#39;t pointing out the hypocrisy.

<p>I dont believe that. If Trump was working for them and &quot;wanted&quot; to lose, why did he go high energy in the last 2 weeks having 5 rallies a day. </p>

<p>If he was going to &quot;take a dive&quot; I dont think he would have worked that hard in the last leg of the campaign. It just doesn&#39;t make sense </p>

<p>It is proven that the Hillary Campaign wanted to face Trump in the general election, but we haven&#39;t seen anything to suggest that they were working together. Especially since we have access to the Podesta emails, the guy who was running the campaign, surely there would have been something in there. But there is not. </p>

<p>But you all saw it on their faces that night. All the talking heads went silent cuz they literally didn&#39;t have a script for what to do.  They were in shock not at the thought of Trump as president, they were scared cuz we broke their system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t think he would win. The media was so bias through the election that they started to believe their own bullshit. Especially the odds on election day which they gave Clinton a 90-98% chance.  </p>

<p>Now the question is, is Trump working with them (or will work with them)? That is hard to say. Most of the time both candidates serve the same people. </p>

<p>Only time will tell. </p>

<p>Yet you attack anyone who doesn&#39;t share the belief that Trump is a saviour. You also turned this subreddit into another <a href="/r/The_donald">/r/The_donald</a> when this subreddit should be about every conspiracy theory that exist even those  on Donald Trump. The difference between you and us is that we are free thinkers whereas you are biased Donald trump supporters who belong on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> and not on here. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask all of you Trump supporters why are you saturating this board instead of posting on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a></p>
