        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since he won the election there have been no clear signs of him planning to make good on his promise to &quot;drain the swamp.&quot; In fact his cabinet picks show the opposite: he is surrounding himself with bankers, billionaires, Silicon Valley tech giants, establishment moguls. Wtf people, will you jump off a cliff if your God-emperor tells you to do so? Open your eyes. The man is a selfish, dishonorable crude embarrassing shit. Your pride won&#39;t let you admit this. You project noble qualities onto this man because you want so desperately to believe. You&#39;re being just as blind as the HRC supporters you disdain so much. Stop perpetuating and playing into the left vs. right fake partisan blame game. The enemy is at the top pulling all the strings. Both sides are essentially controlled opposition. Nobody gets to where Trump is without being carefully vetted. He might even be getting groomed to be the scapegoat for when shit intentionally hits the fan. And if he is actually planning to drain this swamp, you better believe he has a shit ton of hurdles to jump over before getting close. Your guy is not Superman, he&#39;s not that smart, and he doesn&#39;t give as much of a shit as you think he does. </p>

<p>And hey, he&#39;s gonna be my president too. I want nothing more than for him to prove me wrong and be the superhero good guy fighting all the bad guys in the name of change and freedom. We need it. But prepare yourselves to be disappointed or even shocked by how things actually play out when he comes into office.</p>

<p>My point is don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket. You call yourselves woke but you ignore glaring facts. Don&#39;t rely on some
political figure to change the status quo for you. That&#39;s a recipe for heartbreak and disillusionment. Wake up and organize and reconcile with those around you who have been equally played by the leaders from their side. We&#39;ve all been played, for far too long. It&#39;s time to start relying on us, the huge mass, the people. Stop fighting and start educating. Be prepared, stay vigilant, don&#39;t let your bias cloud your vision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the local and state level. That&#39;s where actual change occurs anyways. Look at Maine, they weren&#39;t happy with how the election was being run so now they&#39;re trying ranked choice. But that&#39;s not being rolled out nationally. Or CO with marijuana, NC with their bathroom bill etc. If you want change you need to start somewhere, and top of the ticket is not the best choice in my opinion. From my first comment:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at &#39;Hubbert Peak Theory&#39; on wikipedia, or look up Micheal Ruppert on youtube.</p>

<p>Basically it&#39;s a finite resource that locally or globally follows a bell curve pattern, where the production lags behind discovery about 20-30 years. As an example, continental US oil production peaked in 1970. Certain mitigating factors include new technology to extract harder to reach oil, looking for lower quality oil such as tar sands or shale, and going into more unreachable reserves like continental shelf or the arctic. The demand for oil, however, continues to rise worldwide. Remember its not just gas for cars but also plastic products, transportation of goods, and all manufacturing.</p>

<p>Additionally there is incentive for oil companies and the US Govt to misrepresent info on their oil reserves: for tax reasons, to keep the stockholders happy, to manage OPEC regulations. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert by any means. Just starting to investigate this and project what Ruppert would have thought about the current political scene in terms of Oil/Energy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peak oil?  No one knows now.  Because of modern extraction methods the USA alone could keep the world at its present levels of oil consumption for more than 300 years, and the USA isn&#39;t close to having the highest oil reserves.  There is probably enough oil on the planet to keep us going for at least 1000 years, it is not scarce and shows no sign of running out.  The problem with oil is it is dirty, renewable energy is the future and will happen.  Natural plastics, natural oils and natural energy sources will take over.  But oil will constantly fight back by reducing its price and money talks, but for how long?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the USA alone, the 48 states, reached peak oil production in 1970. We cannot produce enough oil for ourselves much less the world. This is why we are involved in the middle east, to gain access and secure oil for ourselves. </p>

<p>Please consider that switching over ALL the infrastructure to natural energy sources is a monumental task, and the transition could leave  us in a situation with large scale blackouts. </p>

<p>Even if people are coordinating with corporations and government, which is incredibly rosy to conceive, it would need time and money. This is something the population needs to be aware of and demand proper attention and solutions from govt. that support this transition. We need to encourage business to move in this direction. Now that we have the momentum from the Trump election would be a good time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, I was going off a documentary I saw that was obviously bullshit.  Just checked and despite US oil production exceeding the 1970 high, it will be short lived.  The good news is that solar is coming on with leaps and bounds, each new panel improvement is increasing efficiency far beyond what anyone thought possible before.  Coupled with cheap light tracking panels it now means an average house can be powered with only one Light tracking solar panel and one domestic wind turbine.  Going off grid is now an affordable reality.  </p>

<p>Research into natural plastics and oils still has a little way to go, but progress is being made.  I still think that within 20 years our reliance on petrochemicals will be ending and the Saudis will have to go back to rug making or something.  I hope I&#39;m right, because we can&#39;t go in with our diminishing returns system.  Even if global warming isn&#39;t true, we are going to leave future generations with nothing if we don&#39;t change our thinking.  </p>

<p>The problem is that he saw DC was a swamp filled with crocodiles. He says, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s drain this swamp, crocodiles don&#39;t know how to make government work!&quot; He&#39;s right, crocodiles are bad for government. So he drains the swamp of the crocodiles... and immediately refills the swamp with swamp monsters instead!</p>

<p>Getting rid of career politicians might be a good thing, because those career politicians are bought and paid for to do the bidding of moneyed interests. But what does Trump do? Directly pick people from those same industries who have no experience in government. Under Obama, we had a Secretary of State who was a career politician who did the bidding of the fracking industry (and she privately bragged about pushing fracking around the globe). Under Trump, we&#39;ll have a non-politician who happens to be in charge of an oil company and who is most likely to do the bidding of the oil industry. It&#39;s a direct conflict of interest. Our Secretary of State should not be part of the oil industry, they should not do the bidding of the oil industry. That&#39;s the problem. </p>

<p>That&#39;s only a part of the problem with career politicians. Another part is that they are willing to go out every 2, 4, or 6 years and tell the people whatever they need to hear to get re-elected and then they accomplish nothing when they get back in. Their entire time in Congress is spent trying to figure out what will help them get re-elected. I will bet that most career politicians look at a bill and go &quot;Will this blow back on me next election&quot; rather than &quot;Is this good for the people&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Since he is looking outside of politicians to staff his cabinet, can you name me an industry that would have more experience dealing with Russia, Middle Eastern countries, and South America than the oil industry? I assume that Trump picked who he thought was the best deal maker within international businesses circles because I assume he believes it would translate to making deals with international governments.</p>

<p>Also, that&#39;s your opinion as to whether the Secretary of State should come from within the oil industry, and it is clouded by your own bias. It doesn&#39;t matter where the SoS comes from (or any other cabinet position, really) in the business world, you could say the exact same thing about &quot;conflict of interest&quot;. Personally, as long as deals get made that benefit America, I don&#39;t give a fuck who else benefits. Now if he starts making deals that have no benefit to the American people, then it becomes a problem. </p>

<p>Or if he starts secretly running guns (and probably drugs and people) into Africa and the middle east and arming CIA-led revolutions the way Mrs. Clinton did during her time in the position...that would also be a problem.  </p>

<p>This is something I can&#39;t stress more. I feel the American people don&#39;t respect themselves enough to realize this. We saw protests in S Korea and now in Poland, but the American people just don&#39;t seem to get it. For there to be change, they need to provoke it. Occupy Wall Street was a start but they need to build on that, hell once the movement starts in the US, I&#39;ll join in from Canada as well. We have it good, but I still seek change for the better in Canada. Harper fucked us good and Trudeau is a start but like I have said before, left is too far right for me and I want to see us move further left again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one thing to preach big change during an election, remember Obama wanted a true universal health care system but ended up with a sack of shit written by insurance companies?  That&#39;s how it is in politics.  I&#39;m sure the correct people have sat down with Mr Trump and put him straight.  &quot;If you attempt to fuck us Donald those tapes of you fucking that 8 year old will leak&quot;, or they bring in a friend of his from school, let him chat to this old friend, meet his wife,  kids, grandchildren and then without warning a man dressed in black walks into the room and murders all of them in front of Donald, then turns and says &quot;this&#39;ll be you and your family if you don&#39;t do as you&#39;re fucking told&quot;.  Didn&#39;t anyone notice Obama went completely grey almost overnight?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are multiple layers to this narrative.  Trump values loyalty, success, and people that question/are suspicious of the federal gov&#39;t.  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/11/18/who-has-trump-appointed-his-cabinet-so-far/94075950/">All his cabinet picks</a> have at least 2 out of these 3 categories.  And he measures success in business terms, which is why he&#39;s hiring billionaires/millionaires. Without financial success, it&#39;s very hard to have or gain his respect.</p>

<p>The second layer is how the media puts Trump in a lose/lose narrative.  If he nominates an experienced politician (Session, for example), he&#39;s not draining the swamp.  If he brings in a Washington outsider (Mnuchin), then it&#39;s an attack on their business success or their lack of experience.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;m not defending Bannon or Pruitt&#39;s positions/nomination, but my previous statements explain <strong>why</strong> Trump picked them (Bannon has loyalty and suspicion, Pruitt has success/experience and suspicion).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it&#39;s concerning, but if I know one thing about Trump is that he is unpredictable but always comes through on his promises. </p>

<p>He plays 9-d chess. He knows exactly what he is doing. My knee jerk reaction is that he is hiring the opposite people than what he should hire, but I know that he has a plan. It&#39;s very deliberate and somehow it will work.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually very excited to see how this all plays out... Remember the FBI and CIA often offer jobs to the very hackers that they were going to prosecute. He might be hiring the most successful people in each field to help regulate it.</p>

<p>Maybe it won&#39;t work!?!? But I&#39;m excited to see what happens!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump doesn&#39;t &quot;play 9-d chess&quot;, he&#39;s just always been rich enough to strong arm his way with anything and everything, until he ultimately succeeds, or just says he has a billion times even though he hasn&#39;t and people give up arguing.</p>

<p>The only difference between Trump and another President is that they have different close friends.</p>

<p>It is going to get worse for the middle class, despite all the PR stunts telling you the opposite (Trump is already talking about the jobs he&#39;s saving/creating), and it will be much worse for the environment.</p>

<p>The elite are going to continue to succeed off of the backs of the masses, whilst raping planet Earth, until the masses decide to stop in-fighting and start voting together and boycotting together, in order to improve their own lives.  </p>

<p>In the meantime, have fun listening to Trump tell you how great it all is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t trusted politicians in years. Bernie was a representation of change, but the man himself is too weak and powerless to effect it. That&#39;s my point. I want Trump to be it as much as the next guy, but I&#39;m not buying it and I&#39;m tired of people doing the same stupid song and dance of relying on someone at the top of this messed up system to change everything around. That&#39;s false hope, laziness and apathy. That&#39;s not how it works for us. We&#39;re essentially slaves at this point. The power doesn&#39;t come from a political figure, it comes from the citizens realizing their own power in numbers. Time to wake up and get united and organized. That&#39;s my point, but your arrogance and pride refuse to allow you to see what&#39;s obvious. But don&#39;t worry you&#39;ve got a lot of company. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see a lot of career politicians in his cabinet.</p>

<p>The problem is that he saw DC was a swamp filled with crocodiles. He says, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s drain this swamp, crocodiles don&#39;t know how to make government work!&quot; He&#39;s right, crocodiles are bad for government. So he drains the swamp of the crocodiles... and immediately refills the swamp with swamp monsters instead!</p>

<p>Getting rid of career politicians might be a good thing, because those career politicians are bought and paid for to do the bidding of moneyed interests. But what does Trump do? Directly pick people from those same industries who have no experience in government. Under Obama, we had a Secretary of State who was a career politician who did the bidding of the fracking industry (and she privately bragged about pushing fracking around the globe). Under Trump, we&#39;ll have a non-politician who happens to be in charge of an oil company and who is most likely to do the bidding of the oil industry. It&#39;s a direct conflict of interest. Our Secretary of State should not be part of the oil industry, they should not do the bidding of the oil industry. That&#39;s the problem. </p>
