        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m curious to see what everyone thinks about extraterrestrial beings and/or technology. Although I have not seen conclusive evidence of these beings, I am under the impression that in a universe that is as old and as vast as scientists claim ours to be, that it is almost impossible for there not to be life outside of our world. It is also likely that as young as our solar system is, there are forms of life that are far more advanced than ours. I have also read of the possibility of inter dimensional beings being present here on Earth (with these claims also being present in the Podesta emails). I was just curious to see what opinions other people in the r/conspiracy community have on this subject. Could there be a means to communicate with these extraterrestrial/interdimensional beings, especially for someone not involved with a major governmental agency? Will disclosure, when it occurs, be a means to educate the public (I know, probably not likely) or as means to introduce an outside threat to help lay the groundwork for martial law/a global government? I&#39;m not trying to debate this subject, I&#39;m just curious to see others&#39; opinions, explanations, thoughts, feelings, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just regarding using &quot;aliens&quot; for &quot;martial law/a global government&quot; I&#39;d say there are fairly complete plans to move toward that with a convincing &quot;disclosure&quot;. I have seen anti-gravity machines twice. Fifty years from now they&#39;ll be a common sight. In the interim, they&#39;re working on the &quot;alien&quot; by using recombinant DNA to create a chimera that is stable, intelligent, and relatively long-lived; something out of Joseph Mengele&#39;s sickest imagination. It would only be used for a few announcements and thereafter only be CGI. The reason is the poor creature/victim most likely will go horribly insane. </p>

<p>They&#39;d have to find some seriously imaginative sci-fi writers to concoct the back story, and special effect geniuses to enhance the believability, like pictures from its home world, and some &quot;signals&quot; from deep space that real scientists can&#39;t debunk.</p>

<p>The disclosure, to be believed, will have to expose heretofore black technologies, Tesla stuff, to make us think the being brought them. At the same time, previously hidden medical technology, miracles, say a cure for cancer, and age reversal will cement the &quot;truth&quot;.</p>

<p>Like 911, though, it won&#39;t be long before skeptics start punching holes in the giant theatrical fraud, plunging us deeper into whatever shitty vision of the future the controllers have in their sick minds because they <em>will have backup plans</em> they always do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;recombinant DNA...chimera&quot; sounds a lot like what Ozymandias did in the Watchmen comics. Creating a powerful psychic creature that would be teleported into a major city and cause large scale destruction, which in turn gave the world a major outside threat to unite against, putting an end to conflict between the US and Soviets (although I can&#39;t remember if it was still the Soviet Union in the comic).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real trick is going to be getting the creature to speak directly to your mind (an illusion already invented). The main thing setting the program back, preventing its implementation is, what I call, the <strong>Hillbilly Effect</strong>. Even now, the anti-grav ships they have, and would fly around during the psy-op, could all be shot out of the sky by a hillbilly with a WW1 long rifle. It&#39;s a problem they haven&#39;t figured out yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are, in actuality, &quot;near&quot; zero G craft. Hence they have to be super lite, enter the invention of carbon composites. They machinery and propulsion had to be lightened as well, titanium, and new honeycomb materials. Things started looking up when they started using Tesla beamed electricity, capacitors, and plastic (non-lead) batteries, and super-lite electric motors, nano composite &quot;wires&quot;. Finally, super conductors requiring less cooling. Think of one of these crafts as an extremely complicated flying cell phone or lap top. </p>

<p>Force fields aren&#39;t figured out yet, shielding is not what it needs to be. So, a toothless hayseed with a bayoneted surplus Mauser 8mm can bring any one of them down, think Jeb Clampett shooting at some food.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both were connected to Area 51. On the way north to Rachael NV about 8 miles south of the bus road, there&#39;s a low mountain in the foreground and much larger ones in the background, east side of the road. A lenticular cloud was just behind the low mountain. It was yellowish, the <em>wrong</em> color. As we approached I used my camera to zoom on the object. We got about 1000 feet close to it, I observed smoking desert brush which illuminated what would have been an invisible laser, there were two and the &quot;cloud&quot; was at the apex. </p>

<p>My story should have ended there but whoever was in this observation station, saw me, and my camera <strong>they blinked!</strong> thus proving it was <em>not</em> a cloud: they steered and descended at an angle and down behind the foreground small mountain. Clouds don&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>I await the customary attack and will respond with the second observation if you&#39;re not a troll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the Little Ale&#39;inn I was looking at the pictures and was invited by a &quot;retired air force officer&quot; to look at very close (not legal) satellite pictures of Area 51. He showed me rows of dump trucks leading in and out of a tunnel in the vicinity of the &quot;burn pit&quot;. </p>

<p>This I&#39;ve shared before so alert all trolls: I said, &quot;I&#39;m the one paying for this, a taxpayer. I&#39;d just like to see one thing they&#39;re working on. They&#39;re the modern equivalent of the pyramids. I paid for them.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if they put him there because of my earlier observation of the &quot;cloud&quot; and I did see three teams of stiff army types using turn arounds to conduct me into Rachel.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, at home, I got a hangup call at 3am, was going back to sleep but heard a pulsing sound outside, went out, looked up, and 200 feet in the air above my street, making an exact right turn, was the Triangle UFO sporting military strobes. At the end of the block it made another exact right turn and went back toward either the Coronado or Miramar base. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been raked over the coals of my previous account so spare me if so inclined. Take it or leave it. I was done a favor by the black ops people and given a glimpse of secret technology.</p>

<p>I have made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jq50l/i_think_some_day_soon_something_about_atlantis/">a post about Atlantis and its relation to e.t.&#39;s, the elite, and the elite&#39;s system of control and domination</a> that is very informative and logical and connects these things together. I also made this post about the same subject that I also suggest you read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jtaj4/are_the_elites_hiding_giants_and_hybrids_in_the/dbjefio/">this post I made regarding the same subject</a>. Atlantis is the key to both understanding our past and origins as well as destroying the system of control and domination of the elites and once again being in communication with the advanced beings from elsewhere that helped us during Atlantis and the early stages of the ancient civilizations that came from it (like Egypt and the Yucatan civilizations). </p>

<p>Please read that because it VERY MUCH links and connects with e.t.&#39;s and the elite ruling this world.</p>
