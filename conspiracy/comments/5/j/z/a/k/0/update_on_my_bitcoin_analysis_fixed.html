        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I created this thread six days ago.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5irhfi/is_this_a_conspiracy_the_digital_revolution/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5irhfi/is_this_a_conspiracy_the_digital_revolution/</a></p>

<p>Today the price of bitcoin is 900.00 + <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=bitcoin%20price">PRICE</a></p>

<p>I literally said buy 6 days ago and if you listened you made 130.00 usd as the price was 770.00 at time of post.</p>

<p><strong>You can even use this tool I made you</strong> 
<a href="http://www.Investbitcoin.webs.com">http://www.Investbitcoin.webs.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Its bogging down so you literally have to continue to click send on the html repeatedly but it does work.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(I don&#39;t have enough money to make the site  better).</strong></p>

<p><strong>There are vendors, videos, tools, and even affilate programs and free vendors that give it away. All you will need to do is download a wallet and buy in. If you do this now, it will likely make you a thousand dollars per coin or more by next year alone. Maybe 4000</strong></p>

<p>In fact my exact analysis is a 4000.00 price hop in the next 3-4 quarters. and a 45,000 price hop by 2018 DEC.</p>

<p><strong>I wrote this days ago. I am good at inferring data.</strong> </p>

<p>Data sets and analysis is a gift I have. I am very intelligent. </p>

<p>For those of you that aren&#39;t in yet <strong>get in.</strong> (Buy in if you can afford it Asap)!!!</p>

<p>For those of you that are broke. There are sites on the website that you can even earn it for free in the affiliates page. (page 5 in websites browser). </p>

<p><strong>Do this now and thank me later.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Seriously This has the potential to make you 50.000 per 1000.00 you spend by within a couple years.</strong></p>

<p>The thread proves that I knew my shit, and if you listened then it would have already made you 130 +. </p>

<p>Dont not listen again. They are running out of coins and you will lose the oppurtunity to make thousands. </p>

<p>Like stock in apple computing long ago. We are talking prices that will be insane in just a few years. 
Thanks for reading. </p>

<p>Edits made op.</p>

<p>Note: I would not lie to a single person on this forum. There truly are free methods on that site to help you learn about how to buy sell trade and avoid scam coins. It is a full on directory. </p>

<p>I made it so users that are struggling may find hope like the hope that I see - I have no intent to sway you. And if you already listened. You already profited. Food for thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Note with bitcoin you don&#39;t have to buy a full coin. You can easily purchase a 20.00 share from a vendor. 10.00 etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest if your a minimum wager you put anything. even just 7.00 a paycheck. It truly is a stable investment. </p>

<p>Primarily it is because in india, and belgium (intl territories), they are utilizing it as every day currencies. </p>

<p>There are only maybe 4 million coins (full coins) left. So after that. the inflation will hyperinflate, leading single coins up to the potential for maybe even 1 million per coin. </p>

<p>We only know it will continue to go up, with light dips inbetween, when large share holders sell. But for every lost coin, and less coin the price will continue to grow. So that is why you are very well losing your ability to even buy in. <strong>Get in now</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you support the whole weird assed bitcoin &quot;blockchain&quot; Assange encryption key conspiracy theory... and also support buying bitcoins as an investment... is there any relationship between these two views or is it purely coincidental? </p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="comment mb-3 ml-1 op" data-depth="1" data-id="dbk6z7v">

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all a coincidence; Just two different subjects that overlay each other. </p>

<p>By example; I am an analyst. I typically do physics related data sets. </p>

<p>The blockchain key fiasco is essentially a wild goose chase however a dangerous one at that, and I don&#39;t implore novice users to attempt to decrypt a code to implicate themselves in a federal crime.  (however, Yes. I do feel there is slight indication that it could be hidden there; But while this is simply indication of its presence the odds of users finding it are of unknown certainty). I actually believe its already been found in that regard). </p>

<p>Now the price of bitcoin however isn&#39;t in any relationship to that. 
This is simple analysis of the price range, which is relevant as myself a humanitarian am merely suggesting that users who can afford to make an investment make one as I see it being a highly profitable endeavor. </p>

<p>I literally have a quite interesting lifestyle; I don&#39;t have hobbies like others. The internet itself, Is and was and always has been my only hobby. I scour it and utilize it, reading sometimes 200-1000 articles a day, and use self taught assets, such as skepticism, and basic inference; To otherwise make rational conclusions on world events; </p>

<p>I am quite good at it, and its my true hobby and passion. </p>

<p>Not only that but, I am a myself; A self claimed humanitarian, and to be honest the real issues I have with the Julian Assange situation is that there was an honest and obvious incident on the Oct 16-18 date range, and the very truth (because I&#39;ve read so much) is on those dates something did very well happen; (Which obviously is of great importance) (being the circumstances of its concealment). </p>

<p>So yes it&#39;s coincidental but you are roping them up into the same basket because one is an, apple the other is an orange. So I do take that notion into the concept, and think this was a valid and good question. But in that context. I am making cobbler with the apples and juice with the oranges. So yes similar, but my only motive was to address that the bitcoin price was going to hyper inflate. (which it will). and already has as I have left absolute proof of my ability, and that notion, having taken my time out of my own schedule to address it as I had in the first place. </p>

<p>TL/DR
I am just a guy, and I like helping the world. Nothing more, nor less. But it is a quality that I take into full accounts, because as a person. This is who I want to be recognized for. Factually. </p>

<p>:)
P.s. I enjoyed your ability to ask this instead of making a preposterous claim, and looking back. I would have addressed the differences earlier had I noticed the actual overlapping of the topics. So I am actually very happy you asked this, and that we could engage the topic in case it deterred other users from making a decision which they truly should take all extents and values of my theories into consideration between making a decision on behalf of themselves, and more importantly their families. So TY <a href="/u/Ninjakick666">/u/Ninjakick666</a> truly; For bringing this to their attention, and giving me the ability to explain my position on it. All factors truly always should be considered. (and I mean that to everyone). :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very nice post... I appreciate you taking the time to explain your situation to me. Most people just blast out a couple of insults and call it a day. My hobbies overlap with yours in that regard... I like to play &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot; more than most users of these subs... But I stop short of encouraging the regular people to make decisions that could negatively impact their future... investing in cryptocurrencies and hitting the dark web to conspire with others whose motivations I don&#39;t full understand is where I draw the line. </p>

<p>I just post for my own edifiaction... to &quot;lock in&quot; my predictions then kick back and wait to see if I was right... I guess I help the world in a different way... I encourage people to trust their gut instincts... instinct is something that seems like it is being bred out of mankind... People are oblivious to way too much that goes on around them...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No by all means it is a factual way of life to challenge everything that is to be taken into account. I do this as well. </p>

<p>In fact you could likely tell me an actual known fact. (mass has density), but until I read enough to verify it for myself I&#39;d likely not consider it factual at all. I don&#39;t encourage people to put their all into it. Like I mentioned in the thread. Make an investment with what you have to invest. A minimum wager say 7.00usd a month. that is a valid strategy, and at the price of a couple lattes a month you may make a significant profit in terms of long term strategy. </p>

<p>I just hope users take the potential for the opportunity, I&#39;ve based this on the site I built alone, to attempt to show users just how flexible it is becoming. I mean they have atm&#39;s now in multiple nations. There is a full network of 150,000 machines being added in just a few month, from ameritrade. I don&#39;t see this as a fringe investment anymore; At first I was extremely skeptical; But again. With the multiplude of national and international (world acclaimed) business&#39;s now on board. I doubt again any one thing can stop it now. Accept a meteor to the planet or a very very illegal act of law; Due to it inflicting the national finance system). The problem with that argument in itself is that the more bitcoin improves, The better our finances are. So?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes i agree, however using crypto is just as ingenuous as usd all the same. (if your using it to purchase illegal items) then you are complicit?  But buying a book on overstock isn&#39;t necessarily a crime. </p>

<p>Essentially its about who you are and how you use your finances in the first place. So Just be a good law abiding person, and you have nothing to worry about. It&#39;s not like using a debit card and affiliating with say drug cartels isn&#39;t equally as implicating in that regard. </p>

<p>So We simply need to stay true to ourselves in all extents, and in hand (All problems solved). :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. Your research looks similar to fractal analysis which I have been looking into, and I came to the same conclusion of $4000 that you have. There have been 3 bubbles, and each time the price rises by x20 and then falls to 20% of the peak. The first bubble, I can&#39;t remember the prices off the top of my head, but I believe it settled around $10-$12. Then the second bubble, the price rose x20 to $250 and then crashed to about $50 (20% of $250). Then the most recent bubble the price rose x20 from $50 to $1000 and then crashed to $200 (again 20%). So I also think that this next bubble the price will rise (x20) to $4000, and then crash again to $800.</p>

<p>Also, what do you think of <a href="http://woobull.com/bitcoin-market-cap-should-be-40b-according-to-metcalfes-law/">Metcalfe&#39;s Law?</a></p>

<p>What do you think of Altcoins? Have you done any analysis on them? I have trouble finding raw price data for altcoins that is in a csv format that I can manipulate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On metcalfe&#39;s law the principal is a fixed rate; So it is correct in its equation to &quot;some&quot; extents. </p>

<p>The initial threat to bitcoin and all bitcoin holders is, and always was the price fix meeting the final output. Essentially there are only the 21,000,000 respective bitcoins; And the contractual agreements with holders were always fundamental fears that the addition to new coins would counter this; Leads holders to their preemptive jump ship narratives. Essentially bitcoin gave them a single promise which is proven by its computation model. The encryption states 21million shares total, and by adding more it literally upsets the market and in that respect its current holders dreams of growth. </p>

<p>So what I think the actual conspiracy is is the respected &quot;decimal place&quot;. I believe instead of attempting to break their promise of the estimated figure. What bitcoin will do is create a satoshin. (1000th) of a satoshi. </p>

<p>This makes me feel that there was always a conspired plan to have a fail-safe when the market capped by hyper inflating the coin itself which will increase the price of satoshis dramatically. </p>

<p>Essentially I believe the model was always planned and once all coins are distributed respectively. Those coins themselves (should you hold them) will be worth upto a million dollars at that time. While a single satoshi now, will reflect the current price of a bit. I.e. roughly the 1.00 usd to 1 bit rate. </p>

<p>So the law is valid and appears to be a tried and true representation of <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mooreslaw.asp">moore&#39;s law</a></p>

<p>The basic inference is that they will continue to cut the coins to smaller denominations until there is literally enough for the entirety of the planet (should it become a seconded world currency) *which in all honesty it is. </p>

<p>This is truly why I made this update and have been following the rates (as you are) being everyone thinks hmm? Should I take the opportunity, and I cant state more that YES. So long as you put 2 things into consideration. First never make an investment you can&#39;t afford to lose. And Second. Should you be in already then be fully at watch of events that could lead to its failure. </p>

<p>To me its because the people accept it that it has a place in the market. The governments on the other hand are another situation entirely. So there is your answer. Basically. Read everything you can and if legislation begins to form pull out ahead of the curve. </p>

<p>So as long as your watching with some constant vigilance I truly think its safe to say you will have an optimal time gaining profits from this platform until doomsday, or direct laws intervention. </p>

<p>Technically bitcoins vendors are multi million assets, at this time. However again. That will be multi billion in the future. So will those initially raise to million if not millions per coin. More than likely. </p>

<p>This is the same model of stocks with bill gates in my opinion and we all know what happened for those holders ;)</p>

<p>On the topic of altcoins. I know that they will also steadily increase within their spectrum&#39;s. But once bitcoins blow up they will have a huge competitor. I feel doge and lite are the best. shortly followed by anon coin. I don&#39;t really see many others thriving in the future however. Its just like any new soft drink company in today&#39;s market. 
The giants typically kill off the meek; Being there was no real competition in the first place. 
However it is notable that every now and then a good thing like redbull comes along and proves the giants that there is room in the market for a new brand. So take the basic inference of that into the equation. Redbull didn&#39;t sell well because people liked it. They loved it. </p>

<p>So id buy only into the markets that show a love perception, and love is created by the excellence of the products being itself. </p>

<p>So lite and doge  People love. </p>

<p>If you have the money to &quot;maybe waste&quot; buy into alts. Otherwise though with bitcoins doing so well. Really just consider that they are detracting you from the tried and true investment in the first place. </p>

<p>So that initially sums it up. Its wise to stack anything and having a few in holdings could come with great benefit someday; 
But I wouldn&#39;t buy into them like at bitcoins rate. Lite and doge yes. Buy say 20. (they are pennies). But don&#39;t expect them to show profits like bitcoins for a near decade. Not to say they wont. Just to say it will take far more time for them to bare the fruit the other trees are creating here and now in the crypto garden :)</p>

<p>Basically I think I am right and this is a conspiracy. I&#39;d suggest all that read this to attempt to own 1 coin before they are truly un affordable (to the common man). Which is exactly why I posted this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m about to go to bed, but I have a few questions for you. I saw your thread last week and was thinking about buying. Needless to say I&#39;m mad at myself for not doing so.. </p>

<p>I invested yesterday at the $904 mark and it has been staggering since then. What are the main factors that will cause Bitcoin to rise? And conversely, what are the factors that could cause it to fall? I have quite a bit in savings and would like to go all in if it falls back down to 800. A risk I am willing to take since I&#39;m young and can recover from loss. But I know that if I do so, Bitcoin will have to be far more accepted in order for it to reach those quoted marks (5,000+). Almost as our only form of currency. I would love if you could give me some articles to read into. I can relate to living your life on the Internet and constantly collecting data. I&#39;ve just started with Bitcoin, and can&#39;t get enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you should buy 3 coins. Wait until 1200. Pull out 1. That way you&#39;ve recovered any loss in a drop on coin 2. Coin 3 you should never ever sell. Even if it goes bankrupt. Essentially. The things that compel it to rise is every person you tell to take hold of it. That is the unique most feature. They are limited. It&#39;s like the rarest card in the pokemon deck. (or a babe ruth card). You see the paper card. Or in this case &quot;data&quot; are virutally worthless. It is a 10c print. Or a unique piece of coding in bitcoins case. But factually with babe ruth cards. There are only a limited amount of them in circulation. </p>

<p>Never put the bulk of anything into an investment. Say you want to invest 2000. Well. Start with 500. that way you have 3 more investments you can make. </p>

<p>If your first investment isn&#39;t a success this way you have outs. I suggest three coins as that will give you a level. If the market drops to 75%. Sell coin one. If it drops to 50 sell 2. But always keep coin three in. That will lead to only a limited loss in its entirety should prices drop. </p>

<p>Next point. In febuary bitcoin will be boldly shooting up again. But from now until then you may question your investment. Which people do. They get really antz. and can&#39;t trust the slightest sign of a loss. O Oh my god 200- Pull out! NO- Don&#39;t fear the market Just use the above strategy. (i.e maybe sell 1). But stay in. Because if for instance last year seems to reflect next year. Prices will boom and bloom by next winter. And there you are taking a loss on all three coins. (200 a coin). when Had you just stayed in your real profit was there. And now it is laughing at you. </p>

<p>In my advice. If I had 5k today. That was throw away id probably spend 2200 on bitcoin. Then place another 800 on gold. That way your protected by a counter market increase. Because if the above strategy tanks. It will mean gold prices are taking off again; Which you would be in. It also leaves you again. 2000. to save and use should an emergency happen. </p>

<p>Also don&#39;t cloud mine anymore. Its producing less profit than the price increase. You can actually mine yourself. And mining gear is helpful. But its high risk because major players are taking over. You will probably make your money back. But as for profit it may take you a year to achieve one. So why not just ride on the price hike itself? Let them do your dirty work. </p>

<p>Note also: Use the tool I made. I will update it as much as I can. But all those forum pictures are direct links. So click em. Boom community after community. Join them. Talk to users. Invite them to my own site. The main point is, I will keep updating my directory and integrating in articles to the main page that suit its elegance.  </p>

<p>Your job is to manage your own coin. Id buy maybe a laptop for storing them, and try to keep it offline. Cause the worst is if your computer crashes and you cant recover at all. So protect it. if the coins hit 40 - 50k. And your computer tanks. Your going to be 1 unhappy camper. That being said. Literally close your eyes to the price and wait until the 15th of next month. My guess is you will truly be a happy camper :) (remember from then to febuary sucks) so try to consider with recovering a 1/3 of your investment (along with your profits), that way the other 2/3rds are recoverable. Loss or not. You will thank me for this. I assure you. Ironically I was going to buy in when coins were 70. The guy I saw and told me about its eyes were gleaming and he said buy it! Buy it now!!!</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t do it. And here maybe 2 years later I can&#39;t help from thinking that crazy bum is probably a millionaire. While I am just now learning about what he truly told me to do to change my life at the time. I don&#39;t regret it now. But I really am listening. And FML was I wrong...</p>

<p>Id suggest the <a href="/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> <a href="/r/btc">/r/btc</a> and <a href="/r/bitcoinbeginners">/r/bitcoinbeginners</a> ? community. Note <a href="/r/bitcoins">/r/bitcoins</a> users are very prude, and <a href="/r/btc">/r/btc</a> is a much better forum for advice And the beginners forum is the one for novel questions to pro users. </p>

<p>On my website the forums page has near 40 communities to choose from (even with specific area communities). the resources page is &quot;self explainatory&quot; but that will show you physically how many are on board. (note some come and go; I need to check all the links and keep updating). Poke me if Im lagging lol). Also the affiliates. Learn to use them, and use them well. But of all things use that strategy. I am not going to tell you how to spend your money. If you want to do 5000.00 I wouldn&#39;t blame you. However if this was hard to get. If losing say 200 a share will make you bail. Don&#39;t put in that much. Because then you will kick yourself out of your own attempt to make a profit and other users will buy in at your loss and reap your rewards. So essentially stay strong. Stay in. And maybe even thank me in a couple years. Seriously. Stay in with it for 1 year then tell me how you did. My guess is you will be wanting to send me a coffee card lol. I mean that. Its really the best decision you will ever make. Always save that 1 coin. No matter what. Because I truly feel by 2022 it will be worth a million dollars. No joke. 1 million dollars. </p>

<p>Noting that it inflates because its supply and demand. And they are just about out of handouts. Hence again why I am telling people. Your literally going to lose your chance, and by then. You will only be able to have fragments of the regrets that you didn&#39;t get it why you could. Just like me lol. 70.00 what was I thinking. :(</p>

<p>I am happy I learned and I am happy its a story I get to tell. If you ever need advice I will be here. I will add you to my friends list and If I see something terrible around the corner I will flag you :)</p>

<p>I promise :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your advice.. I&#39;ve already got some coin. I was thinking about selling them mid January if it peaks then using that profit to buy more. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to set up daily investments so I can keep buying. As long as more people see how easy it is to use then it will boom, there&#39;s no doubt in my mind about that. </p>

<p>What causes you to say it will boom in up until january? Just the patterns from last year? If that&#39;s the case I&#39;m definitely going to sell at 1200, since there will likely be a sell off. I just want to know what&#39;s going to cause Bitcoin to say &#39;were here to stay&#39; and societies around the world start using it. 5,000+ wont happen unless we can pay bills with it and replace fiat with bitcoin. That&#39;s a huge hurdle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly market trends. Consider it buyer / seller relations.. Essentially most people think just like you. &quot;I want to get my feet wet&quot; but I don&#39;t want to swim to the deep end. Christmas is a time for shopping. So in that mindset we have buyers... But what is the first thing you do when your 15 and don&#39;t like your present? that right you take it back to the store... so essentially markets follow emotional trends. I feel 1200 will be a good cap. Maybe as high as 1500. But 1200 insures a good profit, and gives you relief for a moment in case there is a good sell out. Basically everyone is happy to spend in december... But in january you also have your remorse holders as well; Meaning... Ah I shouldn&#39;t have bought so much; Time to hedge the top... </p>

<p>The reason you want to sell a 1/3 is positioning... Say we hit 1200. (respectively).... Then it drops back to 950 - 1000. (what a good time to buy). It wont go much below the current market holding now. So your basically riding the boom of energy. Stepping out. Then collecting on all the suckers selling low. Basic strategy really. </p>

<p>I mean you could hold. But if you wanted to maximize your profits; Always take market trends into account. (which translates naturally to basic human nature) ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1800 -4500 so long as the price stays + 1000 through June - August</p>

<p>It could stagger to 750 - 800 after January. </p>

<p>Essentially many people will recieve it as a gift (they don&#39;t intend to keep). Others may have over spent. (Some want summer fun money). </p>

<p>Don&#39;t make decisions on prices; Play off trends. </p>

<p>I already made you some money; So don&#39;t think I did this to cost you anything ;) </p>

<p>The way trends work is the was psychology works. Just think in terms of &quot;Most people&quot;. 
Most people over pay; Then sell in reluctance; So I am proud you listened (because most people didn&#39;t). That makes you a rarity. </p>

<p>It probably will be near 1200 in january but because trends. Be sure to follow the dates (in trends) not the prices. </p>

<p>As those that buy in. will likely buy in 1200 (Thinking I am on the band wagon) while those that bought in at 600 (will sell some to keep their profits up). So those that get in late will say Awe what a scam Its 1000 now. (I  lost 200) then buy out. maybe see 900 again. (then you soak up their losses) because they are impatient fools.). </p>

<p>Hence trends. Not numbers. Be sure you have what you want in by april. It will slow climb until December :)
And yes. I think you will see a number that makes you want to kiss me. 
Thanks for giving me the time of day. I promise you won&#39;t regret it ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was pre halving </p>

<p>You got in at the peak of the inflated price at that time. This is the beginning of a new peak. it will level and hold 1200 in jan - march now. </p>

<p>This will leave those (making quick profits as I suggest to become deterred). Between then and July we should see a price increase slowly building to 2200 - 3500. With a December peak next year 4000-4400. Again. Probably tumbling first quarter 2018 to 3300. At which point they will announce a full sell out. And that will hyper inflate. 10,000. 15,000. 22,000. - 40,000. </p>

<p>I expect instead of adding more coins. What will happen is they will reduce the satoshi cut to a new satoshin (adding a new decimal bracket). This will mean the 1 bit per 1.00 will be 1 satoshi per dollar. </p>

<p>That hyper inflates and gives potential to literally 1 million per coin by 2020-2022</p>

<p>The only thing that will stop this is a law being passed against the currency. And because the value and worth is settling it won&#39;t be able to outlast the legal abilities of the coin itself to triumph those suits. Essentially it is here, and here for good. </p>

<p>So that is my analysis (1 million per coin) 2020 - 2022 Highs with extreme fluxuation as multi billion dollar corporations such as amazon step in to begin utilizing it. Hence overstock backing it now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its actually a mathematics principal. But easily explained; </p>

<p>Supply and demand. The supply is limited to a fractional percentage. In this case we have 21,000,000 coins total. That can be cut to the millionth. </p>

<p>There are 7.96 billion people on the planet. </p>

<p>So There can&#39;t be enough for everyone, yet with the climbing users attempting to utilize it, and taking their products to be sold on it. (such as overstock.com). The basic and only factual future for it, is both growth, and acceptance. </p>

<p>The basis of it is say I have 2.0 grams of marijuana. This was fun to share with my 2 mates. (now we all have a bit). we go to a concert. (No one at the concert brought their own). Now we bought ours (2.0) for twenty dollars. Sam tim and tom. </p>

<p>Everyone is begging us. Sam smoked his. How much more did the price offers just increase? (not there is less of it). So tim and tom have a &quot;dilema&quot; that is quite profitable. </p>

<p>In this extent Marijuana is the bitcoin. 21.000.000
And the whole worlds population wants a cut. </p>

<p>The whole reason that it will exist is because its a currency to buy assets now. Overstock literally is the answer to why amazon will infact eventually hop on board. The essential situation is now users in india can use coin to buy house hold goods. So now coins = goods. And bitcoin = usd. </p>

<p>Yet every lost coin in general is just adding to the inflation. I really enjoy that feature. Can&#39;t get enough is the expression. (because you can&#39;t literally). There isn&#39;t enough lol ;)</p>
