    <div class="md"><p>this. I expect to be downvoted for this follow up- but all institutions become corrupt. When you combine our entire history and it&#39;s evolution process, the heads of religion, governments, bankers- all at the most corrupt level, all making more and more knowledge more and more occult, you have a world run by elite black magic. Has to do with blood magic and &quot;stealing&quot; other people&#39;s souls and energy. Satanic rituals, process of illumination, yadda yadda, quantum mechanics, yadda yadda. Spacetime really is controlled (at least able to be controlled) by those who illuminate and choose to torture innocent souls for material power. It&#39;s as dark as dark can get really. And most people are oblivious- even more so oblivious to the &quot;magical&quot; side to all of this. Actual control over the &quot;here and now&quot; that this type of ritual abuse and evil power grants. Satan is king of the material world, blood/DNA is sort of a programming language that consciousness &quot;reads&quot; to write spacetime collectively. (Jung was big on his theory of a collective unconscious, and held a high interest in raising kundalini- the &quot;force/ energy&quot; that students of the occult/ enlightenment seek to awaken and incorporate) The more people/ energy/dna you have under your &quot;control&quot; the more collective power you have over reality. The more quantum wave functions you can collapse under your will. Obviously a single comment isn&#39;t nearly enough to go into this, and I wish I could elaborate to solidify and make these reasons more &quot;concrete&quot; (since most people today only believe in a material reality and nothing more, and language can be misleading etc.) There are several sources out there though for learning about how &quot;dark&quot; this shit really is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. Introductory stuff to the idea of a non-material world, you could start with the science delusion by Rupert Sheldrake. Or watch some lectures by prof Michael Persinger. Read about panpsychism.</p>

<p>After that, you could look into some ideas proposed by proponents of electric/plasma and holographic universe theories. Like Wal Thornhill</p>

<p>After that, you could watch some David Icke on what the Gnostics called Archons, forces within the electromagnet spectrum beyond our ability to perceive.</p>

<p>The idea is that things like child murder and dread in general provide the energetic circumstances for these forces to thrive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://mega.nz/#F!AE5yjIqB!y7Vdxdb5pbNsi2O3zyq9KQ">here&#39;s an ebook/ collection of various texts</a> Mostly occult, but you&#39;ve got psychological theories from Jung (collective unconscious, his occult theories, kundalini, religion and occult,) Wilhelm Reich (his sexual theories and energy/orgasm, mass psychology of fascism,) golden dawn ritual, Robert Anton Wilson (Prometheus rising, octave of energy, Illuminati papers,) theosophy (ego, occult chemistry), Animal sacrifice, symbol/ myth/ ritual/ orgasm/ blood, basics of magic, telepathy, etc. Anything specific that you can&#39;t find here I can probably find for you. 
If you want to begin on the more hard science side of this black magic, I would recommend this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzfSPK9eE_E">Joe Rogan experience podcast where he interviews Dr. Amit Goswami.</a> Dr. Goswami is big on his theories of a collective consciousness (many scientists HAVE been and it has been written out of their studies over the course of later history), that all matter comes FROM consciousness, and has written texts on quantum mechanics and taught it for years. I think he really gets how unusual this branch of physics is (because it&#39;s not really physics- we&#39;ve gone so deep that we&#39;re measuring our conscious will&#39;s effect on reality. Quantum mechanics can scientifically explain all &quot;magic&quot; doings- reincarnation, esp, telepathy, jesus&#39; magic tricks, spell magic, kundalini, ancient ritual and rites, the pharoahs, laying on of hands, mind reading, gambling skill, actual sorcery, alchemy, the human soul, etc. Again, Obviously still theories- mathematics equations are needed for proof scientifically, and many physicists are too pessimistic to ever believe or be open to the idea that science and spirit could ever be the same thing- most believe we are somehow separate from the entire rest of the universe and must function differently somehow. I&#39;ve got a TB HD of ebooks (many once actually published and physical) a number of websites, and many physical texts that I can&#39;t share but can recommend.</p>

The closest &quot;exposition and take down&quot; would prophesies of the apocalypse, saviors, and later golden age of man. I would say we need more people on the same level only actually caring about the rest of humanity. These elite control media, they control money, they control governments.

    <div class="md"><p>Should be around 30% of total population has been, or will be abused before 18.  (last I read anyway - and they actually were thinking it was higher)</p>

<p>7.5b * .30 = 2,250,000,000</p>

<p>2.25b abused.</p>

<p>If the ratio is 1 Abuser : 5 Abused (Complete guess, I don&#39;t know the ratio for this)</p>

<p>Then there should be roughly 450,000,000 people alive right now, who have, or will abuse children.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s take the number of arrests you have listed, whilst fully knowing this isn&#39;t the exact amount.</p>

<p>Total =  14252 Arrests (roughly 1.4k was added from UK bust that didn&#39;t specify if all were charged, only said suspected.)</p>

<p>Another 93,000 were listed as &quot;outed&quot;.  (23k from twitter, 70k from a bust with just under 200 actual arrests which were included in the arrest count.)</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s very graciously add 100 million arrests as undocumented here.</p>

<p>There is still roughly 349,985,750 predators they didn&#39;t catch. </p>

<p>To make things more interesting, statistically, there is someone who will, or has abused children in this very thread.   </p>

<p>7.5b / 350m = 21</p>

<p>1/21 people have abused children or will abuse children.</p>

<p>There are 41 comments.</p>

<p>(I think i did that last bit of math right...and also only if the ratio is 1:5)</p>

<p>FTFY. The people busted so far are, at least a large majority of them, small-fries. Essentially scapegoats. I want to hope that this changes, but I&#39;m more of a pessimist by nature v_v</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you can see this post. if its too long, just read this paragraph:::::::::
lemme get this straight. there&#39;s a group thats called &quot;whatever refuge missionary&quot; that&#39;s busted on child trafficking charges (New Life Child Refuge). the leader of the useful idiots in this group denies any wrongdoing and say its a mixup and that they are simply a missionary trying to help haitian orphans.....despite the fact that these orphans have parents and families and they&#39;re caught PAYING for the kids, and that the person representing this leader of this group in Haitian court, Jorge Puello, is later convicted in a completely different country for keeping girls chained up in a house that ended up escaping and wanted in multiple countries including the United States on human trafficking charges, alien smuggling charges, and then the Clintons spring that person from haitian prisons with other DIRECT concrete connections with multiple pieces of evidence already ON OFFICIAL PUBLIC RECORD to billionaire convicted human trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.... This isn&#39;t suspicious at all to you? People have been investigated for far less.</p>

<p>on top of the creepy pictures and pedophillic art.</p>

<p>john podesta didn&#39;t own any creepy statue thats his brother tony podesta, whom also has pedophillic art, which is whatever I guess. sometimes people have weird taste in art, i get that. yet john podesta has deep and old friendships with serial childmolesters, working for a woman who is funded by child pimps, whom he and his brother fits the exactly a POLICE SKETCH of suspects in a child abduction case in Portugal, while staying in the house of pedophile Clement Freud, THAT SAME DAY OF THE ABDUCTION, and correspondence between John and Tony podesta.......while he works for a woman whose husband visted said child pimps orgy island 26 different times, that same woman providing legal and financial support to those being convicted child trafficking charges with legal counsel that is using various fake identies and convicted for child kidnapping and chaining little girls up in a house, in addition to alien smuggling charges and human trafficking in multiple other countries. </p>

<p>If you lack reading comprehension skills, skills of deduction, a short attention span, and a deep trust in human behavior to be morally sound then I can understand why you think this shit sounds crazy. The only thing is that, pedophile and human trafficking rings have always been around, and there have been MANY many times in which these cartels become protected and remain uninvestigated. I&#39;m not saying this is a done deal, there could be reasonable explanations (unlikely) but the fact of the matter is that these things aren&#39;t even being investigated and Jeffrey Epstein got to sign a non-prosecution-agreement, meanwhile other molesters and rapists rot in prison....not him though, hes a billionaire. </p>

<p>.......right. nothing to see here. </p>

<p><strong>tldr; pizzagate i san extremely small and insignificant part of the evidence for an internationsl human trafficking ring that it seems you don&#39;t know much about</strong></p>

<p>you personally seem to be a dramatic saying this is a &quot;witch hunt&quot; while the only thing I&#39;m saying, like other Law Enforcement and National Security personnel are saying, is that there is more than enough circumstantial and digital evidence for an investigation into the various suspects in this matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there isn&#39;t any evidence is what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;ve seen the instagram posts, and there is zero evidence that any child abuse has taken placd at Comet Ping Pong. I see racier stuff on the front page of reddit daily. </p>

<p>I think pizzagate has more to do with propaganda machine Breitbart accusing Podesta and Clinton of being literal demons from the Christian bible than it has anything to do with actual child abuse. I have religious conspiracy nut friends and they are just like this. They go on insane little connect the dot missions looking for religious symbolism at work in real life. One of them told me Apple computers was a satanic organization because an apple is a symbol of the fall. Others insist the makers of Red Bull energy drinks are devil worshippers. Now we have a bunch of these idiots feeling empowered because morons like Bannon and Alex Jones get the nod from the president elect.

<p>I know a gal whose stepfather is a registered sex offender (kids), and she has to sit across the table from him like it&#39;s all fine.  All her family says is &quot;that was a long time ago, he served his time&quot;. Yeah, because I&#39;m so sure that prison cured his pedophilia. He never even told them about it, she just happened to find his name on the local registry when she was scoping out a neighborhood before buying a home. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nassar, 53, will remain jailed on child pornography charges after an FBI agent said at least 37,000 images and videos were discovered in a garbage can outside his home during a search of his property in Holt, Michigan, the Lansing State Journal reported. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People need to understand what it means every time hundreds to thousands of images/tapes are found. Even if we say that there are 100 images of each victim, that is still 370 victims. And chances are it is actually much more.</p>

<p>How are hundreds to thousands (in multiple different cases) of victims identified, yet supposedly nobody catches on until that many children have been abused? How is that? These are children being physically damaged in many cases, yet parents/doctors never notice anything? Are we really to believe it? </p>

<p>And often times, hundreds to thousands of adult predators are found. </p>

<p>Take this case for example: <a href="http://archive.is/rO41Y">http://archive.is/rO41Y</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We discover in 1986 that Michel Felu used the offices of his employer, Joseph Verbeeck, Director of UNICEF Belgium to realize erotic and pornographic photographs of children. The more &quot;soft&quot; of these photos have been published in L&#39;Espoir , the police are required to make excavations at Philippe Carpentier and other members of CRIES. She &quot;discovers that the CRIES hides an international network of pedophiles that affects at least 18 countries&quot;. More than 4000 photos and tapes are seized, involving a hundred children. The images are taken and tours not only in the premises of UNICEF, but also in private apartments in Antwerp or Brussels where parents prostituted their children, and around the world. The lists of members of the CRIES are seized, and searches are carried out, especially in Belgium, the French police being uncooperative. Although all members of the CRIES have not participated in the exchanges and purchases of pictures and movies of child pornography , Philippe Carpentier and Michel Felu were sentenced in 1988 to ten years in prison for organizing the network</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>At least 100 children, at least 18 countries</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/mTEz3">http://archive.is/mTEz3</a></p>

<p><strong>At least 400 names</strong></p>

<p>How many arrests? </p>

<p><strong>JUST TWO</strong></p>

<p>Use your logic here, people. Hundreds to thousands of people are deliberately being left alone every year after it is discovered that they are involved in child sexual abuse and/or trafficking and/or child pornography. Why would authorities not pursue these people? Usually it means that the people identified were in positions of power, and that is why nothing is done.</p>

<p><strong>Hundreds to Thousands</strong> in most cases. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the argument could be made that they are safer in some aspects. But I would argue that the internet has facilitated a place for child abusers to find other child abusers. This type of communication and possibly collaboration was much less probable before the internet.</p>

<p>OP is not really comparing with historical data. I&#39;m pretty sure he/she was just saying that compiling a list and seeing all these stories in one place is eye-opening and shows that it&#39;s not a rare occurrence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Internet also allowed parents greater control of the location of their child etc. The fact that children are much safer today is something that doesn&#39;t need proof. We had 2 World Wars where hundreds of thousands of children died in bombings. 100-200 years ago the pedofile rings were not only larger but completely hidden from public view. Forensic science was in its infancy, rape kits were not invented yet, children had very few protections under the law so their testimony in court meant nothing. Even if you were accused of pedophilia the science was just not there to convict you. Right now if you rape a little girl they will provide evidence that will convict you with 99% certainty. I can go on for hours.  </p>
