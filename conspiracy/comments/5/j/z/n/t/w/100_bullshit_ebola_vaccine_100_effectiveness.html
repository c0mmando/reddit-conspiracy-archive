<p>Research Article: <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)32621-6/fulltext">http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)32621-6/fulltext</a></p>

<p>EDIT: CDC Intelligence - <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/eis/">Epidemic Intelligence Service!</a> Did not even know they fucking existed. </p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>Highlights: 
- The estimated vaccine efficacy here was 100% (95% CI 79·3–100·0, p=0·0033). 
- 5837 individuals in total received the vaccine (5643 adults and 194 children), and all vaccinees were followed up for 84 days. 
- 3149 (53·9%) of 5837 individuals reported at least one adverse event in the 14 days after vaccination; these were typically mild (87·5% of all 7211 adverse events). 
- Headache (1832 [25·4%]), fatigue (1361 [18·9%]), and muscle pain (942 [13·1%]) were the most commonly reported adverse events in this period across all age groups. 
- 80 serious adverse events were identified, of which two were judged to be related to vaccination (one febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one possibly related (influenza-like illness); all three recovered without sequelae.</p>

<p>Feel free to google for articles big pharma biological experimentation, first link to come up from (2013): <a href="https://www.occupycorporatism.com/big-pharma-continues-drug-experiments-in-under-developed-nations-for-profit/">https://www.occupycorporatism.com/big-pharma-continues-drug-experiments-in-under-developed-nations-for-profit/</a></p>

<p>Los Angeles - Measles Vaccine: &quot;A government-sponsored study of two measles vaccines, begun in 1989 during a major U.S. epidemic and conducted on nearly 1,500 minority infants in Los Angeles, failed to disclose to parents that one of the vaccines was experimental, federal health officials said Sunday...&quot; </p>

<p>Just to add: 
1. US and NATO drone warfare is killing more Africans than Ebola. 
2. If Ebola was an actual epidemic in Africa (which it is not), is pumping mystery chemicals the best solution? 
3. In that case, where the HIV vaccine? Been experimenting in Africa for decades now, no vaccine yet. Zilch. Still trying though, practically every month there&#39;s a new &#39;revolutionary HIV vaccine&#39; to be tested. </p>

<p>2014, sudden widespread Ebola epidemic. 2016 (2 years later!!!) Ebola vaccine, it&#39;s 100% effective ... joy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For polio, I believe the main factor is the fact that attitudes towards breastfeeding have changed significantly.</p>

<p>From the early to mid part of the 20th Century, breastfeeding was considered &#39;dirty&#39;.</p>

<p>Breastmilk contains crucial stem cells and nutrients, so if babies are deprived of this, then inevitably it causes problems.</p>

<p>There is also a rumour that the CDC deliberately changed the definition of what would be listed as polio, so that fewer cases were recorded, I haven&#39;t been able to find a direct quotation on this however. All I have is <a href="http://www.thevaccinereaction.org/2015/07/polio-wasnt-vanquished-it-was-redefined/#_edn1">this.</a></p>

<p>Measles deaths were decreasing before the introduction of a <a href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/189/Supplement_1/S1.long">vaccine.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the late 1950s, even before the introduction of measles vaccine, measles-related deaths and case fatality rates in the United States had decreased markedly, presumably as a result of improvement in health care and nutrition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vaccine was in development for a long time, but they recived minimal funding.<br/>
In 2015, a white person got infected with Ebola, which caused a huge increase in research funds.<br/>
In only one year of research, a cure got found thanks to the massive monetary investments.<br/>
AIDS is different - it &quot;stealths&quot; itself by mutating it&#39;s surface structure,  which hampers any efforts to develop a vaccine.<br/>
There is still a lot of progress made in HIV-Treatments since the eighties, and if you detect it very early, you can even cure it.<br/>
Of course there is also a possibility of a secret cure existing that only rich people get (like magic johnson) , but I personally don&#39;t believe that.</p>
