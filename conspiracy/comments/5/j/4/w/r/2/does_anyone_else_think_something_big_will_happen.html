I&#39;ve never felt this before in my life except one time.... Out of body, numbness? I cannot explain it. Truly a weird feeling. The only thing that compares is when I was stricken sick, when my grand pops was dying. I suffered unexplained chess pains (14 year old), he 79. He died, and my chess pain was lifted the night of.... </p>

<p>About a month ago I felt this sharp pain in my right knee and had this gut feeling I was about to lose my job. I would tell the owner (my friend) all the time the second he was vulnerable his business partner would fire me. I texted him that night and told him that i had this feeling- called me crazy, dramatic told me to go to bed and he&#39;d see me at work- asked him if his knee was bothering he said he had a drs appt. I&#39;m the morning.</p>

<p>At 10:15 he had surgery at 10:25 his partner fired me. We know when we know </p>

I told my friend I was going to get fired, Went into work at 9, did my job, ~10 am came along: We&#39;re going to have to let you go. Called my buddy: &quot;Dude, how the fuck did you know&quot;. Me: I just knew, felt it and knew it. I did nothing wrong, and they wanted to keep me on board as a &quot;freelancer&quot;.. Suck my dick, bitches.. </p>

<p>Curious, I know people will see this whacky, but, have you had any spiritual encounters in your years? Shit you cannot explain, but may have affected your area of &quot;awareness&quot;. Like I said, mine in the left side... </p>

<p>Edit - like a couple of yous, I&#39;ve always had issues controlling empathy; If I don&#39;t have change I have to cross the road when I see homeless people as it bothers me immensely to feel their pain, can&#39;t watch people making fools of themselves or being hurt without feeling it too, always been able to sense <em>vibes</em> from people essentially..
The middle finger in my right hand has been numb for the past 2 months - on and off- went to the doctor - nothing. Didn&#39;t think any of it till I read through this thread ..The sense of unease is very strong at times but has been culminating recently to extremes. I think it&#39;s more a shift, a change in collective consciousness, as opposed to anything negative. 
We are living in interesting times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given that we&#39;ve experienced 911, the only thing bigger than &quot;something our generations haven&#39;t experienced&quot; would be either a fake alien invasion or WWIII.</p>

<p>And do I think anything like that will happen?</p>

<p>Well, I think it&#39;s a possibility.  I mean I know TPTB would absolutely <em>love</em> either (or both) of those options to happen.  However, the 99% is getting smarter and smarter every day w/the internet, and is catching on to TPTB&#39;s lies and machinations faster and faster, and reading through the lies and false flags a lot quicker than TPTB I think anticipated would be the case...so there&#39;s actually a growing counter movement against them going on that could possibly prevent anything &quot;big&quot; of the <em>nefarious</em> sort from happening.</p>

<p>Something &quot;big&quot; and momentous might happen of the <em>positive</em> sort - a REAL and <em>not</em> fake mass ET contact that&#39;s undeniable.  Not saying this <em>will</em> happen, but it&#39;s a possibility if we wake up enough as a citizenry and species.</p>

<p>The negative scenarios seem more likely than the positive ones to happen, but - again - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite as easy for TPTB to keep their chicanery up now as it was, say, in the early 2000s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Main good guy aliens site says there&#39;s a high chance of &#39;the event&#39; happening in the first half of 2017, or the dimensional shift spiritual people keep going on about. I&#39;m an alien contactee that&#39;s tortured daily with directed energy weapons mainly for being into alien shit and heavy meditation so I really think there&#39;s something to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I astral projected and saw Silver Legion once, thousands of clear beings spiraling around red spheres one came through like a frequency barrier, turned into a very beautiful human like being and stared and smiled at me for a few seconds. Their site has lot of cool info: <a href="http://www.silverlegion.org/Updates-and-Changelog.html">http://www.silverlegion.org/Updates-and-Changelog.html</a></p>

<p>Also there&#39;s a global meditation every Sunday 4pm GMT always looking for more to join! Here are the instructions: <a href="http://2012portal.blogspot.com/2016/08/make-this-viral-weekly-ascension.html">http://2012portal.blogspot.com/2016/08/make-this-viral-weekly-ascension.html</a></p>

<p>edit: I believe a mass awakening is inevitable at this point and TPTB are pulling out all their stops because of this so many are freaking out and naturally think that something major and negative is going to happen because we&#39;re so used to it but I think people are underestimating the power they have to co-create our reality and if we really wanted, this change can be a positive thing and I see many pushing for a positive change. Nordic alien told me don&#39;t let the fear get to you, it&#39;s all an illusion so just laugh at their pity attempts and keep fighting the good fight :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a bunch of small gnawing pains until someone-- maybe a suicidal and impressionable US twentysomething (doesn&#39;t it suck that places like this online have created the perfect open channel for psycho recruitment at home and abroad? How the fuck do we really address this?) or a butthurt fascist leader or two-- lashes out. We&#39;ll suffer till then and then suffer further. Can&#39;t say our pending leaders in the US and EU even project the appearance of smart or compassionate. Everything is reactionary now. Maybe we nuke the middle east? Maybe someone pisses off China? Maybe Putin gets bold and does something we all can actually agree is fucked up and wrong? I don&#39;t know. Human rights will be first things to go. It might not even take that much. We&#39;ve already been forced to choose sides, debate reality and fact. Ideology clouds the day to day, extremists come out of the woodwork. I will fight for each of you, in my way. Common ground is attainable, even currently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I think there is a major event every 10-15 years. There are events where everyone remembers exactly where they were when shit went down, almost like they are entered into the collective memory.</p>

<p>If you start with The Kennedy assasination...1962 +7  </p>

<p>1969 - Apollo 11 landing +13. </p>

<p>1982 - Reagan is shot +4. </p>

<p>1986 - Challenger explosion +15  </p>

<p>2001 - World Trade center attack +15 </p>

<p>2016 ??  </p>

<p>Something is due because I&#39;m not sure we can say the election is that big event yet. I think most of us will remember where we were the night Trump was elected...but then again we would probably remember it as well if Clinton was elected. The election night itself was the important event, not so much the individuals running?</p>
