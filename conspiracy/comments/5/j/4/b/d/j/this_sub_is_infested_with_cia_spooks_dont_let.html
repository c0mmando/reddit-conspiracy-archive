       I'm sure I'm not the only one who is seeing an increase of demoralizing responses to really innocuous posts or comments on this sub.

      <p>
       This is a reminder to not respond to those comments and to downvote appropriately to anyone not adding value or trying to derail the conversation.

       We are the white hats of this society. Hang in there and continue to be brave. I truly believe the Cabal is in their death throes, so don't be discouraged. We are going to win this thing once and for all and we know it based on their desperation.

       Just learned about these peoples headquartered there. Maybe they spend a lot of time trying to move opinions on reddit? But I haven't looked in to it all that much so don't take my word for it. Wikipedia goes in to their alleged involvement in freemasonry and new world order shit.... TIL!

       Honestly, if the CIA were posting fake information on Reddit, they would probably be posting from Camp Perry.  If it were the Military, it would probably be from MacDill or Ft. Bragg.

       Yep, because anyone who disagrees with you must be a government agent who trolls the internet to discredit conspiracy theorists.  This may shock you to learn but neither the CIA, FBI, nor the Military care about what you think.  They have more important people with whom to deal.  People with guns and bomb and the training and organization to be able to use those weapons to kill innocent people.  Until you fall into that category, no security organization will care about whatever random insight that you think you have stumbled upon.  For them, you are nothing more than a sideshow for the press and people who want to gawk so they can feel better about themselves (e.g. at least I'm not those people.)  The only reason why  the theories on here have gained attention lately is because someone showed up at a neighborhood pizzeria and started shooting.  As you can imagine, this upset a lot of people.
      </p>

       Personally, I read this subreddit in hopes that I can disuade people from taking similar action.  Something which until recently I assumed wasn't necessary.  And no, I don't get paid to do it.

       Again, see my reply to another post on this thread, but we're on the same side fam (you too u/mrsnakers ).  The line I quoted is something I see fairly often and it lets me know that the writer is some manner of shill or plant or is just dumb AF.  Either way, no CIA here.

       I'm sorry, fam, I think we're on the same side.  I'm certainly not CIA (yes, I know that's what a CIA agent would say lol)

       Of course TPTB care what we think. They understand how influence spreads as well as anyone.  Ideas are much easier to suppress before they hit a certain threshold of awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Nobody cares about you" is the same BS excuse they use when they try to undermine encryption and privacy, too.  Of course they care.  Orwell wasn't f--king around; we may all be proles, but don't forget that the Thought Police took care of any prole that was getting too influential.

       True, but how many have overthrown democratic governments like 60+ times? The CIA should be at the top of that list, because, in case you haven't noticed, they are the Cabal's secret, silent army.

      <p>
       I share this fear (or vigilance) as I do suspect that anyone bringing up and/or associating some credible conspiracy theory with: (i) shape-shifting entities, (ii) reptilians, (iv)alien ghosts, (v) the Knights
       <em>
        Templar

       was not referencing any of these Plausibility Bombs, and was merely mentioning the affiliation or connection by many of the CIA to Jesuits and/or the Order of Malta, each of which are above-board groups respected in society, yet each have histories which call into question their stated motivations/goals, or that suggest their possible role in crimes/assassinations.

       I have an issue with this regarding witchcraft. The Cabal are basically evil occult freaks that believe and practice witchcraft (spirit cooking, anyone?) and are dripping in occult and satanic symbolism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having a value judgement on where the evidence takes you (not aliens! Not witches!) closes off investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand wanting this sub to stick to the facts and not get detailed by far fetched theories. I disagree on not following evidence regardless of if it leads to the fringe.

       I think you are trying to argue that the Jesuits and Knights of Malta (Cabal) are actually online as a propaganda machine, when I made it pretty clear in my initial post that the CIA is the working arm of the Cabal.

       1.)  What you are seeing as "CIA" is a many nefarious groups and people.

       2.)  If you want to talk about he CIA, he has pointed you towards the agenda of an Order of the Church, which he believes plays a large role in the agency.

       Sometimes they do. But it didn't used to be like this 5-7 years ago. People used to be able to have more honest conversation, but now you say anything and there's a thousand haters nipping at your heels at every turn. Seems little positive conversation happens now, mostly just fighting and derailing and nonsense disinfo theories. It's proven there are teams of people doing these things, especially on this subreddit, so it's not paranoia to suspect it might be happening to you.

       It's hard to tell if it is agents, or just conspiracy morons. The fact is no one here ever talks about CIA overthrowing democratically elected  governments or rigging other nations elections or having revolutionary leaders killed. Real conspiracies are never mentioned but there are 10 posts on every page about pizzagate. I have seen this happening for years too, reptilians, birthers, masons the queen is a pedophile etc. It's always just moronic conspiracies getting discussed here. The real actual bad stuff the government really does is rarely ever spoken about.

       The US (and many other) Govt/s
       <em>
        have been controlled
       </em>
       by a 'shadow government' aka "a Cabal" for nearly 200yrs now, with the "original cabal" being a group of very wealthy (banking and industrial) families, i.e. the Rothschilds, Rockerfellers and Co, who 'financed' many wars and manipulated countries political situations with their 'paid thugs' as "War is their Racket" and how they make money from ALL involved and some who aren't!
      </p>
      <p>
       As General Smedley Butler, the highest decorated marine
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       said in a book he wrote upon retiring and followed it up with speaking tours;
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         “I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle-man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.”
― Smedley D. Butler

         Origins of the word CABAL:
        </p>
        <p>
         The term cabal derives from Cabala (a word that has numerous spelling variations), the Jewish mystical interpretation of the Hebrew scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Hebrew it means "reception" or "tradition", denoting the sod (secret) level of Jewish exegesis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Plenty of 'secrets' with this mob!? Check! Jewish connections everywhere you look? Check!
        </p>
        <p>
         In European culture (Christian Cabala, Hermetic Qabalah) it became associated with occult doctrine or a secret,
        </p>
        <p>
         And right now we're seeing their demonic child abuse come out from the shadows
         <em>
          once again
         </em>
         ... something
         <em>
          they once could hide quite easily

         <a href="http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/revolution/open-internet-key-new-world-protect-holy-grail/">
          Now, the Internet has allowed for the massive disssemination of knowledge and Truth
         </a>
         ,  with the Internet 'teaching' many people things they never knew or even imagined!

         Myself and
         <em>
          many people have been waiting for this day
         </em>
         , a day when they
         <em>
          would be able to
         </em>
         communicate in Real Time to people across the planet about the 'things that really matter'
         <em>

         to "The Library of the World" (online access) at their fingertips.
        </p>
        <p>
         These two things combined are a natural recipe for the 'Truth' to come out, as "the Truth is True, it doesn't, cannot "change", No amount of 'bullshit or fake anythings' are able to smother it, as we are beginning to see!

         <em>
          possibility
         </em>
         (aka "plausible deniability") that 'the news

         is quite possibly speaking of things "Untrue" or "Fake"  (

         <em>
          the only way

         'the accused' can
         <em>
          attempt to

         "plausibly deny everything and detach themselves  from the Truth", by (desperately) claiming "all

          that news
         </em>
         " is
         <em>
          "likely to be Fake" so they can Deny, deny and deny a bit moah that *all this talk

         about fast food and hankies has
         <em>
          absolutely nothing to do with 'them

        <p>
         The question we need to be asking Now is; "WTF do we 'do' with the people in positions of 'Power' i.e. Hitlary If/when
         <em>
          they get 'caught'

       The so-called Jews who are VASTLY disproportionately represented in media, higher education government and banking. Look up the background of every reporter out there pushing hard for globalism and against anything resembling decency and justice, and by and large you will find Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing, though. They're not even real Jews like the ones in the Bible. They're just a group of eastern Europeans who claimed the title out of nowhere to capitalize on the history and have since been pitting nation against nation and financing both sides of wars while they amass vast wealth. Also, they wantonly murder Arabs in their stolen land and trick Christians into financing it.

       While it is a fact that shills are paid by multiple parties to be on here, I personally know that many people are so set in their propagandised convictions that they will argue to the point of hysteria to defend their worldview. Since it's impossible to know whos who, just keep it short and succinct when you disagree. One or two sentences should tell you whether they are open to discussion, or are just parroting.

       "Self appointed guardians of the status quo"
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason the CIA can get away with astroturfing is that there are real people like them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accusing
       <em>
        real people
       </em>
       who are just blindly set in their ways of being "CIA shills" will only validate their desired confirmation bias and set them deeper into their ways. They will simply see the accuser as a paranoid conspiracy theorist, as they are taught to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even worse, is that these threads are all archived. They never go away. If someone
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       get curious about a particular conspiracy theory, a google search for it will likely turn up a thread here if there is a relevant one. We are influencing far more people than just the ones who post or upvote, is my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if they search and end up in a thread, they will likely read the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they had a question or doubt about the theory, it's likely there was a comment about their doubt. If the response to the questioning comment is to accuse the person of being a shill, then they will definitely not be convinced.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing to do is to just respond to any arguments logically until there is no logic to be given. Just post the information and accept shills and self appointed guardians and their madness and ignore it to the best of your ability while still keeping the information organized and available.
      </p>
      <p>
       It truly is an information war. They will post fake information, you must debunk it. They will try and debunk your information, you must defend it logically. When information is not on their side, they will focus on how it is framed.

       Not a good way to get hired by the CIA, but if you really want to shill, I've heard CTR is easy.  A number of posters on The_Donald claimed to have joined CTR for the lulz.  I don't know if they actually did it, or if the lulz were just for claiming it, but hey...  That's what I've got for you.

       Most shills are actually on the nsa payroll. cia are the ones that will try to kill you.
      </p>
      <p>
       First they will try to put a few bullet in you. If that fail they will try to run you over. If that fail, they'll try to frame you with a terrorists attack via IED. If that fail, and you live in an apartment, they'll try to gas you. If they can't gas you they'll try to run you over again. If that fail they'll use drones/gunships. When they have exhausted their resources, they will get silly.

       Again, see my reply to another post on this thread, but we're on the same side fam (you too u/mrsnakers ).  The line I quoted is something I see fairly often and it lets me know that the writer is some manner of shill or plant or is just dumb AF.  Either way, no CIA here.
