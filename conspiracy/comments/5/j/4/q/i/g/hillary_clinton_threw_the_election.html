       Just wondering, because I haven't seen it discussed literally whatsoever. Is it at all possible that Hillary Clinton purposely threw this election? Before you dismiss, doesn't it seem odd that a career politician and so many people we thought were aligned with her, slipped up and "exposed" themselves so often leading up to the election? I mean, as someone who became very interested in politics for the first time this past election cycle and tried to look at everything objectively, it seems like almost everything she did from the primaries to election day worked to alienate, disenfranchise, or build a false sense of security in enough people to allow Trump to win (and possibly carry out her/the elites agenda) much more easily than she ever could have in office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclaimer: I'm not saying I believe these things to be true, I just think it's odd that no one has contemplated this possibility before. What I'm looking for is a discussion on the possibility. This subreddit seems to have been flooded with people that are seemingly obsessed with these DNC conspiracy theories that are lacking on hard evidence. Well, what if it's all a rouse to get the conspiracy theorists (those of us who would actually put the time and effort into exposing something like this) looking the wrong way? Meanwhile you have a public that either blindly supports Trump (and is seemingly unwilling to question anything he does), aggressively opposes Trump (who are made out to be "liberal babies" who are just whining because their side did not win), or those that are so fed up with all of this that they've stopped paying attention a long time ago. Isn't that exactly what these elitists would want? A public that has given up, or is too busy fighting with each other that they don't see what's really going on? Anyway, I'm relatively new to all this and I figured I'd let you all weigh in. Peace &amp; Blessin's

       Hubris, bro.  Hubris.  After sooo many years of getting away with the absolute worst, most despicable criminality, I can tell you that the

       Yeah, I mean that seems to be the general consensus (and the most logical explanation) as to what happened (to everyone except those in the DNC who's heads are too far up their own asses in thinking that they don't need to change). I am looking to entertain the idea, and discuss, the possibility that it was not hubris on the part of Hillary and the DNC! Rather, that perhaps this illusion of hubris was all part of the plan.

       Part of what plan?  To have Clinton throw the election?  Why?  To put Donald Trump in?  Why?  So that the public could put its guard down thinking
       <a href="http://www.clipartbest.com/cliparts/Rid/g8G/Ridg8Ga6T.jpeg">
        "The people finally won!"
       </a>
       or whatever tf and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       TPTB can swoop in and use DT to put in even worse legislation than Clinton would have?  I mean...I don't understand why TPTB would have wanted Clinton
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to get in.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no...I didn't actually read what you posted under your OP.  Gonna do that now.  Maybe you answered all this there.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Just read everything.  First and foremost, let me say that I don't like Trump, but I
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       don't like Clinton - so I'm glad she didn't get in.  That said, I think TPTB might have been able to control the masses better w/Clinton in because she could have put everyone to sleep a bit more.  Trump - though he might raise racial tensions and cause a civil war in the US - might also cause people to "gun the fuck up" a lot more and stir some vinegar in folks enough to not stand for the establishment's b.s.  Clinton would have
       <em>
        taken
       </em>
       those guns - which TPTB are absolutely salivating to make happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think TPTB absolutely wanted Clinton to get in, and the leaks fucked up their whole plan and they're still scrambling hard as hell right now to STILL somehow get that bitch in office actually (smfh).

       I think it's possible that whoever is in the white house will preside over the biggest economic crash the world has ever seen.  In this regard, I suppose it's possible Hillary potentially threw the election.

       Yeah,  i can totally see it.  In fact,  i don't know how i didn't see it.  They propped Trump in the media from the beginning.  Then they rigged the primaries so Hillary had to be against him.  But then she literally had the worst presidential campaign of all time. Before the election people were saying the Republican party was over.  Now it looks like the dems are over.  At least for another 8 years.

       lol I would argue the opposite actually. Hillary (or some higher power) is still running the show and donald is still the plant. See Hillary has been championing certain issues that don't necessarily make it easy for her to carry out her true objectives. All these lobbyists/ceo's/1% who she would have been catering to all while trying to put up this facade to the public that she was not, well donald can just blatently get away with it apparently. He doesn't need to hide it, he can just appoint these people to his cabinet and cut out all the bullshit of trying to make it seem as though they care about the common people.

       They're both "plants". The debates made that obvious. Obviously Clinton &amp; Trump are good friends. The elites decided to troll everyone selecting Drumpfft with this odd election.

       The popular/electoral split was planned long before the election. Both Trump &amp; Hillary knew. Things could be interesting soon. Once Americans know some of these electors are community college freshmen, it may be time to revisit the electoral college &amp; change the system.

       That would be wild. I doubt it tho, for a number of reasons: a, I don't think enough electoral college voters have the balls to not vote for donald, and b, if my theory were correct, having the electoral college voters deviate from the vote would go against their plan of disenfranchising the masses.

       This is not Lincolin's America where the electoral college is well known and open; The electoral college today is filled with degenerates, nobodies and yahoos that nobody can seem to name or know where they are from and they are electing presidents in a black room.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is an unprecedented pressure from intelligence agencies like the CIA and FBI to force the electoral college into electing Hillary. In short words, the intelligence agencies blackmail these yahoos and nobodies to declare trump the loser and Hillary the winner.

       Gotcha. Well I think you're a bit too hopeful in your doomsday predictions (no offense). If this is being orchestrated from above, then wouldn't the elites want to disenfranchise us, make us lose hope, and have us fighting against each other rather than for each other? I suppose a war would do good in ridding the common folk in mass, but war has gotten too messy nowadays; it's only reserved to places we (most Americans) don't feel any sort of attachment to (the middle east)

       It seems more likely to me (especially now so that the EC vote went smoothly) that now is when we enter the period of submission. The right is smug and happy and unwilling to question donald or his motives, and the left has lost their hope/will to fight any longer. Which, would be in line with my theory as donald is able to effortlessly appoint heads of special interest groups to departments which prevented them from implementing their plans to further cripple the masses and increase the wealth gap.

       Yeah, I mean that seems to be the general consensus (and the most logical explanation) as to what happened (to everyone except those in the DNC who's heads are too far up their own asses in thinking that they don't need to change). I am looking to entertain the idea, and discuss, the possibility that it was not hubris on the part of Hillary and the DNC! Rather, that perhaps this illusion of hubris was all part of the plan.
