       I'm trying to get traction for this story of a Washington D.C.  ritual child abuse ring in the 1980's and 90's tied to the  GHW Bush CIA. and a group called the Finders.
  Early fuckery in the downvotes made it obscure. It may have too many actual places and names for reddit.

       Indian Boarding schools.  It is well known that the Natives kidnapped and forced to attend the residential schools were raped and tortured into the 80s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a report from
       <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/node/87342">
        Amnesty International
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A 2001 report by the Truth Commission into Genocide in Canada documents the responsibility of the Roman Catholic Church, the United Church of Canada, the Anglican Church of Canada, and the federal government in the deaths of more than 50,000 Native children in the Canadian residential school system.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The report says church officials killed children by beating, poisoning, electric shock, starvation, prolonged exposure to sub-zero cold while naked, and medical experimentation, including the removal of organs and radiation exposure.
        </strong>
        In 1928 Alberta passed legislation allowing school officials to forcibly sterilize Native girls; British Columbia followed suit in 1933. There is no accurate toll of forced sterilizations because
        <strong>
         hospital staff destroyed records in 1995 after police launched an investigation.
        </strong>
        But according to the testimony of a nurse in Alberta, doctors sterilized entire groups of Native children when they reached puberty.
        <strong>
         The report also says that Canadian clergy, police, and business and government officials "rented out" children from residential schools to pedophile rings.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you research it you will find more testimony and there has been at least one law suit filed in the US but you're never going to see any media touch that one, ever.  As far as I know there aren't any allegations that this was cult/satanic worship but the details of the abuse including murdering newborns from raped children are similar to other victim statements.

       Jimmy Savile is a great place to start when you explain this topic to people for the first time. He was good friends with the royal family, which means that British intelligence kept tabs on him, but somehow he got away with raping kids for DECADES.  The government knew, the police knew, the BBC knew... But he was protected because he was probably a child PROCURER for the elite.

       It would be awesome if someone created a short video of all of the historical global pedophile rings and activity by country so we could see the big picture better.  Kind of like those progression videos showing the glacial melting due to climate change:

       The
       <strong>
        UK home children scandal
       </strong>
       . The UK and Australia
       <strong>
        officially apologized
       </strong>
       for taking children, telling them they were orphans, and shipping them to Australia to add British stock to the population. Thousands of children were put in labor camps and many were sexually abused. The whole program was secret for about 100 years ending in 1979. Most of it happened after WWII.

       The Zandvoort CD-ROM affair.
      </p>
      <p>
       CDs with pictures/videos of young kids and c.p. were found in a Zandvoort apartment who belonged to Gerrit Ulrich. He was a member of a pedophile network and sold these CDs to clients. Footage of children having sex with animals and babies being raped by adults were found on those tapes. Gerrit was killed a few months after these cds were found.
      </p>
      <p>
       81 families recognized their missing children on these CDs. Copies were sent to Belgian, Dutch and French justice but nothing ever happened. They either disappeared or judges never received them.

       <em>
        background evidence,

       I don't think "evidence" is the right term here. You're looking more for "background information" or "contextual information".

        Here
       </a>
       is a link to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy in which the phrase “background evidence” is used. “Background evidence” means something roughly like “facts that raise the prior probability that a thing being alleged
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       happen, by showing that it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       happen, and therefore increasing the plausibility—to whatever extent—that it could have happened in this particular case.” The phrase probably feels out of place to you because you’re thinking of “evidence” as meaning something much closer to “proof,” but that’s not actually what the word “evidence” means. For example, if we know that a man molested every child he had prior to this one, that doesn’t
       <em>
        prove
       </em>
       that he molested this one. In the strong sense of the word “evidence” your criticism is implying, you could say that that doesn’t count as “evidence” one way or another. But it does, and we would absolutely be interested in knowing that in a court of law, and specifically it would count as “background evidence” that raises the prior probability that the claim that he molested this child could be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       To continue the analogy, here’s what background evidence does: if we know the man has molested all of his previous children, then we are justified to give
       <em>
        increased weight
       </em>
       to whatever direct evidence exists indicating he may have molested this one. If we know the man has never molested a previous child, then we are justified to give
       <em>
        less weight
       </em>
       to whatever direct evidence exists indicating he may have molested this one. On the other hand, if we knew the child had a history of lying for various reasons, that wouldn’t prove they were lying for those reasons this time too, but it would count as “
       <em>
        background evidence
       </em>
       ”:
       <em>
        relatively
       </em>
       speaking, it would cause us to give
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       evidentiary weight to the child’s statements alone, if those were all we had as evidence. If the father also molested every child he had previously, those two pieces of background evidence would basically cancel out. But if we knew the father had never molested any previous child (background evidence),
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       we knew the child had a strong history of lying about similar claims (background evidence), then the two facts put together would suddenly become enough to make a pretty compelling legal argument all by themselves, even though they have
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to do with the specific facts at stake in this specific case, and they do
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to deductively refute whatever claims against the father the child might have made. In the real world, we often don’t have access to the kind of information we would need to deductively prove or refute things one way or another, so background evidence is sometimes the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       evidence we have to go on, and it is in fact defined as a form of evidence (again, in court, if you knew that the child had previously made very similar lies and that the father had never molested a previous child, you would submit that information to the court “as evidence”).
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, “background evidence” is the correct term. Whether or not we know high–level sex rings exist, and whether or now we know that they get cover up, influences how we ought to evaluate the evidentiary relevance of things we do or do not know when it comes to Pizzagate in particular. You might find similarities between the way people respond, or in the particular people taking the effort to respond, to Pizzagate and the way coverups of other cases took place. For instance, if someone we now know was very active in denying allegations about a case that later turned out to be true is doing the same in Pizzagate (and for instance, Mark Thompson of the BBC
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       credibly accused of helping cover up the Savile scandal, and now runs the NYT), then we have evidence in the form of recognizing that what’s in front of us
       <em>
        fits a certain pattern
       </em>
       . Previous cases establish the ‘patterns’ that take place when one thing or another happen, and therefore influence how we ought to interpret the patterns we see in front of us in a given case, and therefore literally qualify as “evidence,” which is why “background evidence” is a phrase with a meaning and a definition that is used in contexts like these. Because this is precisely what it means.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, do high–level sex trafficking rings or organized forms of pedophilia exist in upper levels of government? How prevalent does it appear to be? As best we can tell, how many of them are there? How do things tend to go at first when they’re exposed? Can we confirm with prior evidence that they can be and are successfully covered up? All of this
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       influences the
       <em>
        likelihood
       </em>
       that Pizzagate could be on to something. The more prevalent these things are, the less overwhelming the direct evidence needs to be to justify concern. The less prevalent they are, the more overwhelming it needs to be. Just like the history of how many previous children a man has molested influences how we evaluate the evidence at play when someone claims he’s molesting this one: if he’s never done anything of the sort, you’re going to need a lot of evidence before you take the accusation seriously. If you know that he’s even had a history of glancing at child porn, the more of that kind of background evidence you get, the less direct evidence you need to say that the accusation that he molested this child should be taken seriously.

       courtesy posting from my friend Knight .. who sez this.... Some sample quotes. The children were unaware of the functions of telephones, television and toilets, and stated that they were not allowed to live indoors and were only given food as a reward. ... Could they be the "green sows" in the pizzagate farm map? ... A photo album contained a series of photos of adults and children dressed in white sheets participating in a blood ritual. The ritual centered around the execution of at least two goats. The photos portrayed the execution, disembowelment, skinning and dismemberment of the goats at the hands of the children. This included the removal of the testes of a male goat, the discovery of a female goat's "womb" and the "baby goats" inside the womb, and the presentation of the goat's head to one of the children. ... There was also a large amount of data collected on various child care organizations. ... The warehouse contained a large library, two kitchens, a sauna, hot tub and a 'video room.' The video room seemed to be set up as an indoctrination center. The organization had the ability to produce its own videos. There appeared to be training areas for the children and what appeared to be an altar set up in a residential area of the warehouse. Many jars of urine and feces were located in this area.

       that's a deep question-i'm not sure people that do this can question their motives (being demon-ridden) which calls to question how culpable they are.  i'm thinking they compete to see how "strong" they can be.
