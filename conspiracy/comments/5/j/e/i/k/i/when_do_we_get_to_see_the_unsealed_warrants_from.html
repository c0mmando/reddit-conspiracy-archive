    <div class="md"><p>wow.  I mean they redacted some stuff that should probably not be as far as I can tell b/c you can read into it.  But what I&#39;m reading from it is that this argument could be used to obtain a warrant for ANY device that had been used to send email through ANY account on ANY of Clinton&#39;s servers.  This is a general and broad determination and while it needed to be investigated, the only reason you would state that a presidential candidate is suspect due to this is if you believe you have found something.  Yet, nothing that I can see in the document suggests that they have found anything other than a device that was used to send emails through and account on one or more of Clinton&#39;s servers.</p>

<p>Edit: Update - can someone please tell me I&#39;m wrong?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probable cause is not a tremendously difficult standard to meet.  The FBI told the court essentially &quot;in the course of investigating improper storage or transfer of classified information, we&#39;ve come across many emails with similar to/from/subject line metadata which ended up containing classified information.  We would like to search the body of the emails contained on this computer to see if any of them contain classified information.&quot;  That is pretty much good enough to have a judge sign off on the warrant.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right but what I see here is an argument that we know there are emails there because we know that we have the one side of the conversation.  And therefore we need to go in to this laptop and secure it and purge any classified info.  The notion that there is NEW information is not even addressed and that is where it seems extraordinary to me that Comey felt the need to address this publicly.  </p>

<p>This device is like all of the others in the investigation, they didn&#39;t find new things, they found the same emails depending on who sent or received them.</p>

<p>The extraordinary part is that Comey felt the need to bring this up.  If this is simply the client side of one of the email chains that they already had info on, then it is not new info.  It is simply the client side version of some of the emails.  The only way this rises to the level that it should be mentioned as it was, is if there was a good chance that there were NEW emails.  Since they hadn&#39;t even reviewed the data at the time of Comey&#39;s announcement, it&#39;s unlikely he had any evidence to substantiate his apparent belief.</p>

<p>You are right, the warrant is completely valid.  The announcements before the election were a partisan move, that may be passable on a technicality.  The implication that new Clinton email CONTENTS were found was not supported by any information that Comey had at the time or has learned since.</p>
