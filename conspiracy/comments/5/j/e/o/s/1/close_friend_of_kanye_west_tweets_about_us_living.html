Best bet, think about the moment (stay in the now) since fear only exists in the future and you can be at peace now. By doing this, you alter your future to a more pleasant one. Just a tip!

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. I will answer briefly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve recently began to read the Bible, starting off with the Book of Rev., then beginning from Genesis and thereafter, to get a better understanding of the book in it&#39;s entirety. I soon realised that the many things the Bible mentions are not literal but rather metaphorical, especially in rev. </p>

<p>Example: <strong>Rev. 9, 3:4</strong> <em>&quot;And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.&quot;</em></p>

<p>In this case, the word <strong>grass</strong> represents people. This can be proven and confirmed in <strong>Isaiah 40 6:7</strong> - <em>&quot;All people are like grass,
    and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field. The grass withers and the flowers fall,
    because the breath of the Lord blows on them.
    Surely the people are grass.</em></p>

<p>So the grass represents God&#39;s people, not literal plant life. Once you reread the verse with this realisation, then it makes more sense.</p>

<p>The video narrator took it as literal and completely missed the point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s completely wrong in everything he says, but after studying the Bible for myself, I have become more skeptical to these types of videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem just as certain as those you claim to be missing the point with their certainty. Not to be skeptical to the point of cynicism - but if the people are the grass, as you say is the correct interpretation, why does it go on to say &quot;or any plant or tree&quot;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wondered about that too. I don&#39;t have a definite answer for you but based on the previous verse I mentioned before (Isaiah 40 6:7), I would think that plant or tree represents something other than its literal meaning. </p>

<p><em>&quot;All people are like grass,
    and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field.&quot;</em></p>

<p>If grass = God&#39;s people and flower = faithfulness, then I think it would be safe to assume that plant or tree may represent something of similar nature. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes same video. Like I said, I am not claiming his analogies are completely wrong, but I would take what he says with a grain of salt. </p>

<p>I believe everything in the book of Rev. is meant to have an effect on a global scale and the consequences are to affect everyone to a certain degree. </p>

<p>Like many people, he mentions specific events pertaining to a specific part of the world at a specific time in history, yet none of these events are worthy enough to usher in the end times that many people believe we are in. They are so small and so far apart in comparison to the epicness of the book of Rev. that I find it difficult to take many things he says seriously. </p>

<p>EDIT: wording</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is that no one knows for certain the real date of Jesus&#39; birth. It almost certainly wouldn&#39;t have been December 25, as it happened while the Romans were conducting a census and they wouldn&#39;t be doing that in the middle of winter in those times.</p>

<p>It ultimately doesn&#39;t matter though. What matters is that we do celebrate Jesus birth and that celebration takes place on December 25.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So happy seeing someone else mention The Age of Aquarius!! 
Also!! I thought this was important as well; </p>

<p>&quot;Right now, we are all experiencing Pluto in Capricorn (from 2008 through 2023) which means that we will see many things collapse, such as money, religion and government, but these changes will present an opportunity for everything to be rebuilt in humanity’s best interests. </p>

<p>Pluto is known as the “Destroyer” and will relentlessly throw challenges into your face until you learn why specific things seem to continuously happen to you (and all of us). Right on schedule in 2008, when Pluto entered Capricorn, we saw a massive banking collapse. Since 2008, we have seen the Roman Catholic Church get exposed to numerous pedophilia ands trafficking allegations. World governments have become overly tyrannical and in many countries around the world, there are revolutions.</p>

<p>The last time Pluto was in Capricorn was during the American and French Revolutions, so it’s not at all surprising that revolutions are happening right now.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dawning of the Age of Aquarius is at hand--the Piscean Age draws to a close, and with it, the prophecies and teachings of the age.</p>

<p>Much that was done to control and rule the age is coming to light, and as the house of cards collapses, the secrets of the age pour out. The traditions and secrets that stand outside and above the changing of the houses emerge from the shadows, and the prophecies of the end of days takes on new meaning.</p>

<p>The method by which the Earth is brought to it&#39;s knees is debatable, but the Earth begins to groan. Christ himself admonished any who would ask how this age would end, for none can know--but the great cycle of Gaia repeats itself, and again, the GODHUMAN experiment reaches its zenith, at a time when all consciousness can return to experience it. </p>

<p>The Aquarian age, characterized by uncontrollable and unpredictable energies and movements bursts force with not the humble beginnings of it&#39;s Piscean predecessor, but with the teachings of the previous age available to all, in order to make the ultimate decision with their soul gift--to transcend, or play again.</p>

<p>The path to eternal life is long, and frought with difficult choices. The instruction books are still available to read, but the game begins for all shortly, if it hasn&#39;t already.</p>

<p>Listen to the voice within you that tells you to take action, not the voice that calls from outside, even if it is couched in what appears to be grace. All can survive the transition to the new age, but only those who are prepared to humbly do the work will be asked to come forth.</p>

<p>To all, God Bless, stay calm, and prepare for a show like nothing you&#39;ve ever seen, but something you&#39;ve seen a million times.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s all get it right this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider that no matter what year it is, at some point I&#39;ve always heard someone say or type  &quot;this will be a special year&quot;.  </p>

<p>They&#39;ve always said it in the comments of a thread they consider to be relevant in <em>their</em> lives.  Some people see this and have evidence of a sort that would open people&#39;s eyes if they could have people&#39;s attention.</p>

<p>I had a year a long time ago and I had some information that I still feel would open the right eyes....but its not for everyone.  If you think this is important, talk about it now because the opportunity might not come back around.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s hope it helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bit of info I researched when I first began started with 911 and the Pentagon.  <a href="http://www.citizeninvestigationteam.com/videos/national-security-alert">Specifically the work CIT has done in getting the testimony of 13 eye witnesses to the plane at the Pentagon</a>, two of whom were Pentagon police officers.  A third officer Roosevelt Roberts witnessed the plane flying over him as her ran out of a loading dock.  All the testimony is the eqivilent to the wtc7 information in NYC.  I have not had a reasonable discussion with anyone on it as most attack the info outright and never address the facts.  Coroborating each other, all the witness testimony means they are all correct or they have orchestrated a lie together as a group.</p>

<p>So, thats where I started and one which i feel has been supressed here on r/conspiracy.  To me, this is as obvious as wtc7 and the disappearing plane in shanksville, the war games, all of it.</p>

<p>Also</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally know Daniella, and she claims <strong>all she did was send out a tweet accusing Connor of being a “rapist”</strong> (Connor has a long history of spending hours searching through Twitter for his name and trolling those who cross him). </p>

<p>Haha so silly and playful, just some casual public rape accusations! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you rambling on about? This subreddit constantly talks about how John Podesta is a child molestor with just as little or less evidence than Ian Connor being a rapist lmao. he literally tweeted about pizza gate earlier today lol.</p>

<p>What is your point about Kanye&#39;s money? He&#39;s not &quot;close friends&quot; with Ian, he allegedly fired him this Summer (according to Theophilus London, a person who is actually friends with Kanye)</p>

<p>Clearly I&#39;m jealous because about a guy who has been accused multiple times of rape and openly tweets suspect shit about forcing himself on women.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read plenty from both sides of the Ian Connor story and have come to the pretty obvious conclusion he&#39;s a rapist. Can you read both sides of the story and understand the possibility of it being true? lmfao.</p>

<p>get a grip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This wouldn&#39;t be out of the realm of possibility. Think about it. People are brainwashed all around you. They think everything is alright. Or maybe they have an idea from what they&#39;ve seen on MSM. However, if you use MSM to gain an insight of what is going on in this world, You are being brainwashed. It&#39;s not going to be to the extent that Kanye and any other person that went through an MKUltra seminar. Just bits and pieces changed in the everyday person&#39;s mind to make them believe that everything is okay. They also could manipulate people to make them believe that any one who is a believer in Conspiracy Theories is insane. </p>

<p>I always have this theory that some Conspiracy Theories are intentionally made by the banking elites in order to make us look like delusional idiots. I.E. lizard people, flat earth. Fact is, no one really knows how deep this goes. Not us, and especially not the normies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The negative connotations of the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; were an invention of the CIA in the 60&#39;s to get people to accept the Warren Commission Report on the JFK Assassination, because they knew the official story was complete bullshit that doesn&#39;t pass the smell test to anyone that uses critical thinking and digs into the evidence. Thus why, whenever anyone mentions a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, most people are trained to automatically equate it with being fake. And yea, some conspiracy theories are definitely planted misinformation so they can lump all conspiracy theorists into one group with the people who believe the fake crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct, whatever you want to call them, globalists, satanists, Illuminati, etc killed JFK through the CIA. He was hellbent on taking down the NWO/globalist agenda. Listen to his speech on secret societies or read some of his quotes, he clearly knew what was going on. Since the Council on Foreign Relations was founded in the 20&#39;s, JFK and Reagan are the only 2 people who were not a member to become president. As in, in nearly every election they either control both candidates, or make sure their candidate wins. Reagan&#39;s assassination attempt was a warning that if he didn&#39;t play ball, they&#39;d kill him. Trump will be the 3rd non-globalist president in the last 100 years. 2017 is going to be quite the adventure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re all brainwashed to some degree.</p>

<p>I told my buddy to watch the documentary 13th on Netflix, and it talks a bunch about the media being used to create an image of blacks being criminals - linked with the &quot;tough on crime&quot; which has always just been a PC way of saying &quot;tough on niggers&quot;.</p>

<p>He asked me if now it&#39;s just the &quot;keep calling a kid stupid, and he&#39;ll be stupid&quot;. And I said yeah pretty much. A girl that plays with barbies growing up thinks she has less job opportunities and won&#39;t choose sciences, tech, etc. in college.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a construction worker. I was raised &quot;tough&quot;. I was on a job site working sometimes at 13, and had a job at 15. If I see a skinny nerdy guy I don&#39;t consider him a man and I&#39;m consciously aware of how fucked up that is, but if you&#39;re not able to pick up your own tools and do things you&#39;re not a man to me. It&#39;s so fucked up I have a delayed fear response to doing dangerous things at work.</p>

<p>I&#39;m college educated and thank the mythical sky being I learned trades, because I&#39;m the only person I know my age who owns a home because I make good money. My older brother works IT, makes great money, but can&#39;t afford a house because he can&#39;t fix anything. My house needed new almost everything and needed major renos like a new bedroom built, new bathroom built, etc. I&#39;ll make my good money when I sell it. Right now I&#39;m lucky to be skirting by as lower middle class since me and the wife had kids.</p>

<p>All we can do is try and not pass this on to our kids, and to make them aware of attempts to do this to them.</p>

<p>Think hard, what have you been brainwashed into believing that you know isn&#39;t true? Trades are for stupid people is a big one, or manual work is below you. Why do you think they would want you to think that? If you have to pay someone to do it, the government gets taxes!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly took offence from what you said about skinny nerdy guys. I am a skinny nerdy guy and I believe I am just as much a man as anyone other man. Just can&#39;t gain weight. But I know what your saying. You were brainwashed at a young age to believe you have to be tough in order to be a man. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of anything I have been brainwashed to think. Now days, I question everything. If you asked me a couple years ago I&#39;m sure I could come up with something. But now there isn&#39;t anything I don&#39;t question.</p>

<p>Edit: thinking about it now, I know of one thing that we are all brainwashed to believe and that is religion. Where ever you are on the spectrum of belief, you have to understand that you are rearranging your entire life to fit some idea that was made thousands of years ago. This idea has still not shown any evidence of proof, and continues to exist on the idea of faith. </p>

<p>Imagine a world where religion never came into the picture. We wouldn&#39;t have constant arguments over which religion is true. Which God is the better one, even though they all are the same God just presented in different books. Religion has no place in a modern society, at least in my opinion, if that society wishes to evolve.</p>

<p>Good song, but now Kanye West is supporting the man that is going to do expand the prison industrial complex in the likes of Nixon and Reagan before him. &quot;Law and order&quot; just means new slaves for the DEA and the CCA. Kanye West is one giant hypocrite, and a man who needs to take his bipolar meds at that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The One</p>

<p>So, should we listen to lyrics like this? &quot;Best way to describe my position is at the helm

    <div class="md"><p>This was the one that really got to me. The more I thought about this artwork, the more I cried. This is the definition of absolute depravity and sickness, there is no defending it. This is not art, this is glorification of ritual infant rape and murder.</p>

<p>I have heard people who question the Bible point out verses in the Old Testament highlighting why the Israelites were told to completely destroy an entire race of people, like the Amalekites or Philistines. Want to know why? This is why. They sacrificed their children to Moloch. It was crucial that this did not spread, that the sickness was cut off.</p>

<p>Why did God destroy cities like Sodom &amp; Gomorrah? This is why. They tried to rape the angels that were in the house telling lot and his daughters to leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I theorize that, no, he isn&#39;t on drugs. Rather, he is awakening to what he truly is, and what we all truly are. Humanity has no clue what it really is. We all think we are this &#39;little me&#39; who lives my little life. No. We are life itself. And people go through paradigm shifts in consciousness, most of the time after lots of suffering, when the brain forgets its understanding of itself and consciousness finally understands what it really is. When that happens, your life changes and becomes significantly more open-minded and experience a sort of cognitive clarity that is hard to explain. </p>

<p>He&#39;s waking up. But it sounds insane to the common man. Because the common man is, in fact, insane and believes that it is its ego.</p>

<p>Does this sound strange? If it does, wake up :)</p>

<p>Edit: Thank you to the kind soul for giving me gold. It&#39;s funny, you guys, how when you speak the truth, good things come your way. I love you all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally fair and accurate reply. Okay, let me try to dumb down that which literally cannot be explained. :)</p>

<p>What we are is energy. Within us, the &#39;me&#39; feeling is really just energy. There is no center of our consciousness, but because we believe we are our thoughts, we believe we are a centered illusion. Because we become our thoughts (which is what makes this hard to understand), we suffer to an enormous degree. I&#39;ll explain.</p>

<p>YOU is an idea -- it is a thought -- it is a collection of stored memories and experiences that work together to create an identity, which we believe is what we are. Pride, for example, is an illusion. The fact that I can call you an insulting name and you literally feel hurt is insane. What is it that gets hurt when I call you a name? Nothing is hurting from outside you, but within you, you feel hurt. There is absolutely no real threat, but you still feel hurt. </p>

<p>What is that pride? It is a memory. It is, in my personal experience, my father telling me I need to be a certain someone, and that I need to protect that someone, and I need to prove people wrong in order to prove that I am this someone. But that someone is really just a mental construct. It is a collection of thoughts that I&#39;ve identified with because they made me feel good. So, I spent my life going on chasing that identity, which resulted in endless suffering. </p>

<p>Now, collectively, for the most part, all of humanity believes they are this &#39;pride-like&#39; thing because none of us has, or takes, the time to contemplate reality. The truth is that none of what you THINK you are is real. Because it&#39;s exactly that...a thought. And thoughts have no foundation in true reality. Thoughts are a response to our own personal environment, so they cannot be true outside of our own selves.</p>

<p>So, then, what is actually real? Well, you are real because you are reading this. But what is reading? Consciousness. It has no center, it is your entire energy field. And it is also everything that ever exists: grass, concepts, vision, love, sweat, hate, a car, the moon, the ocean, your parents, and so on. It is everything. But we believe we have personal will and a personal identity -- but it&#39;s all a clever illusion put there by God (which is consciousness). It&#39;s SO hard to see, but SO easy to see. It is nothing and everything.</p>

<p>The reason people who have been on the journey towards enlightenment tend to speak so abstractly is because there is no way to prove this. It is an experiential thing to know. You have to go on the journey and have the balls to contemplate your own reality. Eventually, as you start to let go of your ego (which is both good and bad, but people tend to think it is only a bad thing), you will start to feel what I am saying as being truth. At first, people tend to understand it intellectually but they do not feel it, so it frustrates them. But, eventually, you let go even deeper. And you realize that fear, anxiety, lack, need, desperation...all of that is an illusion that we put on our selves because we believe we are something that we are not. </p>

<p>Long story short, you are not your thoughts, but you believe you are. If you aren&#39;t your thoughts, what are you? I&#39;d suggest following that question in a deep and quiet meditation. I used to think meditation was a silly concept and that an alternative reality was a hippy idea. No. There is a more intimate form of consciousness...and it is the consciousness that sits quietly within you, watching everything that&#39;s going on within and outside you. It is you. Abstract? Yeah. But I tried!</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot to mention this and wanted to make your day. You are not mortal. Your body dies, sure. But it&#39;s silly to identify with the body or emotions. You are the thing that experiences the body and the emotions. You are the screen on the TV and your ego is the television show going on. You do not die. You carry on forever. Consciousness is infinite. Figured knowing you are immortal might help you sleep tonight! lol. take care, friend.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read Descartes. I haven&#39;t read much of anything. After my spiritual awakening, words just started coming to me. I&#39;ll check him out though. He is right. Doubt everything because no-thing is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been as well, and that&#39;s quite possible. Could just be a coincidence he mentions MK Ultra. His tweets before that and following that make me think it&#39;s something more than just him starting a trend.

<p>Here are some of her other works, which are disturbing to say the least. I think we are connecting the dots here. Don&#39;t stop. </p>

<p>Edit: I should mention that Noble suffers from DID because of childhood abuse.
The pieces of &#39;string&#39; that you see the abusers are holding are actually cattle prods. The imagery of the child &#39;fading away&#39; in the artwork is actually showing the child dissociating from his/her reality. </p>

<p>By going public in this manner he not only creates more attention to himself (which ultimately makes him a target), but also helps spread the word.</p>

<p>The impact of his tweets are dubious at best, but what we are seeing on the grand stage, I would suggest is the plan going as planned, and nothing much has changed - though tweets such as these, certainly makes people think twice, no matter which direction they choose to interpret them in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ian connor is very close friends with Kanye, keep this in mind. Before Kanye was forcibly admitted into the &quot;hospital&quot; he shouted out Ian as being &quot;one of the real ones&quot;, followed by him saying how evil Facebook, Google, Hillary, etc. are. Many people on this sub believe Kanye was brainwashed (MK Ultra) when he was forced into the hospital to shut him up about exposing the elite. He was clearly beginning to turn on them. Now Ian connor is tweeting about MK Ultra, brainwashing, etc. He deleted many of them now but a few are still up there. He even tweeted saying if he dies it was not a suicide it was &quot;them&quot;. Connect the dots. If this doesn&#39;t even slightly further your suspicion on this theory, do some more research on the Kanye brainwash conspiracy and Kanye and Ian&#39;s relationship.</p>

You may not care about this conspiracy but I and quite a few other people on this sub do, and it definitely relates. Idk if you&#39;re into pizzagate at all, but imagine someone close to podesta or clinton tweeting about pedophelia and that if they die they promise it was not a suicide but it was &quot;them&quot;. It&#39;s just something suspicious to keep an eye on </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I literally mention what conspiracy it&#39;s relevant to before the links to the tweets. Please read through the thread and I&#39;m sure you will understand. Summarized: This man is very close with Kanye, was mentioned by Kanye as being one of the only real people out there the day he was forcibly admitted to a hospital and called crazy by every media source out there, many people believe Kanye was brainwashed in the &quot;hospital&quot; (MKUltra) and now someone Kanye trusts is coming out saying he is scared for his life basically and how a new form of MKUltra is going on, and just now tweeted a picture of some pizzagate relevant artwork. I think this is should explain how it is very relevant.</p>

<p>To say this is irrelevant is ignorant of the pervasiveness of what&#39;s going on behind the scenes.</p>
