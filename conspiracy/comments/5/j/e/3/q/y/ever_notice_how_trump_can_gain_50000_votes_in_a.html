<p>The democratic party is about to experience what happened to the GOP in 2008. Many republicans were sick of what Bush did, then came along Ron Paul to save the day, and the party sabotaged his campaign. The exact same thing happened with Bernie Sanders in the DNC, and now they will be a fractured party</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always thought of it as classical liberalism.  In the 1960s liberals weren&#39;t shouting, &quot;we need public health care.&quot;  They were shouting, &quot;Down with the government, up with people,&quot; which is the core belief of libertarians. Their movement was usurped by communists who seem to have morphed into fascists per Orwell&#39;s Animal Farm script.  You are certainly right about their affinity for the cause of the wealthy.  That is very typical of fascism, which is very elitist by its nature.</p>

<p>I do hope you&#39;re right, but I doubt he will shut down the fed.  He wants to be in it, and he&#39;s smart enough to realize how to best get at that money- pretend you hate them and then let them pay you off to go away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fed needs to be brought under control but not necessarily shut down. They play politics by tightening money on republican presidents and letting it flow for democrats. You can&#39;t go to a commodities backed dollar when you operate at a constant deficit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a good video you may not have seen (maybe you have).  I&#39;ve only watched the first 30 minutes, but it shows in those 30 minutes that entities like the fed go back to Roman times, with some breaks in between.  Certainly gave me some insight into the battle we are fighting, and I believe its main argument is a fiat currency is fine, provided it&#39;s issued by the government, and only in sufficient quantities and not oversupply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video discusses why the Constitution is silent on the issue of paper money- because lobbyists to the Convention convinced the framers not to address
It!  It&#39;s at 42:30 in the video- Gouvenor Morris and Robert Morris, along with Hamilton and the rich &quot;money changers&quot; in Europe, lobbied the delegates, who were still reeling from the inflation of the Revolution.  So, it was easy to convince them to keep it out.</p>

<p>Crazy that bankers were even then influencing leadership.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think the idea of &quot;wide-spread&quot; voter fraud is irrational because we have a decentralized voting system, in order to have &quot;wide-spread&quot; voter fraud you would literally have to go county by county or even voting district by voting district and grease election officials, that would literally be thousands of people that need to be paid off and remain silent, it would never happen on a truly significant level, and even if a candidate tried to pull that off, a good amount of these officials may not even side with you party and would immediately get on a soap box, I.E: trump wouldn&#39;t try greasing elections officials in California nor Hillary in Texas.</p>

<p>that isn&#39;t to say hillary cant i don&#39;t know have thousands of democrats wiped from the registered voter list in new york, or influence a city to shut down half the polling stations (Arizona), there are ways to influence an election besides ballot stuffing. What i did think was interesting was how many states were less than 1% vote difference which would of authorized a recount, but Hillary never challenged them..... she literally just went crawling back to her hole once the results were announced (i know she quietly supported people like stien or the russia investigation but she never came back to the main stage and fought for herself)</p>

<p>the fact she was so unwilling to even put up a fight herself, reminded me of a line in LBJ&#39;s biography about his 1941 senate campaign loss </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;....On the second day, delayed returns and some last-minute recounts put O&#39; Daniel, ahead by 1,311 votes. Despite several reports of fraud on the part of O&#39; Daniel&#39;s forces, Johnson decided not to contest the election. The reason for this willingness to accept the dubious results is not entirely clear, though colleagues at the time suggest that his decision to hold back was made in the context of an awareness that on his side there were violations of the laws regulating campaign contributions and expenditures.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this isn&#39;t intended to be some rock solid evidence that Hillary most definitely has to be corrupt, just pointing out when someone has a fighting chance to challenge something and slink back to the shadows instead, there might a reason</p>

 you are correct, a handful seemed close.  But if she was in anyway afraid of campaign finance violations, THAT would be a first imho lol. Speculating, could it have been that she was concerned that EVERY recounted state might have broken for Trump, and that certainly would have raised eyebrows. We&#39;ll never know . . .</p>
