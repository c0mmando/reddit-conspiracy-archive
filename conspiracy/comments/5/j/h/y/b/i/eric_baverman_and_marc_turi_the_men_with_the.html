<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-22/meet-man-who-can-expose-real-hillary-clinton-scandal">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-22/meet-man-who-can-expose-real-hillary-clinton-scandal</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Conservative Daily News, it was also speculated that like Edward Snowden, Eric Braverman had also sought political asylum in New York’s Russian Embassy. And to add more gravity to the rumor, it was also said that the Russian Embassy never rebuked the story.</p>

<p>The major history of the former Clinton Foundation CEO went back to the year 2013. This was when former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton appointed Braverman as the CEO of the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>This report from investmentwatchblog.com claims that Braverman is actually in Protective Custody with the FBI, in exchange for testimony against Clinton.</p>

<p>It is known that Braverman had difficulties negotiating the Clinton foundations donors and web business dealings across the globe. There were also issues with the aggressive nature of the foundation&#39;s find raising practices. Chelsea Clinton had supported Braverman&#39;s application to become the CEO of the foundation, but both of them had reservations about the legality of how the Clinton Foundation and the Teneo group practiced find raising, dissident of funds and the compensation of Bill Clinton&#39;s speaking engagements and shown in the 2011 memo written by Doug Band. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Band wrote the memo in 2011 to foundation lawyers conducting a review of the organization amid a brewing feud with the Clintons’ daughter, Chelsea Clinton, who was taking a stronger role in leading the foundation and had expressed concerns about Teneo’s operations. </p>

<p>It describes how Band helped run what he called “Bill Clinton Inc.,” obtaining “in-kind services for the President and his family — for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like.”</p>

<p>Them Wikileaks dropped a bomb. Shortly before Braverman left the foundation John Podesta identified Braverman as a leak in the organization. The Clinton Foundation is now exposed for questionable feduciary practices by internal memos and Braverman had been identified by Podesta as the rat who told the media to follow the money. </p>

<p>It looks as if Braverman ran, and as the CEO of the Clinton Foundation and may have left with a life insurance folder like Weiner. </p>

<h2>How does Eric Braverman&#39;s disappearance tie in with the death or disappearance of Marc Turi?</h2>

<p>This is purely speculation that either man are linked, but Braverman, reasonably could have left with financial records. In reality, what would be important enough to bring down the Clinton political machine and possibly obama&#39;s legacy. Proving they did in fact fund the group that became ISIS thinking they were rebels that were going to over throw Assad. Whatever their motivations, they lied to the American people, they got Americans killed, and they committed a crime by supplying terrorist with weapons. </p>

<h2>Who has the evidence, the actual correspondence with hillary, the emails toxic enough to get the DOJ to stand down on an international arms trafficing case?</h2>

<h3>Marc Turi</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Marc Turi, the Phoenix, AZ-based arms dealer also saw himself being set-up by the Clintons to take the fall and he went to FoxNews with the story but soon disappeared and is currently presumed dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After threatening to release emails in federal court implicating hillary in the Bengazi arms trade the DOJ dropped all charges against Marc Turi. An associate of Turi alleges that the documents that would have to be released under discovery to the defense would have implicated hillary and obama in illegal arms deals that moved arms through Bengazi Libya to arm Syrian rebels that later became ISIS. </p>

<p>Great Biographical Information about Marc Turi.

<h3>Charges dropped in Libya weapons scheme</h3>

<p><a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/5/marc-turis-charges-dropped-in-libya-weapons-scheme/">http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/5/marc-turis-charges-dropped-in-libya-weapons-scheme/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Turi has said the Obama administration, and thus Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee and the prime mover of NATO intervention in Libya, blessed the moves he made to get rifles, anti-tank rockets, explosives and machine guns into the hands of anti-Moammar Gadhafi fighters.</p>

<p>The backdrop to Gadhafi’s fall is Benghazi, where four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador, were killed by terrorists on Sept. 11, 2012.</p>

<p>Mr. Turi’s lawyer, Jean-Jacques Cabou of the Perkins Coie law firm, has argued in court that among the bounty of Clinton emails released by the government are discussions between the then-Secretary of State Clinton and others about arms for Libyan rebels</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, help yourself.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of threads and I post about them hoping to find something that ties them together.  There are so many things that take place with coincidences that supposedly mean nothing. I don&#39;t think the connections between these people mean nothing, I think it is simply a part of the mystery we haven&#39;t solved yet. I&#39;m hoping that working together we might figure out finally what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>A taxi driver in eastern Europe hacked Sid Bluminthal&#39;s email and published screen shots of the stolen mail while the hearings about Bengazi were taking place, and the result was we learned about the hillary mail server. The smallest things linked together correctly can change the course of history. </p>

<p>Tell me if you figure something out. ..</p>
