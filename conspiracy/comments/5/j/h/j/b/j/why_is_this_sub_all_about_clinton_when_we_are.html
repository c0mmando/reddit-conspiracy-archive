       Even ignoring the Russian angle, it's not like many of these people have been pro US interests.  Just look at Tillerman who has brazenly gone against national security goals. Just see exxon's actions in Chad.  These people haven't loved america for decades, I doubt they have suddenly found their hearts now. This will be the end of America and the beginning of a true Corporate state.

       That's why he's got dick cheney in an advisorial role? Lol.  There isn't much of anything on Hillary Clinton, and Trump isn't going to take her down...You are delusional.  There's no way he's going to reopen and investigate 9/11, especially with the people he's associating with.  The truth, donald trump is far more corrupt than any politician we have seen.  His conspiracy of absolute corruption screams in our face ever day, yet here you sit bitching about Clinton...Why is that?
      </p>
      <p>
       you are complicit in the deciet, or you simply lack the critical thought to evaluate the situation.  It's very interesting, how so much of the sub is focused on anything anti-clinton no matter how off topic, yet there is a silence when it comes to trump.

       Dude, she's a helpless ol' lady who has done nothing but try to help the children... And America.
The only reason countries stopped giving so much money to her charity is because of fake news!
It's totally not true that only 10% of their donations went to people who needed help.
And it's definitely not true that she helped pedos and sex offenders, it would go against all she stands for.

       What substantial evidence do you have on Hillary.  No evidence of any laws being broken.  So, I don't see it.  The FBI didn't even collect her server with the files on it, you have to ask yourself why that's the case.  Most of the claims made against Hillary are based on misinformation.  From running a private server being illegal, to her deleting emails and sending and receiving classified information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI initial claims were proven false.  The new claims have yet to be verified by any independent court or party with the necessary security clearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you believe the FBI when it says these new claims are truthful, when their previous ones were not.  And now when the FBI back the claim made by the CIA and other intelligence bodies that Russia tried to manipulate our national election...All of a sudden you don't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how are you determining when the FBI lies and when it doesn't?  Are they only truthful when they are making claims that negatively impact Hillary Clinton?

       It's word play it's not his job as the president to go after Hillary it's the attorney general; that's why he's putting someone like Jeff Sessions in place because he was one of the biggest pushers to have her ass locked up and if you check Jeff sessions track record he's not one to back down .

       Yeah, he may have said that but again, it's not the presidents duty to decide whether someone should be prosecuted and locked up, it's the attorney generals job. He positioned the right guy to carry it out, she's not going to escape the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my point of view it's a smart tactic because it will avoid Obama from pardoning her or having them pull any last second moves to protect her.

       Well, you see, the Annunaki are a race of reptilian, shape-shifting, ancient astronauts from the Draco constellation. Being that they are from a differrent dimension than humans (forth dimension to be exact), they have manipulated humans for eons, making us build their UFO docking stations that we call pyramids, and they walk among us today as rich and powerful humanoids. They have been using humans to mine monatomic gold to further cement their grasp on our minds, while simultaneously deriving power from the suffering they inflict on us. Educate yourselves.

       Thank you but please, Why is there such a large amount of importance placed upon Sirius by past humans? I mean for example there are tribes in Africa who know about Sirius and it's actual location. I understand Annunaki are stated in both (Native American) Indian and Sumerian texts but the mentions of Sirius are vague.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying they aren't from Sirius but rather plundered it? Interesting.

       You're talking about whole 'types' of people (DNA). What I am also saying is that it might not depend on the DNA of someone , as it seems to be a more society/government issue.

       i kind of don't want to on here...check out Gaiam TV and David Wilcock's blog, he's not 100% accurate but it will give you a feel for what's going on, sort of, hang in there I believe the next few months will hold many revelations, disclosures and even a massive awakening. Just don't worry about it too much and get your ass outside into nature

       It's specifically in the title... The whole post is written in such a way as to draw juxtaposition between the treatment of Clinton vs Trump, so I'd say it's somewhat relevant.

       Nope. She is a monster. Not because of any allegations about her eating babies and so on..... I think the who pizzagate thing is ridiculous. No. She is a cold, calculating political monster who would have dragged the US into a war with Russia. I would not have voted for her even if I had a vote.

       It sounds like what you're saying is that Trump and Clinton are two sides of the same rusted coin, two puppets held up by the same puppeteer. From this assumption, it would be easy to view the entirety of the 2016 election a damning indictment of the whole of the American bourgeois capitalist project. Take it another step further, and one could reasonably be compelled to advocate for its overthrow and replacement by a system built in the interests of the vast majority of the population, rather than the greedy and hegemonic interests of the sick cabal that has controlled this society for the better part of the last two centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, one doesn't need, necessarily, to advocate for revolution. History has placed all of us at odds with this system, and upheavals are likely to become more frequent and more intense, with or without any provocation from revolutionarily-minded people. The task then becomes one of ensuring the success of such a historically necessary endeavor, against not only the reaction from the right, but also against the hypocrisy and opportunism of the middle-class fake left. Our work is cut out for us (all of us), but I think we're up to the task.

       He said Clinton is evil, he denies pizzagate and believes HRC would not have gotten us into what seems, at least now, as a slow slide to war with Russia. Make sense? I mean, it is right up there...

       Yes, the Democratic and Republican factions of the ruling Capitalist party of the United States are distinctly different. I forgot. Maybe if I'd only have looked more closely at their bilateral assault on living conditions here, or their collective war aims abroad...

       You have bought into his barefaced lies. He isn't that rich because he's not that smart. That's why he still won't release his tax returns. And anyway, if he's so smart he would have simply invested his inheritance in FTSE 100 companies and he'd be MANY times richer than he claims to be. It doesn't take any skill or talent to become a celebrity. But I'll give him this.... he did a fantastic job of getting the working classes to shoot themselves in both feet by voting for him. He isn't going to drain the swamp. He isn't going to lock her up. He doesn't give a flying fuck about the struggling masses, and he has no plan that will make America great again.

       But that'd be a pretty good distraction while you slyly fill every position with billionaires, wouldn't it? Why not officially make politician and banker synonymous? Now it's normal and there's no reason to complain cause it's better than a monster as president.

       You mean the civil suit that was dismissed by the judge?? The accuser using a pseudonym was found out to be using a fake address and fake phone number for the court case.  With the whole civil case being orchestrated by the former producer of the The Jerry Springer Show? ?

       Not all of Trumps picks are bad. I personally think some were of Niccolò Machiavelli level brilliance. That does not make them good either. From what I see its similar to previous presidents in terms of quality but nowhere worse.

       What's the conspiracy behind Trump's cabinet picks lol?  That's all visible spectrum BULLSHIT that no one cares about.  Go watch CNN all day if you want to hear about that.

       I think you're forgetting what conspiracy means. It doesn't matter if it is in broad daylight or in a back alley, a conspiracy is a conspiracy. If he's picking these people for a nefarious reason, then I think that is notable enough for this sub. But I know this is impossible because it is the nature of us humans is to pick one side and fight for it.

       I am as anti clinton as it gets but I do have some questions about Rex Tillerson's ties to Russia. I think we just need some time to see if Trump was for real or if he was just full of smoke.

       Yes, the World Trace Centers collapsing was not a conspiracy, it was an event.  The conspiracy is the alleged nature of the event (planes caused collapse vs controlled demolition), and the motivations behind it (terrorists did it vs US gov. did it)
      </p>
      <p>
       The event of Trump's cabinet picks, similarly, is not a conspiracy.  The theoretical conspiracy would be SECRET dealings that somehow involved deals to place these people in the public spotlight (not a smart move if you want to use them in secret).  Now all of these deals can simply happen behind closed doors anyway, so there is no reason to assume that anyone you see on TV is the man behind the curtain.  In fact, these cabinet picks are probably patsies.  You people will direct your hate at them while the real people in charge go about their business

       You mean like The secret plan to make it look like trump was going to drain the swamp but the whole time he was SECRETLY planning to appoint a corporate dream team of swampmen? Just because we're watching the effects in plain view doesn't mean that it wasn't a conspiracy, someone distracted and fooled millions of Americans with promises of bettering the system and then started doing the opposite of that. It's a conspiracy playing out in front of your eyes

       I don't get why everyone assumes he's appointing 'swamp men' .. You and I have no clue who these people are and how they fit into Trumps' plan. Who's opinion are we referring to when we discuss these things? It's all speculation driven by liberal media propaganda.. I think it's foolish to doubt Trump and Steve Bannon at this point. You're only getting left behind from my vantage point. Nice try Reddit ;)

       There's a difference between conspiracy theories, and wild speculation.  Anyone in the world could have a hidden agenda, but engaging in that without any real reason is just a guessing game.  Trump's cabinet is all in plain sight, there's no reason to assume that any secret deals were involved, or else why even put them on TV in the first place?  The societal malady of television has really hurt people

       Okay well you seemed to have missed the point. Rephrase what I said with political elite instead of ruling class and you're still left with my point which you did not refute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you trying to shutdown the discussion of the hidden agendas of our political elite on a conspiracy forum? If you assume there is no hidden agendas or they aren't worth discussing why not just not participate? Why go out of your way to try and shutdown and dismiss everything as not worth the time or not a conspiracy when it so very clearly is?

       You are going on and on about what the media wants you to focus on.  Trump's cabinet picks.  You should be more worried about what is not on TV.  Instead you drink the CNN Kool Aid and complain about only things that are on TV

       I can be worried about a spectrum of things at the same time. Trump cabinet picks will directly effect my life over the next several years. This is important for me and anyone else who lives in the United States to speculate on. You still haven't answered my question as to why you're putting in so much effort to silence the discussion. If you think it's all just media distraction and doesn't matter then why are you here? Why waste your time trying to shutdown discussion just because you personally don't think it's important?

       No you have multiple comments on this thread completely denying the existence of any conspiracy here at all, not just saying that it's a waste of time. That's why I'm so perplexed, because there is in fact conspiracies to be discussed here whether you like them or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one thing to say something is a waste of time and another entirely to deny its existence. One is your personal opinion and the other is a lie with the intent of shutting down discussion on the matter by being dismissive.

       It appears most people here are so ignorantly and blindly pro trump that the only explanation is paid shills, brainwashed supporters, or trolls. Can't tell which is which but at the end of the day does it actually matter? This subreddit sucks and has literally been taken over by (intentional or not) shills.

       THIS THIS THIS. seriously. you either have corrupt mods deleting any thread that addresses this, or brigading and pile-on antagonizing of anyone critical of trump, this blatantly obvious white-supremacist-boys-club of a cabinet, or legit accusations of supporting child rape by anyone critical of the pizzagate meltdown (which it's quickly becoming).
      </p>
      <p>
       what you're seeing is the beginnings of fascism and tyranny. these trump-tards are SO brainwashed they can't even see that what is happening is EVERYTHING this sub is against!
      </p>
      <p>
       which leads me to my final point, that this sub is no longer actually r/conspiracy, it's r/the_donald_pt2. all those idiots came over here and this is no longer a conspiracy sub, unless it's against hillary (whom i hate, so again, fuck off with the shill bullshit).
      </p>

       we'll see how long until the tide turns here, but i've NEVER seen this sub this closed minded and antagonistic, and i've seen some shit here.

       Well to be honest a lot more of Clintons hand has been exposed making the discussion about them or surrounding them more prevalent. You'll naturally see more discussion especially because the information out there involving Clinton confirms and validates a lot of people's suspicions about Clinton. The discussion around Clinton is naturally more visceral and cathartic than about Trump. Trumps supporters are very ruthless and there is an overall expectation of some kind of revival involving Clinton. If he squashes this and denies this his supporters will turn on him fast.

       Clinton pardoning a few white collar criminals is nowhere near as bad as bush pardoning scooter libby for his treasonous when he outed a covert CIA agents identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't recall Clinton invading a country based on lies and the subsequent looting of their national assets,and allowing and attempting to cover up torture and murder in places like Abu Ghraib.

       Cant cast more than one and if you got 2 to choose from then it would be stupid to vote for the one who is least fit for the job and to think otherwise is just....moronic point blank period. If trump will do what he said then the way i see it hes better for it cause that obama guy done a disservice to our Country and it doesnt take a genius to see that and hillary was gonna pick up where he left off and anybody thinks she would beena good choice has lost thier mind or dont know right from wrong. Im an american and im not gonna vote for those that are against and she plays on that team and eithet she knows it or dont care. Yeah trump aint no kennedy or licoln but at least he aint on the bigger fools team! Thats a fact. Most of the people that vote for hillary are doing so because they unknowning been brainwashed by bs, not a conspiracy theory its a conspiracy fact! Not gonna argue about theres no argument to be had.

       Some stuff he said on his campaign to get elected. Meanwhile it's a man who's friends with Jeffry Epstein, friends with the Clinton's, a billionaire with a history of bending the rules and fucking people over for profit, filling his cabinet with similar bankers Clinton would have, and who's filling his cabinet with swampmen.

       Tillerson:  Close ties with Russia. Another de-escalator.  Plus he is a commoner.  He was not born into wealth.  He made his own.  He belongs to nobody, in theory.

       Bannon:  Whilst not a cabinet pick, Bannon is the successor to Andrew Breitbart, who now-famously tweeted about Podesta, child sex, etc, back in 2012.  Assumedly, Bannon knows all Breitbart knows and is of similar morals..

       There is also thought that he is purposefully picking the Oil CEO as SoS to show the US how we've actually been running things.  No more faking.  Bring it into the light and let the US public judge.  etc etc...

       In the eyes of most, Trump was a wild card coming onto the political scene. Then a lot of people have been absolutely desperate for a candidate who they believe can go in and magically fix everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas HRC has decades of corruption behind her that most people already know about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truly unnerving thing is that most people completely ignore that Trump and Clintons have been friends for a long time, and that by his own words, Trump only acted tough towards HRC because it was a political contest but that he still likes and respects her a lot outside of the political game. Which makes sense as they have been
       <strong>
        friends for years
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       People are drunk on "hope on change" right now, though. (I know, in all of its ironic glory.)
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no point in getting into aggressive arguments with such people, though. Emotions are riding high and plus let's be honest, none of us can see the future in perfect detail. So let's just wait and see what happens.

       Im willing to give trump the benifit of the doubt untill he is president at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       He will be introducing laws that ban members of the government from taking lobbying positions for five years after they leave office,this is not perfect but its a big step in the right direction.

       First, the President can't introduce laws/bills. That is done by congress and then has be be voted on by congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, there is no way anyone in congress would introduce or vote for a bill that goes against their own interest. So, even if he wrote a bill, then asked congress to introduce it, it's dead in the water. It's like if you boss told you to decide if you should get a raise or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conceptually, I think it's a cool idea. But I also think it would be cool if I had a summer house on Mars.

       You mean the woman who conspired against the people to put aside their only viable other candidate using her DNC connections? or the woman who was conspiring against the American people using the Entire corporate media as an arsenal? or the Woman who conspired  against the American people using an illegal private server , then deleted all the emails, and then conspired with the Justice department not be prosecuted for her criminal actions?

       Becoming friendly with Russia is a good thing. Who the fuck is such a scrub in conspiracies/reality that they don't even understand that the US is the biggest threat to world security of them all.

       The idea doesn't bother me that much actually because Clinton was using office to gain wealth. I would like to think that billionaires going in would be less likely to be influenced by foreign nations and entities for for money like the Clintons, but billionaires can still be greedy. I wish his picks were billionaires who were less crazy. More Musks and less Sessions.

       True, but easier to buy off than your average politician? Peddling influence for cash like the Clintons and their people? I don't know.
None of us know. I am more concerned about some of the appointee's opinions and  beliefs than I am the fact they are millionaires.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I still think it was the better option. Clinton would have been business as usual and put the people back to sleep. Trump being president, the corruption, the media lies, people are frosty now and waking up. No government is good. It's surreal.

       The US Government is a business, Trump is going to run it like one.  It's not surprising he's hiring people with successful business backgrounds.   Some of his picks have been questionable for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'm hoping that the people he is hiring are getting jobs because he believes they are not linked to the Clinton Foundation scandal.

       A mistake too commonly made is the assumption that "the enemy of my enemy is my friend." This is a faulty assumption.

       The fact that Trump opposed Hillary is good; she deserved to be deprived of office and to have her true character held up for scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not mean, however, that Trump is therefore good and exempt from the same kind of scrutiny to which we must subject all of the ruling elite.

       The Trump presidency will have its good points, but will also be a shitstorm of bad news for this country.

       The majority of Obama's cabinet and appoints were ex bankers who tried to get the stink off by spending 1-2 years "teaching" at harvard princeton. So the media referred to them as "______ from harvard" when in fact they had spent the previous 30 years at goldman sachs - to run Treasury or the Fed

       You're right, OP.  We have to pay attention to all of this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we can't forget Clinton, especially considering the situation there is very much up in the air and worthy of discussion and investigation right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will have plenty of time to call out the Trump administration.  One silver lining here is all the "normies" who would have ignored a Clinton administration (which would have been just as evil, but a very different flavor of evil, in a more bland and subtle way which would fly under the radar) are up in arms because they think Trump is literally Hitler, so they will be paying close attention instead of ignoring Washington policy and eating up all of the pro-Madam President propaganda the MSM was so ready to feed us week in and week out.  Maybe enough regular joe blows are finally interested enough in what the hell actually goes on in D.C. that we can resist some of the shit.

       Hillary offered another 4 years of the Bush/Clinton war mongering, drug running, dark money, CIA government. Trump and his cabinet are definitely rich, but maybe, hopefully, that gives them a degree of freedom to not rely on the "establishment"? Time will tell. Hillary was a vote for corruption. Trump may also be a vote for corruption, but hopefully not. Obama was hoped to be change, but wasn't. The choices were very limited. Bernie was screwed over by Hillary and the DNC and would have been preferable to either Hillary or Trump.

       The end of America? Are you serious? The end of America was when the Federal Reserve wasn't abolished. America the great has been dead since the 30's. That's when the money changers took final control and when people were taxed under socialism and when the culture went from virtue and hardwork and community to special interests and the destruction of American cities to house the welfare class.

       This sub has a one-track mind.  While it IS true that Trump's picks are terrible for the country, the sub is still focused on Clinton.  Once that's gone, then they'll move on to the next thing- but that may or may not be Trump's cabinet.

       That question should definitely be answered. Why does everyone assume every rich person is in on the globalist-satanist-pedophile-elite plan automatically? It's a dangerous over-generalization. Extremely cynical.

       The problem with trump is that his position on tpp and his cabinet picks are antipodal, much like any other opinion he seems to hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he said and what he will do, like any other politician running a campaign, are bound to be vastly different things. Now I'm all for hope but that word was ruined 8 years ago.

       What a stupid post, as someone who voted Trump I'll admit that he wasn't my first choice (Bernie) and he is far from perfect as far who he has put in his cabinet (some of which I've already stated in
       <a href="/r/the_Donald">
        /r/the_Donald
       </a>
       ). However, it's retarded to vote and not criticize someone like Hillary and her Globalist puppet masters who we know would screw us over and want total dominance over the people, she said it herself, a vote for her is a vote for the policies that Obama (another Saudi, Soros, Globalist puppet) installed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll criticize Trump when the fours years of his are up and he has put forth his policies as any sane person should. While he is a grade A narcissist, I don't believe he wants to control and dominate EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING on the planet. He wants to be loved adored sure, but I wouldn't grade him a psychopath like Soros, Kissinger, the Rothschild, and the Globalist group. Let's see what he does when his fours years are up and grade it then, maybe I'm wrong. Guess we'll find out.

       I just cant believe there are millions of people that cant see that antiamericans are behind all the division in this country. What i mean is' they are doing it on purpose. We got an enemy and had one for 7 or 8 yrs in charge of this Great Country and we would have continued to have one had hillary won. She lost get over it and by the way russia isnt why Trump won, thats a straight lie. The leftist are sore losers who dont know and dont want whats best for this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah stopping imagration is for the best and it doesnt mean you hate foreigners. Having a rebel flag doesnt mean you are a rascist or support it. Abortion is murder. Right is right and wrong is wrong and its about time alot of people get thier heads out of thier asses and realize that they are being manipulated into excepting evil as good. Those out there that are beating people up because they voted for trump or those that think killing babies is ok,  those who say that those that dont want to support homosexuality is a homophobe and southern people who have a rebel flag is a rascist....get for real and quit being stupid because all you are really doing is buying into damn lies by those out there that think you and your fellow americans need to die. Our country is being attacked and they are using you as part of it period whether you believe that or not...its a fact realize it. If you want to destroy a country do it from the inside out and thats what all this bullshit boils down to. Keep this shit up and we will lose more and more freedom. Do you want that? Obama does, hillary does, most of the left does and so does those who is starting all this division. So all you who support those like obama and hillary...you are supporting it and the sad part is that you dont even know it and to dumb or stubborn to accept it period. Im not trying to insult leftist but this is a serious damn deal that is destroying our country.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as abortion in this Country goes all i can say is...keep killing babies by the millions and we wont need to worry about the haters of america because we will be dealing with destruction from the Almighty because He wont put up with the slaughter of innocent unborn babies that He is giving the gift of life to. And people wonder why there is so much trouble in this Country and the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly i dont care if you believe me because its your ass thats on the line. I believe Gods Word...the real and only one not the quarran kurron (however you spell it) or buddha or hinduism or any other religion. The Bible is 100% true and for those who can discern it which only includes believers sirry victims of deception knows what is right around the corner and knows thats things are coming just as described (oh sorry for you that think you know the Bibles teaching on the endtimes and what it actually says) to a T and that we who are the ones will be persacuted and be hated know what will happen to us in the end and put it like this...id rather be the jew than the nazi. Those that go to thier graves without ever finding the truth will realize they will end up under the same judgement as the nazi and they will know that they where wrong to think they recieved out of anger of God but rather them falling for a big lie and the oppurtunity to change that has passed and nothing CAN BE done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many better realize it and they only have a short time to do so that all this turmoil and terror and all this bad stuff that is increasing in the world is birthed in the spirit world and what is coming from the satanic side of that world is stronger than anything man has experienced before and the traps will be harder to escape and in fact its already begun but point is...it gets deeper. If the whole truth was layed out in front of them many still would be in it so deep that they just wouldnt see it until its too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its exciting to know that our time period and that we are the people mentioned in Gods word that are a part of the most significant time in the history of mankind yet sad that im living amongst and seeing the people that is said the majority of which was said to be the most decieved stubborn of many of which are black at heart. And to know that they will perish in a quick ammount of time and never come to the truth that will prevent them from the seperation of God. That hell and hell is a place where Gods presence isnt. That all that is considered good doesnt exist. Water is good...that doesnt exist there. Air to breath is good...that doesnt exist outside of Gods presence. Comfort is good...there is NO comfort outside Gods presence! Memories of the times with those you love is good...memories doesnt exist outside Gods presence! Anything good doesnt exist outside Gods presence. So what is left is all that is the opposite from good. Die rejecting God is your choice and youll know that because He isnt gonna force you to be with Him. Youll wish you had only known and He will say...remember so and so? Do you recall when...? And youll say but i thought....! But i....! You have have to accept Jesus offer of salvation before you perish so that way when you die you die unjustly. Sin is the only reason man dies so He removes the sin and then you die anyway....it results in your destination being reversed. Youll be choosen the presence of God instead of choosing to be outside it. If you think at some point in eternity things will change then you are foolishly mistaken. Dont take no chances if you know whats good for ya. You can reverse the gift of life. That man who found himself in sheol (basically a holding cell for those waiting judgement to determine the depths of hell they are to be forever a none is fun) begging for one drop of water which abraham would give IF he could...that guy is still there. I cant help if many of you think this is fairytales but if you understood that prophecy proves Gods word and how to a T it is being fullfilled and again there is many of you that may think they grasp bible prophecy and you may to a degree but if you understood it as it really is you would know the Bible is Real and factual because you can now see the odds are a gurantee that it is. All this turmoil intensifying is because satan know bible prophecy and he see that the time has come and like the Bible says, when he realizes it he will know his time is up and he only has a few years to achieve his ambitions, so get ready because he has held back and planned for this time period for thousands of years! He has a ton of things that he has already brought that is having devistating effects and you have to realize that we are dealing with forces that have an intelligence on a supernatural level. I could expose alot of things that he has implemented things that is different about the world and how it is prophesied that ties up things on a level this world has never understood or has ever been able to know and thankfully there is an awakaning taking place among believers that understand some of that i could say but im finished. Im just tired of fools running this country and the people who are foolishly supporting it and supporting evil and dont even know it. I love my Country and thank God for it and thank our veterans who have placed thier lives on the line to protect it. Just stop letting our enemies manipulate us into causing division amongst us.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you that dont believe this... all i can say is oh well and one day you will but if the truth has to be divinely giving to you...sorry for you because it will be too late i gurantee you that!!

       I think what is going on here in this sub is that people think Clinton is evil.  Trump isn't ideal IMO but at least he seems to be anti-deep state to a degree.  Deep state and mainstream media's cover is being blown with the PizzaGate leak.
      </p>

       I wouldn't mind seeing some posts investigating Trump's cabinet choices in this sub.  They just need to be presented in an unbiased fashion.  I think people are just more interested in the level of corruption being shown of late.  Sex with children and satanism are gonna be hard to beat with Trump cabinet pick posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republican or democrat, I think we can agree that we both despise corruption and sexual abuse of children.  Our enemy is not each other but those kinds of people.

       While I agree with your points what I also see happening is that Trump probably knows there's going to be a huge financial recession coming soon enacted by the very same people who did not want him elected in order to undermine this new wave of nationalism that has come about. He is surrounding himself with people he feel would be most helpful as everyone will blame him for the financial downturn.

       It was going to happen either way and you all did it to yourselves when you didn't stand with Bernie against a fucking huge obvious criminal and froze him out.  No, the Republicans didn't do the american thing and defend against this chicanery because he was a socialist Jew from a state that makes ice cream and dreams

       They always go after his cabinet picks... like people at conspiracy give a fuck about that... at least a few try to bring up the Epstein thing. I have a couple of doozies about Trump tucked away... the only reason I don't post them is just cause I know it is what the people trolling this sub want... they want Trump dirt. Can't have it.

       The problem with trump is that his position on tpp and his cabinet picks are antipodal, much like any other opinion he seems to hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he said and what he will do, like any other politician running a campaign, are bound to be vastly different things. Now I'm all for hope but that word was ruined 8 years ago.
