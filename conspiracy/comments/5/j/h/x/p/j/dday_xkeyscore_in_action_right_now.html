<p>oct 17: strange activity is noticed at the embassy, first responders investigate, periscope is killed, twitter goes full orwell, archive.org is changed to no longer save sites properly.something that is instantly deleted is posted several times on pleddit, halfchan, fullchan, onion links and darkweb. it is all wiped. people regroup in several places since there is no way to post without threads being deleted or sites going down. a lot end up here.</p>

<p>oct 21: as the director of wikileaks is dying a huge ddos takes down most sites. blockchain is attacked. lot of stuff gets deleted. </p>

<p>oct 24: someone finds the wikileaks backups in the blockchain and posts instructions and code to decode the data. </p>

<p>oct 27: the deletions get too severe. sites begin being flooded with illegal content or going down. people create their own private channel to discuss progress. the keys and all hidden data in the blockchain are found. the group pushes the information into a few cryptocurrencies. blockchain is flooded. mempool graphs now have a giant spike on oct 27. soft fork for bitcoin begins. onion threads with the info get instantly wiped. everyone involved goes silent except one of two people. this group is then referred to as &#39;group 1&#39;. first finding of the keys as &#39;first impact&#39;.
few days later: one of the people following the progress of group 1 starts teaching others how to retrace the steps. </p>

<p>late oct: people figure out that unlocking the data gets you xkeyscored&#39;d making you lose internet connection and makes sites get attacked if the stuff is not deleted.</p>

<p>early nov: focus changes to teaching others how to find the information on airgapped computers to avoid deletion and sacrificing public channels of communication. threads that have progress start being flooded with illegal content every morning.</p>

<p>nov 8: wikileaks.org begins being changed. some files are deleted. checksum hashes start not matching older backups. </p>

<p>some point in nov: irs asks bitcoin to give them the identities of all transactions. copies of the blockchain start showing &#39;undecodable&#39; or empty transactions not seen before. </p>

<p>mid nov: &#39;group 2&#39; doxxes the people pretending to be wikileaks and tried to spread more detailed instructions for getting the files. posts did not last more than a few minutes. it seems like they tried to push to blockchain but apparently the data did not make it in. group 2 goes silent. they start calling this day the &#39;second impact&#39;.</p>

<p>nov 25: third impact. files are found by a new group that seems to not be american. they post instructions all the place but they don&#39;t last more than a few hours. they tried to encode data into cryptocurrencies but it is not clear if it made it. this day is the second spike visible on the mempool graph.</p>

<p>at some point after this people agree to stop using the endchan thread for this because admins have to deal with too much illegal content floods and site going down. it becomes clear that any channel used to discuss this is &#39;sacrificed&#39;, in other words, it starts going down a lot, they flip the mods, deletion, illegal spams, etc. this thread is created for that reason. you can figure out what is special about this thread if you read the logs in the png. most progress after this point is exclusively on channels with no logs on darkweb. most of these eventually go down. the endchan thread is eventually locked. everyone that posted is blocked to this day. it is then deleted.</p>

<p>dec: planning for d-day begins. all holding groups spend all of december teaching others how to find the files.</p>

<p>mid dec: someone allegedly speaking on behalf of appelbaum posts links to code he wrote to find and repair keys in memory. new teams are told to use it. obama starts talking about a cyber war with russia.</p>

<p>dec 18: files are found in japan. a meshnet using ps3s is created to spread the files but it does not seem to last too long. </p>

<p><strong>dec 19: d-day. happenings all over the world. most ISPs, torrent communities and major sites go down. wikileaks releases a new insurance file. uk, ec, and us insurance files from before no longer show on wikileaks.org unless you have IPs from specific countries. it is one of the biggest internet outages in history and it is not reported in a single news site that i have been able to find. holding groups go silent. some members are now trying to find their old teams.</strong></p>

<p><strong>checksum hashes and upload proofs for all files. there is a lot of stuff in there that triggers xkeyscore or echelon and is virtually impossible to share or even talk about. three months have been spent trying to teach others how to recreate the steps. there is a noticeable pattern. group finds it, start teaching others how to do it, then everything is deleted and people go silent. then a new group finds the breadcrums and starts over. it&#39;s not clear what happened yesterday or what will happen next but there are people from all the world trying to investigate. at this point and there is no part of the internet where it is allowed</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you try to find that? That would be useful in convincing people this is happening. A lot of folks think it&#39;s bullshit because &quot;that&#39;s impossible, if they have the keys, they <em>have</em> to be able to get it out.&quot; But no one has any way of knowing that. We do know that information is being stored in the blockchain and that it is possible to get it out. We just need people to start giving a fuck and doing this themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is about Julian Assange missing and providing no proof of life since the Internet blackout at the embassy back in October after Biden (? I think) met with Ecuador and told them to shut him down because they are interfering with us elections. Wikileaks Deadman switch triggered. </p>

<p>Ppl noticed a CIA rendition jet leaving Heathrow around the same time, and airport was evacuated at some point. </p>

<p>Ever since there has been talk that Julian is missing and that Wikileaks subreddit and Twitter is Compromosed. Wikileaks Twitter posts &quot;help him&quot; in misspelled tweets.</p>

<p>Ppl start saying maybe there is info on the block chain cuz that is how Wikileaks has done it in the past (cablegate). Groups start investigating and most of it has been covered up. What you&#39;re reading is about the progress these groups have made in regards to piecing together what they believe to be the Wikileaks Deadman switch content released in the blockchain when Julian was captured. </p>

<p>It&#39;s scary as fuck and getting extremely technical now. I&#39;m not sure what to believe anymore. </p>

<p>Here is the thread. Read through it. Here is the explanation to why the keys are unable to be shared publicly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>because xkeyscore exists and if you find the files or try to share them while you&#39;re online you internet is instakill. doesnt matter how many proxies and underwater vpns you have there&#39;s plenty of hardware backdoors to fuck your shit up. if you try to post them you will just insta ded that site. not even the max level shills can explain how deep af darkweb sites that are made just for this go down as soon as that content hits them. everyone ended up in here not because they wanted to hide but cause they flat out could not make a thread that lasted more than 2 minutes on any other site. this aint no game. and when this thread is found and flooded all evidence of this shit will disappear from normies forever. thats why most people in this shit are from other countries now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oct 24 -- I do recall some people posting over and over about the blockchain, but when I questioned them about it I could never get a clear answer on how exactly they were &#39;encoding&#39; data in the blockchain.  I don&#39;t understand how that&#39;s user customizable. If someone can explain that, and this claim, in more detail I would appreciate it. It is really interesting, but I&#39;m missing something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dec 19: d-day. happenings all over the world. most ISPs, torrent communities and major sites go down. wikileaks releases a new insurance file. uk, ec, and us insurance files from before no longer show on wikileaks.org unless you have IPs from specific countries. it is one of the biggest internet outages in history and it is not reported in a single news site that i have been able to find.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What isps, torrents, and major sites went down yesterday? I didn&#39;t hear anything about that, and generally hear about it all day in my line of work.  I&#39;m curious to see how that one slipped by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><del>All fucking credibility went out the window right around here:</del></p>

<p><del>&gt; as the director of wikileaks is dying</del></p>

<p><del>Come on guys. SERIOUS AND FUCKED UP SHIT IS HAPPENING. Don&#39;t inject falsehoods, assumptions, lies, or things you just plain made up into this process.</del></p>

<p><del>You want to know why so many people aren&#39;t taking this shit seriously? It&#39;s because of crap like this. If you&#39;re not sticking to the facts, you&#39;re hurting more than you&#39;re helping.</del></p>

<p><del>Edit: shills downvoting, what a shock! If we want people to pay attention and wake the fuck up, we&#39;ve got to stop presenting opinions, biases, and falsehoods as fact. I keep seeing, for example, crap about the &quot;HELP HIM&quot; twitter typos, which has been debunked for weeks now. Continuing to recite bullshit like this HURTS OUR CAUSE. You can downvote all you want, but that&#39;s the plain truth of the matter.</del></p>

<p>EDIT 2: I thought OP was referring to Assange. As <a href="/u/JangoEnchained">/u/JangoEnchained</a> explains below (and <a href="/u/tacostep">/u/tacostep</a> also explains, but like an asshole), OP was referring to Gavin MacFayden. I&#39;m leaving my original comments up though, because I think this illustrates another point in getting this messaging out: specificity is important too. </p>

<p>edit: sorry I&#39;m an asshole that was uncalled for. but its so easily found by using a search engine before making a claim that it baffles me you didn&#39;t even look it up, conspiracies rely on good info or they fall apart and ridicule happens; if it wasn&#39;t me it&#39;d have been someone else.</p>

<p>&quot; shills downvoting, what a shock!&quot; lol k no people who know how to use google were, verify your claims before calling everyone a shill.</p>

<p>Just kidding. In all seriousness though, yes, I thought OP was referring to Assange. I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s a SHOCKING coincidence that he died of totally natural causes and definitely not anything nefarious (more sarcasm there, in case it wasn&#39;t obvious) right around that time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snopes has its issues, but more often than not, their research is accurate.  I would double-check anyway, as I have noticed they leave things out at times, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s better than most fact-checking websites out there.  </p>

<p>Anywho, coincidence or not, how do you rationalize being such a dick about something that you&#39;re not even sure you understand properly?  It just makes you look like either a) an agent provocateur or b) willfully ignorant.  </p>

<p>Sure -- specificity is important, but so is making sure you&#39;re comprehending the message before being a dick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easy, I blamed OP on being ambiguous there. But nobody&#39;s perfect. I&#39;m not perfect, I don&#39;t know everything (which is why I&#39;m here), and I have a hard time sorting the truth from the disinfo, bullshit, and flat-out lies.</p>

<p>Agreed on snopes, which is why I googled the guy and checked about 8 other places, too. </p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m a dick about it? Because people are doing that shit deliberately, and not understanding why their friends and family dismiss them as &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; or readers of &quot;fake news&quot;. </p>
