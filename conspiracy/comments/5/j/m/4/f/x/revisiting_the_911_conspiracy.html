        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Global Resource Problems</strong></p>

<p>In the early late 70’s / early 80’s a report was done for the Carter administration. Referred to as the Global 2000, it outlined a bleak forecast for the state of the earth and it’s resources by the year 2000. With much skepticism, under the United States state department, Alexander Hiag and Henry Kissinger outlined a set of global policies that countries should adhere to. In 1992, at a conference in Rio de Janeiro, it was presented to the United Nations as Agenda 21. This agenda continues to drive our ecological initiatives in regards to climate change today.</p>

<p>Sustainability guidelines for the past few decades have been given to countries outlining what is needed to maintain a sustainable earth. They include land management, animal management, resource management, and the flexibility for countries to develop their own policies and guidelines. Any biological, chemical, and or physical methods are assumed options. Recently this initiative has been renamed the 2030 Agenda.</p>

<p><strong>The COG</strong></p>

<p>In 1982, under the Ronald Regan administration, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney architected a doomsday scenario government function referred to as “Continuation of Government” (COG). It was conceived to support the nation after a major catastrophe such as a nuclear attack. In such an event, the vice president of the united states would take control over government operations and work to keep basic civilization needs functioning. The COG not only has the ability to operate outside of the US Constitution for ultimate control, it works above the federal level. It was later referred to as the “War Council”.</p>

<p>By the year 2000, leaders of the world realized they had failed in meeting the requirements outlined in the Global 2000 report. They failed to create the sustainable world envisioned for the year 2000 - the only option for a course of action would be to take drastic measures.</p>

<p><strong>9/11</strong></p>

<p>On September 11, 2001 an extremely sophisticated operation took place. The “terrorist” events of 9/11 put wheels in motion to allow the US to perform unquestionably in other countries under the premise it was working to eradicate the threat of terrorism.  9/11 was a calculated operation coordinated by Al-Qaeda forces with funding from Saudi Arabia. The threat of terrorist activity drove enough fear into the public to not question the US military’s actions in other countries.  The &quot;War on Terror” campaign not only allows for the take over of countries to eradicate terrorist threats, but also allows for control of the land. The US has a history with Saudi Arabia, as they have been bailing the US banks out since the Nixon administration. The US also developed a uniquely close relationship with the American ambassador of Saudi Arabia, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan. As the US invaded necessary territories, the areas rich in oil were handed to Saudi Arabia’s oil conglomerate OPEC, giving them full control of production.</p>

<p>The 9/11 attack triggered the COG, which allowed the US to function in a doomsday state scenario enforcing the policies for which it can function. The intention was to keep the COG in place until the threat had been defeated.</p>

<p>If Global 2000 had a highly desired outcome for a certain year, when the world arrived to that year with less than optimal results, I speculate the need to take drastic measures would be required. If that’s the case, I imagine those measures would look very similar to the reported activity of the &quot;War on Terror&quot;. This activity would also easily allow for the most highly controversial factor outlined in the Global 2000 report to be addressed; concerns with the increasing  POPULATION OF HUMANS IN THE WORLD.</p>

<p>If what is being speculated is true, then the war on terror is not a war on extremist factions, but on a terror that is a fear of the future world. This would also entail keeping the COG functioning until the world, it’s resources, and more importantly it’s population are in a controllable state.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Operations</strong></p>

<p>The state department and supreme courts have often been given the excuse from officials that they can’t reveal or report information because they are not at liberty to, due to control of departments they can’t discuss.</p>

<p>It’s been reported that the state department has a secret team referred to as the “7th Floor Group”, which includes the secretary of state. The group operates in secrecy, primarily meeting once a week to review and craft information for releases in agreement with the Freedom of Information Act. It’s said that they coordinate with an another “Shadow Government” — they are most likely referring to the COG.</p>

<p>The FBI has an email regarding Hillary Clinton titled &quot;The Clinton-Slaughter view of the world” (Anne-Mari Slaughter was policy planner for the state department). The email outlines a curious concept of establishing policies for societies that can function with the ability to influence government. To expand on all that, there has been a centuries long paranoia that the powers at be have been conspiring to form a “new world order” (NWO) to things. This NWO, would ideally operate as a totalitarian world government. The groundwork is suspiciously being laid out with the establishment of heavily influencing Think Tanks and councils associated with the UN, such as the Council of Foreign Relations and Project for the New American Century. These think tanks bring large corporations and world leaders together to conspire outside of their respective governments. Such major financial influencers are billionaires George Soros, an ex Goldman Sachs CEO / current Head of Immigration for the UN, Peter Sutherland. Not only do they heavily drive the destabilization of countries through the promotion of activist groups such as <a href="http://www.moveon.org">www.moveon.org</a>, but they have an obsession with open boarders and immigration strategies to bring large groups of different cultures together in an antagonistic way.</p>

<p><strong>Controlling the Public</strong></p>

<p>In addition to creating a NWO, a major initiative seems to be to disarm the public. The war on terror also allows governments to push an anti-firearm agenda.  We know that the FBI actively and publicly stages terrorist attacks. Are 911, Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, and the Comet Pizza gunman among them? This activity would give legitimacy to the funding toward the “War on Terror”, and help governments drive initiatives to disarm their people. By dividing the people with civil tension, disarming them, and getting the public to distrust the police, the powers of the COG could overthrow local law enforcement with the application of military police.</p>

<p>From a economic standpoint, a continuous pattern of bankruptcy and debt has been allowed to take place worldwide. The banks that fund the governments play a large part in the lobbying for financial polices and laws that work in their favor. In doing so, the banking companies have been able to create economies based on fraud around that world, and economies that have destroyed middle classes and put the people in endless debt to them.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>  Is it a coincidence many countries enacted population control regulations and methodologies, and introduced controversial food additives in the 80’s?</li>
<li>  Is it a coincidence the COG was initiated under the vice presidency of the man who helped create it?</li>
<li>  If the COG is still active, who would be heading it?</li>
<li>  Is it a coincidence the US can never justify it’s invasions into most countries?</li>
<li>  Is it a coincidence the US continually “mistakenly” bombs heavily populated public establishments such as schools and hospitals during invasions?</li>
<li>  Is it a coincidence the US’s activities with abortion clinics have been highly questionable in terms of human rights.</li>
<li>  Is it a coincidence the US has been tied to heavily funding the terrorist groups they once created? The same groups that traffic opium, sex, people, and weapons? Not to mention the multitudes of pedophile rings reported “untouchable” by the FBI for decades!</li>
<li>  Why is the US involved in a handful of wars that are barely covered in western corporate controlled media?</li>
<li>  Why are large groups of children often reported missing upon the US’s military intervention in other countries?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>It is very hard to not draw a conclusion that our world governments are slowly using decades of time to hide patterns of deceptive activity that would otherwise be noticeable in news. It’s hard not to think the US is leading a NATO coalition of the genocide of people along with an objective to obtain control over natural resources. If this is the case, the initiative is done under the veil of a war on terrorism with the moral justification that it is for ecological reasons. It’s also hard to not think the US is part of a plan working to create a unified government; a government designed to control the people and resources, and create an economy successful only to the bankers who fuel the governments and the politicians they corrupt.</p>

<p>Some think America never won the revolution against England, and that England has been a puppet master to the US for some time. Some think the country was overthrown by the families that control the banks when the Federal Reserve was put into place and is run by the Jesuits behind the Vatican ( The Vatican’s think Tank the Club of Rome is said to have largely contributed to the Global 2000 report ). Some think this is an advanced extraterrestrial attack. I’m not sure, maybe all of that; but if anything, it seems something much more deceptive than a fight against terrorism is currently happening.</p>

<p>For Donald Trump to make America, and for us to make the the world great, the US needs to end the “War on Terror” campaign. We all need to reevaluate the Earth’s ecology; find out if there really is a problem.  Nations needs to end their dependence on central banks and also perhaps better understand the intentions of the UN.</p>

<p>If none of this is the case, and I’m delusional, we as people should take this as warning because regardless, we are setting the world up for domination. Be sure to check out the video at the first link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you heard of George Webb&#39;s investigative youtube series, Where is Eric Braverman?  </p>

<p>He hits on much of what you are analyzing.  There is a powerful faction (basically headed by Hillary Clinton) involving a few key people- Senators, military generals, CIA, NATO, bankers/billionaires who are responsible for the destabilizing and toppling of the Middle East after 911.  They then take the money, oil and natural resources and even children.  Many people have been compromised into participating or looking the other way at the atrocities occurring.</p>

<p>The immediate concern is they are also involved in human trafficking, largely in Haiti.  Numerous journalists who have investigated have ended up dead.</p>

<p>What you wrote gives good background to the how and why this is happening.</p>
