    <div class="md"><p>Ditto. The first Mandela Effect I remember was in 2004, when a girl in my class was reading a book that wouldn&#39;t be published for another 6 years. I also remember hearing the news that Billy Graham died... twice. And watching his funeral both times. Motherfucker&#39;s still alive and those funerals were not false memories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, his &quot;first&quot; death happened in 2005. His &quot;second&quot; death was just after Obama was inaugurated. I remember watching one of the funerals with my mom (who rightly never cared for or about TV preachers) and the other funeral with my dad, who for some reason acts like Billy Graham is the closest we&#39;ll ever get to seeing God on earth. My dad doesn&#39;t cry, but he bawled his eyes out during the funeral that didn&#39;t happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Changing the past does not change people&#39;s memories. Sure, one can go back and undo stuff now (but everyone still remembers it) </p>

<p>Hillary ended up causing a Nuclear war that basically sends the human race underground for 10,000 years, folks had to mess with time itself and team up with Russia to pull off getting Trump elected, (people still complain)</p>

<p>Test your timeline: As long as Vader says &quot;No, I am your Father&quot; in Star Wars then all is well, (&quot;No&quot; is from the timeline where there are &quot;no nukes&quot;) where as if you find yourself in a timeline where Vader says &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot; then &#39;Luke&#39; is a timeline marker for &#39;Nuke&#39;.</p>

<p>An easier way to tell:
Berenstain bears = NO NUKES
Berenstien bears = NUKES
Vader say NO = NO NUKES
Vader says LUKE = NUKES</p>

<p>(always keep a copy of Star Wars and a bears coloring book around, check the cover daily)</p>

<p>Why? 
Because when you change time people&#39;s memory does not change too, which is why people think Vader says &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot; because he DID, and your memory is correct, but time has been altered. Same with Berenstien bears, yes, it used to be Berenstien, but now it&#39;s &quot;Berenstain&quot;, which is good. and no, your not crazy, but you would be wise &quot;not to talk about it&quot;...</p>

<p>So... What one CAN do, is try to shift events so certain things do not happen. Which is why we have both &quot;short grey&#39;s&quot; and &quot;tall whites&quot;, both are evolutionary descendants of the human race from 2 timelines. There are no Aliens, only humans who continue to &quot;evolve&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a 10 month-old account with zero karma replying to a comment I made four months ago with a warning &quot;not to talk about it.&quot; Given that there is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BANdelaEffect/comments/5717lp/government_shills_are_real_and_evidence_suggests/">coordinated effort to control the Mandela Effect narrative</a>, I&#39;m extremely suspicious of these circumstances.</p>

<p>I <strong>will not</strong> stop talking about the Mandela Effect. </p>

<p>I <strong>will not</strong> stop warning people about shills.</p>

<p>I <strong>will</strong> continue to encourage people to visit <a href="/r/Retconned">/r/Retconned</a> where people are free to share their Mandela Effect experiences without concern trolls telling people &quot;not to talk about it.&quot;</p>

<p>As for your <em>speculation</em> (because that&#39;s exactly what it is--speculation without evidence), I <strong>do not</strong> believe that the Mandela Effect is related to time travel simply because it doesn&#39;t sufficiently explain changes to astronomy, geography, anatomy, and sunlight. </p>

<p>What I believe the Mandela Effect is and why open discussion of it is strongly discouraged by people like yourself is because it&#39;s a positive shift in human consciousness. There are many elite interests who don&#39;t want the masses to question reality, let alone discover how powerful they truly are, so they are doing everything they can to suppress it.</p>

<p>Because it threatens them. The idea that reality is an illusion is an idea that terrifies a lot of people, so they attack it out of reflex. Attack the threat before it causes you to start to ask yourself deeply uncomfortably questions about existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Mandela effect is a trollspiracy that takes advantage of the inherent inaccuracies of the human memory to make lulz at people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always been Berenstain.  I remember it from childhood.  It&#39;s always been, &quot;No, <strong>I</strong> am your father.&quot;  i remember that from childhood, too.</p>

<p>So, look.  We&#39;re facing real actual issues like the US arming terrorists and using them to force its own agenda.  Like people who attempt to whistleblow and expose the government for its awful lies and cheats and then are forced into exile at best, captured, tortured, or murdered at worst.  Like the weapons and drugs our government pushes through intermediaries to soak up the cash flows of other countries.</p>

<p>So I see the Mandela effect as a cute little side show that hides the insidious truths that happen day in and day out.</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right that we&#39;re being lied to, but you&#39;re wrong as to what lies are the real problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t corruption, just that the mandela effect exists as well. The actress that played dolly says she did not wear braces, but no one supports that claim, everyone remembers that character as being iconic FOR her braces (commercials, pop culture references, etc). But the physical evidence has been tampered with. VHS tapes sitting in attics have signs of digital alteration (which should be &#39;impossible&#39;), frame by frame gifs can easily be found in Google search showing manipulation. I think it&#39;s easier to discount the mandela effect than to try to wrap your head around it, the implications are mind-blowing</p>

<p>I think the new Shazaam claim that it was Sinbad is a troll. I think someone saw a picture of what Sinbad looks like now 20 or however many years on and thought it would be funny to say he was in Shazaam. I always remember it as Shaq.</p>

<p>Berenstain was always Berenstein to me, but I could see how so many teachers could read it wrong outloud with it&#39;s most common lettering and just seeing the first bit of the name and mentally filling n the rest (like those sentences of misspelled words you can read as long as the first word is correct and all the letters there). Or it may even be possible they pronounced it stein? I know a Krueger that pronounces it like Kreiger.</p>

<p>As for the other most common Australia being so close to other lands. I remembered it from school being alone out there with NZ, but I think those memories are based off of shitty continent work sheets that often do not include all the island nations because they aren&#39;t one of the continents.

    <div class="md"><p>So the belief on this theory that it is merely a psyop with small inaccuracies is the most logical. They are throwing out very small insignificant things, like a word change usually from movies. Really who cares! The more we analyse these things to death, the more they have won! Now if whole things changed like instead of the Macy&#39;s Parade it was the Bloomingdale&#39;s parade. Something completely different to the actual facts. Not just remembering but something that no one can dispute that was around at the time. There also are videos, books and newspaper clippings that can be veriifed on these. 
We can not allow anyone to make us think that things are changing. They are NOT. We just have corrupt gov. groups intent and ready to pull Operation Blue Book at any time. Just take a look at CERN and what they are up to.Most believe CERN is the cause of the Mandella Effect because of their quantum Physics computers which can make things be in many places at the same time. They are bad news people! They have been allowing rifts in time from another dimension to open up and other things get thru. This is the much more alarming issue here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Changing the past does not change people&#39;s memories. Sure, one can go back and undo stuff now (but everyone still remembers it) 
Hillary ended up causing a Nuclear war that basically sends the human race underground for 10,000 years, folks had to mess with time itself and team up with Russia to pull off getting Trump elected, (people still complain)</p>

<p>Test your timeline: As long as Vader says &quot;No, I am your Father&quot; in Star Wars then all is well, (&quot;No&quot; is from the timeline where there are &quot;no nukes&quot;) where as if you find yourself in a timeline where Vader says &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot; then &#39;Luke&#39; is a timeline marker for &#39;Nuke&#39;.</p>

<p>An easier way to tell:
Berenstain bears = NO NUKES
Berenstien bears = NUKES
Vader say NO = NO NUKES
Vader says LUKE = NUKES</p>

<p>(always keep a copy of Star Wars and a bears coloring book around, check the cover daily)</p>

<p>Why? 
Because when you change time people&#39;s memory does not change too, which is why people think Vader says &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot; because he DID, and your memory is correct, but time has been altered. Same with Berenstien bears, yes, it used to be Berenstien, but now it&#39;s &quot;Berenstain&quot;, which is good. and no, your not crazy, but you would be wise &quot;not to talk about it&quot;...</p>

<p>So... What one CAN do, is try to shift events so certain things do not happen. Which is why we have both &quot;short grey&#39;s&quot; and &quot;tall whites&quot;, both are evolutionary descendants of the human race from 2 timelines. There are no Aliens, only humans who continue to &quot;evolve&quot;.</p>

Instead of focusing on fixing what is broken, or taking part in instituting meaningful change, they&#39;re convinced the Earth is hollow or lizard people run things or the Earth is flat or it&#39;s all a computer simulation. People are so broken that they are rejecting reality and as more and more people reject reality the system will begin to collapse. If we cannot agree that the fucking planet is round, or reality is real, we&#39;re never going to agree on anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone must have made a post about it in 2013 when I used to go on r/glitch_in_the_matrix a lot. It struck me as odd at the time because I had believed Nelson Mandela to be dead for years. So I wrote my own post about it and the next day he died. Well, he did in this universe.</p>
