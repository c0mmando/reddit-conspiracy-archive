        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From the article...</p>

<p>*The mainstream media has been busy at work admonishing the alternative media, trying to accuse us of being fake news… But if the alternative media did not exist, who would be around to call the mainstream media out on their “fake news”?</p>

<p>The New York Times has been caught in a blatant lie, a lie so blatant in fact, that the outlet was forced to issue an embarrassing correction on their own article after being called on it.*</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the NYT&#39;s most recent position has been to beat the drums in its editorial section for ending the electoral college. They even went as far as citing their opposition goes all the way back to 1936. </p>

<p>They left out one crucial tidbit. It was a big one, too. It was a little something about how they <strong>defended</strong> the electoral college in 2000 when it gave GWB the presidency.</p>

<p>Ooops. </p>

<p>They issued this apology on 12.20.16.</p>

<p><em>&quot;An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that the editorial board has been opposed to the Electoral College going back 80 years. It failed to note an exception: in 2000, the board defended the college after the election of George W. Bush.&quot;</em></p>

<p>And, one last thing of note. This quote by David Rockefeller was uttered at the 1991 Bilderberg meeting. Make of it what you will.</p>

<p><em>“We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years… It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries.”</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess but imo it&#39;s cuz the idea behind globalization could be good and liberal but in practice it&#39;s just letting bankers force austerity on people and steal land. Not so leftwing in practice. a libertarian would say just get rid of big govt and leave them alone, unfortunately it&#39;s not realistic, you&#39;d still be getting screwed over by private bankers and corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, I guess what I was trying to say was more that it&#39;s not the whole of the right, but a specific faction thereof. </p>

<p>I think the biggest problem with either the left or the right writ large is that they both correctly identify a source of corruption and exploitation — the right see it as the state and the left as the corporations — yet both fail to see that the other (the corporations or the state) are just as bad, and would be relatively worse without the other. </p>

<p>Very few seem to see centralization of power as the root cause and enabling factor of the exploitation by both. </p>

<p>That said, people here are currently crusading against Snopes, partly because it&#39;s run by only a few people.  </p>

<p>How many people do you think run MyDailySheeple?  Two - what appear to be a husband and wife team.  Kind of like how Snopes used to be.</p>

<p>My ONLY point here is that people should apply the same scrutiny they do with Snopes to other media, like TheDailySheeple.  Be skeptical of ALL media and read their sources (when available) for yourself.</p>

<p>That quote from Rockefeller is almost certainly fake. It sounds like satire and it uses a word (autodetermination) that&#39;s not even an English word. This quote was published in a French newspaper and <em>autodétermination</em> is the French word for self-determination.

<p>The quote seems to have a rather contentious history, according to <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Rockefeller">wikiquotes</a>. </p>

<p>Given that wikipedia/quotes/etc began with noble intent, it&#39;s also said to be a tool of the CIA for its propaganda. Considering the sensitivity of the subject matter and the person to whom it&#39;s attributed, it seems probable the quote is accurate. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think this is a dangerous trap to fall into. While I don&#39;t doubt that Rockefeller holds views similar to those expressed in the quote, we don&#39;t gain any credibility in using that assumption to say the quote is probably true. From the wikiquotes talk page, the only sources seem to be a few right wing French publications, who apparently got the quote from anonymous leaker. I don&#39;t trust anonymous sources when they come from the government, and I also don&#39;t trust them when they come from sources that would confirm my biases. </p>

<p>This quote may reinforce the opinions of those who already agree with you, but its use will discredit your argument in the minds of those who are not already convinced. They will go to wikiquotes as I did, see that there is no reliable source for the quote, and dismiss you as a simple conspiracy theorist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s cool. People should make up their own minds.</p>

<p>As I said, it was included within the article itself; I&#39;m not the author of the article nor is it something I randomly decided to included within the body of the post in an attempt to make it seem as if it&#39;s part of what I linked to. Many people have already made up their minds about the wikis solely due to the possibility of CIA involvement. </p>

<p>Your seeming &quot;concern&quot; about my &quot;argument&quot; is disingenuous. I posted an article within this, the conspiracy, sub. It&#39;s something people do regularly. That someone posts within this sub is cause for some people to dismiss them as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; from the get go, depending on their confirmation bias. Of course, with everything that&#39;s finally coming out, that label is practically a badge of honour given the term&#39;s origins. </p>

<p>Your opinion/dismissal of me doesn&#39;t negate the fact that the NYT was caught being shady with regards to its positioning about the electoral college on its editorial pages. If you choose to disregard it, that&#39;s your choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re not the author of the article, but when asked about the source, you did say &quot;it seems probable the quote is accurate,&quot; so to that extent, you&#39;re defending it&#39;s validity. Wikiquotes is somewhat secondary. It being CIA-compromised does not mean its dispute of the quote is evidence of its accuracy; the issue is that there are not any good on-the-record sources for it in the first place. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not concern-trolling nor dismissing you; feel free to browse my comment history. I do agree with the general thrust of the article, but I find unsourced or poorly-sourced quotes detract from the credibility of the argument, not add to it. The article stands on its own without it. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like that the quote was included within the article, you should contact the author and let them know how/why you feel about it. </p>

<p>As for the possibility of the CIA&#39;s involvement in wikis, from where I&#39;m sitting it absolutely does play into being able to accurately source the quote; I included my opinion after listing the most common, and often questionable, source. The person it&#39;s attributed to and where it&#39;s said to have been spoken make it plausible that the actual quotes would&#39;ve been scrubbed from the publications it appeared in. </p>

<p>Regardless, I should&#39;ve disregarded your initial comment as I didn&#39;t write the article, so lesson learned. Similarly, since you feel so strongly about it, you should contact the author with your concerns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm New York (City) Times wants New York City voters to have the authority to silence entire regions of our country because they alone are intelligent and wise enough to understand the need to elect incredibly corrupted Democrats with a Globalist First America Last foreign policy basically is what&#39;s needed. Basically equals Jesus giving Santa  a hand with the presents. Tie that superior plan together with murky swamp water visibility level tax policy that publicly states lies about cutting the middle class taxes. And privately Wall Street speeches they&#39;ll promise the opposite, nothing but middle class hikes while approving every crazy merger. Also we not only coronated them we are completely okay with the fact that  lies cheating and stealing the primary away was just excellent and worthy of our admiration.  We also think accepting millions upon millions of dollars from countries that happily murder people remotely suspected of homosexuality is not only no biggie, but just another reason to high five our endorsement. So piss off America the Entitled  Urban  Elite with apartments paid for thanks to daddy get to beach this ship called America. This will be your president you cousin kissing morons and if you don&#39;t like it your gonna FEAR our next pick. Holy shnikes thank you mighty NYT I&#39;m shocked you&#39;re selling half your building </p>

<p>This page opposed the Electoral College in 1936, and in more recent years as well. In 2004, President George W. Bush won the popular vote by more than three million, but he could have lost the Electoral College with a switch of fewer than 60,000 votes in Ohio.</p>

<p>Also THEY ADMIT THEY GOT IT WRONG. They did not lie intentionally to mislead the readers, they made a genuine mistake, which we all do sometimes. They have stood against the electoral college going back 80 years, except on ONE occasion.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is it just me or does the actual wording in the article make it sound like they opposed the Electoral College in 1936 and then not opposing it again until 2004 onward? Thus it not being a continuous 80 years even without the 2000 exception?</p>

<p>This might sound confusing, but here&#39;s what I mean:</p>

<p>In the article linked in <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/opinion/time-to-end-the-electoral-college.html">OP</a>, it says (my emphasis):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This page opposed the Electoral College <strong>in 1936, and</strong> in more recent years as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The articles that are linked to the words &quot;more recent years&quot; are opposing the electoral college for the election years <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/14/opinion/drop-out-of-the-college.html">2004</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/opinion/20thu1.html">2008</a>, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/opinion/the-tarnish-of-the-electoral-college.html">2012</a>.</p>

<p>Even without the correction, it read to me as they were either for or neutral towards the electoral college between 1936-2004.</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably just over analyzing it, but that&#39;s how I would have taken the quoted sentence before being told they were trying to imply opposition all the way from 1936 until now.  </p>
