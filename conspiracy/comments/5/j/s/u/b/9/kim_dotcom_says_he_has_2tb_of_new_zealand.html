       Yeah. He got some legitimacy with the early mention of Wikileaks having Clinton information, but threw it all away with showboating.

       He isn't necessarily a liar so much as someone that did something that didn't work out as he intended. No one wants to tell the truth of their mistakes. That isn't a criminal, its a tolerable man, subjected to intolerable things. With a moral conscious and regret for his mistakes. So pardon him for having the conscious mind that you yourself seem to neglect. Parading about law as if it were infoulable while allowing the real criminals to cheat lie and steal in your own protection. Id rather be a criminal than evil itself, and the iron curtain that protects it-

       That is a personal judgement; I don't believe that he needed to be addressed in the way he was; He has a family and family life that didn't need to be subjected to public ridicule, an armed intrusion, nor an alienated search. I would truthfully not wish this on any "criminal" nor human being that is a known non aggressive party.

       If his kids were home by example, they will be permanently victimized and considerably jaded to trust LEO's in active duty;
      </p>
      <p>
       People have consciousness and are inherently vulnerable to long lasting psychological damages in these actions. Public embarrassment, and being defunded so you are without ability to pursuit an active defense team by example seems rather below our country to impose on an international citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may be too morally minded by our planets standards - 
Between the black and white of law; There is a moral responsibility in which law does not address; The more it persists, the more we die as a race. Sure data and actions can be in fact illegal; I am not arguing that. But if your a team of soldiers with high power automatic weapons actively engaging a home where fragile minds are consistently aware of your being. What makes you any better?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a sad world sometimes. I don't believe that two wrongs meet a right in any regard, nor that this qualifies as an act of valiance we should consider was tried and true. If anything it just makes my own world that much sadder that people can be so inconsiderate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't blame them; Its just something that should have been avoided entirely. There were work around's in that regard. 
There always is...

       His model while used illegally, wasn't a faceted bracket in criminology. It was a standard business model no different then one-drive. 
Google is just an empire that can handle the situation because they were government approved. Not like microsoft and google aren't also being used to transfer illegal data. Not like yahoo and reddit itself don't host illegal data. Or facebook. Seems rather biased to attack only one company isn't it. Or are we to believe they simply don't. Because I assure you respectively they factually do - Hundreds if not thousands of times a day.

       From what I read mega complied with a vast majority of desist letters.
      </p>
      <p>
       This wasn't a man who gave them the finger. When companies requested to have materials removed he complied. They are assessing the ease of people / users rehosting, as him being complicit in mishandling his own company.
      </p>
      <p>
       That does not go on to say i've read everything about the case, but from what I have it greatly goes against your main points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again. Personal attacks. 
I truly pity your moral compass. You need to do some self reflecting. Every user on reddit is watching you a grown person, act like an irrational child. That is how you represent yourself. A child throwing a tantrum. I truly hope you take sometime to get to know yourself. Because today and now. You truly are rather unlikable.

       So your telling me reddit independantly scans every post I place prior to posting it online. That isn't how this works. You should talk to mods about how many times a day they personally remove illegal materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see we can't monitor the human psyche in advance. 
If your proving to charge that any company is doing this by comparison, you would be wrong. Because again. All companies host data without simply looking into it. It is only when it is brought to their attention that it is removed. You can't argue that point. Because that is exactly how it works I am afraid-

       Your anger is laughable. If users rehost content it isn't up to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He leases content space. He can't monitor 3.4 million users. Hence the need for desist letters, that he complied with. It would be different if he didn't comply with them. But he did; Every time. Sorry that your upset that people are inherently good at heart. I can see that not being your own personal philosophy; Judging by your anger. You should take more time to practice peace in your own life, and learn basic forgiveness. Your demons are strong. Good day.

       He never gave anyone anything. Look your wanting to fight but hold no validity in your arguments, and your childish attitude isn't helping you win points in the world. He has a large staff. The workload is impossible to meet. For any team. Furthermore you still haven't addressed why every .com can do it accept him. Hence reddit mods finding sick shit and illegal data everyday. Should the owners of reddit's families be raided and guns be stuck in their innocent childrens faces. This was never about morality. But morally, any person with common sense could argue that as taking things too far. Your obviously ok with it. So find a book on the art of taoism, and learn basic composure; 
You have no self reasoning; It is anger channeled by ignorance. I forgive you; But you need to learn more about basic human nature, and being kind to your fellow man. My guess is your were abused alot as a kid. And I really am sorry for that. Take care friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to explain why google reddit youtube and facebook can do it, but kim couldn't; Please be my guest. Because they do it everyday. The main answer is. You can't because factually kim was subjected to intolerant things. Which means I just won my argument until you can gain your composure and explain it. 
Good luck, and sorry again for your impositions.

       So you should petition the reddit admins to having their homes raided and their children forced into gunpoint because users here break the law everyday. You should throw in this request to imgur, and facebook. Youtube. Or you know. Maybe go after those that are actually breaking the law by stealing and exchanging the content. If they did that from the first place, and cracked down on it; There wouldn't be a problem. So Kim isn't the problem. He was a business owner. Just like the people that run reddit; Or facebook, and youtube. The only difference was he was a small time player in an otherwise larger game. Hence the brassiness in it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       so don't play devils advocate in an otherwise black and white situation. Kim was treated unfairly; While other "approved assets" are doing the exact same thing; Everyday; Without remorse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again. Now your bolding your key points. Stop holding in the guilt and learn to forgive. This isn't for today and now; But someday you truly will thank me. Good day friend. You have officially lost your argument.

       I well know the difference in their platforms abilities. You do know what hosting data is right. Because they all host data. Illegal data at times, and there truly is no differences. I wouldn't strive to attack my intellect either. Factually your avoiding my argument. Because you have lost your own argument. So pester someone else with your initiations of faulted criticism. My position will and has not changed. Your essential reasoning is to steer around solid points. Which is not a win; It's a tactic 'not to lose'.

       They host a framework for people to interact and discuss
Faceboo only hosts images texts and some videos
Copyright is reported by it's user base as it's main function isn't a file sharing website
It also has links to some news articles externally
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit only literally hosts texts and external links
It is a discussion board

       oh yeah and some subreddit images ahahah

       The instances vary so vastly differently because 
1. none of the above are pimarily a file sharing download site which rebroadcasts it's content without moderation or censorship.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         all of the above have a different purpose other than sharing large amounts of data instantly without moderation or censorhsip
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         All of the above strive and have moderation to an accepted standard as it's main purpose is not to distribute Files on an instant rebroadcasted without moderation basis.
Therefore if "illegal data" is found the above aren't nearly criticized as much as they actually have a function other than sharing vast amounts of data without moderation in an instant rebroadcasted fashion

       If you talk about reddit alone yes. that isn't the point. The point is that the corporations didn't like competition so they axed out the little guy. They openly use both facebook and youtube to host illegal data. Which does host content. I don't see zukerberg in a raid with a gun in his face, and compared to his Psychological studies on unsuspecting users. That literally violate their trust and authorities, without knowledge those crimes are far more serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ya. Mega is a host. Just like them. Why aren't the others held accountable. The answer is Biased law and corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO I stand by my statment again. Kim Got treated far too harshly and it was an abuse of his civil rights. We aren't supposed to do these things to others. Its more criminal than anything he'd done in the first place.

       It wasn't even real child pornography
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        last year the social network partnered up with Microsoft to crack down on child pornography through the use of Microsoft’s PhotoDNA software, which can search through billions of images and identify which of them may be inappropriate.
       </p>
       <p>
        We scan every photo that is uploaded to the site using PhotoDNA to ensure that this illicit material can’t be distributed and we report all instances of exploitative content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. We’ve built complex technical systems that either block the creation of this content, including in private groups, or flag it for quick review by our team of investigations professionals.
       </p>
       <p>
        We’ve worked with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the New York State Attorney General’s Office in the U.S., as well as the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre in the U.K., to use known databases of child exploitive material to improve our detection and bring those responsible to justice
       </p>
       <p>
        However, we’re constantly refining and improving our systems and processes and building upon our relationships with NCMEC and law enforcement agencies specializing in child protection to create an even safer space.
       </p>
       <p>
        if an account is suspected of involvement in “illicit activity,” such as child pornography, the site investigates “associated objects (groups, Pages, and images etc.) and associates.” In addition, all accounts that have been disabled, removed from the site or found to be involved in child pornography activity are preserved in order to aid law enforcement officials should an investigation ensue. The site often brings up such cases with both domestic and international law enforcement to further help in apprehending and convicting those behind the activity.
       </p>
       <p>
        So not only did they work with microsoft to develop technology that would detect pornography they used databses to match against child pornography and worked with law enforcement directly to bring offenders to justice.

      <p>
       Users are abusing an interactive based software to advertise their illicit products 
facebook is not responsible for people abusing their platform to advertise their products
Their illegal product is not distributed through facebook
When facebook is aware of the problem it takes down the groups
Facebook does not host Weapons on it's (that's impossible)
It hosts images of weapons on it's servers.
 it does not sell weapons thought it's servers (that's impossible)
      </p>
      <p>
       you can't distribute drugs through facebook
You have to use physichal methods such as being in person
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook doesn't host children in it's servers or rehome them
(that would be impossible) (children cannot be converted to digital format and stored in facebookservers)

       This is third party advertisement of illegal activity
This isn't

        hosting
       </strong>
       illegal copyrighted data on a instant rebroadcasting manner
      </p>
      <p>
       How can't you see the difference
Illegal data is when you have information about somewhat you are not allowed to have or was gained in an unlawful manner this is third party advertisement of illegal activities in the physichal manner being used on a social media platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no direct culpability.
      </p>
      <p>
       an example of illegal data would be a whistleblower website hosting classified information 
That's is a true example of illegal data as it would show there was a clear intent to distribute illegal data.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm actually starting to think you may have a mental disorder as you can't see the difference between putting illegal things on to a website that hosts them for distribution and somebody advertising illegal things using images or text based discussion
      </p>
      <p>
       The illegal pornography beckoned dedicated software just to detect it and you're saying there is any sort of parellel
betwen that and megafuckboy.cum
      </p>
      <p>
       Face it if megafuckboy.com couldn't handle hosting directly all that illegal copyrighted fileload than it should have diminshed it's operating size there's no excuses when dealing directly with the the questioned illegal products.

aiding drug cartels? not intentionally 
again if you manafacture an ar-15 it's not your fault if a lunatic uses it for a mass shooting
now if you hand it over to him knowing damn well he's going to do it that's a slightly different thing as there are laws against selling weapons to people with disorders etc.

       if there is classified materials on facebook 
i'm sure he's likely to endeavour to remove them as soon as possible however there's no way of knowing what classified materials are beforehand and they dont host files just text or images so no PDFS

       Also just because one is called a social network....
      </p>
      <p>
       And the other is a "file sharing site". Does not negate the criminal complexities involved. Factually many members abuse both networks, and while they attemp to comply the very bulk of the services will always be out manned unless the users themselves are employees. Sure it is easier to shut them down from the top. But calling them apples and oranges does not free them from the cunundrum that they dont share the same purpose because they are packaging them differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you on the other hand. have completely insulted me several times factually. I don't appreciate your aggression's. So maybe you feel I am psychologically damaged because I don't understand the full principals that you inherently are addressing but it give's you not an excuse to persecute me in your anger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Factually I've been quite clear about my position. I myself am a humanitarian that cares for people. I probably don't belong in this world because between the black and the white there is a grey area where morality used to exist. Truly it troubles me that you have seemed to have forgotten that. But I don't call you names because your doing it to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already told you I don't know every detail of the case, but I have told you some pretty compelling arguments that do need addressing. Such as why does zuckerberg get off the hook when he's hosted criminal networks and CP related materials; Yet Kim seems to be a hyper criminal and take responsibility for his users actions. They are both the same business model at a fundamental level. "hey" come share things! Share with your friends and Upload to our servers your personal data so others can see it...
      </p>
      <p>
       80% of the audio content and videos are plagurized that users seem to share on their social feeds everyday. There is every type of illegal material on both networks. So Why does one get a free pass and the other walks free...
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what pisses me off about this. The users are the criminals. Period. The moment they choose to host illegal materials that is who law should punish. And these networks always will be run over hence the materials being there for years without intervention. So to say that they both advertise to share and for users to connect they are no different in that regard. Just named differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also note I have more respect for you for your last message. So please continue to engage in the conversation but shit man please lighten up for your own sake. Your going to give yourself a heart attack; And by all means I am just a curious person talking semantics with you. 
So truly I'd like to know why one can have a server and host illegal data. But the other can't without the full bulk of law ramming its wang down its throats? Is that not a valid question?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean facebook itself is saturated with crimes? How is it truly any better at a fundamental level?

       So your saying they are both complicit but one is a state assisted party so they get a free pass for the same offences. Along with most other sites... Not just facebook. But all servers in the nation hosting illegal data? I don't host data myself. It's not my intent. But those that do on mass scale should all be treated equally. No excuse for that.

       no one is profiting mainly from illegal files being hosted on it's site
      </p>
      <p>
       The other is profiting from users interacting with each other on it's site
      </p>
      <p>
       One doesn't notify the authorities when widespready copyright infringement occurs
      </p>
      <p>
       the other notifies the authorities when a minor instance of copyright infringement occurs
      </p>
      <p>
       In the first case the police are in no position to say that he didn't knowingly allow this copyright infringement to occur
as they havn't been allowed to investigate and see what is possible or reasonable
      </p>
      <p>
       In the other case the police cannot be in a position to say that every effort to obey the law whilst operatin it's business has not been followed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a very simple and huge difference
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep being mad please i don't care you're just sayin the same thing and then turning it into a plot for the authorities to somehow profit from faceboo or whatever your insinuating.

      <p>
       Which is hardly the case it's a case of businesses working with authorities when questionsable acitivities occur within and around their business
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference with megafuckboy wing no schlong is that he was directly hosting the illegal material and rebroadcasting it
      </p>
      <p>
       and he was aware of it everyone was aware of it. he should have provided a back door for authorities to access the material in order to remove it if it violated any laws

       While I am beginning to see the differences fundamentally why is zuckerberg given a free pass being in possession of illegal files in instances where possession is a crime. He is profiting, and possession of stolen property is still an offence? Drop kim. I'd like to know about this other issue entirely...

       I am not saying he didn't know his servers were saturated. but I find it hard to imagine that he willfully was hoping to be a pirates playground. (When he created it); People aren't inherently evil; They make mistakes and I think he can even assist the world if he rededicated himself. Side note, We were all young once, and thought we were invincible-
      </p>
      <p>
       I just hate when law punishes you more then you deserve; That is the difference between justice, and the gross abuse of the system itself. (I'd certainly be happy to hear more details that make him out to be a super pirate), from what i've read I myself am on the fence. (I doubt any 'one' individual would ever know the full story);
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean his servers hold masses of information which are literally endless. (I myself would hate myself to be the guys having to do the forensics on that gig). Like Ok so this is what we found:
      </p>
      <p>
       a googleplex of data. lol. Christ that would take years to sort through. I suppose that is the point though. He provided a service for the many, (originally with a maybe financially minded but rather curious intent), and at this point he is ultimately to blame for everyone else's including his own fuckery. I don't think he himself knows exactly everything that he has been storing;
      </p>
      <p>
       but as far as the situation goes. I just hope he pulls through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a bit of a humanitarian, and rather hope all people will thrive in this world. It's far too difficult to fail, and the situation we face every day only make it that much more difficult to get yourself on the right track. So If he is the devil to you in that regard... (in my opinion), I've seen far worse-

       From someone that's made constant mistakes in my own youth;
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only say thirteen years is a long time to have learned the error of your ways. As so being an eccentric person is always likely when having the luxury. I expect to hear even more failures in his future then we have now, but to wager he hasn't already achieved great things by this time; Would be a great devaluing of the services and capacity of growth he may still be able to achieve should the world allow it.
      </p>

       The story I best look forward to hearing is the one involving his family. Being a father myself I know if anything has taught me to press on; It was the fact I am no longer doing it for myself. 
In that extent alone from one being to another, I'd promote giving him a second chance. (a final chance maybe). Yet a chance all the same.

       Make peace with your enemies, find patience through your hardships; And forgive the elements of life you best regret. 
That's why they say forgiveness is divine. Essentially it is;

       Ego is a testament to the challenges we have faced, and already overcome. You will get past this, and when you do; That is when a true smile will form; and it won't matter anymore; I am sorry your compelled by it today; But I believe in everyone's ability to find closure. Both kims, and your own. 
It isn't my place to conclude anything in this; but you will always have my advice :)

       I think in 3 days you may see a 6.0 in south japan. Technically I aim for mega quakes. Hence the january prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially when people say earthquakes happen everyday they are right. However the real threatening ones are rare. So I focus on pointing those earthquakes out, so I can prove my thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can show your on top of the largest events you can work the data down into the small ones. But to prove the theory you have to wait until you have undeniable evidence (to move the work itself forward). and So we wait :)

       You too, Spend it with your family. If your in newyork be safe - I've a bad feeling about an attack there on the 28th. I've already reported it myself; However this year is looking gloomy; So stay safe through newyears, and keep your eyes open ya. (maybe avoid crowds altogether).

       I'm sure, I was just joking. I don't know much about new Zealand politics, just that the drug policy is a nightmare. I've got an old elementary school friend who moved the about 15 years ago, he loves the landscape at least, we don't talk too much about the politics.

       Scenario:  An authentic whIstleblower or leaker appears who is a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       threat (unlike our current celebrity leakers).  Dishes out alarming 9/11 info, definitive FBI links to false flags, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this time, the Feds are
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       terrified.  They decide to set up the leaker as a patsy.  They plant false info leading to "release of terrorists" or some such set-up mechanism.  The real leaker leaks the fake info.  Chain reaction.  Then a dirty bomb goes off in LAX Airport.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly a real whistleblower is
       <em>
        framed
       </em>
       -- which is what intel agencies like the FBI do best.  Classic pretext for the "war on whistleblowers" to expand.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this hasn't happened yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe this subreddit, nobody in their right mind is skeptical about leakers or whistleblowers.
       <em>
        They couldn't be fake.  They couldn't be planted.  They couldn't be used.  They couldn't be deceived themselves.  They couldn't be limited hangouts.  Stop thinking, just believe, stop being cautious of traps.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So why hasn't the "Whistleblower Causes Mass-Casualties" false flag been done yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Either you believe that intelligence factions use false flags, or you don't.
       </strong>
       If they had no use for fake whistleblowers, they would get serious.  If they weren't currently benefitting, they would stage a false flag.  But that is not happening yet.  Not yet.  Not finished getting mileage from the celebrities yet.

       But then they release it and the politicians just tell the media to tell the public its a lie and that only thekr website can be trusted for "nonfake" news. I honestly dont see any change. Not because the hackers arent effective, they are, but because the mass majority has become too despondent to care. I honestly feel like people dont care about how corrupt their politicians are anymore, nor do they care about the fact that the fence is tightening around us every day.
