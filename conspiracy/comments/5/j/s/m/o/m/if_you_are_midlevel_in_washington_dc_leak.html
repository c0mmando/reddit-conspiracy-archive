    <div class="md"><p>Okay, serious reply here.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re working for the bad guys and want out before the shit really hits the fan (yes, the Cabal IS collapsing) then there are people who can help you.</p>

<p>Contact Thomas Williams, look up his FB page: Truth Honor &amp; Integrity.</p>

<p>They have already setup means of protection for exactly this.  It&#39;s not about leaking or anything.  Its about providing a platform for people to make a transition to help us make a better world NOT controlled by them. Its happening whether anybody wants it to or not, we&#39;re already that far. Lots of former henchmen have already flipped sides for many reasons.</p>

<p>No joke, not a scam, get in contact with him now.</p>

Wikileaks if you must, but the better thing is maybe cryptome or freenet then leak on 4chan..  Oh?  You dn&#39;t know about freenet?  There is a reason for that.</p>

<p>If you get ahold of damning info, save it, bury it in the woods somewhere after wiping all our fingerprints off  it.</p>

<p>By all means don&#39;t leak anything now.  Obama is still in charge.  He&#39;s part of the fifth column</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks is presumed to be CIA. I wouldn&#39;t leak anything to WL unless you are on the inside. </p>

<p>Also this thread is pointless. They could leak all the info they want, if they don&#39;t have photos or videos of these people in action it will be disproved by the normies. Your best bet would be to do your own investigation. There is a lot more on the internet then people realize. Connect the dots. Research specific factions like the Clinton Foundation, Bilderberg group, Tavistock, etc. Also, certain people known to be part of the elite. Soros, the Clinton&#39;s, board directors of The Clinton Foundation. </p>

<p>This is out of the hands of the FBI. They most likely can&#39;t release anything in fear of not only their own lives but their family, wife, kids, friends, basically anyone who&#39;s come into contact with them. Nothing would probably happen to that extent unless a high up FBI agent released something on the lines of concrete evidence. This is on us. Don&#39;t lose hope. Continue telling people what we do know. I always like to inform normies of Operation Northwoods. This former top secret document was released under the Freedom of Information Act is very factual. Keep pushing this and other things. We have a lot more power then we might think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fifth column refers to destroying an organization or institution from within.  In this metaphor, the four columns are the four sides of a building under siege by an army for example, the fifth column is a virtual center, a metaphorical column inside the building</p>

<p>It refers to double agents acting withing an org to destroy America t from within.  For example soviet spies within the CIA</p>

<p>In this example, the CIA&#39;s fifth column (obama/Hillary/DNC/Soros) referring to fascist, corporatist, gnostic, globalist technocrats who we are discovering are also Mafia child sex traffickers in addition to drug traffickers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hope is futile.  Don&#39;t hope.  Don&#39;t worry about hope.  Hope alone is a completely empty thing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care how much somebody <a href="http://orig10.deviantart.net/7390/f/2012/145/5/5/happy_crying_face_png_by_nfc_by_ninetailsfoxchan-d510n4g.png">&quot;hopes&quot;</a> they get better at math, for example.  If you don&#39;t do the work and learn and study and number crunch and put in the hours, then it won&#39;t matter how much you &quot;hope&quot; you get better at math.  You&#39;ll sink.  Hope don&#39;t mean shit unless you WORK - unless you put in the time.  You have to do <em>work</em>.  You have to put your arms and legs and put your mind and your will power to <em>work</em>.</p>

<p>If you have <em>work</em>, then you don&#39;t need any hope at all.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like that one joke about boxing where two fighters are getting reach for a match, and one fighter gets on his knees in a corner, makes the sign of the cross and starts praying.  And at ringside, a kid sees this and asks his father,</p>

<p>&quot;Dad, what does all that prayer mean?&quot;</p>

<p>And his dad leaned over and said,</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t mean shit if you don&#39;t know how to fight.&quot;</p>

<p>TL;DR:  Fuck hope.  Learn how to actually <em>do the work</em> (whatever that work may be), then you won&#39;t need hope.</p>

<li>I can understand that. </li>
<li>Flood stuff is interesting </li>
<li>There were several Jesus&#39; with followers and most of them died. One, apparently, didn&#39;t stay dead.<br/></li>
<li>Technically he didn&#39;t do &quot;miracles&quot;, or as you translate it, magic tricks. They&#39;re described as signs. As in, they point towards a claim (made by him or his followers) about &quot;who&quot; he was. There&#39;s a ton of literature discussing the hwremeneutical approaches to the written version of these events and the degree to which they were mythical etc. My general take, if you&#39;re interested, i see that with most of these texts (Christian, Muslim, Sumerian etc) they tell two kinds of stories. One are those which are imaginative and attempt to explain reality in terms of morality and purpose etc (creation narratives for example) and the other kind are those where an event happens and they place meaning onto it and it assumes a legendary quality. Personally always reluctant to say that those who lived thousands of years ago were idiots. I&#39;d imagine if you adopted an ancient roman baby from birth and brought them up today they&#39;d be on reddit themselves.<br/></li>

A holy war is coming. A three sided conflict coinciding with an uptick in natural and man-made disasters. There is no avoiding it. The NWO will be unmasked and weild their power for destruction unabashed. Islam will unify and rise up as one and declare jihad on the unbelievers. And the rest of us will turn to God and fight for our right to exist. This will happen before the end of the century, possibly with the next decade.

    <div class="md"><p>Huh. Internet isn&#39;t how you leak things anymore, man.</p>

<p>If you get your hands on incriminating TS documents, use an offline printer. Photostat and make 1000s of copies. Ask some of your friends to put on their hoodies and surgery masks and leave them EVERYWHERE. Let others who read them post them on their social media sites and watch it go viral.</p>

<p>Not foolproof, but it&#39;s harder for &quot;them&quot; to remove/control info. There&#39;s no webpage to delete here, and they can&#39;t do anything once it went viral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many degrees of evil. I honestly hope that Trump is just corrupt evil and not satanic evil.</p>

<p>Because even the most violent criminals <strong><em>fucking hate</em></strong> child molesters, and generally kill them if given the chance. That really says something.</p>
