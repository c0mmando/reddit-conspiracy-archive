       They have been setting up Trump to get assassinated for a long while... it became obvious on election day... I'm really surprised he's gone and done so many rallies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was obvious that CNN was trying to spot for a sniper on live TV when Trump went to meet Obama in the whitehouse... I'd love to have some footage of it so I could watch it again... It was insane...

       Yeah... you could hear the media give up hope when Trump arrived in a different plane, ditched the media by not taking the limo... evaded all the reporters... and snuck in the backdoor to the white house... the Secret Service agents had all been replaced by Marines in full uniform.

       The fact that the MSM cried so much about that and acted so butt-hurt over Trump's "daring" to keep his own private security says a lot about how absolutely fucking useless the MSM is.

       If I were him I'd keep that private security, too. Won't go into a ton of detail as it could dox me, but 2 years ago I worked an event Trump gave a speech at. His private security is absolutely no joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       He showed up roughly 45 minutes before he was going to speak. Within 15 minutes his security had a pretty large arena on lockdown. Of course they had scoped the place and pre-planned, but as soon as their feet hit the ground it was game on. No one was getting within 50 feet of him.

       All that sounds pretty darn awesome for his sake actually.  Glad to hear it.  Hopefully this’ll allow him to feel safe and protected enough to really move forward with some plans that might just get the corporate PTB pretty damn pissed and try to JFK him.

       Damn it was nuts... you could hear the nervousness in the reporter's voice... as soon as Trump was reported arriving in a different plane... which probably got one of those famous
       <a href="http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/11/10/780/438/694940094001_5204951661001_Salute-1100.jpg">
        "fire truck" sendoffs
       </a>
       ... you could tell they knew the script they had been given and were following was falling apart... They didn't report on much aside from the route Trump was taking to the whitehouse... where he would be walking... when he'd be there... was angles were obscured by trees... where security was stationed... what door he would probably take... they asked reporters outside to ask Trump questions that would require long rambling answers (hold still for headshot)...
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that wasn't nuts enough... on live TV... when they were showing Trump looking out on the green from the balcony of the whitehouse... There was sound effects of a fuckin' war being played... yells and gunfire and jets streaking by overhead.... but just sound... everything was visually peaceful out there... then some dude shoved the cameraman into the stairwell... I know this makes me sound like a fucking nutcase... but it was honest to God what I saw. I hope someone has that shit from CNN recorded somewhere.

       They had a Plan A... rig the election... Failed. They had a Plan B... assassinate Trump Nov 10th... Failed. Plan C is to just hope and pray someone does something... but no one will... cause the FBI2 knows all and sees all... not everyone inside the NSA blows the whistle the way Snowden did... some of them have a dogwhistle only their trusted allies can hear... and those allies are tight with the entire Armed Forces...

       It started at  the time when they cut away from the newsroom on CNN to cover Trump visiting Obama on Nov. 10th at the whitehouse... The footage would look like almost nothing.. a bunch of exterior shots of the whitehouse with barely anything happening... just a lot of sketchy talking. I've seen em re-use the balcony footage but with the sound removed, cause I don't think the "war" soundtrack was added into the audio mix... I think there was a speaker or something playing it there.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have resources that extend past my own... I'm also looking for pictures/footage of the "decommissioning" of Tim Kaine's campaign jet... it would look like a cop/FBI agent on mobile stairs peeling the C and L stickers from the word "Clinton" off the side of the plane... It prolly happened on Nov 8th or 9th but I'm not sure...  exactly within a day or two of that range though.

       they get it wrong here and there and rarely point the finger but overall probably the best podcast
      </p>

       you will almost certainly hear or learn several things you didn't know about in each episode, especially if you rarely waste time with the msm, they do it for you, which is where it scores

       You can also grab it on most podcast player platforms (I use Overcast for iOS, but there are tons of others) by just searching "No Agenda".

       Started listening a few weeks ago and they've been stellar. Certainly not perfect... but their deconstruction of the media is really outstanding. They also don't bite into some of the deeper conspiracies like PizzaGate or the Antarctica stuff, so they stay "above the fray" in lots of ways... which isn't to say that they don't consider it, they just don't go whole-hog the way that Alex Jones and his ilk do. This allows them to stay relevant and avoid being labeled as tin-foil hat wearers... which is awesome, because their commentary about the media is spot-on.

       12 months 1 day is apparently all teh punishment for such an attempt of assassination from someone who liked to play in the woods with a glock and is in teh USA illegally. Prison now but out on good time in a few months.

       This hoax with the Russian Ambassador may have been a dry run. If they "kill" him, it will be a hoax. He'll be shipped off to Antartica or wherever as the world burns.

       It's not like you see in the movies, my dude. If it's not high caliber to the head, there usually isn't very much blood, especiialy if they are wearing clothes or fat.

       I just feel like all this opposition to him is all part of an elaborate play. American presidents aren't chosen by us.

       Ive listened to a handful of eps, overall I like them but on the most recent (#888) Adam was acting smarmy regarding the fact he did Alex Jones' show the night before on skype. Either be proud of who you choose to associate urself with and don't hide it or stop doing outside commentary. Its like the inverse of Joe Rogans relationship with AJ.

       Not going to bat for Alex, it just says a lot about the character of a person who carries himself this way. I was in radio in my past life so I guess my bar for this kind of behavior is low.
