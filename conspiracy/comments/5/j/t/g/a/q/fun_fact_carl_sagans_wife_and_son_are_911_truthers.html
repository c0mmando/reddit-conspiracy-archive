    <div class="md"><p>Funner fact: Carl Sagan was a great admirer of Leon Trotsky, co-leader, alongside Lenin, of the Russian Revolution of 1917.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;1984 was not just an engaging political fantasy; it was based on the Stalinist Soviet Union, where the rewriting of history was institutionalized. Soon after Stalin took power, pictures of his rival, Leon Trotsky-- a monumental figure in the 1905 and 1917 revolutions--began to disappear. Heroic and wholly ahistoric paintings of Stalin and Lenin together directing the Bolshevik Revolution took their place, with Trotsky, the founder of the Red Army, nowhere in evidence. These images became icons of the state. You could see them in every office building, on outdoor advertising signs sometimes ten stories high, in museums, on postage stamps.</p>

<p>&quot;New generations grew up believing that was their history. Older generations began to feel that they remembered something of the sort, a kind of political false-memory syndrome. Those who made the accommodation between their real memories and what the leadership wished them to believe exercised what Orwell described as &#39;doublethink.&#39; Those who did not, those old Bolsheviks who could recall the peripheral role of Stalin in the Revolution and the central role of Trotsky, were denounced as traitors or unreconstructed bourgeois or &#39;Trotskyites&#39; or &#39;Trotsky-fascists,&#39; and were imprisoned, tortured, made to confess their treason in public, and then executed.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;But it&#39;s hard to keep potent historical truths bottled up forever. New data repositories are uncovered. New, less ideological, generations of historians grow up. In the late 1980s and before, Ann Druyan and I would routinely smuggle copies of Trotsky&#39;s History of the Russian Revolution into the USSR--so our colleagues could know a little about their own political beginnings.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smuggling the works of Trotsky into the Soviet Union was a courageous act that involved considerable personal risk. But Sagan felt it was his duty as a scientist to make known the advances of human reason in all fields, including history. He saw Trotsky&#39;s history of the revolution as a weapon against the falsifications of Stalin and all those who attack reason and progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trotsky was not a co-leader. He played a relatively minor role, Stalin&#39;s role as Lenins number two was much more important.</p>

<p>I really hate Trotsky. This has made me dislike Sagan, but in general I dislike all the patron saints of the internet (sagan, hitchens, stephen fry, neil degrasse tyson etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always thought the term <em>truther</em> is a somewhat failed attempt at being derogatory.  It seems like someone figured out that if you can make a way for someone to compartmentalize something its easier for them to to just file it away under &quot;bullshit&quot; and not think about it.  Or maybe its just occurs naturally the same way other stereotypes occur.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting she shares a style of speech and even has some of the same mannerisms as Carl Sagan.  If you could change the pitch of her voice to match his and could hear but not see the speaker you might very well assume Carl Sagan was speaking.  Anyone else notice this?  I don&#39;t know what it means exactly but it&#39;s a curiosity.</p>

<p>I have a hunch this woman is going to be famous for her contributions to theories of evolution long after her former husband is forgotten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from Yorkshire England, and moved to Canada, my wife and my best friend (coworker) have both picked up some of my speech.</p>

<p>My buddy asked his mum for a &quot;bottle of wa&#39;er&quot; and she looked at him like a retard. His grandad who part raised him was from Slovenia and spoke broken &quot;backward&quot; English. I also speak it, because I&#39;m a country bumpkin, and my grandad had a hard Yorkshire accent and used all the slang.</p>

<p>Normally it happens the other way, but I keep telling them I speak the pure English. There&#39;s letters from the War of the Roses and as they&#39;re written phonetically it&#39;s all normal English to me. Same with like Chauncer and Shakespeare (there&#39;s rhymes that don&#39;t work in modern English accents, but do in old ones).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carl Sagan was one of the most honorable  people ever.  A voice of reason, peace and progress.  A scholar and humanitarian in the finest Jewish tradition.  He passed away in 1995 at just 61.  His wife Lynn Margulis was also a celebrated scientist who won the Presidential science medal under Bill Clinton.   Shortly after 911, she was shown the tests done on the dust, or she examined the dust herself.  She understood the implications of the chemical signature of the wavelenghts given off by the particles : thermetic explosives.  She went public about this.  Her son Jeremy, Carl&#39;s son, understands as well and has spoken out.  He is to be commended for his bravery.  Support him.</p>

<p>Carl Sagan&#39;s protoge was Niel DeGrasse Tyson.   He was actually at the towers and filmed their collapse.   No doubt he knows that airplanes could not make those towers collapse at freefall.  But he dare not say a word of his career is toast...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the contrary: the forensic application of the scientific method is the core of NFPA921 fire investigation protocol, which naturally stipulates the development, investigation and elimination of alternative hypotheses to explain observed events; it should be equally obvious that this protocol stipulates there should be a strenuous effort to eliminate accelerants in cases of high-order damage. That would be the application of the scientific method.</p>

<p>Margoulis is one of many scientists who recognise the banal truth that you don&#39;t find what you don&#39;t look for, and as we know the effort to eliminate the possibility of accelerants in the case of WTC7 was limited to the laughable claim that some videotapes of the event didn&#39;t have audio recordings that were as loud as some people thought they should be.</p>

<p>In terms of tower collapses in general, of course, reproducibility or repeatability as you call it is very much possible. Experiment is the core of the scientific method. We often hear that the mechanism by which the twin towers collapsed is essentially simple and well understood, and physically accurate virtual modelling environments are now advanced and commonly used. But in the 15+ years since the most catastrophic structural failures of all time, are you aware of any significant scientific effort to model the collapse mechanism in such a way that demonstrates how huge towers can possibly come apart so quickly and with pulverising destructive force?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why doesn&#39;t someone put forward a conceiving alternative hypothesis? I&#39;m no fucking expert and neither is Carl Sagan&#39;s wife. If your going to complain that the argument put forward by those who claim the towers collapsed as a result for the plane crashing into the world is not convincing, why has no one been able to put forward their own equally rigorous claim as to what occured that day? The people claiming the towers collapsed by the planes hitting tower 1 and tower 2 have made their case. They only need to strengthen it if a better alternative arises. That is the scientific method. </p>

<p>In my mind the conventional story is already pretty well supported. It doesn&#39;t need further proof. You&#39;re the one trying to prove it wasn&#39;t a result of a plane crashing into the towers.  Alright, prove it then. Why can nobody put forward their own evidence based alternative hypothesis which can rival the conventional story in its rigor? Because it doesn&#39;t exist. There is no case to be made because if there was someone would have made it.      </p>

An alternative hypothesis isn&#39;t necessary to prove that the dominant hypothesis is false: a true scientist welcomes the most nit-picking attempts to undermine their theories, as popularity or dominance is no index of hypotheses&#39; truth -- this is the lesson of Copernicus.</p>

<p>The conventional story has no rigor because it doesn&#39;t have any experimental, reproducible scientific evidence to explain how the towers could come down in the way they came down: a point underscored by the fact that like me, you cannot point to a single scientific experiment that demonstrates how towers can possibly collapse with such incredible speed and destructive power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m well aware of the conspiracy related to WTC 7 and the fact it collapsed from only internal fires and no collision with any plane or from the other towers collapsing. </p>

<p>WTC 7 collapsing from fire is not evidence that anything amiss occured. You need to create an alternative evidence based theory in order to debunk the conventional claim. You can&#39;t just go &quot;no that doesn&#39;t make sense so it couldn&#39;t have happened&quot; because all the types of things which do not make sense actually occur. The probability of any one singular event ever occurring is astronomically low. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The probability of three distinctly unique events of the same type happening in one day when it never happened before or again after is even more astronomically low.</p>

<p>The evidence that something amiss would have been if they would have tested for explosives.  Unfortunately they decided not to test for explosives (iirc correctly according to NIST it was because no one in the area heard a blast)  Also unfortunately they got the remains the hell out of here before they could be thoroughly investigated.  </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t I just go &#39;no that doesn&#39;t make sense so&quot; it looks like it was much more likely that it was demolished?  What the fuck else can I do?  I can&#39;t go test for explosives.  The government was too irresponsible to test for explosives (why wouldn&#39;t you test for explosives in an event big as this?  why would it not be a considered possibility?)  They did a good job of destroying any potential evidence.  We aren&#39;t exactly talking about a group of amateurs here.</p>

<p>I read the NIST reports.  Nothing whatsoever about this collapse makes sense except when you consider that it was demolished.  NIST couldn&#39;t even bake their model enough to reflect real life events.  They removed all lateral support of the main columns and couldn&#39;t even get their model of the building to collapse without removing an entire column.  The fudged factors when it came to modeling the fire, made it hotter and used systematic breaking of windows to make it spread like they wanted to.  They also removed all fire barriers from their model to allow the fire to spread.  Ignored fireproofing of the beams.  The list goes on and on.  </p>

<p>So even though this event is impossible to imagine happening like the official story claims you are saying that I have to believe it unless I come up with physical evidence?</p>

I have my own experience but it in no way qualifies me to judge what happened on that day, just like being a biologist doesn&#39;t qualify you to make you own investigation into what happened that day. What both of us can do though is look at what conclusion the people who were best qualified to make the determination  and compare that to other claims and see if they stack up in terms of qualifications of those making the claims and the evidence they have available to them.

    <div class="md"><p>I did read your comment. What you have missed is that is is not the conclusions but the methodology that anyone can examine, understand and criticise. Your appeal to authority is simply an attempt to tell people that they cannot understand the scientific method, but in fact that method can be understood by anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll also contest your interest lay people comment. Interest lay people can only prove a theory wrong if they have sufficient knowledge and evidence. Given the fact this is a situation where lay people almost certainly do not have sufficient knowledge and certainly don&#39;t have access to the evidence it&#39;s almost impossible a lay person could actually create their own theory of what happened that day which rivals the normal story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science doesn&#39;t discriminate between professionals and amateurs. What matters is the science. Sir Francis Bacon could have been called a &quot;lay person&quot; but that didn&#39;t prevent him from being one of the greatest scientists of his age.</p>

<p>Also, you haven&#39;t understood Popper&#39;s concept of falsificationism. As I said before, an alternative theory isn&#39;t necessary to falsify any given hypothesis: any real scientist welcomes the even the most pedantic and improbable effort to undermine any theory they have come up with. That&#39;s how science advances.</p>

<p>That is what is so weird about you debunker types.  You think you are the rational ones, but your beliefs are actually not based on any rational thought whatsoever.  You simply believe what authorities tell you <em>without question.</em>  I would add that this refusal to question authority is why it took roughly 2000 years for people to figure out that maybe the Bible isn&#39;t exactly meant to be taken word for word.  If you listen to the authorities?  Of course it is.  You will be burned at the stake in this life for questioning it, and go to Hell in the next life.  Of course if you stopped to actual examine the evidence and use your own reason you&#39;d see the whole thing is blatantly absurd.  </p>

<p>Its exactly the same these days.  Do not question.  Believe what you are told.   </p>

<p>You aren&#39;t the rational one.  Not even close.  You&#39;re no different than the mindless, unthinking people history is full of.  </p>

<p>Unsubstantiated bullshit.  Why can 19 hijackers do it, but if the American government did it would take hundreds of thousands of people?
