       Hi r/conspiracy!
 I'm u/elnegroik you may remember from such ... 
I kid. Most of you will have seen my recent spate of High Level Insider submissions and I wanted to provide some clarity on my actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive been using this sub for 7 or so months. I've had a Reddit account for longer but never really used it. I'm a Londoner with an American wife so am fairly invested in US politics.
I really started using r/conspiracy during the elections - it genuinely seemed like people were waking up to the reality of the world and this sub was actively dropping truth bombs every hour.  It looked like Bernie might win, with the old older being exposed and removed. When that passed - it was back to the normal
       <em>
        doom porn
       </em>
       and actual global peadophilia that passes normal discussion round here. Which is cool- as it all links back to the existence of a hidden power structure, knowledge of whom which we share in the hopes of eradicating it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a month back I came across a thread dump from u/darkomantis on /pol. I did as he advised and approached it with an open mind and found my initial cynicism replaced with interest. I have an understanding and appreciation of history, current affairs and fairly good general knowledge and found myself impressed with the anons depth and range of intelligence. More specifically, his positions on the idea of Consciousness, the Bicameral Mind and his groups future policies to bring about a change in the world.  I did the research around some of the claims he makes of
Historical events and found him to be accurate;
       <em>
        but the narrative
       </em>
       was different. He doesn't appear to have an agenda, in as much as I can discern one, he encourages self growth through learning, physical health and "developing consciousness". Nothing sinister or nefarious to the best of my understanding or others that I've spoken with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel there's a lot of truth in what the anon says and have begun to apply things like meditation, decalcifying my pineal glad and a greater interest in Consciousness to my every day. I take the time to question my emotions
       <em>
        why did I react that way
       </em>
       and actions *what is the purpose of this *more frequently, rather than be my usual impulsive self. Not perfect - but the difference being I realise things like this are important.So yeah- I guess I noticed some changes in that respect. Have I bought anything? Or signed up for anything? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I chose to share excerpts from the threads is essentially to foster some more interest in the sessions and have a larger conversation on it- I felt there was a lot to be taken from it - even if he does turn out to be an expert Larper. One of the biggest things we could apply in this sub is the manner HLI encourages those who are aware to use knowledge of conspiracies. I wrote a post on
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jdbwr/we_can_all_feel_a_shift_ive_noticed_it_over/?st=IX0UPRZL&amp;sh=32cc67aeHe">
        it recently
       </a>
       The anon suggests using that increased awareness, not only to shine the light on evil, but also to show how they limit our collective potential. How our scope for growth is diminished by the different chains the elite use to maintain control.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to get these ideas out to a group of people well versed in dissecting questionable info and to analyse them further.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess even deeper than that I thought we could do with a change here. I thought a discussion around unspoken possibilities rather than the unseen fuckeries that permeate our lives, would be a welcome change in direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well for one day eh anyway ... we can go back to Global peadophile rings &amp; Flat earth tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who have been irked, my apologies. It wasn't my intention to offend or irritate anyone. I respect this sub and appreciate how little it restricts activity: I meant no abuse of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judging from the response and conversations I've had, most people have responded positively. I think they realise the anon requests no return for what he says and are able to impassively assess whether or not what they're reading is relevant and applicable to them - and judge it on its own merits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll no longer be posting any HLI submissions, and would encourage any interested in reading more to find u/darkomantis thread dump in any of today's posts.
      </p>

       Wow, so sorry that this has been poorly received. I was very appreciative of your links to the HLI threads. I found them to be very interesting. Even if HLI turns out to be a 16 year old boy, I think he has amazing insight, and genuinely seems to be interested in encouraging people to realize their full potential to bring about positive change. I love this sub, but sometimes I grow weary of the amount of negativity here and must choose to skip over some posts. I found the HLI information to be very positive, hopeful, and thought- provoking, and that was such a refreshing change. Thank you.

       Hi! On the contrary it's been pretty well received - far more positivity than otherwise . I wrote this more as an explanation- the spate of posts caused a bit of a reaction. The method of delivery was somewhat
       <em>
        militant
       </em>
       As is whenever you're discussing conspiracies, any cynicism is perfectly justified and as you've said the fact we discuss so much negativity here immediately makes any break from the norm a source of contention. I'm glad you found them useful . 
Peace

       The latter - I posted screenshots of notable excerpts as opposed to the whole thing. Far more effective in capturing interest, but admittedly the
       <em>
        machine gun meme method
       </em>
       was quite disruptive to the sub

       some information. Wow.

       The negative reactions were weird. If I see something on here I don't like (often these days) I just ignore it and keep scrolling. Rarely if ever am I moved enough to initiate hostilities against OP. It's only really racist or ignorant shit I'll step in and challenge - opposing views? Not so much. People interested in something I don't like? Nah. People who I believe are collectively being mislead by a fake Larper? Why is that my concern. 
Instead we get a small percentage of very much indignant and annoyed users who in some cases, are writing posts urging people to not even look at the posts let alone do any research into HLI.
Why are they threatened by this fake? I've spoken with the mods and they were really cool - just said it's not the right format to post, they'd be removed and that was it. Couldn't care about the message, actually they thought it generated a lot of positive and interesting conversation.
I just find it weird and unnecessary that some people were moved so much by these posts, they actively sought to stop others from visiting them.

       Do you by any chance know if there is a question queue thread? He's unfortunately active outside my timezone and I'd like to ask some question or have somebody proxy ask him on my behalf.
