       In Serbia a W Mammoth was found frozen. The mammoths blood was in liquid form and the meat was fresh. How can a mammoth 40,000 y/o have liquid blood? Did it fall out of the inner earth and die a sudden death and freeze? We know General Byrd saw a mammoth during his voyage. 
I also read about another mammoth was found frozen in LAKE WATER and stilll had fresh greenery in its teeth and stomach. How was the mammoth frozen in lake water if it was found in the ocean?  I can't find the article tho. The one below it the mammoth with liquid blood.

        In 2005, the US MILITARY was attacked by a 12 ft, 1100lbs red hair 6 toes/6 finger giant. The giant killed one solider before the giant was killed. The book of Enoch gives the exact description of this Giant, which is called the nephillim. The nephillim was the off spring of fallen angels and a woman.  The military and media kept this from the public, but why?

       The book of Enoch, which was left out of the Bible, explains these Giants and relation to the fallen angels in great detail.

        Long video, but explains the book of Enoch in great detail
       </a>
       According to the Book of Enoch, God judged the angels for producing the Nephilim. God decreed that the fallen angels (Watchers) were to be cast into Tartarus.The Nephilim were also judged and it was determined that their bodies were to return to the earth in peace but their souls were doomed. 
What is Tartarus? is the deep abyss that is used as a dungeon of torment and suffering for the wicked and as the prison for the Titans. As far below Hades as the earth is below the heavens.
       <br/>
       IS THE TARTARUS THE INNER EARTH???

      <p>
       Also, Genesis SAYS GIANTS LIVED HERE BEFORE THE FLOOD AND AFTER. WHERE ARE THESE GIANTS AT??
(Genesis 6:4)
(Original KJV): “There were giants in the earth in those days; and ALSO AFTER THAT, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the flood there were 409,000 Giants that lived on the surface of the planet. There's huge structures that couldnt possibly be moved by any type of technology we have today. Are these structures the Giants built?

       Are the world leaders hiding the truth about our planet being hollow in order to hide GIANTS and hybrids? If Giants were the offspring of woman and fallen angel, then is the Nazi army admiral Byrd saw an offspring of Nazi and fallen angels? Are they hiding the army of the antichrist under our feet? Are they reproducing and getting ready to go to war against us in the battle of Armageddon ? Is the entrance to the underworld in Antarctica? Was NASA formed to focus our  attention to the sky's rather then what's underneath us?

       Let me say this... the elites rewrote history and created their own.  They use religion to control the mass population, which is why I'm not religious. I believe in God, the Son Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Use the Holy Spirit to help you search for TRUTH.

       I know the hollow earth stuff is true, at least to an extent. There's a massive cavern system throughout both north and south America and very little has been explored. Earlier this year many scientific news outlets were reporting about a massive underground freshwater ocean 3 times the size of the above ground oceans. What you mention about giant skeletons is obviously true if anyone took the time to do the research. These aren't anomalies or regular humans that had growth-related diseases or glandular problems. They're widespread. These beings were well known to the ancients; to more recent Native Americans there was not even a question as to their existence. Many were also said to have 6 fingers/toes and reddish hair. It is not an alien matter. Believe what you will about the scriptures, Nephilim are half human half demon (fallen angel) hybrids. This is explained in great detail (among other related events) in the Book of Enoch as you mention, which I highly recommend to anyone. There's only a brief one line mention to the nephilim &amp; fallen angels in Genesis. It's an interesting subject to be sure. Don't understand these people so furiously trying to discredit any of this. Another related subject that may interest you is Shamballa of Buddhist cosmology (sometimes also referred to as Shangri-La although this is a separate but similar concept from a novel). You can call anything a false flag or psyop here and get everyone upvoting and agreeing but this gets trashed on, wtf? Great post

       Thanks Man. It's definitely an interesting theory to research. Just bc it's part of our history the elites have covered up for whatever reason puzzles me. 
I think some conspiracy theorist are atheist so when the Bible is quoted they freak out. 
My research of Giants are mentioned in the Bible and the Vatican is covering it up so all of it is related. If they gave it some time and read over it, they would see that...

       It is literally the biggest conspiracy ever. Why do so many believe in religion? This is an honest question, i can't fathom how you'd be so questioning of everything BUT religion.

       There's plenty of questioning of religion, usually of church hierarchies and clergy. But when one of the most credible modern conspiracies is literally an international elite pedophilia ring of Satanists, the elite stage mock-sacrifices (and maybe more-than-fake) and previous Satanic pedophile rings have killed children in
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       sacrifice, and the Podesta emails show high-ranking political officials name-dropping Moloch - a demonic pagan deity specifically admonished against in the Old Testament - suddenly religion and loyalty to a good and loving God become a lot less implausible and a lot more attractive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poke around beneath the surface of the world and it becomes fairly clear that humanity is locked in a power struggle with religious and metaphysical overtones. When your enemy is a Satanist it can't hurt to seek the blessings of God.

       EDIT: But OP is probably nuts tho lol. I love the variety on this sub - sometimes it's original research evidencing the existence of an international satanic pedophile ring 2 years BEFORE Pizzagate, and sometimes it's a crackpot Hollow Earth theory.

       I never made such a claim, but I propose there could be since our understanding of electromagnetism is potentially incorrect. See my
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5k22gh/earth_a_globe_a_donut_a_plane_and_god/">
        post
       </a>
       . You can see the visual representation of how electromagnetism is projected on a ferrocell. In this context, look at the hollow earth or counterspace picture. The videos go into greater detail, so I posit that if our understanding of physics is not correct; why can't the core of the earth (a magnet) be a sun (which have cores themselves?)

       When you talk about the elites being satanists, they don't actually believe in a devil sitting down in hell wanting fresh souls. There's a bunch of different names that they use like Baphomet, Set, Moloch, Lucifer etc. but it all extends from ancient Egypt. They might use these deities in their rituals but they don't really believe in them, it's more of a symbol of their ancient knowledge passed down through the centuries.

       Because chasing rabbits gives one meaning to their life. Catching a rabbit isn't anywhere near as meaningful. The Bible is the perfect means in which to keep someone digging into total bullshit while failing to notice a system that is fucking them in every way possible. Tackling real problems is scary to some because they recognize their insignificance and lack of importance in life, so they dive into this bullshit believing that they alone are going to crack the code and awaken the sheeple, granting them a level of significance in their lives they'll never attain by simply staying informed and educated.

       I don't think that reading a book controls you after reading it. Consider this, without the proper indoctrination and preparation for the reading of the holy text, do you think people would believe it in a traditional religious fashion? If, in a vacuum, a person had to read and examine a book such as the bible, do you think they would find it to be useful in their spiritual education and well-being? I don't think so. So then, it seems to be the issue is one of narrative. What is acceptable to question and what is not, and that I think is the battle we fight in our churches.

       well here is the thing the "bible" is just a collection of very old religious documents. it was compiled from 100's of different writings and gospels decades or even 100s of years after the time of christ, and many of them from long long before.
      </p>
      <p>
       some of the gospels that were once very much a core part of the  "bible" have been removed, the often cited "book of enoch" is one of those. the church itself tried to erase them and supress the knowledge of them in spite of it being very very much a part of the early canon.
      </p>
      <p>
       now that said why would some one completely discount the documents because of how they have been used? do we ignore the contents of the rigveda the oldest know writings by the oldest known religion because they were used as a source for much of the Nazi ideologies and myths the spun out of them?
      </p>
      <p>
       taking the bible, excuse the phrase, as the gospel truth (lol) is imho pretty ridiculous but not as ridiculous as ignoring the document as a whole.

       The Bible certainly has some historical value, there is no dispute in that.

      <p>
       But using a collection of ancient hebrew stories as
       <em>
        proof
       </em>
       that there are angels and demons, they've impregnanted humans, this spawned a race of giants that live underground in a 350 degree + cave with no sunlight, they've been hidden from regular humans for thousands of years, oh but except that one that killed a soldier named Dan in kandahar even though the government sources only list one dan death in kandahar in 2002 and it was EOD?

       "Ridicule" is subjective. Can you provide a singular example as why you don't believe? I'm not trying to start a debate, just a simple instance.

       well the fact that the religion, at least as it is today, is a Roman Empire perpetuated version of several other minor religions and cults (Mithra's cults, Zoroastrianism, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       the Romans were good at one thing, plagiarism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had thought it was common knowledge at this point that the romans did this to create a state run religion that would appeal to as many of the masses as possible. the major myth/stories etc are just an amalgam of half a dozen or more earlier beliefs held by prior groups.

       That's fair and I agree with you, that's why I'm not a Catholic; it even goes against the Gospels. I believe there is some truth to those early religions due to natural revelation, but then one could argue which predates which? It could even be argued that* it was prophesied that the Roman Church would lose it's stranglehold on the faithful, giving birth to the Protestant movement.

       You're still calling the branching off a religion, it isn't; in a traditional sense. Also it's not just a religion but the precursor to to universalism, surely you've had these suspicions of the "church," this is a conspiracy sub after all.

       I disagree, I believe "religious" people question even further, which is why they believe in something. At least people beyond the age of accountability. For the sake of argument, I'll assume you're an atheist; why stop questioning at "there is no God?"

       I'm interested in the first part of your comment, genuinely. What do you mean, "question even further?" It is hard to convey tone in text but i am honestly asking to know.

      <p>
       Every religious person I've talked to. Had the aspect of faith. There was always a point where they would say, "gods will," "in gods hands," those cliche things.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct in a sense with the last sentence, i have no faith in organized religion. I place my religious philosophies somewhere in the spectrum between mahayana Buddhism and la veyan satanism. As weird as that sounds. So the only appropriate title for me is agnostic, but ive had my time with the christian church and it's not for me.

       I suppose I'm assuming that the atheist is content with "there is no God" and none of this matters, but then we're veering into nihilistic territory. It just seems miserable to me, personally. If there is no God, where does a sense of morality come from? If it comes from man, who was the first man or council of men to determine what was good or bad? Were they our alleged ape ancestors? The animal kingdom is brutal and altruism largely doesn't exist except in rare cases that I'm aware of, Humpback whales attacking and defending seals from Orca attacks for instance (this seriously happens, it's suggested that it's instinctual to protect other Humpback calves from being hunted and they mistake the distress calls of seals or can intercept the Orcas calls but I digress.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true of those cliche sayings, but God's will doesn't move forward without the believer acting on those things. I realize my bias is coming through but I understand where you are coming from as I was a lukewarm Christian for the majority of my life. I don't blame you for not having faith organized religion, the more rigid an institution becomes the more likely people will revolt and turn from it; as we see today. Do you know Gilfoyle from Silicon Valley? ;)

       I've been pretty nihilistic most of my life, having children changes that a bit, however. BUT, " where does a sense of morality come from?" From the same instinctual motivations you talk about with whales and seals, i can't speak for the whales motivations but humans have an instinctual and intellectual ( because we developed that trait) need to do things that prolong our species' existence. Most don't want to kill because that subtracts from the population, most don't want to rape because intellectually and socially we have developed the recognition that if a person doesn't want to do it. It is not fair or right. All of the universal 'morals', which are present in EVERY religion can be traced back to a instinctual need to not do the certain thing which is clearly negative to the evolution of us as a collective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does instinct come from? From evolution. Humans have clearly been around for thousands, hundred of thousands of years, we have developed an instinctual need to protect life through our tribal roots. And know that rape is bad through the social and intellectual evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.s. humans do not give animals enough credit. I got done early at work today, i drive for my job, stopped to wait for 5 next to a cow pasteur. There was many but i watched a mother and her calf eating and cleaning each other. They kept nudging each other in what i can only call a hug, in their terms. It was beautiful, and i instantly felt bad for eating steak and hamburger all the time. I love my kids and so did that cow. Thus may be a tangent but i could feel the same love for my kids through their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl:dr silicon valley looks funny. Humans are instinctual animals. Instinct comes from evolution. Cows are just like us!!

       Yet it is rampant at the highest levels of society via the emerging epidemic of sex slave trafficking and abortion given to the middle and lower classes. All made possible by those who worship evil, you must have seen the posts on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Animals generally speaking protect those within their own herds or familial packs. Of course there is an instinctual protective relationship between a parent and offspring, as I mentioned with the whales ( I personally believe they just want to stop Orcas from killing anything because of instinct); but communities of chimpanzees protect their own and there is a hierarchical structure that is often determined by violence if necessary, not to mention those communities go to war with one another for territorial gains/food. Just like we do! Did we inherit these aggressive tendencies from our alleged evolutionary ancestors? Serious question: is it possible to know when the first documented decree of "rape is bad *and so is murder" was, without an omniscient and benevolent creator?
      </p>

       Silicon Valley is probably the funniest show I've ever seen, before I became a full fledged Christian, honest. The old me recommends it.

       Religion is more personal while most of what conspiracy talks about is external. I wouldn't even call what I have religion; it's simply faith based on spiritual experiences I've had which are most in line with what we call Christianity. Many people have encountered spiritual beings, both good and evil. It's hard to question the existence of a spiritual element underlying our existence when you're a healthy, (admittedly self-professed) rational, skeptical and sane person who experiences such things.

       King James is the best you're gonna get for an English bible. Make sure to cross reference with a Strong's Concordance or something similar. There are many errors in the King James, including the names of God.

       The best translation you'll get is the NRSV. Why? It's faithful to the earliest and best manuscripts available  of the original languages of the Bible. Hebrew for the Old Testament and Greek for the New Testament. The translation in the NRSV is fairly literal and uses gender inclusive language where the text supports it. So person instead of man when trying to talk about all people.
      </p>
      <p>
       King James was good back in the 17th century. Many earlier and more accurate biblical manuscripts were discovered afterwards and most modern translations are based on those (i.e. The Dead Sea Scrolls)
      </p>
      <p>
       tl:dr The NRSV is used by serious bible scholars, Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant Christians alike. If it's good enough for all of them it's good enough for most everyone.

       Yea man keep digging. Even if it were true that tptb are covering up this knowledge, it may not mean they themselves are all that aware of what really happened in ancient times, they take what they have and mold it to their agenda. Like most of the bible, but particularly revelations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you seen the Pyramid right there in Antarctica? They have a base right next to it. And fake, or not fake, buzz Aldrin tweets, "I have seen evil" and it's a pic of that pyramid -which is massive and jutting out of a sheet of ice. It's a revelation, its evil, the end of the world. It's the same psyop as in the bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how they bend it already. Towards fear. Fear knowledge. Whatever, but what's there is there, they can't hide it forever. But I think we have enough artifacts, fossils, and clues, to figure it out. Though using the bible is a path of distortion. No, God and angels and all that drama didn't give genesis to our world. So already, with what were given we won't make sense of it. Dogma won't work,  especially ones promoted from a time when man was so entirely objective that there was no subjective knowledge. But other times in our history the subjective was the dominant awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Egyptians who built pyramids. Not the Egyptians then, but their ancestors were highly subjective to the point to developing technology of the subjective awareness. The ankh being a symbolized focal point, the eye of horus,(or the pineal)as the current. Such as, increased strength. Enough to lift massive rocks by a group effort, with little physical effort at all. You will find this ankh type symbol in the hands of many of the large stone God's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Giants are portrayed as Mongoloid and somewhat unintelligent. Perhaps the red haired cannibals retain a sense of genetic line that was once part of the human race, but Pyramid builders, not likely. They don't fit inside ,for one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with rock Is you can't really date it within any say correlation to anything within the frame of history that we are fed as being man's origin to present. The pyramids are older than they tell us. But we have the artifacts. Massive black dense, incredibly heavy boxes in Egypt. Lids only certain people could open. Structures whose purpose only certain individuals understood it's function. This, from a time when subjective knowledge was dominant. How to create with the power of the Gods. How to take mind and manipulate matter. How to go into a dream, more or less, become awake, and tell the object that is also dreaming with you what to do, where to go, and give it movement. A type of forgotten technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ability to become awake in dreams was an advantage for survival. You could dream, become awake and travel the physical environment. Nowadays dreams, which are a massive part of our life, are not even taught in school. So you can see the shift in perception it takes to understand the ancients.

       Hmmm... so the book of revelations is used basically to scare us and an excuse for mass murder?
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the flood of Noah the fallen angels were running ramped on earth causing destruction and inbreeding with humans and animals. The Bible states God flooded the earth and locked them up. Could this explain why they were able to move things with their mind before the flood and now we don't have that type of technology? It seems like that technology was witch craft or helped by a higher power. 
Is this why the elites are using CERN to try and open the abyss? Bc the fallen angels are being held back by Gods words right now?

       Well, one of the points I was attempting to make is if you interpret history though a distorted recollection, it will be difficult to understand history.
      </p>
      <p>
       And contrary to archeological data, the bible still is given weight over what is present and accountable.  Do we have any solid evidence of Noah, a flood, and fallen angels , and even god? No we don't. We just have what the bible says and that was written and then altered and like I said, it's a distortion to our present perspective because it doesn't fit in modern time. We don't say Zeus is sitting on a cloud and throwing lightning down as an explanation for lightning. But once upon a time people thought like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you are attempting to understand what is prior to the bible, the bible is not reliable as a historical record because what was before wasn't necessarily a dogma. Dogma begins with the flood. The metaphorical purge to clear the slate, so that the dogma can begin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Revelations is more about how will it end. In doom and all that apocalypse... Because what comes after dogma is what was before. See, it's a loop. Dogma both begins and ends with a destruction, it's about fear and consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       But prior to that ,what was going on, prior to noah, prior to the flood? The bible won't help you so much with deep history. What did they believe? Did they even view such things as Gods? Did they over objectify creation?

       There's a theory that the younger dryas period was caused by a massive impact around 13000 years ago. They believe this object hit a glacier in North America and the resulting meltwater would have caused a flood wave, nearly 1000ft, to sweep over the continent. Any civilization there would have been competely wiped out. I think this event is where the flood myths come from.

       THIS, more than anything is such an offense to me.  I love Graham Hancock's quote "we are a species with amnesia".  I feel like Robinson Crusoe waking up on a beach.  I would love a burning bush to speak with some authority as to what this game is all about.  Is it all locked up in Vatican vaults?  What's the point and where are we from, what's expected of us?  And to think some people somewhere might actually know but keep it from us as a strategic advantage.  Well, it gives me a mission at least...  (Great post btw, thanks for writing it up)

       actually there is a pretty staggering amount of evidence to support the flood(s)
      </p>
      <p>
       noah you could possibly argue is the story of our common ancestors (backed up by genetics etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       the giant skeletons they have found or hell even the neandethals could be evidence of what may have been interpeted then as the angels/nephalim etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       i listed those in order of what has more physical evidence to support them but i agree these historical/religious documents are still just what people interpeted and then wrote down in a way they could understand and share. the understanding of the world those people held were pretty damn ignorant though so imho that lense of what was understood then versus now is something that needs to be kept front and center when thinking about these theories.

       i believe in the giants/nephalim theory BECAUSE i am an atheist.
      </p>
      <p>
       the idea that "gods" were visitors makes 1000x more sense than the "official" account  Christianity has tried to sell us. (raised roman catholic and did sunday school until my teens)
      </p>
      <p>
       IF that is what the story really is about, then controlling the relics of that time and evidence of them really is no different than controlling the biblical Ark or grail. keeping those items from being examined and perhaps confirming that to be the case allows them to maintain their control.
      </p>
      <p>
       If christians suddenly found out jesus was the son of an alien named "god" and that they left 2000+ years ago to go check out some other inhabited planet after leaving us some rules that we should follow, how does the vatican maintain control of its flock? prayer is meaningless, the pope has no connection to "god" these cardinals are just run of the mill pedophiles, etc etc etc. their whole little empire falls apart.

       This is the most important point. It's not a hollow earth it's a honeycomb crust earth. But for all intents and purposes it's vast enough for entire civilizations to dwell all around the globe and that's the point. The elite are connected to each other by vast underground military bases all over the world connected by underground high speed rail systems. Even the Denver airport contractors admit to building underground skyscrapers (earthscrapers?).

       this here is probably the most supporting evidence i have ever seen in regards to the hollow earth theory. now do these forces scale up to the size and with the same materials i have not been able to find a definitive answer and its not exactly something any one can test out.

       You are an insane person. Putting aside the astronomical cost to bore through thousands of miles of continent, (remember, even on the surface, high-speed rail in the U.S. has been stymied by the cost and distances involved) what the fuck is the point of this "network"? This is most likely the only way you can conceive of how the world works, the "elite" "underground tunnel" model is an easy metaphor for the complex workings of power, politics and money that operate in the world today. If you consider yourself a critical thinker and someone who has insight beyond the "sheep," in what universe do you arrive at these conclusions?

       these tunnels would allow connections underground between nuclear bunkers foregoing the ability to travel on the surface, it also allows for materials, and arms to be moved around the country out of view of soviet satellites.

       not to shit on your parade but the deep underground ocean is water caught in a type of mineral, its not a physical ocean, just a ton of h20 molecules bound up in solid rock.

       now i do support the historical giants (biblical accounts, native american skeletons in burial mounds etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       i have not seen any real evidence to support the idea of north/south pole gateways to the inner earth. the idea of the inner earth comes from germanic/ norse myths but i am still incredibly skeptical about that theory, but i do try to keep an open mind, the diaries etc are interesting but not exactly verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       the book of enoch, the nephalim etc are very interesting and reads like some damn good sci-fi by todays standards, the fact the vatican removed it from the accepted gospels is certainly interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       a problem when looking in to these theories is that the lines between religious bullshit and fact is very very blurry.
      </p>
      <p>
       just be aware this line of inquiry is not all or nothing, i think aspects of these theories have some evidence to support them, other parts are baseless.
      </p>
      <p>
       its imho in the vein of ancient aliens, a lot of interesting factual evidence with some potentially very flawed interpretations.

       Jules Vernes did a lot of writing about shit like this before his passing, which I like to take in account when seeing anything like this. As well as Hitler's secret expeditions to Tibet to find occult items and what not. Lots of shit out there about this, and if the original Book of Enoch ever gets released, it'd clear it all right up.

       You know it or you believe it? There's a difference. Knowing something should be based on cited evidence and reproducable results. Believing something is based on whatever the hell you want. If you know this is true, list some objective evidence that stands on its own with NO subjective explanation needed. If you're unable to do so, you are misleading people with your bs and I question your motives or your intellect.

       Your source is a trash tier clickbait "journalist" that makes all kinds of absurd assertions, like the US Government killing off living dinosaurs, Hillary was going to push an executive order to ban all guns, theres shapeshifting lizard demons, the anti-christ is a legitimate concept, and
       <strong>
        that Hitler was a good dude.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The only "evidence" is the account of a single man claiming a man named Dan was killed by a giant in kandahar in 2002 (You said 2005), but the only record of a dan dying in kandahar in 2002 was due to EOD incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to assert that the us government is killing giants spawned by angels, killing living dinosaurs, you gotta give me something more to go on if you'd like to be taken seriously.

       Snopes is ran by an old cat lady and her whoring husband. It's not the bible for what's true. Using snopes as a source is just as reliable as the old homeless man offering $10 blowjobs down the street.

       The truth is that there were never giants. There was however a species of beings that lived at a different level of existence almost as a form of direct energy. They have been manipulating our story as an experiment since the beginning. They have the ability to manipulate ma after at the atomic level and beyond. We were produced from basically an engineered prototype. The systematically create our entire existence from this ability to manipulate energy. We aren't the first or the last to be created. The accounts of giants was simply them toying with different prototypes before finalization. They do not exist anymore.

       I like to keep my focus on information from an inward perspective.  The more connections I make the more I'm starting to realize that "they" is us.  When I say connections I don't mean research online.  I mean asking my self questions and finding answers in experiences.  Feeling it if you know what I'm saying.

       "..then geology 3. What do we really know about the Earth's interior? And how trustworthy is our knowledge of it? Many people (mistakenly) think that the lava which pours out of volcanoes comes from a large reservoir of molten material which makes up the greater part of the Earth. Scientists have discovered that lava comes from within the Earth's crust. The lava comes from approximately 20 miles down. The existence of lava does not affect the passage of earthquake (seismic) waves. This indicates to scientists that the crust is largely solid. So where does the heat come from which melts the rock locally? Scientists have advanced two theories. Some say that the melting is due to high concentrations of radioactive elements in a particular area. These decaying radioactive elements generate enough heat to melt rock. Much lava is slightly radioactive and that lends support to this theory. Other geologists have argued that shearing and faulting are adequate heat generating mechanisms via friction. The evidence supports both theories. Lava cannot possibly be rising from the centre of the Earth as some may be tempted to think. It would cool down and become solid on its long, slow journey upwards. Lava is therefore a surface phenomenon and does not in any way reflect what the Earth is like 50 or 100 or more miles down."

       I think a hollow earth is without a doubt a conspiracy theory. I keep seeing more posts claiming this isnt a conspiracy or yadda yadda, wheres the proof. What inspires you idiots to even comment this useless diatribe is unbeknowst to me. Thats a bigger conspiracy! If you dont believe or care to beliebe, move along. Stop causing problems.  We all get that some things posted we all might buy into, but there is no need to cry a river over proof, in a sub that is about conspiracies

       This is a sub entirely dedicated to raising questions.  I'm raising questions regarding to the question raised.  You want an echo chamber of only conspiracy theorist that only believe in the conspiracies you believe in?  That sounds like more of a problem than raising a few questions.  Don't get mad because reasonable people bring up reasonable questions to unreasonable conspiracy theories.  How do you expect to find any kind of truth to the questions you seek if you run the non-believers out?
      </p>
      <p>
       You realize this sub is all about proof right?  A conspiracy theory is labeled that because of the lack of proof.  So, no, I will not leave or stop asking reasonable questions to the unreasonable conspiracy theories.  This particular "conspiracy theory" is dealing with worldwide government coverup, biblical characters and coverups in the bible, so called fallen spiritual entities, a hollow inhabitable planet, gigantic humanoids, a star within a planet, gravitational anomalies, and shit I can't even understand enough to put into thought.  The flat earthers at least provide some sort of what they call proof.  So, yes, show me some sort of what someone says is proof.

       My problem is I asked for YOU to explain YOUR thoughts.  Not just link to research someone compiled.  If you can't even collect your thoughts well enough to put it in your own words then no, I am not going to watch 45 minutes of youtube videos and read 2 other posts with more youtube links attached.

       There are some that say it is hollow and has a sun in there.  Suns are heavy with mass.  But even without that, the hollow shell has mass.  I am not a scientist so I don't know if that is enough to maintain gravity we are used to.

       Why are you assuming I'm willing to entertain "fallen angel hybrids" and not a sun inside of the Earth.  Any reasonable person could conclude that my statement was made by a person who is just hearing the claims of a literal sun inside of a planet.  I was replying in disbelief that people actually claim a star can be contained inside a planet.  And the fact that it is not fully contained.  So the hollow Earth has the exact same pressure as the exterior Earth?

       And if there is some kind of hollow Earth with it's own source of light and life, and some kind of opening to the the thing that we call Earth, why isn't there a constant beam of light being emitted from this opening in Antartica?  Do giants or these fallen angels...people actually believe in FALLEN ANGELS!?!?....not sleep?  They like constant light?

       Kind of a shame you're getting downvoted for this.. it's absolutely ludicrous to suggest there's a star inside the planet.  Like is everyone walking upside-down and looking up at a star that according to gravity they should be falling into?  gravity just reverses inside the earth?  How can a star that small exist?  How could life exist only a couple thousand miles away from a star?  Why aren't massive amounts of radiation coming up through the ground?  I'm all for cool theories but you have to draw the line when it gets ridiculous.

       Thank you!  That is all I was looking for in the first place.  How do the physics work in a hollow Earth with an opening to the exterior and a sun inside of a planet.  That is it.  I thought I was very respectful to begin with.  I like you, you seem reasonable and open to a discussion.  Apparently whenever someone is questioned here, the people asking the questions are automatically against their theories.  They are using the exact same tactic that so-called non-conspiracy theorists use against conspiracy theorists.

       Someone makes a huge post that contains claims violating every known law of physics, and they tell us we're closed minded when we don't believe that angels birthed an underground race of giants and shape shifting lizards run the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not how it works.  You can't go off on some crackbot theory with no relationship to reality and claim its true just because you say it is.  Or use a random cave painting that kind of looks like it might have a vaguely astronaut shaped figure on it.  That's like reading lovecraft and thinking its all real.  Just because someone drew a picture doesn't mean it was supposed to depict reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why argue about esoteric bullshit when there are real conspiracies going down every day?  These chucklefucks want to talk about demonic lizards shooting mind control waves off saturn but are sick and tired of hearing about political corruption.

       No. Just because earlier ancestors didn't fully understand the LAWS, not theories, of the Earth at the time, does not mean that anything is possible.  Keep watching the hit hollywood blockbuster, starring the big tits actress and universal black man, Lucy tho.  It seems to be doing YOUR mind a lot of good.

       So you think anything that anybody can come up with in their mind is a possibility?

       You seem like a really insecure person. In 200 years from now someone is going to say the same exact thing about us. You need to really think about your reponses before typing them out. Id say late teens early 20's by the way you percieve there to be absoultes. Humans have only been recording history for 15000 years? Earth has been habitable for at least a billion. Like i said we dont know enough to prove or disporve anything. Just take what you read with a grain of salt. It will help you in the long run and will make you a contirbuting adult in society.

       Well then I'm glad it is IMPOSSIBLE to live to be 227 years old.  You need to really think before you type or say anything.  So there is no absolutes in this world?  Now what fucking tangent are you going off?  Talking about a habitable Earth?  The Earth was inhabited long before humans.  The fact that you think humans are some kind of mythological all-knowing being is somewhat troubling.

       Holy fuck you are some kind of delusional.  I am taking what I read from you with an entire fucking salt mine.  Saying I read everything and take it as gospel.  I'd say early teens by the way you perceive, and spell, your thoughts.  I don't know if there is any help to give you so best just stay clear of society.

       Yikes, you really don't read what you type. You need to take a step back. You pretty much just agreed with everything everyone has been saying. You really need to calm down.  The first sign of insecurity is being critical of grammer and spelling. People speak more than 1 language and dont put as much thought into proper translations.

       What did I say that has agreed with "everything" "everyone" (by that do you mean you? hahaha) has been saying?  You really need to stop assuming everyone that disagrees with you over the internet is mad.  I'm laughing and overall joyfull just thinking about you and your thoughts and reasoning and critical thinking.  I am so glad I am not you.

       Hahahahaha did you just come up with that insecurity saying on the spot here plato?  So now correcting someone on a mistake is a sign of some sort of insecurity.  You know what probably is a sign of insecurity? I can't say for certain because I don't have a special degree on trying to interpret other people's thoughts, but I would bet any sort of psychologist would say people bringing up other people being insecure because they are afraid(?) to believe something is a sign of oneself's insecurity.  I don't give a shit what other languages you speak.  If english is not your first language and you are too insecure to accept a correction, then there is no helping you.

       Just one question.  Please answer so we can discuss.  I am commonly aware of the physical limitations of a spherical Earth with an Iron core, and I accept these LAWS OF NATURE.  So again, tell me how the laws of nature react within this theory.  Please.

       Would you like to know why I believe in some conspiracies and not others?  Just having to type that out makes me mad because by your logic every "conspiracy theorist" needs to believe in every conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in the conspiracies that use science, otherwise known as the LAWS of the Earth, which excludes the IMPOSSIBLE, to back up their claims.  The fact that you refuse to expand on your thoughts and then get mad at the fact that some people claim "where is some shard of something that resembles some kind of proof" is laughable.  I am not mad at all.  I am laughing at you.  I am mocking you.  Is that impossible?  It can't be possible that someone has the audacity to mock you, can it?

Unless you are assuming I believe humans are not intelligent?  Again, where am I contradicting myself?  You bring up nothing.  Just deflect and bring up a new topic.

       I think the point is to remain open minded.  Example, there is only a small difference in time between the wright brothers's first flight and the trip to the moon. Keeping an open mind allows you consider all possibilities.  Sherlock was successful because he would consider all possibilities, no matter how small.

       Tl;dr doesn't hurt you to have a more open mind.

       So asking questions is closed minded now?  Jesus fucking christ, if you can't support your thoughts then keep them to yourself.  What does bringing up the exponential rate of technological development have to do with anything me and that other person were talking about?  Are you going to tell me some conspiracy theory I haven't heard of regarding the advancement of technological methods and ideas since 1900?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe I have a very open mind.  How does asking for some kind of proof, an idea even, make me closed minded.  I asked for what this person thought and then proceeded to get ostracized because I wanted to hear it from them.  If they can't take the time to write out a quick explanation of their thoughts, why should I be criticised for not taking 4-5 hours out of my night to read up on a completely nonsensical theory?

Pro tip: you are not as open minded as you think you are.
Also: your angry tone is for no good reason.  You have brothers here sharing with you.  Relax, open your mind, and be open to learning,

       Why do you assume I am not open minded?  Because I am asking reasonable questions on this so called conspiracy?  How are you able to distinguish tone from text?  Sharing what?  All I've had shared with me is that people that don't even know me seem to know my thought processes.  I am very much open to learning.  Teach me something.

       I guess you need to google "scientific theory" or "mathematical proof" because it is definitely not the same definitions as a layman's "theory" or "proof".
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a couple of excerpts but I think you need to study up more on it because you sound completely ignorant of the concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
       " A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world."
      </p>
      <p>
       "In mathematics, a proof is a deductive argument for a mathematical statement. In the argument, other previously established statements, such as theorems, can be used. In principle, a proof can be traced back to self-evident or assumed statements, known as axioms, along with accepted rules of inference."

       SiriusDogon is right, the morning star is Venus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons for sun worship is pretty clear, it's the bringer of life, light and power. You also need to remember that Christianity took on a lot of the symbols of the pagan religions to assist in the conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your assumption is that Sun worship is evil, but there isn't really any connection there.

       The theory could equally be as true if they were being hidden to maintain the status quo and prevent an enlightenment.

       Yeah I agree with that. I just don't trust the Vatican just as much as I don't trust our govt. The pope has a telescope named Lucifer. I think the Vatican will be the head of the one world religion... luciferian when the NWO comes in play.

       Couple of people fussing about the biblical references here, and I understand your reservations, but it raises a thought I've often had: Which is the origin?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's all sorts of people who want to say that aliens are angels/demons, and there's all sorts of people who want to say angels/demons are aliens. Which is more true?
      </p>
      <p>
       We could have extradimensional or extraterrestrial beings which are masquerading as spiritual figures. They might have seeded the various religions or simply played to existing ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could instead have benign and malevolent spirits who masquerade as aliens. They might have created the popular image of aliens, or they might be disguising themselves as this image after we've already created it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, both sides could simply be the products of the human imagination - a series of accounts made consistent by shared human psychology or even just "telephone game" retellings.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't rule out the possibility that certain pieces have kernels of truth simply because it plays into religious ideas. There may yet be elements worth uncovering in those religious ideas, regardless of the overall accuracy/inaccuracy of those religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The full Hollow Earth idea may be physically impossible, for example, but what if there really are large networks of caves? There may not be actual demons who sired giants amongst ancient people, but what if there was a race of people who were genetically altered by a non-human race?
      </p>
      <p>
       The real art of deception is getting people to reject the truth without giving it consideration. We cannot consider ourselves to be truth-seekers if we don't at least investigate the possibilities which could underly even the most absurd stories. We should neither reject blindly nor accept blindly.

       I say it's a stupid response because it is.  It's safe to assume that most people in this sub do not take the bible very serious, you have to take it with a shitload of salt.  Any casual amount of browsing r/conspiracy will lead you to believe most people here are highly skeptical of the bible.  The person responds to this threads theory with how he loses some interest in the validity when it quotes the bible and takes it literal.  That is a very normal reaction to a theory whose supporting evidence for being factual is a quote from the bible.  Then you flip the script of r/conspiracy and act like NOT believing the bible is the brainwashing going on here.  Huh?  Well whatever man.  So in the discussion of the bible, you say people are being brainwashed not to believe. You then say governments and churches have and will cover up and lie.  It seems like you're probably just picking and choosing when to say the bible is nonsense and when it's to be taken completely literally and factually and is good enough to be proof of a theory stating giants and misc creatures live in the middle of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: it's stupid because you contributed nothing to the conversation yourself, other that what essentially boils down to "dude just think about it many, anythings possible."

       He didn't posit any of that shit as truth. Just possibility. And as for "flipping r/conspiracy's script" as you put it: are you suggesting that no one should speak against the prevailing opinions in a given community? How open minded of you.

      <p>
       All he said was that
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       we have our brainwashing narrative backwards. NOT TO MENTION that just because the bible may be corrupted or something, doesn't mean there are necessarily no shreds of truth to be found.

      <p>
       Furthermore, OP doesn't submit scripture as evidence, let alone the
       <em>

       evidence. He just submitted the clues supporting his hypothesis, and left it up to the reader to weigh in on.

       It's too bad that some people won't wake up and see what is really happening all around. These are the ones holding others back. Pushing them down, accepting "this is how it is? Okay. Let's not better ourselves or our planet then." No to progress, no to civil liberties and our God given rights to be free as humans? They like being controlled and told what to do and what to think it seems. The day may come when they get mad about it and wake up. But until then we can only help each other with a nudge. Free will to go about your life and make your decision!

       Using the bible as evidence makes for a weak argument. A more likely explanation is the petroleum reserves and other minerals which become fair game after the 1991 Madrid Protocol expires in 2048.

       I think people want to hear aliens are from all the stars and we have 800 different species living in the galaxies. The Pope shape shifts when he's constipated which is why he compared fake news to feces fetish. That shit was real news.lol

       The bible is a collection of ancient books, texts, and stories. It is not religion. It has become a tool of religion, and it has undoubtedly been edited to further specific agendas, but to dismiss it out of hand is a disservice to yourself.

       Man, if you're joking please tell me. What physic principle may dispose elements from the lighter to the heavier? And just for your information, the earth radius is larger than 6000km, while the deepest we reached is ~12km. Yet, we couldn't go any further because of the geothermal gradient, which shouldn't happen in an hollow object.

       I think the people in favour of this theory need to scale their ideas back. They may be on to something, but on a much smaller scale than "hollow earth". While imagining the entire earth is hollow can be exciting, it does not fit with our knowledge of our world. And there is no chance every scientist across the globe is paid off to say the earth
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       hollow.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, giving this theory the benefit of the doubt, there could be a deep cave system that's been hidden from the public for whatever reason that satisfies you the most.

       Caves need specific geological variables that are not found in most of the planet. Still, as I said before, we couldn't use them if they are any deeper than a few kilometers, due to pressure and temperature. Damn, even radioactive waste is buried relatively close to the surface

       I'm sure you believe on evolution, right? If, hypothetically, something were to start living in caves and over several generations were to begin moving deeper into said caves, becoming used to the pressure, radioactivity, lack of light, and oxygen, would you say they couldn't exist because humans can't live under these circumstances?

       Thing is: there are no caves, so no places where this "aliens" might live. In second place, carbon-based life forms specifically require STP variables or close in order to exist, otherwise we'd have them in other planets too. If they were a completely different life form (let's say, based on silicium), they wouldn't be able to enter our environment, for the same reasons you listed (lack of radioactivity, presence of light, oxygen that is mostly toxic, pressure and so on), therefore no close encounter might have happened

       Please excuse my late response, I was at work.

       You could take the five minutes it took you to write that condescending reply to go do some research.  I don't claim the whole Earth is hollow. Could there be huge pockets? Absolutely! Scientists state that the surface is porous. Why couldn't inside the Earth be the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientist estimate that the crust of the Earth is about ~45 km thick. How can you say that by digging down 12 km we can be sure the Earth isn't hollow. What if the Earth weren't porous in the specific location they were digging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go read the wiki article on scientific drilling and try to think past your own sense of self-superiority.

       If you had a clue about what I mentioned in my OP, you wouldn't have asked this question. Scientists know the earth's structure due to seismic waves propagation. Specifically, when earthquakes happen, they release waves that have different speed as they travel through different state of matter. Guess what? These waves don't propagate in gases, only in solids and liquids (a subset of them really, called P waves). Given this, we discovered the various discontinuities that separate the mantle and the asthenosphere from the core, and no signs of "bubbles" were detected.

       My research has already been done and I'm happy with it, and so far, fits perfectly with the rest of the planet. Yours doesn't, and a few motives are, again, already written in my OP

        it depends upon certain 'forces' at play, and which timelines are activated. Humanity, though utterly unconscious of the fact, has a significant part to play in this. You (as a collective consciousness of the planet) are choosing the Negative Polarization by default, by the quality of your thoughts and actions. Thought is creative energy, focused. You get exactly what you put out.

       Honeywell ships military equipment and supplies all over the world. One of their clients is Norway, where they are stockpiling in "caves". The person who told me this did not dispute me when I asserted that the caves were actually massive underground bases.

       Yes. That's what they call it. They also keep massive cargo ships, full of supplies, at sea for years at a time. When the ships rust out, they bring them in for painting and send back out.

       You could say they are 2 separate things.  Believing in God is one thing, but the bible is an ancient set of data.  You can believe it is all false, mostly false, some false, or all true.

       Both polar entrances have the Nordic types, including thousands of former Nazi's as well. If you go way inside the Inner Earth is infested with Reptilians. People have seen Reptilians come out of cave systems in the Southwest. They abducted groups of humans who were visiting the Catacombs. Most people thought the horrific child abuse David Icke talked about was years ago was fake. Now they are believers. Eventually it will be well known that the Inner Earth is hollow and is infested with extremely dangerous Reptilians..

In South America you read about people seeing the reptilians? South America has the largest underground bunker in the world. I wonder if they are near that??
Solomon island people say Giants and reptilians live in the caves. I listen to David icke, he's good.

       They say they live in the caves with eachother lol and they are cannibals. 
The Indians, US military, Solomon Islanders say they are mean, extremely strong, fast and cannibals. 
The Voyages of Byrd, 2 regular people boating to the inner earth said they were the friendliest Giants.

       I wonder, does the Wildebeest think the Lion is evil? Were the bugs in Starship Troopers "evil", or is any clash of species merely a moment of evolution and natural selection. I suspect that the notion of "good and evil" is a man-made construct used to generate fear, and hence control. Or, if "evil" is real, perhaps it is we humans that are evil? To me, the most important concepts to hold in your conscious mind are Cognitive Dissonance, Confirmation Bias, and Cognitive Distortion. Learn to identify in your own mind when you are thinking openly and rationally and when you are thinking emotionally, or using a closed mind.

       There is a Hopi prophecy about a broken tablet piece.  In that prophecy they speak of the piece being returned near the end of the world by a white man in a red cap.  I always assumed red cap meant red hair.  Red hair aliens :)  Star Warriors I think they called them.

       Anything and everything is possible.  I guess Orange was known as yellow-red before the Spaniards changed shit.  The wiki article says "wearing red" for the Pahana.   Maybe it referred to someone who uses a tanning booth way too much. hehe

       The night Saturn stood still.
      </p>
      <p>
       One night I went camping with my wife and I took a massive dose synthetic psilocybin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I rarely dabble in recreational drug use of any kind but the occasion called for it... Anyways didn't take too long till everything was moving wildly. The camp fire was making the trees next to me melt in fantastic colors, all the while every star in the sky was swirling with great viger. Everything in my field of vision was moving except for a single object in the sky. My sober sitter and wifey pooh had to use a star charting app on her phone to see what it was, sure enough it was Saturn.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried everything to make Saturn budge. I stared at It for well over an hour and it was completely stationary. Even tried using my perifual vision but nothing worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gotta disclose that I'm not really into astronomy so going into that experience I had no idea where Saturn was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saturn "Sauron" is key to middle earth. Host to the council of ELders in the 8th dimension. I promise the only war of meaning here is a spiritual one. The harvest is now.

       Man ur dabble sounds pretty trippy. I agree, there's a spiritual war going on. Evil had its way for a while and good is ahead now but evil won't just give up with a fight. 
What's crazy..: is a lot of people have no idea we are in a HUGE war right now, spiritually.

       One thing worth reading about is the religious freedom movements in colonial north america. The gist is that people began to realize that they should read and interpret religious works for themselves rather than rely (submit) to a so-called expert (priest) opinion. We are told that many early settlers came here to escape religious persecution or to establish religious freedom for themselves, but we are not told how they attempted to take back the real meanings in the religious texts, or to find real truths in the religious texts. The legacy of that effort in seen in the so-called "separation of church and state" in the us constitution. However, in the intervening centuries the church has re-established control of the truth. We are told that anything in the bible that mentions "chariots of fire" or "giants" is allegory. I am not religious, and I'll admit that I struggle to take religious sources seriously (meaning that when I see a guy preaching in a church, my cognitive dissonance flairs up dramatically) but I do believe that some inconvenient truths found their way into the religious texts. Zecharia Sitchin's early books are highly accesible reads, very entertaining, and open the door to altenate explanations of our modern world. I certainly don't claim to know The Truth, but every time I read anything that sounds like dogma I immediately try to figure why. Its usually comes down to control: they are either trying to impose a useful world view (useful to them) or they are blocking truth (usually both).

       David Icke's theory is that Saturns rings are used by aliens to transmit energy to earth, which is reflected by a man-made moon to create the illusion of life on earth (like the matrix) and to generate negative feelings, preventing humans from having a singular conciousness

       Thanks for taking the time to write me and send me the link. I've seen it before and it's pretty fascinating stuff. I'm fairly certain that it's all disinformation though. David icke is probably a shapeshifting reptilian and Alex Jones is controlled opposition by the illuminati.

       This is extremely difficult to convey accurately. I always send people back to this thread from 2008 of a self-proclaimed Illuminati Insider. This being claims to be the spiritual leader for the luciferian soul group that has come here help with Yahweh's spiritual progress.

       Back to your question, there are 9 dimensions with the source of all creation being at the highest. Each step down is a distortion of perfect unity. Saturn is one step away with guardianship over this solar system. After that night I kind of like to think of it as if we are in Saturn's shadow.

       Gravity only works as long as you believe it does. The moment you realize gravity isn't real, you are free from its bonds, (and you freeze to death with your knowledge...)

       It's funny that we accept "conventional" gravity as described by Einstein as a "warping" of spacetime because that's what physicists tell us. Of course, physicists can't reconcile quantum theory with relativity, but we are assured they will because they always do. None of this answers your question, but I just think it's funny that we accept such a bizarre and non-intuitive explanation as fact.

       We accept it because it applies to our world, not the world of quantum physics.

       It has so far worked for us and it will continue until the next genius finds a new discoveries but that will have nothing to do with hollow earth and giants.

       they are close to the goal set about 2 hundred years ago, a genocide of the population and they plan on surviving underground in the frozen wastes , it is one of the only places the virus will not survive , they have storage places all over the world where they store food , a seed bank in the frozen north to help them rebuild and a 2 year deadline from the start of 2017 , if not complete they are going to nuke the planet . that's all i know.

       people mistake the "social Elite"  or "political Elite" for the real Elite , the real Elite are a set of ancient bloodlines and those within who rule the rulers are the real Elite , i am of the inside but not like them , i love video games , music and things they deem inappropriate , i was raised upon esoterics and  books you dont know exist ..

       there are over 50 underground bases in the US , i do not live there but have been to 2 of them (lots of things are made down there)

       the plan the "Elite" have not everyone on the inside wants it but follow out of fear of social exclusion , i know things others dont but this is the internet people do not want to believe the truth , they too follow out of fear of social exclusion , the whole pizzagate thing , its Johns brother you want to focus on , and jeffrey epstein ? people have this all wrong , you want proof of Aliens ? this man knows all about them him and Demon worshiping Prince Andrew ..

       That seems highly odd considering there are at least
       <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/dd/81/ef/dd81efe77f7eab24df906f99f16f0dd4.jpg">
        7 versions
       </a>
       which preceded it and were ultimately used as source material. Even something like the 4th century Vulgate is a curated collection of the disparate texts
       <em>
        Vetus Latina
       </em>
       which comprised the Latin bible before the Vulgate. I guess I'm just wondering why King James would be the final arbiter of the word of god?

       Hey man first off thanks for posting. Second I've just recently been consuming all of these posts and information over the past few days that has really blown my mind and completely changed my way of thinking. I'm coming to a lot of conclusions and a lot of this shit seems so negative from what I'm finding, like say all of this is 100% true then is there anything you've researched that us good guys could do to prepare? I mean if we're going to be fighting demons in my lifetime I'd at least like to stand a chance you know, haha? Anyways if there is anything you've found out about beating them if it comes to war, I would love to hear it

       Thanks man.. yeah, it's pretty scary shit what we are up against. The main thing is to be prepared and stay Awake. 
I've come up a 2 plans incase something happen i.e. Natural disaster, nukes, or fake alien invasion. ( Von Braun says the elites last card is to stage a fake alien invasion. They might try this to scare us into NWO. I think the "aliens" are already on earth and walking amongst us.)
-plan A at  home 
-plan B escape out of the city if you can't stay in your home. 
-stocked up with ammo,guns, water, canned food enough for 3 months etc, survival stuff.(find a list online) 
Even if nothing happens... it's good to stay prepared with all this stuff especially with rumors of war everyday. 
You just never know...
Never leave with FEMA if Obama happens to declare martial law. People are saying FEMA camps are like the Holocaust for Christians or non sheeple. 
No vaccines and don't get chipped. 
I've also repent and made sure I'm saved again (baptized)

       ... David Icke explains it perfectly on how we can prepare and defeat the elites. 
The key is... waking up the mass population to reality. Majority of the people are asleep and have no idea what REALity is. We need to unlearn everything we were taught and reeducate.

       While this is very important is and is going the right direction needed to destroy the system of control and domination of the elites, it's still missing the crucial key connector which is Atlantis. See my post

        here
       </a>
       about it and help it get more up votes so more people see it.

      <p>
       Atlantis, even more so than hollow earth is the key to destroying the elite's system of control since it is the thing that will truly destroy the narrative they have built over millennia that is the heart of their system.

       Excellent post man!!  I've read Atlantis is where shit went down and Atlantis might have been connected to Antarctica? Maybe they have found technology in one of the bases? I watched this YouTube video of a conspiracy of Atlantis technology found in Antarctica.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=H_a-N8D5Iwo">
        Atlantis Technology
       </a>
       Wouldn't you think this type of technology isn't from humans? We are so Stone Age compared to what we had in the past. I think it's the controllers of the world holding us back from evolving. We should have zero point energy now, but nah that won't happen bc that takes money out of the elites pockets. I don't mind people ruling us but damn don't suppress us, let us evolve. 
We are probably the 3rd world planet in the galaxy. Lol can you imagine what UFOs visiting us think about us? They prob laugh and fly back off. Smh

       It would be most likely that they did find something in Antarctica, and most likely have gotten a lot of their advanced technology from certain e.t.'s who perhaps weren't very spiritually aware and who also could have been some kind of elite themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of their advanced technology is given to us to use simply because it would relinquish some of their control and domination over us, and that can't happen, so its only used to continue the existence of their system of control by whatever means necessary, albeit within the framework of their system and their narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their lust for power is insatiable and they want to completely dominate everything on the planet but have to do so within the framework of the narrative that they have built which is what maintains their system of control, since when people buy into the narrative they accept the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they can't simply use this technology out right in incredibly obvious ways since it would break the narrative and collapse the system. But they need this technology to use it as much as they can and are able to within the framework of their system to further their goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to think that to the majority of e.t.'s that are spiritually advanced and aware, we are simply seen as beings in a dark place oppressed by those who have forgotten the purpose of the negativity (to learn lessons), but that we will wake up and then we will be able to join them on the galactic stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to realize that the destruction of the system has to happen from internal destruction of the narrative, which means that Atlantis must be discussed/researched and then rediscovered so that we make the connections between our history and the present. The internal destruction, which would come from humanity learning of its own past, rather than external destruction, which would be e.t.'s coming in and benevolently ending the system and destroying the narrative is more effective at producing a populace that would can learn the ultimate lesson of the age, that the negativity we find ourselves in isn't the natural state of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be taught to us by benevolent, spiritually advanced beings from elsewhere, but if we don't make the connection ourselves to our past and present and discover for ourselves Atlantis, then the lesson won't truly sink in since we are more likely to take it for granted if simply given it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that's not to say there will be no help once the beginning of the end has come for the elites. Oh the contraire, there will be far more help than we have experienced in thousands of years. More sightings, more communication, and even more meetings. Once Atlantis is rediscovered and everyone knows about it, the cat is then out of the bag and they no longer have to wait for us to make the connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do have to make the connection ourselves, but there will always be help, and help is indeed necessary. That is distinguished from having them do it for us with no effort of our own. Once Atlantis is rediscovered and the rediscovery of it and information we learn about it is disseminated world wide, then the narrative of the elites will truly be destroyed and once that happens, there goes their system of control and everything they have built to keep the system running will be undone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once communication with the spiritually advanced e.t.'s is reinstated, we will learn the full truth about Atlantis in complete detail as they will surely know every bit about it. And with Atlantis being such an advanced civilization, they would surely have kept secret record rooms around the globe in key places, in case Atlantis was ever destroyed, which it clearly was.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the e.t.'s would almost assuredly show us the location of these record rooms and allow us access to these records and their own records and we can then go into extreme detail about every aspect of Atlantis. And we will then use this knowledge and these details to recreate it on a grand, global scale, all with the added benefits of current trends, namely things like the internet,

       That will then be a truly global civilization, united as a planet rather than divided by religious, ethnic, political, economic, and social differences. Countries will be done away with, as every single country on earth works within the framework of the system of control and domination of the elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we learn the full story of Atlantis, we will also fully learn the origins of humanity and where we came from, since we most certainly have unknown origins. The current part of the narrative dealing with our origins tells us that we evolved from a common ancestor with apes and that we simply developed this kind of intelligence due to some random, non-intelligent process that somehow decides which species grow to be super intelligent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all seems very logical and seems to make sense but there are many holes in this story, with the most obvious fact being that if literally everything about our life here on earth is influenced and controlled to some degree by the system of the elites, why on earth wouldn't one of the most important things (the origin of humanity as a species) be controlled and influenced?
      </p>
      <p>
       To believe otherwise and to be skeptical and "scientific" is simply a condition of their narrative being forced upon and ingrained in us and their system being ever-prevalent throughout our lives. The skepticism and mainstream scientific approach is completely manufactured by the elite to control discussion, curiosity, and interest in the most important aspects of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skepticism of this level is automatically linked with a denial of any kind of meaningful spirituality as everything then becomes suspect. It is built off of distrust and only feeds negativity and corrupts so many different aspects of people's lives, often at a deep, subconscious level. Their attitudes, desires, beliefs, feelings, and thoughts, are all negatively affected by this kind of skepticism since the inherent negativity of it seeps its way into all of these things and subtlety drives people to accept the narrative and system even further, at which point they then become willing participants in continuing its existence and actively defend it, whatever part or parts of it that may be, whether it be politics, religion, mainstream science, economics, or the social institutions that make up their system such as government, law enforcement, military, schooling (they most certainly have gigantic amounts of control over education the world over), healthcare, banks, corporations, and the other institutions that comprise this system. Since the negativity of such skepticism and by extension the elite's narrative and system corrupts people's minds, beliefs, and desires, they then continue to treat each other in horrible ways the world over, ranging from bullying to horrific acts of violence and sexual behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also denies people access to what can truly give life real and lasting vivaciousness and meaning, and that's meaningful spirituality. Again the core of meaningful spirituality would be to learn lessons to grow and appreciate existence far more while infinitely expanding in all areas of life. Another huge part of meaningful spirituality is realizing that the learning never stops completely and thus stagnation never has to happen. Even when one isn't learning at the moment, one can be applying the lessons one has learned to their life to enjoy it more and create an overall better existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Atlanteans surely would have known this and again, would have had a standard of living and existence that blows our current one out of the water a thousand miles high. An open mind and a willing constitution (meaning a willingness to explore, discuss, consider, and research different "debunked" topics) are the keys to overcoming the skepticism and the mainstream "scientific" beliefs and thinking that has overcome majority of the academic world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skepticism has its uses, like being skeptical OF the narrative and system of the elites, or being being skeptical in a practical way like not trusting a shady businessman or someone you sincerely think has negative ulterior motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those things are healthy and can set one free to a certain degree from the negativity that prevails this planet. But its use and application only go so far and are only healthily applied to certain things. And if we are skeptical about meaningful spirituality which involves learning lessons, then we truly are as lost as the negative elites that want to control and dominate the world, because they lost sight of this point long, long ago, and that's what led them to be increasingly negative and to perpetuate negativity in all aspects of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ultimately that negativity that the elite thrive upon and have instilled into every aspect of our lives is what we will overcome and once overcome our lives will return to a level near of what Atlantis had.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, if you can, read the other replies I posted to the other commenters on my post since I go into even more detail about Atlantis that is crucial to discussion of it and that further lays out why things would be the way they are. And one last thing, please try to show others who show signs of waking up and questioning of the elite's narrative and system this reply, my post, and the other replies on my post, since they are all connected and link together to form a much better and fuller picture.

       Everyone has their opinions on which conspiracy theory they believe and which ones are a total joke. 
I think Antarctica definitely has something to do with aliens  or a master race... this thread I focused on the master race being the Giants that were mentioned in the Bible.

       I don't know... I tend to think our atmosphere was different and everything grew larger in the past including humans. There is no doubt that large human remains exist. The question is what did our atmosphere comprise of to allow the large growth of the biodiversity on the planet. Could we return the atmosphere to the way it was? Was our atmosphere intentionally altered by other biological beings or was it all a freak accident? I tend to think it was a accident and the stories you read about encounters by normal humans and giants are the telling of people encountering their dying predecessors hanging on for survival but unable due to the radical change in our atmosphere. All the religions of old seem to be stories mixed with mysticism. It would stand to reason that the older humans that were large would be advanced or at least capable of having a advanced mother civilization. Atlantis, Mu, etc.

       I dunno.. I believe (even the elites believe) history repeats itself. 
They are basically saying the fallen angels tried to destroy the earth before and they will try to do it again, just in reptilian/human form rather then Giant form.

       I always thought the giants or "EL" were a version of hybrid that had more of the "god gene" than we do. Like, they were humans mk1, and we are humans mk2.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were wiped out by god because they were too smart, and too big. So they killed them, and created us in their stead. Smaller, stupider, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, is god some mystical all knowing force? Or is god just an alien, who owns a company that harvests something from the earth. If you think about it, gene splicing a new race to do your work for you is the best way to go about things. Machines break down, and fuck doing the work yourself.... especially if you can't breath mostly nitrogen.

       Hmm... that's an interesting view and does make sense if you think about it. I've always thought we were the elites human energy farm but didn't think about it relating to God. 
I've read aliens feed off of fear for their energy which is why the elite (reptilians) constantly put us through war, 24/7 scare tactic media, etc 
If our planet was controlled and ran by humans, I think we would live in a more peaceful planet.

       Yeah, my version is basically what the sumarians carved into stone, but from hearing many things like what Phil Schneider spoke about, that there are around 20 something different KNOWN alien species that come and go from our plant all the time. It really makes one wonder. Like, did we all actually evolve? Are all races born of the same evolution? Or perhaps did each alien type create their own type of human to do the work needed in areas they were specifically designed for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have what you are discussing, which is demon stuff, reptilians, portals, etc. Many reports of people that saw a reptilian said that it literally appeared out of nowhere, leading many to believe they possess some sort of technology or power to "phase" or perhaps exist on a different light spectrum or wavelength than us altogether. Literally living right beside us. Like an upsidedown world.

       All this is so fkin insane and what's crazy about it.. all of it could be True. Like no big deal, our president shape shifts at night and eats babies, smoking hot Nordics live in the poles, 15ft red hair Giants in the caves, and alien fly bys all of which just laugh at us bc we are still in The Stone Age and not up to par in tech. 
Do you think the elites will try and sell us out or do you think humans will take control? I'm sure Putin will cause false flags to sway the German voters towards a human nationalist lol

       I watched the video about the patrol in Afghanistan attacked by a red haired giant
      </p>
      <p>
       I have one question about the legitimacy of that story: why was a grunt foot patrol carrying around a Barret? The thing is heavy and would seem more a waste on a mission like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see it if a humvee patrol was sent out, but they were air lifted in and on foot.

       If the earth is hollow why is it that the deepest holes the USA and Russia have drilled (40,000') have temperatures in excess of 350 degrees?  So in addition the giants being, well, giant, they are able to survive that sort of temperature?  And their bodies apparently don't require sunlight?  And they've managed to hide their home world literally right beneath our noses for tens of thousands of years?

       Thank you for sharing and Merry Christmas!
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to comment on these morning stars since I happened to come across them yesterday in reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take Job 38:4-7 where God refers to the divine council or heavenly host existing before creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       4 “Where were you when I founded the earth?
Tell me, if you know so much.
5 Do you know who determined its dimensions
or who stretched the measuring line across it?
6 On what were its bases sunk,
or who laid its cornerstone,
7 when the morning stars sang together,
and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Pslam 82 where Asaph describes gods, sons of the Most High, dying like men because of their wicked partiality.
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) Elohim stands in the divine assembly;
there with the elohim, he judges:
2 “How long will you go on judging unfairly,
favoring the wicked? (Selah)
3 Give justice to the weak and fatherless!
Uphold the rights of the wretched and poor!
4 Rescue the destitute and needy;
deliver them from the power of the wicked!”
5 They don’t know, they don’t understand,
they wander about in darkness;
meanwhile, all the foundations of the earth
are being undermined.
6 “My decree is: ‘You are elohim,
sons of the Most High all of you.
7 Nevertheless, you will die like mortals;
like any prince, you will fall.’”
8 Rise up, Elohim, and judge the earth;
for all the nations are yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       I encourage everyone here to heed OPs words and put on the armor of God.  Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.

       Thank you!  That is all I was looking for in the first place.  How do the physics work in a hollow Earth with an opening to the exterior and a sun inside of a planet.  That is it.  I thought I was very respectful to begin with.  I like you, you seem reasonable and open to a discussion.  Apparently whenever someone is questioned here, the people asking the questions are automatically against their theories.  They are using the exact same tactic that so-called non-conspiracy theorists use against conspiracy theorists.

       How do the physics of a hollow Earth with an opening to the exterior work?

       Just one question.  Please answer so we can discuss.  I am commonly aware of the physical limitations of a spherical Earth with an Iron core, and I accept these LAWS OF NATURE.  So again, tell me how the laws of nature react within this theory.  Please.

       It would be most likely that they did find something in Antarctica, and most likely have gotten a lot of their advanced technology from certain e.t.'s who perhaps weren't very spiritually aware and who also could have been some kind of elite themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of their advanced technology is given to us to use simply because it would relinquish some of their control and domination over us, and that can't happen, so its only used to continue the existence of their system of control by whatever means necessary, albeit within the framework of their system and their narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their lust for power is insatiable and they want to completely dominate everything on the planet but have to do so within the framework of the narrative that they have built which is what maintains their system of control, since when people buy into the narrative they accept the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they can't simply use this technology out right in incredibly obvious ways since it would break the narrative and collapse the system. But they need this technology to use it as much as they can and are able to within the framework of their system to further their goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to think that to the majority of e.t.'s that are spiritually advanced and aware, we are simply seen as beings in a dark place oppressed by those who have forgotten the purpose of the negativity (to learn lessons), but that we will wake up and then we will be able to join them on the galactic stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to realize that the destruction of the system has to happen from internal destruction of the narrative, which means that Atlantis must be discussed/researched and then rediscovered so that we make the connections between our history and the present. The internal destruction, which would come from humanity learning of its own past, rather than external destruction, which would be e.t.'s coming in and benevolently ending the system and destroying the narrative is more effective at producing a populace that would can learn the ultimate lesson of the age, that the negativity we find ourselves in isn't the natural state of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be taught to us by benevolent, spiritually advanced beings from elsewhere, but if we don't make the connection ourselves to our past and present and discover for ourselves Atlantis, then the lesson won't truly sink in since we are more likely to take it for granted if simply given it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that's not to say there will be no help once the beginning of the end has come for the elites. Oh the contraire, there will be far more help than we have experienced in thousands of years. More sightings, more communication, and even more meetings. Once Atlantis is rediscovered and everyone knows about it, the cat is then out of the bag and they no longer have to wait for us to make the connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do have to make the connection ourselves, but there will always be help, and help is indeed necessary. That is distinguished from having them do it for us with no effort of our own. Once Atlantis is rediscovered and the rediscovery of it and information we learn about it is disseminated world wide, then the narrative of the elites will truly be destroyed and once that happens, there goes their system of control and everything they have built to keep the system running will be undone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once communication with the spiritually advanced e.t.'s is reinstated, we will learn the full truth about Atlantis in complete detail as they will surely know every bit about it. And with Atlantis being such an advanced civilization, they would surely have kept secret record rooms around the globe in key places, in case Atlantis was ever destroyed, which it clearly was.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the e.t.'s would almost assuredly show us the location of these record rooms and allow us access to these records and their own records and we can then go into extreme detail about every aspect of Atlantis. And we will then use this knowledge and these details to recreate it on a grand, global scale, all with the added benefits of current trends, namely things like the internet,
      </p>
      <p>
       That will then be a truly global civilization, united as a planet rather than divided by religious, ethnic, political, economic, and social differences. Countries will be done away with, as every single country on earth works within the framework of the system of control and domination of the elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we learn the full story of Atlantis, we will also fully learn the origins of humanity and where we came from, since we most certainly have unknown origins. The current part of the narrative dealing with our origins tells us that we evolved from a common ancestor with apes and that we simply developed this kind of intelligence due to some random, non-intelligent process that somehow decides which species grow to be super intelligent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all seems very logical and seems to make sense but there are many holes in this story, with the most obvious fact being that if literally everything about our life here on earth is influenced and controlled to some degree by the system of the elites, why on earth wouldn't one of the most important things (the origin of humanity as a species) be controlled and influenced?
      </p>
      <p>
       To believe otherwise and to be skeptical and "scientific" is simply a condition of their narrative being forced upon and ingrained in us and their system being ever-prevalent throughout our lives. The skepticism and mainstream scientific approach is completely manufactured by the elite to control discussion, curiosity, and interest in the most important aspects of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skepticism of this level is automatically linked with a denial of any kind of meaningful spirituality as everything then becomes suspect. It is built off of distrust and only feeds negativity and corrupts so many different aspects of people's lives, often at a deep, subconscious level. Their attitudes, desires, beliefs, feelings, and thoughts, are all negatively affected by this kind of skepticism since the inherent negativity of it seeps its way into all of these things and subtlety drives people to accept the narrative and system even further, at which point they then become willing participants in continuing its existence and actively defend it, whatever part or parts of it that may be, whether it be politics, religion, mainstream science, economics, or the social institutions that make up their system such as government, law enforcement, military, schooling (they most certainly have gigantic amounts of control over education the world over), healthcare, banks, corporations, and the other institutions that comprise this system. Since the negativity of such skepticism and by extension the elite's narrative and system corrupts people's minds, beliefs, and desires, they then continue to treat each other in horrible ways the world over, ranging from bullying to horrific acts of violence and sexual behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also denies people access to what can truly give life real and lasting vivaciousness and meaning, and that's meaningful spirituality. Again the core of meaningful spirituality would be to learn lessons to grow and appreciate existence far more while infinitely expanding in all areas of life. Another huge part of meaningful spirituality is realizing that the learning never stops completely and thus stagnation never has to happen. Even when one isn't learning at the moment, one can be applying the lessons one has learned to their life to enjoy it more and create an overall better existence.

       The Atlanteans surely would have known this and again, would have had a standard of living and existence that blows our current one out of the water a thousand miles high. An open mind and a willing constitution (meaning a willingness to explore, discuss, consider, and research different "debunked" topics) are the keys to overcoming the skepticism and the mainstream "scientific" beliefs and thinking that has overcome majority of the academic world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Skepticism has its uses, like being skeptical OF the narrative and system of the elites, or being being skeptical in a practical way like not trusting a shady businessman or someone you sincerely think has negative ulterior motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those things are healthy and can set one free to a certain degree from the negativity that prevails this planet. But its use and application only go so far and are only healthily applied to certain things. And if we are skeptical about meaningful spirituality which involves learning lessons, then we truly are as lost as the negative elites that want to control and dominate the world, because they lost sight of this point long, long ago, and that's what led them to be increasingly negative and to perpetuate negativity in all aspects of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ultimately that negativity that the elite thrive upon and have instilled into every aspect of our lives is what we will overcome and once overcome our lives will return to a level near of what Atlantis had.

       Please, if you can, read the other replies I posted to the other commenters on my post since I go into even more detail about Atlantis that is crucial to discussion of it and that further lays out why things would be the way they are. And one last thing, please try to show others who show signs of waking up and questioning of the elite's narrative and system this reply, my post, and the other replies on my post, since they are all connected and link together to form a much better and fuller picture.

       Thing is: there are no caves, so no places where this "aliens" might live. In second place, carbon-based life forms specifically require STP variables or close in order to exist, otherwise we'd have them in other planets too. If they were a completely different life form (let's say, based on silicium), they wouldn't be able to enter our environment, for the same reasons you listed (lack of radioactivity, presence of light, oxygen that is mostly toxic, pressure and so on), therefore no close encounter might have happened

       I like to keep my focus on information from an inward perspective.  The more connections I make the more I'm starting to realize that "they" is us.  When I say connections I don't mean research online.  I mean asking my self questions and finding answers in experiences.  Feeling it if you know what I'm saying.

       Someone makes a huge post that contains claims violating every known law of physics, and they tell us we're closed minded when we don't believe that angels birthed an underground race of giants and shape shifting lizards run the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not how it works.  You can't go off on some crackbot theory with no relationship to reality and claim its true just because you say it is.  Or use a random cave painting that kind of looks like it might have a vaguely astronaut shaped figure on it.  That's like reading lovecraft and thinking its all real.  Just because someone drew a picture doesn't mean it was supposed to depict reality.

       Why argue about esoteric bullshit when there are real conspiracies going down every day?  These chucklefucks want to talk about demonic lizards shooting mind control waves off saturn but are sick and tired of hearing about political corruption.

       I'm interested in the first part of your comment, genuinely. What do you mean, "question even further?" It is hard to convey tone in text but i am honestly asking to know.
      </p>

       Every religious person I've talked to. Had the aspect of faith. There was always a point where they would say, "gods will," "in gods hands," those cliche things.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct in a sense with the last sentence, i have no faith in organized religion. I place my religious philosophies somewhere in the spectrum between mahayana Buddhism and la veyan satanism. As weird as that sounds. So the only appropriate title for me is agnostic, but ive had my time with the christian church and it's not for me.
