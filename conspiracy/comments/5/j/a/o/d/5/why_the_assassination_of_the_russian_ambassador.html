       The lack of any hint of forward blood splatter was something I noticed the very first time I saw the video, and other questions came to mind as well…
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the floor around his fallen body so immaculate when there should be a pool of blood?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was the assassin able to stand around and give his backstory for the attack without coming under fire?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were there no other policeman besides the assassin near the Russian ambassador?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were there no armed bodyguards from the Russian embassy near him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it standard practice to leave an ambassador alone with NO SECURITY at a public event in a high-terror nation like Turkey?

       I think the shooter was on security detail.

      <p>
       Edit: actually, what the photographer said was: "When I returned to the office to edit my photos, I was shocked to see that the shooter was actually standing behind the ambassador as he spoke. Like a friend, or a bodyguard"

       The last question is worth asking for sure. Why were there no gaurds or security to return fire? They said he was "neutralized," but when and how? Theoretically, the shooter could have used blanks which, at that range, could've disturbed the ambassador's clothes. Were there photos of the scene afterward showing blood?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: shooter was and killed. Saw photos. A lot more blood than the ambassador.

       There's photos of the assassin shot dead, small amounts of blood too. Small caliber, round nose bullets would have small entrance and exit wounds resulting in less blood on both the ambassador and the assassin. From the video, though, the ambassador's jacket moves in time with a shot. Shouldn't we see the front of his shirt have some blood soaking through? Was anyone else at the event hit? Those shots would have passed through him and into (or near depending on the angle) the crowd.

       There's quite a bit of blood on the assassin. It looks like he was probably using a 9mm. Not massive, but not small. At any rate, I would expect to see some blood somewhere around the ambassador.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether the ambassador died or not, I think the timing of this, and what the assassin shouted after are suspicious.

       Early MSM reports said he was alive when they took him out to the ambulance... Ambassador could have had a vest and got killed from blunt force to the back with no blood.

       I've seen a lot of episodes of the First 48... this looks like a "normal" crime scene... they aren't ever as bloody as they look like on tv and movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my head I have this pinned as the back right corner of the area where he was pacing in the video... I'd like to see the layout of the room... cause the angle from the bullet holes look like the shooters flanked in quite close and fired as he was going down... maybe he was behind the podium the guy was giving his speech at... and was hit there... dropped and tried to move back towards the wall... I'd say it looks like more than one shooter cause a couple of the holes in the wall look higher caliber than the others... but I feel like they got inside and up on him before firing... Thats just my spidey-sense though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no gun expert, but I think he blew his only clip all into the dude's back.

       Thanks for the reverse angle... I think the photographer must be standing in roughly the same spot the shooters body ended up...
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if there is an exit over where those people are huddling... I'd guess not cause they prolly all be heading for it.... though they do seem clustered there... I feel like thats where the shots that killed the shooter came from... that general direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that the camera that recorded the shooting hidden behind the PA? Cause whatever it was recorded on was on a tripod...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I got to go back and see if I can see the shooter acknowledged the existence of the man that took this picture standing there at this point in the event...
      </p>
      <p>
       edit - Looks like he does shoot a glance over where that camera man would be standing...

       LOL.  And yet NOT ONE SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD COMING FROM WHERE A BULLET "BLEW OUT" HIS COLLAR.  Total staged "terror event."  He'd have that much blood from simply hitting hit head on the floor.  Not when half of the back of his head is blown off.  Not on single security agent present.  Total farce here.  Just watch the disinfo apologists swarm.

       I don't think this is a false flag. I think this is connected to the capture of those 14 men the other day. Someone wants those men back ASAP, they weren't returned on time, their names were released and so action was taken. You had multiple attacks against the Russians today and this is an orchestrated attack.

       Mevlut Mert Altintas. That's the name of the shooter. Google the name and you'll see he was trained.

       For it to make sense I would have to guess that the dude that shot him was assigned to be his bodyguard... that explains why no other bodyguard... the shooter's professional stance and gun handling... and the way he was dressed. The dude he shot was maybe wearing a vest? 13 shots to the back at close range would still kill you with no blood.

       I think it was orchestrated to provide further safety for all parties. I wouldn't be surprised if this entire thing was cooked up by Russia/Iran/Turkey to scare off actual assassins due to the perceived heightened security/scrutiny.

       But why is it a news article?  Where is the press conference?

       If this were an American ambassador getting assassinated, Obama would have held a press conference
       <em>
        today
       </em>

Edit: it was a senator from the Kremlin.

       If this is a false flag like it appears to be, we need to figure out why. What is there to gain?
