    <div class="md"><p>^ This is the best and most similar to what I was going to say, so I wont make another comment.</p>

<p>Knowledge is power, and he who has the knowledge has all of the power. I like to think of it as a video game. A programmer programs a game with certain physics, people are unaware of anything different. hackers find glitches in the physics, they keep it to themselves, in order to benefit from it. </p>

<p>If you ever glitched in a video game to be invincible, or shoot through walls, surely you would know not to tell others how to do it, because then it would be pointless. Everyone will know. You may tell a &quot;select&quot; few of clan members or what not, but not the average user.</p>

<p>This is where the Ancient mystery schools come into play, along with secret societies. Damn near every major scientist, physicist, mathematician, etc etc were all occultists and a part of secret societies. The question is, why were they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but who says those same groups were not infiltrated by the church, or a false front? The church supports/promotes the heliocentric model, and has for a very long time. Why? Why all of the sudden did they change their tune? They could&#39;ve stomped it out, like they did with their long history inquisitions. They embraced something alternate to what they were saying,  <em>for a reason</em>..</p>

<p>Also, there are many factions, within secret societies. Those of the East are far different than those of the West..</p>

<p>I should note, I&#39;m not saying the Earth is flat or not. I&#39;m just answering your question on why they might abstain from releasing such hidden knowledge to the general public...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome, and thanks for the kind words. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying physics are wrong, no, you can do the experiments your self, just like in a video game. Walls exist and you cannot just walk into them thinking you&#39;ll go through them, but glitches could exist, which may allow you to manipulate certain things, in order to gain entrance into the wall. You just have to <em>know how to</em>... </p>

<p>I remember playing Socom on Playstation online, and there was a &quot;glitch&quot; where if you were in prone and had a grenade out, you could shimmy your way into certain walls. </p>

<p>For some reason, it worked, based on the game programming and variables involved. This, is a layman description of the art that is the age old science of alchemy. Think about it...</p>

The purpose specifically is it&#39;s one of the pieces to a puzzle that leads to our end game, set in place by a being that knows no time and can plan and wait for things to come together.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure thing.  Freely go right ahead and scientifically address each of the following &quot;globe&quot; issues made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jaw6a/what_would_be_the_point_of_lying_about_the_shape/dbfaoqw/">here</a>.  Good luck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...the evidence clearly shows that the Earth is NOT a 1000 MPH spinning &quot;globe.&quot; There is famous footage of what&#39;s called the midnight sub. Anyone with spacial reasoning (or the simple ability to model a globe from a high latitude* surface point of reference, using a tilted Earth spinning AND rotating around a central sun) can very quickly how this most certainly isn&#39;t the case. The &quot;magic&quot; of near perfectly static stars for AS LONG AS WE HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTING THEIR POSITIONS, the lack of any actual parallax (not simply virtually imperceivable micro-movements in EVERY direction), and the claims of knowledge of our position in the &quot;Milky Way&quot; based on again, ZERO relative movement from the stars. But my personal favorite is the immovable atmosphere. Now THAT is magic. Hop in a helicopter, perform absolutely no lateral movements, go straight up and hover while watching the world soon beneath you at a cool 1000 MPH. And, oh yeah, OF COURSE, the whole gyroscope issues that show ZERO MOVEMENT WHATSOEVER (all items above have been personally verified, and I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you do the same rather than just &quot;toolishly&quot; trusting anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then when complete, again, feel free to directly address the apparent movement of stars in both the Northern and Southern hemisphere.  For you to exist on a spinning globe, the stars MUST rotate counter direction in the Southern hemisphere.  Do East and West magically now &quot;swap&quot; positions in the South?  This is yet another asinine &quot;PROOF&quot; claimed by the moronic shills pushing the globe model.  It would be INCREDIBLE PROOF, if it were true.  The stars ALWAYS follow the same path across the night sky as the Sun and Moon.  And which direction is that again?  Oh yes, FROM EAST to WEST.  This is IDENTICAL in the Southern hemisphere to the movement seen in the Northern hemisphere.  Again, good luck trying to explain ANY piece of this in verifiable detail.</p>

<p>I just love coming across people with such rudimentary understandings of what they themselves proclaim to &quot;know&quot; when actually they quite clearly understand NOTHING.</p>

<p>This world has been mapped. Cartographers and survey crews have measured most of the known globe. Upon compiling this data Euclidian geometry didn&#39;t add up. This error was found to be corrected by using spherical geometry. And the size of the sphere was almost exactly as  Eratosthenes of Cyrene calculated over 2500 years ago. Using shadows that you claim don&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Refute the math. Refute the data. </p>

<p>What I meant by &quot;it&#39;s easy to underestimate the size of the earth&quot; is that I&#39;ve heard people use the fact that the horizon looks flat as an argument for flat earth, which is ridiculous, the horizon is curved, it&#39;s just such a minute curve that you&#39;re  not going to see it with the naked eye. As for seeing things on the horizon that should be too far away, I can&#39;t explain that but I&#39;m confident there&#39;s a reasonable explanation or some variable the flat earthers aren&#39;t taking into consideration  when making those claims.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s suppose it&#39;s biblical related. Denial of God&#39;s existence, corrupting His image of this planet which is a sin in itself. &quot;Make no graven images of this planet&quot;. The Bible points out many times the Earth is not round, is not a globe. How does this correlate, you&#39;re  thinking? What if the mass denial of information is a power trip to denounce Him? What about a mass sacrifice on a spiritual level, on purpose with the reasoning &quot;I&#39;ve led this many people astray, give me power&quot;. </p>

<p>Have you seen the faked ISS videos? Check out YouTube if you&#39;re curious. They could be real, or fake. I do not know, I have not seen it, only been &quot;shown&quot; what&#39;s selected by some power elite group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The heliocentric model is the only one that enables a materialistic worldview. If the earth were something other than a spinning ball, like say an infinite plane with the heavens rotating around it, and the sun and moon something other than balls of gas and rock, then the materialistic worldview shatters. If someone doesn&#39;t tell you that the sun and moon are just balls of gas and rock and explain how they&#39;re floating up there, then you&#39;re left with a wild and mystical phenomenon that would probably inspire and intrigue people in ways that make them less docile. You take the spiritual fire out of people when you turn everything in their world (including the origins of nature itself) into something random, accidental, and strictly physical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes farther than we think it does then. It extends as a flat plane for a lot larger surface area, than if you took a curved earth and flattened it out. It doesn&#39;t stop at the ice wall. It keeps going. There is more surface area than you have been told to believe.  I don&#39;t know exactly, it&#39;s simply a thought experiment. I did say I do not subscribe to flat earth.

<p>&quot;14 And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. 16 God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a sacred mystery.</p>

<p>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  The earth was unformed and void, darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God hovered over the surface of the water.  Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.  God saw that the light was good, and God divided the light from the darkness.  God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. So there was evening, and there was morning, one day.</p>

<p>God said, “Let there be a dome in the middle of the water; let it divide the water from the water.”  God made the dome and divided the water under the dome from the water above the dome; that is how it was, and God called the dome Sky. So there was evening, and there was morning, a second day.</p>

<p>God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let dry land appear,” and that is how it was.  God called the dry land Earth, the gathering together of the water he called Seas, and God saw that it was good.</p>

<p>I remembered a few seconds of when I had astral projected during sleep, mountains rose up fast and there were thousands of clear beings spiraling around intense red lights in the air, there was like a frequency barrier between us, one came through it and turned into a really beautiful human like being. Shortly afterwards I was attacked by really scary/threatening voices before waking up by what I believe were entity sounds, I had meditated <em>too much</em> and floated from my body once, I&#39;m still not quite sure how dimensions work, TPTB induce needle prick feelings with technology when I&#39;m between sleep/awake state so I don&#39;t astral project.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have three hundred years of empirical science and all kinds of scientific laws and theories that are all based on the purely materialistic interpretation of our world and the universe that Isaac Newton dreamed-up and that the wealthy elite and aristocracy of his day promoted and backed him up on by using both the Royal Society of London and the Academy of Paris, (which they themselves created and controlled), to make that the only &quot;official model&quot; and interpretation of this world or the  universe that any and all further scientific research must be based on and more importantly must fully support. </p>

<p>Any research or experimentation that ever dared to question or challenge that basic assumption and that model would be utterly discredited and dismissed out of hand on that account alone, thereafter, and would never be considered as real or legitimate science nor would anyone presenting any work that ever did be allowed to be or considered as a legitimate member of the so-called scientific community or establishment. </p>

<p>In short, they created a completely controlled, closed, isolated, reductionist and utterly self-referential &quot;system of thinking&quot; when it comes to science, which is the only reason that science is able to postulate and make up laws and rules about all kinds of other so-called closed and isolated systems that presumably make-up our everyday existence and experiences as well as that of the universe at large.</p>

<p>Now the ancient philosophers and sages all discredited and banished the corresponding Philosophy of Materialism that was based on that very same interpretation of the world due to the completely self centred and selfish attitude it&#39;s proponents and adherents all held towards any wisdom that they acquired as individuals that gave them a distinct advantage over others which they saw no reason to not personally gain from of by not sharing it, or ever admitting that they were aware of it, or in possession of it which was also a major part of that world view and it&#39;s whole so called &quot;matter of fact&quot; and strictly &quot;objective&quot; attitude towards all life. </p>

<p>One that was utterly divorced from any finer feelings, ideals, or anything that entailed self sacrifices for altruistic or higher purposes or the benefit of the many or the world in general.</p>

<p>That, of course hardly demonstrated any &quot;love of wisdom&quot; which is what the word &quot;philosophy&quot; not only means but the teaching and sharing of it for the greatest good and benefit of one and all.</p>

<p>Materialism was therefore rejected and deemed to be an abject anti-philosophy because of that.</p>

<p>Now no one needs to tell you that all the elites and aristocrats of this world are nothing if not both philosophical and scientific materialists who all promote science and fund scientific research primarily to personally own, control and profit from whatever knowledge or information that comes from it or to supress any that would interfere with what they are already profiting from.</p>

<p>Why would they lie? Why wouldn&#39;t they? Why in fact wouldn&#39;t they misconstrue anything that might change the way people see and accept themselves and the entire world they live in if it preserves promotes and perpetually rewards those who already have far more than they&#39;ll ever need at the very direct expense of all those who never had enough to begin with? </p>

<p>The answer is all around you, everywhere you look, and in every uncomfortable feeling you ever had about how many unfair and simply wrong things that not only go on but have gone on from time immemorial as an innocent child that you have been relentlessly compelled to accept for no other reason than that they&#39;ve always been that way and you&#39;ll learn to live with it if you know what&#39;s good for you. </p>

The true shape of our &quot;World&quot; is irrelevant for this immediate discussion. Though the evidence clearly shows that the Earth is NOT a 1000 MPH spinning &quot;globe.&quot; There is famous footage of what&#39;s called the midnight sub. Anyone with spacial reasoning (or the simple ability to model a globe from a high latitude* surface point of reference, using a tilted Earth spinning AND rotating around a central sun) can very quickly how this most certainly isn&#39;t the case.
The &quot;magic&quot; of near perfectly static stars for AS LONG AS WE HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTING THEIR POSITIONS, the lack of any actual parallax (not simply virtually imperceivable micro-movements in EVERY direction), and the claims of knowledge of our position in the &quot;Milky Way&quot; based on again, ZERO relative movement from the stars.
But my personal favorite is the immovable atmosphere. Now THAT is magic. Hop in a helicopter, perform absolutely no lateral movements, go straight up and hover while watching the world soon beneath you at a cool 1000 MPH. And, oh yeah, OF COURSE, the whole gyroscope issues that show ZERO MOVEMENT WHATSOEVER (all items above have been personally verified, and I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you do the same rather than just &quot;toolishly&quot; trusting anyone else.</p>

<p>I think there is more to it than what you are asserting. There could be a LOT to gain.</p>

<p>IF the world was flat it could mean one of two things, both of which would be of overwhelming importance. 1) If the world was flat and encompassed by hostile barriers (cold at the perimeter, hot underneath and lacking air at top) it would imply a creative being, or beings. These could be super-intelligent &quot;engineers&quot; so to speak, or God, or gods. Think of this as the &quot;Truman Show&quot; scenario. Imagine a world that has been led to believe that we are an insignificant speck in a limitless universe and that we are nothing special, just a happy accident on a backwater planet. Suddenly it is revealed that we are unique, created being and the center of attention to higher powers that we can&#39;t comprehend.</p>

<p>2) IF the world was flat and Antarctica is indeed the edge and barrier, there could easily be more land beyond this barrier once you pass through the inhospitable frozen zone. This could be the proverbial Atlantis or Lemuria scenarios for example. Also, think of living in a time before the &quot;New World&quot; was discovered. Suddenly a group of people found out there was an entirely new world and they could escape and not be controlled by kings etc. There was suddenly limitless land and resources not controlled by any sovereign nation. Freedom. If these powers that be had this happen once, and they also knew of far greater lands to the south containing vast resources out of their control, wouldn&#39;t they like to prevent large numbers of people migrating there? What if other groups/civilizations are there and more advanced than we and are the source of many of our technological advancements? Wouldn&#39;t they strive to cover this up and maintain their monopoly on these advancements? What exactly was the point of Operation High Jump, a well established military operation in 1947 and not some shady rumor? Admiral Byrd and James Forrestal weren&#39;t exactly fringe players.</p>

<p>That is two possibilities why this isn&#39;t a pointless discussion.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know what I think anymore lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I propose a simple experiment.</p>

<p>Get two tall poles, the taller the better. Both sides will inspect the poles to ensure they are both straight. Put a laser at the top of one pole and a photodetector on the top of the other. Stand these poles vertically at significant distance from each other, and point the laser at the detector, again both sides will inspect the poles to ensure they are perpendicular to the ground. Now, if the Earth is flat, the poles should be 90 degrees relative to the flat earth, and the laser beam should be parallel with it and it should hit the detector. If the Earth is round, the laser beam will not be parallel to the ground, and should shoot over the other pole and miss the detector.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is from this ancient lay line map that the myth comes from please let me try to explain..</p>

<p>from the perspective of the hidden society that has shaped the earths path through time i can tell you this secret of what i and countless others know but can not give proof as nothing is written it is all handed down by word of mouth . take from it what you will but it will give answers to those with the eyes to see</p>

<p>from the dawn of time on this planet 6 races have shaped the destiny of the human race ..</p>

<p>God . the Angels , the Devil Satan , those known as the greys and a race called the reptiles, the other race is man kind him self.</p>

<p>for those who believe in God and Angels this may ring true , for those who dont , dont bother reading or making a comment..</p>

<p>in the beginning God created man kind , his Angels spent time on the planet helping this newly created race with building , showing them what they can eat , learning how to fish for food , hunt and make clothing.</p>

<p>after some time God sent another race here to work under the cover of darkness and total secrecy , the Greys .. after some years Gods plan came undone because of Angels , not all were subservient to Gods will , archangels having free will set upon Gods plan and destroyed the genetic research the Greys were charged with conducting..</p>

<p>God decided to bring this plan to an end , the Greys wanting to keep some humans who had been genetically engineered told selected humans of Gods plan to destroy them ..</p>

<p>(note) not only were humans but nephilim also saved by the greys as they had attributes pass onto them by their fathers .. the archangels such as clairvoyance and psychic abilities .</p>

<p>(note) this can be seen in the bible as the flood but in the book it is God who told man about the destruction not the people who really told him .. The Greys .. this reason will become apparent .</p>

<p>after the destruction of the human race God created a second race of humans . this part is not in the bible , a second genesis .</p>

<p>the humans &quot;saved&quot; by the greys were taken into the bowls of the earth and became a slave race being ruled by the occult and where the flat earth myth came from , i will get to this part soon its juicy..</p>

<p>the second plan God created came to an end with the destruction of sodom and gomorrah , by this time the earth was covered in humans and the nephilim who came to the earths surface from the chambers in the earth after thousands of years of selected breeding by the greys . 
this second race was once again saved by an outside force , this time by the reptiles , seeing what the greys had done the reptile race decided they wanted in on the spoils of Gods harvest and did exactly the same . those humans were not enslaved , they went with free will knowing God had a tendency to kill and destroy everything and anything he was not happy with ..</p>

<p>the civilizations underground are where the myth of the flat earth come from and it is hard for me to put into plain context but i will try my best</p>

<p>the earth is like everything else it vibrates at a frequency as all matter dos , this has implications for science as the psychics involved are in its infancy for those of us above . for those below , they have known the answers for thousands of years .
the societies below have had access to science far beyond the surface dwellers from the begininng , this science is quite simple , it involves the earths natural magnetic core and the craft we seen in the skys in the past , the &quot;white or iridescent orbs&quot; these are built using powerful coils and powered by a small nuclear reactor , for those humans on the surface , they only started to make these in the 1940s at oak ridge , the magnetism of the earths core is what is used for the lift along with the powerful electric field generated by the coils , the flat earth myth starts here ..</p>

<p>lay lines , the highway of the craft , in the past the lay lines were used as a road for the craft and the civilizations along these lines were put here by  the ancient &quot;elite&quot; , you will notice the occult connection to these civilizations and soon be able to connect the dots to many mystories..</p>

<p>anyway the earth and its lay lines being used for nothing more than an ancient high way is where the myth comes from , the craft could not travel over water as the &quot;newer&quot; models can and the ships used by both the greys and reptiles being of a  different technology  could but thats a different thing and not related to the flat earth myth.</p>

<p>it is from this ancient lay line map that the myth comes from , </p>

<p>from what i have been told the nodes where lay lines cross are  where most of the first early humans made their home , those were created with the help of the reptile race who were at the time friendly to humans , i do not know if this is still the case as 1974 changed everything .</p>

<p>You must have some magical abilities because the PROFESSIONALS know that &quot;curvature&quot; has NEVER been visible at a paltry 35,000 feet.  Hell, Cosmonauts and Astronauts have said they couldn&#39;t see ANY curvature until they were HUNDREDS OF MILES UP.  Yet magically, you foolishly believe you can see curvature in a perfectly flat, 360° horizon.  WOW.</p>
