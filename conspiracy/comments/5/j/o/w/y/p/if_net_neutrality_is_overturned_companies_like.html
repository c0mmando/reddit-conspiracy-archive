       Overturning Net Neutrality would give Internet providers like Time Warner and Comcast the ability to give preferential treatment to certain websites, charge extra for access to certain websites, or block them altogether.

        "without Net Neutrality, ISPs could block unpopular speech and prevent dissident voices from speaking freely online."

        George Soros' fund owns 1.45 million shares in Time Warner worth $259.2 million.

      <p>
       If Net Neutrality is overturned, they will be able to block a website, while claiming they are blocking it because it is "fake news." We need to do everything we can to keep Net Neutrality so George Soros can't control our access to certain websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans ending Net Neutrality will end up hurting their own cause, because it will be their websites that end up getting blocked by the liberal ISPs.

       Let's be honest a lot of these Republicans are on the payroll, and are going to do as told by their owners even if it's not in the parties best interest. I mean neither was Amnesty but a lot of them were on board for that. The one thing that's good though is with the government under such a Republican majority control it's going to be really easy to spot the RINO's now.

        Oh wait, if the state can hack into your system, and they are pedophiles, then they could put pedo porn on your computer in order to take the heat off of themselves, to frame you for political activism, or just to use your machine as a hidden-file-share in a pedobotnet (yes they do that--as an it expert I've seen this before on a machine at UGA when fighting nimda virus)

       Hmm, given the above, you can choose to do one of:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        ) Blue Pill Option: Just be blocked and live in a 100% artificially, curated internet reality controlled by the state
       </li>
       <li>
        ) Red Pill Option: You can allow yourself just become a privacy activist cryptoadversary of the state.  This means you
        <strong>
         <em>
          must
         </em>
        </strong>
        then become familiar with linux, data security, crypto, firewalls, secure communications, tor, i2p, freenet, vpns, ssh, ssl, cryptocoin based services, libfuse, sshfs, tunnelling, etc.  You must keep your user files locked in a vault, and run a read-only based system to mount it (tails).
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       No matter what, don't break the law.  Run Tails or some other usb-based diskless OS so that if they put anything on your computer, it will be gone the next day.  Windows will
       <strong>
        never be safe
       </strong>
       .  Keep your userspace in a veracrypt container.  If you're really paranoid, you can keep your veracrypt container on an external ssd drive that you physically unplug when not in use.  You can even have a tails-like machine set up as a dmz between your computer and firewall that anon-proxies all your internet traffic.  If they hack in, it will act like a honeypot that they put their files onto, except that the computer resets itself every 8 hrs, runs bleachbit on empty spaces and the files are not just gone they are scrubbed.

       Many many companies are anti-neutrality because they are pro-money.  If they had an option to charge tiered access for the internet, they would.  For infrastructure that they are often not responsible for (most of that's taxes) and content that they sure as hell don't create.  Forget speed tiers, how about each domain outside of .com requires an additional fee to access?  Or streaming speeds get throttled after 30 seconds if you don't have a digital TV license?  Or mass uploads (such as cloud storage, backups, or livestreaming) are limited to only approved services?
      </p>
      <p>
       The upper levels of the media industry are money-hungry monopolies.

       and Bright House and then renamed everything to Spectrum.

       I assume that Soros owns stock in
       <em>
        Time Warner Inc
       </em>
       - which is an entirely different company than the former Time Warner Cable. Time Warner Inc is in the regulatory phase of being acquired by ATT, a merger which President-elect Donald J Trump has indicated he'd stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of who owns what, after all the fake news fake headlines, I hope it's even more blindingly obvious to everyone just how important Net Neutrality really is.

       Afterall, CNN might be totally fake news 90% of the time, but that doesn't give Verizon the right to not carry their signal.

       Ah yes, that is an important distinction. Time Warner Cable was spun off from Time Warner in 2009.

       What you do instead is to have Google lobby hard to have trump Bulid a 10 Gigbit internet connection to every home including out in the boonies, and allow any ISP including startups to utilize the network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps we should make a requirement so that ISPs would be required to offer speeds faster than 10 Gbit for business and some-profit organizations such as CERN?
      </p>
      <p>
       Such a network would make the need for net neutrality Inert because the competition would be so vicious  that companies couldn't get away with data caps &amp; slow lanes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infact with the ability to hook up anyone with a connection that's fast than 10 gigabit, we might see ISPs offer affordable speeds faster than 10gbit for consumers with the level of competition that we ill see.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is 10 gigabit is about the fastest ethernet port that you can get on motherboards, so companies would have to probally install a fiber NIC on your computer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Trump would benefit  from such a network as he wouldn't have to go into debt up to his hair to build the infrastructure that's needed for a ISP. Trump would make more money as an ISP than he would through bribes.

       Many many companies are anti-neutrality because they are pro-money.  If they had an option to charge tiered access for the internet, they would.  For infrastructure that they are often not responsible for (most of that's taxes) and content that they sure as hell don't create.  Forget speed tiers, how about each domain outside of .com requires an additional fee to access?  Or streaming speeds get throttled after 30 seconds if you don't have a digital TV license?  Or mass uploads (such as cloud storage, backups, or livestreaming) are limited to only approved services?
