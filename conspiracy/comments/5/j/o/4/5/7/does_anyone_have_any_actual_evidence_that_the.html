    <div class="md"><p>Well, put it this way. You admitted that the word is well known, and suspicious. So, it wouldn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to say: Hey, maybe we should use different codes in case anyone so happens to see these emails (the public or law enforcement). Gee wiz Trevor, that&#39;s a brilliant idea...</p>

<p>So, with that being said, why do you think there would be 100% bullet proof evidence that any of those are codes words, which are known and have evidence for? </p>

<p>Gangs have known and unknown code words/hand signals, which go up the chain, without the lower members knowing what they mean (especially outsiders). Tis&#39; no different in this case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I thought, but I wanted to check.  This whole thing seems to rest on the fact that people think that you can&#39;t have a taste for unnerving art without being a pedophile and that comments in e-mails and instagrams between friends that don&#39;t make sense to an external observer are evidence of some wrongdoing.  It&#39;s a witch hunt that could catch anyone in it&#39;s ravenous maw.</p>

Callously pushing this unsubstantiated material and acting like it is a fact is just muddying the true instances of pedophiles in our government, namely John DeCamp&#39;s work.</p>
