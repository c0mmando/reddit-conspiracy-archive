       I know "Cheese Pizza" is used on the internet for child porn but nowhere in the Wikileaks e-mails is "cheese pizza" referred to and I've not yet seen any other evidence from law enforcement, or earlier articles.  This whole code seems to spring up only after the wiki email dump.  What have I missed if anything?

       Doesn't matter if the whole food thing was a total hoax, which I don't think it was. It simply got the ball rolling, then a ton of other evidence was found. Anything could have been the initiator -- an anonymous 4chan thread, a tv documentary, a phone call, anything. Just something to say: Look at John and Tony Podesta. Look at this creepy pizza shop. Look at this weird satanic artist. Dig here.

       Yes, continue to project bs against your political enemies, and continue to ignore all the instances of right wingers and pedophilia, namely Roy Cohn, Denny Hasert, Mark Foley, and the guy that brought an underaged teen to the White House during the H.W. era, and last but not least, ignore John DeCamp's lifelong work. You are doing a great job of projecting, you are doing great, soon you will be an Orwellian trickster in the likes of Roger Stone.

       Who's projecting there? You seem like the bias one, not that user with this comment. I agree with you, but your tone/comment seems hypocritical... Many of us are trying to get people to depoliticize this, and teach people it's a big club, and both "sides" (political Establishment) are in on it...

       Pizzagaters who refuse to recognize the instances of pedophilia among right wingers, namely Donald Trump's former lawyer and mentor, Roy Marcus Cohn. A man who is responsible for pushing the red and lavender scares during the McCarthy era, despite being a homosexual and pedophile himself.

       Well, put it this way. You admitted that the word is well known, and suspicious. So, it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to say: Hey, maybe we should use different codes in case anyone so happens to see these emails (the public or law enforcement). Gee wiz Trevor, that's a brilliant idea...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, with that being said, why do you think there would be 100% bullet proof evidence that any of those are codes words, which are known and have evidence for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gangs have known and unknown code words/hand signals, which go up the chain, without the lower members knowing what they mean (especially outsiders). Tis' no different in this case.

       The real question here is do criminals use code to hide their crimes and the answer is of course yes. I definitely think there are parts of the pizzagate investigation that are far reaching, but some people are looking for a guilty verdict before looking at the evidence.

       Thank you.  That's what I thought after searching forever for something real about the code.  The closest thing I've been offered is a few urban dictionary entries which are proof of absolutely nothing since people just screw around there and definitions are being invented night and day.

       They were in Portugal at the time. Also, I'm not blind or partisan. See, I do not believe in government one bit. I believe in self rule. Check my account history about it, to verify ;). You, on the other hand, seem very partisan while projecting it onto others....

       That's what I thought, but I wanted to check.  This whole thing seems to rest on the fact that people think that you can't have a taste for unnerving art without being a pedophile and that comments in e-mails and instagrams between friends that don't make sense to an external observer are evidence of some wrongdoing.  It's a witch hunt that could catch anyone in it's ravenous maw.

       All you are doing is projecting the pedophilia of Donald Trump's mentor Roy Cohn on political figures you dislike. Callously pushing this unsubstantiated material and acting like it is a fact is just muddying the true instances of pedophiles in our government, namely John DeCamp's work.
