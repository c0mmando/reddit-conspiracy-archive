       Symptomatically, they seem to act similarly? A little bit causes anxiety, energy, etc., more gives lethargy, headache, etc., both give similar bad "withdrawal symptoms" that seem to coincide it seems? Maybe different SSRIs seem to act differently because of different amounts of caffeine in them? I'm only interested in symptoms. Theoretically, if people tell you SSRIs change serotonin in the brain but SSRIs act just like caffeine symptomatically, maybe the people lie to you and it's just caffeine in disguise, but again it's just a theory. Don't hate me for it.

       Note that different websites may list different symptoms. Low libido wasn't mentioned in these both lists, but anecdotally it should be it seems. Low libido should be associated with weakness, malaise, which is a symptom of both "withdrawals". I've seen many people get twitchy after SSRIs, just like I am after caffeine. Same for low libido. I have some experience with it. Search
       <a href="/r/ssris">
        /r/ssris
       </a>
       . Head pressure, blurry vision, seemingly migraines or rashes seem to happen with both. Racing heart (part of anxiety) is mentioned here:

       Alcohol possibly acts similarly? It can be both a stimulant and a sedative, and according to WebMD alcohol's withdrawal symptoms could be:

       Shaky hands
Sweating
Mild anxiety
Nausea
Vomiting
Headache
Insomnia

      <p>
       "A much smaller subset of people report a permanent cluster of symptoms including anhedonia, genital numbness, sexual dysfunction, anorgasmia, low libido, and memory deficits. (Interestingly, there are quite a few people reporting this exact set of symptoms after discontinuing finasteride for hair-loss and accutane for skin; I am less certain given the general safety of finasteride in clinical trials which show similar side effects to placebo, but really would not rule it out given its proven effects on important hormones.)"
      </p>
      <p>
       Finasteride for hair-loss and accutane for skin seem to give certain similar symptoms too?

       People get twitchy (muscle twitch/twitching/twitches/spasms. Google it) after Adderall. It's not clear whether all stimulants should make you twitchy. It could give racing heart:

       . It does seem to act similarly.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are at least things to consider and it's a theory with some evidence and currently I don't see a reason why it's wrong. I'd like to see some evidence that it's wrong. Again, I only care about symptoms, not research (that could theoretically be lies as I've said), so an anecdote with an experience with an SSRI that gives an objective symptom that caffeine could never give is the only way you could prove me wrong here. Thanks.

       Caffeine is as close to a miracle drug as it gets.  SSRIs, and every other drug, are not without a negative side  effects.  So anyway not caffeine for sure.  For anything else consult a doctor.  Get a new doctor or call a nurse if you don't trust the current doctor.  Stopping medication suddenly could be unpleasant for a number of reasons.

       OK, I am a heavy caffeine user.  2-5 cups of coffee a day, plus a cuppa tea in the evening.  I'll admit if I don't get my AM coffee I feel off, mostly angry that there is not any coffee yet.  But after a few hours I feel fine.

       "so an anecdote with an experience with an SSRI that gives an objective symptom that caffeine could never give is the only way you could prove me wrong here"
      </p>
      <p>
       SSRIs are notorious for causing sexual dysfunction, which caffeine does not. Caffeine actually increases blood flow, so it could theoretically help with erectile dysfunction, if anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find thousands of the anecdotal examples you are seeking by going to
       <a href="https://www.drugs.com/">
        https://www.drugs.com/
       </a>
       and searching for patient reviews for the various anti-depressants (SSRI and SNRI). You will see sexual dysfunction complaints everywhere.

       Does caffeine increase your or anyone else's libido anecdotally? "Caffeine actually increases blood flow" is research, not an anecdote. One person here said it actually decreases blood flow, and some people there had decreased libido. forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=164835291 Some places mention decreased libido if you google "caffeine libido".

       Low libido is mostly the same as weakness, malaise, which is listed under both withdrawals. Also, I can see how a certain caffeine product could increase libido once during the first use, but over time it should get worse.

       Caffeine primarily acts as a vasodilator, but can act as a vasoconstrictor briefly, initially. But that's research, which you're uneasy about.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I concede on that point, anyway. One of the best ways to find anecdotal reports is to specifically search for forums. So for example, "caffeine erectile forum dysfunction" would be a good one. That search is pulling up forums full of guys with anecdotes claiming that caffeine ultimately gave them sexual dysfunction.

       Ugh this is a tough one. So my next thought was what if you could test to see if there was caffeine in it for yourself. So I find this product, caffeine test strips, which can detect caffeine in a beverage and had customer reviews (anecdotes), and which you could just buy and use for yourself (put contents of SSRI capsule or pill crushed to powder in water, stir and test), so I was compiling it all up for you, the product was fking
       <em>
        discontinued
       </em>
       and apparently nobody else on earth makes these strips despite the fact that they sold well enough to people with caffeine sensitivities wanting to test their decaf beverages. I also can't find any reasons as to why it was discontinued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have there been any cases of someone emptying their SSRI/SNRI capsule or crushing up a SSRI/SNRI pill, and then taking the material to a laboratory and paying to have it analyzed (unknown to the lab)? That's what I'm trying to find right now, if anyone has done this.

       While it could've been a direct cause, there are some other different possible causes. There's a possibility of: people who are immoral and mentally ill enough to want to create mass shootings are very likely to have done some wrong things before, triggered a visit to a psychiatrist (by parents, other people) and a prescription of some SSRIs, making the SSRIs seem possibly unrelated to the shootings, or just the last straw. And the possibility of many people being forced to take SSRIs, feeling permanently changed by the medications (helped by the actual effect of fatigue or anxiety or both, which many people on SSRIs experience (you would get it from too much caffeine too.

       What if instead of a half of a cup of coffee you drank like two or three? Or taking a smaller dose of the SSRI? As I've said in this thread with a few links, larger doses of caffeine trigger heaviness instead of helping. While it may depend on sensitivity, I think overcaffeinating yourself would give lethargy to everyone. Just something to consider.

Google "Zoloft racing heart", "ssri racing heart", etc. to find more anecdotes. While the racing heart could've been caused by anxiety of the fear of side effects, the same can be said about your view of the racing heart after caffeine.

       Very interesting. I've asked one person who got sharp stabbing pains in their head after caffeine if they've ever taken any SSRIs and I'll wait for a reply. Thanks for your input.

       How exactly do the brain zaps feel? Are they painless little sounds in different parts of the brain or do they hurt (sharp stabbing pains in different parts of your head)? Caffeine is associated with headaches.
