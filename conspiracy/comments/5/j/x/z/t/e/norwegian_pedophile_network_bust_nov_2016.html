<p><strong>Operation Darkroom</strong></p>

<p>Western Police District since January 2016 investigated several major cases involving sexual abuse of children.</p>

<p>The work has been organized in a project where employees over the last year rolled up several networks of people who have committed child abuse, both physical abuse and abuse over the internet. The project has so far identified 51 people involved in multiple networks with branches throughout the country, even internationally. A large number of photos, movies and chatting is seized and examined. The size of the total seizure is so far on 150 terabytes of data, and is thus one of the largest seizures in Norwegian history.</p>

<p>The Police Authority has during the investigation halted ongoing abuses, identified several victims and had identified and registered more assailants.</p>

<p>The investigation shows that this kind of network of abusers often have their origin in the dark online. So it was natural to call the project Operation Darkroom. The dark web has been a place where predators often have been able to share their interest in children undisturbed. Much of Operation Darkroom their efforts have therefore focused on just that dark web.</p>

<p>Coiling started with a review lodged on Crime Guard, Bergen police, autumn 2015. The case revolved around sexual intercourse with a girl of 14 years was sent to the Crime and moral section at Bergen police station. The seizure was done included imagery of atrocities against children, it also showed a great deal of contact with others interested in child abuse. It is this material that forms the basis for Operation Darkroom.</p>

<p>The project has worked 25 people with interdisciplinary skills. Besides the investigation and påtaleurist from Crime and moral section, NK chief investigator of surveillance and intelligence, so the group comprises of experienced investigators from different sections at Bergen police station but also from different operating units in the police district. Special Investigators from computer crime, analysts and investigators with special expertise in personalized questioning is affiliated.</p>

<p>The fact that the multidisciplinary expertise have been able to work closely together has given police district a solid professional for this type of case.</p>

<p>Cases that do Western Police District now has explained, is a serious and complex matter at one of the highest priority crime areas: violence and abuse against children. I myself have on two occasions been in Western Police District and received a briefing on the case. It was not difficult to agree with the chief that this matter should have top priority, said Police Director Odd Reidar Humlegård.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drug war. Middle east war. The election. Fuck, even Donald Trump vs Hillary Clinton. These are the topics on MSM. Yet, something like this will stay in the dark.(pun not intended) CP is an epidemic. The fact that most of MSM won&#39;t talk about this and other CP ring busts just screams that they are being forced not to report it. </p>

<p>Every inch of me knows there is something going on as far as a global pizza ring. Just because we have no videos or photos doesn&#39;t automatically mean we are wrong. However, we could be wrong, but I am 99.9% percent sure we are not. We might not have the right people, or certain details may be out of place, but there is something going on. CP is just another stream of not only wealth, but could easily be used as blackmail to help their own agenda. Open your eyes if you haven&#39;t already. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s guarding the normies perspective on life, but they need to understand that anyone can be a monster. It&#39;s not only a select few, literally, ANYONE can be. Hell, there could be a pedo right now reading this, or browsing r/conspiracy, just laughing. </p>

<p>Time to wake up and stop being afraid.</p>
