<p>These kids are then too stupid to change the file name.</p>

<p>This, unfortunately, gives people a way to browse through tons of default/bullshit videos that random tech-illiterate people end up loading to youtube.</p>

<p>What&#39;s seems fucked up is that some of the videos have tons of views and most of the popular ones are of kids. I&#39;m not the only one who finds that creepy right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, these are the default titles, but honestly there is not a &#39;conspiracy&#39; to be made out... However TwitterGate was real coverup, but in this YouTube case these are simply videos uploaded by bunch of kids who do not know anything about not sharing too personal things on the Internet.. People who are asking: Why YouTube is not deleting it?</p>

<p>Well pretty much it does not break any rules and it could be said that these videos are almost the same as any random teen girl blogger, except these kids are inspired from them and haven&#39;t really edited them... Although I do agree that they may be creepy and used for bad purposes, they are not illegal as none of them actually show any explitic parts... So it&#39;s not a coverup or anything...</p>

<p>But YouTube deleting and censoring PizzaGate is not nice either...</p>

<p>What I am wondering is, why do they all have the same style of title? Is it like a default name if you don&#39;t set a title on a webcam video or something?</p>

<p>Edit: it probably is a default name: they record a video, program names it &quot;webcam video from x&quot;, upload it to youtube without setting a new title. I think this is what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So...the search results are clearly sorted by video popularity.  To get an idea of whether these default-named uploads are being used in any nefarious way, we need to weight these suspicious vids against the entire volume of search results from this query.  How many are there?  There must be thousands upon thousands.  If even 20% are anything like the first page of results, I would raise a red flag; otherwise, confirmation bias is just bumping up the most perverted results in a natural pool, here like they would most anywhere else.</p>

<p>There&#39;s guys who buy used women&#39;s socks off Craigslist.</p>

<p>I was once offered a job where me and like, 10 other women, would go to parties, sit in chairs and get paid hundreds of dollars each to let guys lick our feet.</p>

<p>I also once stumbled upon an entire genre of porn that consisted entirely of videos of men essentially jerking off <em>with</em> 12 inch anime dolls. Kind of like a fleshlight, but tiny anime girls.</p>

<p>There&#39;s probably nothing that hasn&#39;t been fetishized by someone, or groups of someones out there.</p>

<p>That&#39;s <em>clearly</em> not what you were talking about in your original comment. In your original comment, you were talking about fetish videos uploaded to YouTube in general. </p>

<p>If you search &quot;webcam video from&quot;, you will, shockingly, find videos exclusively taken from a webcam. And, as it turns out, you very rarely find videos of children swimming taken with a webcam. </p>

<p>So basic deductive reasoning would tell us that you were not talking about this <em>specific</em> set of videos, found by searching &quot;webcam video from&quot;, but instead were talking about videos on YouTube in general.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did your parents fetishize you when you swam?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seemingly, your criteria for fetishizing a child while swimming is merely filming a child while swimming. So, according to this criteria, yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think you, or others, might enjoy having a record of their younger years, maybe a video, or a picture, even if it involves a bathing suit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait, so you&#39;re saying it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that those videos of &quot;UNDERAGE CHILDREN DOING THINGS LIKE SWIMMING, PILLOW FIGHTING, PLAYING INNOCENTLY&quot; had some other purpose than fetishizing them? Oh, well if that&#39;s the case then maybe I wasn&#39;t molested after all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not that hard to follow. Please try to keep up.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re going to do this thing where we end each of our responses to each other with snarky shit, then this will get real lame real fast if all you do is copy me. Get creative, if you can.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sarcastically pointing out how retarded this notion is, which the first guy was making in earnest. He was saying that videos of children swimming or playing <em>innocently</em> were inherently fetish videos and were creepy as hell, and they were just some loophole for pedophiles to get their rocks off.</p>

<p>He was essentially doing something I&#39;ve seen a lot of on this sub since pizzagate, which is making mountains out of molehills and automatically assuming that literally anything that is related to a child in any way has nefarious undertones in it. And I was pointing out how retarded that was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey everyone... So I searched it up and I was expecting some more fucked up shit, but I think I know what all these videos are...</p>

<p>If I am not mistaken many apps and devices and programs and simply operating systems offer that &#39;quick upload to YouTube&#39; pretty much almost every app that involves something with recording, whenever webcam or not... So usually you need to have your YouTube account linked with it, but getting a Google account nowadays is easy and Google services are being used by more and more, especially the ones from 3rd world countries (that can be seen in those videos). So you know many kids watch YouTube and want to act like their favorite YouTubers.</p>

<p>Typically these &#39;makeup&#39; and &#39;gossip&#39; channels are trending on the younger girl audiences. Kids very often try to recreate their favorite YouTube heroes, which I said is real-life/blogging stuff for young girls and gaming channels for boys... Then there also are all those &#39;challenges&#39; and &#39;tags&#39; etc..</p>

<p>So these videos are just auto-uploaded videos.... If I am correct then if you do not change the title by yourself, it just puts the default label which in this case is &#39;<em>webcam video from</em>&#39; and then the date and time when it was recorded/uploaded. And because kids do things very randomaly on the Internet they usually do not even edit their videos, or change titles or description, but just leave them messy and unedited...</p>

<p>Actually I came up with a theory. What if these trends are launched to get younger children and simply human attention so Google has more data to harvest? Wow, this could be some nice theory... </p>

<p>Some home web cam security /baby monitor cameras are set with default passwords and easily findable. </p>

<p>Further, there are groups of &quot;deviants&quot; dedicated to scouring photobucket, flickr etc for open albums of semi sexual content eg <a href="/r/photoplunder/">/r/photoplunder/</a></p>

<p>This isn&#39;t an issue of YouTube ignoring  child sexualisation, it&#39;s a problem of camera/app manufacturers not protecting their customers. </p>

<p>look at how fucking creepy this is. Look at how he is holding her. Look at how this little girl looks at the camera and then purposefully spreads her legs to show her panties. These video&#39;s show kids that are trained to sexualize themselves on video with coaching!!.</p>

<p>What freaks me out the most is the guys asking for private videos. Almost making me think some of these videos are just sex slave kids being unknowingly advertised on the internet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious. Don&#39;t be scared there is no nudity, just actually look and think to yourself why is this adult asking this kid to do this and why is it being recorded. And why do they allow such comments and WHY is the video still up if its innocent and you see its hijacked by pervs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I opened 2 of the videos you posted but didn&#39;t watch them, just went straight to the comments. On the one with the thumbnail of the girl in a pink dress (tikitiki girl) there&#39;s a guy who makes comments in Spanish and everything he says is stomach churning disgusting. The guy is Joaquín Ignacio correa Silva look at his comments (and his history) and if you don&#39;t speak Spanish paste his comments on google translate. At the beginning I was shocked but then I started thinking, what if these videos were posted with the purpose of catching predators? They seem to interact and exchange numbers and kik/email info, this guy claims he had videos he can send the others, and that he abuses his little niece, etc. In one of the comments tiki tiki girl seems to reply to one of the comments from a guy asking to meet her, her response was &quot;ой ой ой&quot; (I pasted to google translate and it translate to oh oh oh) which made me think that it can&#39;t possibly be a real little girl behind that account. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The  whole thing that rhymes with Lisa Kate is very disturbing.  Seeing just the icons of the videos &amp; the amount of views is heartbreaking.   Most of the thumbnails are innocent. (There was a couple I saw that weren&#39;t.   Wtf!)  However, the amount of views obviously show that there is a dubious side to this.  </p>

<p>Some had over a million views.  People are getting rich of exposing young children to flipping pedophiles.  Kids just doing normal kid stuff wouldn&#39;t be watched over a 1,000,000 times. No way.  </p>

<p>Do the parents even know these videos are on YouTube?   Holy crap.</p>

Very sexual in nature, obviously these videos are being watched by loads of pedophiles.  There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with the videos themselves.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason is because there really is not a real little girl behind those account. Two possibilities I see 1. An actual pedo uploading random videos on accounts to attract other pedos and monetize. (A bunch of those  accounts are for money with thousands/millions views). So someone did their research on what &quot;sells&quot; so to speak and it&#39;s now making money out of it. It&#39;s still wrong and it&#39;s still exploitation of course. 2. It&#39;s a tool to catch predators. If you see how these men seem to comment nasty things on the accounts of  little girls, then it makes you think why YT is not deleting those videos, why these comments are still up, etc. If you read the comments they seem to exchange numbers, kik and emails with the purpose of exchanging CP videos and pics so maybe the assumption that LE is behind this is not so far fetched. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One possibility is that we are seeing natural selection in action. That is: say there&#39;s ten thousand videos. Some little boys, some little girls. Most of them are totally harmless and look harmless. But a small selection of them is little girls seemingly doing sexualized shit. The thing is, those videos are the ones that get targeted by interested parties. Out of all the different videos, the sexualized little girl videos get the most clicks, the most comments, the most activity from the perverts who go looking for them. So presto, those videos are the ones that end up at the top of the search results. These videos exhibit all the signs of being the most relevant videos in a search, so why wouldn&#39;t the search pick them up first? It&#39;s natural selection in action. Am I sure of this? No. But is it realistic? Yes.</p>
