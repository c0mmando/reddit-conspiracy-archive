<p>Racists are not allowed to have their own sub. White nationalists are not allowed to have their own sub. Pizzagate was not allowed to have its own sub. Pro-Trump people usually get treated unfairly in the mixed-politics subs. Etc.</p>

<p>So where do they come? To the conspiracy theory section. It&#39;s like the final bastion of <em>mostly</em> free speech on this overall site. </p>

<p>So this means that conspiracy theorists, ranging from people insisting the earth is flat or it&#39;s hollow and full of reptilians, to people who want to talk about the UN journalists claiming that the situation is Syria is being lied about by western MSM, and everything in between, along with racists, racial nationalists, &quot;It&#39;s The Jews&quot; people, civilian investigators for pizzagate, Pro-Trump people who want to debate (The_Donald is total echo chamber), etc <em>ALL</em> get funneled into the same sub. </p>

<p>The actual underlying purpose of this is not actually political correctness, as many people mistakenly assume. It is so that credible conspiracy theories or discussions about actual conspiracies wind up being seen in the same light as reptilian talk, Jew haters and Trump sycophants. </p>

<p>Then all of the people seeking to keyboard fight with the racists, Trump people, etc <em>also</em> come here in pursuit of them. </p>

<p>Alright, l&#39;ll have a crack, and btw l&#39;m not in the US.</p>

<p>First thing is kill the television; just stop watching it.</p>

<p>Go outside, find a bit of ground somewhere- a park, oval, whatever and take off yr shoes.</p>

<p>Sit down.</p>

<p>This is the first step.</p>

<p>If we all did this, TPTB wouldn&#39;t have an audience, media will suffer (haha), and we can all get off reddit and other anti-social networks and have a fucken life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually you did offend me, calling all Trump voters white nationalist is racist. Stereotyping 62 million people is racist of you. People voted for his promise of tax cuts and national security against attacks like Berlin that happened this week. He flipped hundreds of counties in his favor that voted for Obama the last two elections. Nice try though. BTW if a Trump fan said the reverse about Clinton voters being (insert whatever race baiting label you want) you would say hey buddy what&#39;s your problem?</p>

<p>Ok, you must be confusing me with the OP of that thread. I told the OP of this thread to read my words in that thread for reasons that will be apparent to him once he does.</p>

<p>But I never said, nor implied, that a black person thought being called a Negro was ok with them. In fact, if you read my posts in that thread you would see that I said the opposite and provided information supporting my claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, at that time people thought that was an OK thing to say but wasn&#39;t that mostly white people?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, refer to the information I provided in that thread. There are two distinct discussions I&#39;m having in that thread. One relates to the specific response I gave to the OP in this thread while the other   pertains to what you and I are discussing. And again, I must say, you are confusing me with the OP of that thread, I&#39;m not the OP of that thread. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe MLK used Negro in his speech because using some other word would make a lot of people focus on that instead of the point he was trying to make?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above.</p>

<p>EDITED: You have a new account. So let me explain something. When you see a persons name with a BLUE highlight around it that means they&#39;re the OP. You won&#39;t see me with a blue name in that thread as I am not the OP.</p>

<p>And taken from that thread, and for you, part of my second post.</p>

<p><em>What the OP doesn&#39;t get, but what you obviously do, is that it doesn&#39;t matter because they were forced to abandon their names anyway. So when it comes to what they were called, quadroon or mulatto would have been used but, when you look at these terms none of them were meant to be uplifting. Negro, nigger, negras, etc, none of that shit came from leftists. For the OP to say it wasn&#39;t seen as racist is downright laughable.</em></p>
