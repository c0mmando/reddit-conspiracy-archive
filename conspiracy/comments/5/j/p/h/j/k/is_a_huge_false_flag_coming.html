        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok so, the Russian hacker story didn&#39;t work, with under 30% of people believing the Russians had anything to do with it.</p>

<p>That means there&#39;s 29 days left to stop Trump.</p>

<p>Really, their only 2 choices now are taking Trump and Pence out, or urgently coming up with a false flag so big that people will be begging USA to take serious action. I&#39;m talking 9/11 big or worse. </p>

<p>I hope I&#39;m not right but what other outs do they have? All their power and money is riding on Trump not taking over. Imagine the promises they made in return for all those donations - not to mention their current lifestyles being funded by deals with the devil.</p>

<p>I have a really bad feeling that given christmas and new year are in the next 29 days.. I think they will use new years eve. Probably Times Square. It would cripple NY again, and it&#39;s a big slap in the face of &quot;freedom&quot; targeting happy Americans on one of the best nights of the year. I hope I&#39;m wrong but I wouldn&#39;t put it past the US Government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump and the Clintons have been close friends for several years. </p>

<p>I am very confident that the whole idea is for the &#39;system&#39; to act very opposed to Trump while Trump pretends to be very against the system (establishment, ruling elites, globalist bankers, etc), so that the majority of the nation will be practically rejoicing when he takes office (rather than being skeptical and critical as they should be). And so that furthermore, due to personal ego/pride issues, almost none of the anti-establishment citizens will make so much as a peep about it when Trump completely sells out once in office.</p>

<p>If his decades-long friendship with the Clintons wasn&#39;t enough evidence of this, then his cabinet picks should have been. But I guess we will just wait for even more evidence.</p>

<p>Even the entire Truther movement is hijacked thanks to controlled opposition fkwad Alex Jones going full-sycophant for Trump, and thus all of the Alex Jones sycophants doing the same. </p>

<p>And look I know. I know most of us wanted Trump to be who he seemed to be in the beginning. I know it&#39;s painful. But it&#39;s still reality.</p>

<p>May the future prove me wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>seems like to get a majority of the nation rejoicing it would have been easier to simply run Clinton vs Bush.</p>

<p>Bush wouldnt have had Trumps support and Clintons treachery, corruptness and health issues wouldnt come out.</p>

<p>Upon winning &quot;nation rejoices&quot; and Clinton goes about doing everything and more Obama did.</p>

<p>All this &quot;Trump is a sellout / plant&quot; just doesnt make sense and just reeks of DisInfo. </p>

<p>Why make things harder for oneself?</p>

<p>And I can assure you if Trump sells out then:</p>

<p>1) the ctrl+left crowd would scream
2) his own supporters would leave him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;ll jam every roadblock they can in front of Trump, Trump in turn will gently put out his milder policy stuff including his first 100 day list, infrastructure improvements, etc, and bide his time while the DNC burn more money and goodwill. When his 4th year start he will bring the hammer down and enact his huge tax savings for the lower classes and small business owners. He will drop it as loud and irreversible as possible with the house and senate fully aware of his game plan. Democrats will once again look foolish , greedy and out of touch. By the time 2020 election rolls around he will have huge gains with working Black, White, Asian. and Hispanic voters, who all benefited and prospered thanks to him. In 30 years Trump will be compared to FDR and fondly remembered. Democrats in that time will still not have  managed to elect another President since 2012 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So? Buy Trump. He&#39;s for sale. In fact, I can&#39;t think of anyone MORE for sale than Trump. </p>

<p>And, oh, lookâ€”he&#39;s appointed half of Goldman Sachs already, right on cue.</p>

<p>Left, right, left...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps in Iran. The Jocpa which lifted sanctions and gave Iran permission to build nuclear technology may be th &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; 2.0 Additionally, As China is an economic threat, and the declining US Petrodollar needs to secure Iran&#39;s oil sales in US dollars, we might see the US aligning with Russia. Perhaps we agree to lift sanctions, they surrender Iran&#39;s oil supply which is Russia&#39;s primary economy and we setup trade arrangements that China would have formerly had. It would accomplish 2 things, reduce China&#39;s upcoming financial threat, and improve relations with Russia, who is arguably the stronger military threat. Additionally, it would help thwart the future chance of China and Russia cooperating to overthrow the US if we continue to devalue our currency and are no longer able to fulfill our debtor obligations and we default, which would either result in war, or hyper-inflation as we try to print our way out of the mess, like many before have, and subsequently failed in doing so.</p>

<p>Domestically speaking, I think between Obama&#39;s failure to enact legislation like Bill Clinton did with the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, in addition to the strong support from the Military for Trump that any wide scale rioting or acts of terrorism in an attempt to enact martial law to suspend the Presidential proceedings would end up resulting in a coup d&#39;etat  that would toss Obama out of office, or locked up/hung.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Convenient time to get rid of Trump. Media making him look so bad/evil that people wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some &quot;lunatic&quot; killed him. But I don&#39;t think they need to get rid of him, looks like he is just a puppet. </p>

<p>Geopolitically no need for false flags, &quot;terrorists&quot; already well represented after europe incidents. Unless they want more open war with Russia instead of hiding behind Syria. Ofc they might want to advance into other countries in middle-east or advance in Venezuela, but no need for false flags on US soil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s going to be increasingly hard to stage, sell, and cover up a false flag. There will have to be another option. I picture somebody getting set up, like me pranking 2 people by making each of their phones ring at the same, and when they say hello, it&#39;s the other person on the line and they both think the other one called them. Except I think somebody will nuke somebody and make the nuke have come out of the other parties hand. Well I guess by my own analogy there will have to be 2 nukes thrown and both will think they are retaliating , or that wouldn&#39;t work. These false flags are getting more and more obvious and on a smaller scale, they can&#39;t get too much by us, and still cover it up. </p>
