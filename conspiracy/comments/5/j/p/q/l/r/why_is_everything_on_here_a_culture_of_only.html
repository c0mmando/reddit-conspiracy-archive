<p>Just because I am republican does not mean that I am blind to the neocons and how evil they are. Think of the tips dem left and the rep right (Neocons and Neoliberals) like wings being spread fully. It forms a full circle. And they always agree over things that take away our freedoms. These Neos always come to agreement at the most dangerous times over the most dangerous issues. They practically hold fucking orgies when the war drums are sounding.

<p>This place (actually all of the net) always needs taken with that extra grain of salt. Question why you only see 1 side of an agenda/topic, we should never stop learning from each other</p>

<p>so trump is suppose to get a 4 year free pass while we all beat the dead horse called the Clintons? news flash: she lost! as much as everyone here might really really want to see it, no one will ever put her in jail for shit, and a mentality like what you just suggested is essentially saying we should ignore what our government is doing because some here like who is in charge? is that not dangerous thinking to you</p>
