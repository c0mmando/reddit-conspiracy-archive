<p>Atlantis, hollow earth theory, giants, reptilian overlords, reincarnation, fake heavens....</p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<p>Why do people want to focus on quacky mystical shit instead of stuff we might be able to prove?</p>

<p>We can sit here and argue about which fairy tale origin stories are true, or we could focus on real shit, shit that we can prove went down, we just question the official version of events.</p>

<p>Stuff like....</p>

<ul>
<li>Was the recent Russian ambassador incident a false flag?</li>
<li>How deep did the DNC corruption go?</li>
<li>Questions surrounding Tower 7?</li>
</ul>

<p>I dunno.  I try to keep an open mind you know?  I don&#39;t trust any news source 100%.  I question the narrative everyone is trying to push, question the version of events we have, and still want to know more about JFK.</p>

<p>But damn, hollow earth and reincarnating lizard people?  I can&#39;t buy into that shit.  </p>

<p>You realize narratives like this are actual disinformation put forward by shills trying to destabilize the forum, right? People don&#39;t actually believe that stuff, they just want to make it look like we do, so we look insane, so people leave and don&#39;t talk about important things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a valuable contributor here and I&#39;ve always enjoyed your perspective.  I do think that there is room within a conspiracy forum for non-activists as well as serious activists.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re a serious activists and I applaud your passion to make the world a better place but there is a reason you aren&#39;t as prolific on /news as you are on /Conspiracy, there is a reason you&#39;re able to post activist things, which are almost universally considered to be ridiculous by the consensus of the public, and discuss them.  And that reason is that we allow things to be posted here no matter where they fall on the public perception spectrum of ridiculous things.  If we tried to limit that spectrum, there suddenly becomes a possibility that your own topics land on the wrong side of that limit.</p>

I don&#39;t want to limit the spectrum of discussion at all, but rather just wake people up to the fact there <em>are</em> disinformation campaigns, and there <em>are</em> disinfo narratives, and they <em>are</em> actually on this subreddit and voted to the top to make us look bad.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this sub should stick with the real issues and let all that unprovable fantasy BS alone. </p>

<p>Stick to stuff like claiming that every single mass shooting or other similar event like a bombing is a staged event.</p>

<p>There is always something that somebody can claim they saw on the video that proves it&#39;s fake. Usually it&#39;s either that blood looks fake or why isn&#39;t there more blood. They can never seem to get it quite right. Seems to me that they should hire someone from Hollywood special effects. They do an excellent job... </p>

<p>They always recruit &quot;crisis actors&quot; from Craigslist a week or so before such an event. Too obvious...</p>

That is how the elite can get away with the continuation of the game that is.

I own books by Adam Smith about economics, Henry Kissinger about &quot;diplomacy&quot;, Francis Crick about the research into DNA, Bruce Lipton about biology relating to belief, and Lloyd Pye about the research into bigfoot.

<p>This is a wonderful attitude to have.  Entertaining an idea is one thing.  Acting like an extremely esoteric theory is 100% indisputably true is another :)</p>

<p>There are plenty of neat ideas out there that would be cool if true.  Hollow Earth?  I&#39;m sure there&#39;d be all sorts of interesting discoveries to make in there.  Ancient astronauts and giants?  That&#39;d be one of the most interesting things to ever happen if it were proven true without a doubt.  An afterlife?  Sure, I&#39;d love for there to be one.</p>

<p>Just because an idea sounds neat, or I really want it to be true....well, you still need to ground beliefs in some sort of evidence.</p>

<p>How&#39;s that bigfoot book?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, if anything isn&#39;t <em>the bible itself</em> a conspiracy?  Maybe its because I&#39;m older, but back when I was more into this scene I think more people felt that way.  </p>

<p>I mean, people were into all sorts of spiritual stuff, but it was a personal journey, not one born out of belief that a collection of ancient hebrew writings that have been altered and translated multiple times across thousands of years are the divine word of god and the eternal truth.</p>

I&#39;ve listened to his talk on the book, and he touches on a lot of facets (the hominid branch offs, human evolution, Darwinism). I looked at the book distinctly this morning and thought, &quot;I have to read this at some point.&quot; </p>

<p>Haven&#39;t really been there much can&#39;t speak for how good it is. Still I&#39;d rather not put blinders on the scope of discussion allowed, even though I think things like hollow earth are at best silly, at worst disinfo.</p>
