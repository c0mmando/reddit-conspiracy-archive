       I cannot believe that they have spun themselves as the victims so successfully even though they are right in the middle of pizzagate, that they are receiving financial support!

       "When do we draw the line with Fake News, when fake news becomes yelling "Fire" in a movie theatre (when they is not one), which is not protected by the first amendment. This seems like the prefect case to try in court... that this type of fake news is not covered under the first amendment. I would love to see you put together a legal team (with the help of the Hillary Campaign or another go fund me campaign) that takes Michael Flynn Junior to court suing him for violating the first amendment... it would probably go all the way to the Supreme Court. If you don't win... it will bring fake news into the media... and expose it. It would be highly courageous for you and your team to take on this issue. Someone certainly does... our society is slowly being eroded by fake news and we have a President Elect who tweets lies... it is time to take a stand or we won't survive 4 years of the Trump Administration."

       It is surprising to me how many people are tuning into this "fake news" buzz word, as if this has never happened in our country. Do they really believe it has taken until 2016 for MSM to start reporting false information? Do they not see that the information we once called lies and propaganda has simply been renamed? Nothing has changed except the admission that it happens (news organizations reporting lies).

       Let's say pizzagate is true. Maybe the owners of the restaurant know and comply, but what about the workers? Those who just need a job to support themselves and their families. They might not know what's going on; with any job, there's a distance kept from the knowledge of management and the low level employees. Locked rooms only managers can access are common in all walks of life, from retail, food, offices, etc. So the safety and well being of these people should be considered when investigating pizzagate. Additionally, if they do know, considering projects like MK Ultra, perhaps they've been brainwashed, making them victims -- maybe the same can be said to the owners.
      </p>
      <p>
       These restaurants, should pizzagate be true, would most likely be under the spell or threat of people with lots of power and scary abilities. Let us not lose sight of that and turn brother against brother, but rather continue to fight the powers in charge rather than the pawns. And even if these restaurant owners may have taken bribes, what about their conscience? What if it gets the better of them and they are living in their own internal hell? It's not up to use to judge these pawns, that work comes from above. And in fact, if the theory of pizzagate holds true, who knows, a whistleblower from within may one day step forward with documentation and proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ultimately, please, try and be as rational and logical as you can about pizzagate. That's how this thing will be exposed, not through clickbait, self-righteousness, lone wolf behavior, death threats, and the like.

       So assuming it is true, wouldn't you say it's more important to dismantle a child sex ring than it is to keep say 5 people employed?

       Yes, I agree. But lets use something like the CIA, the FBI, the KGB, even Nazi Germany for instance: Not everyone who had ties to these organizations is innately evil nor are they aware of what they're doing; they've been conditioned to follow orders, keep their heads down, don't ask questions, fall in line. A low ranking member might for instance see a door in one of their headquarters buildings and if they try to open it, surveillance, or worse, a higher ranking employee might find them and this will result in unfortunate consequences for that person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's also a parallel to be made with any major corporation. If you work for a company which is controversial such as fast food, known for causing poor health conditioning, it's not you, the worker, that is responsible for such a thing. It's the company, their executives and management and corporate interests which sneak their way around loopholes and use lobbyists and money to hide their agendas or keep their practices on the downlow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system we live in is incredibly corrupt. The market dictates that people need to work, meaning many of us will find ourselves working for corrupt places, simply due to the need to money. Low level workers like cashiers, cooks, delivery drivers, they likely wouldn't have access to pizzagate related info, they're just doing superficial work.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if they did at least hear about the conspiracy, this puts them in a bind: Work for an unethical business or work for what's likely another unethical business? What's worse, if pizzagate is true, what if they quit and are monitored by shady agencies upon doing so?
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, it's critically important to dismantle child sex rings, but we have to remain vigilant about all the possible players, the outcomes, and so   forth.

       Ya I see your point and like the examples, definatley puts it into perspective. Crazy how many corrupt institutions and companies there are that are able to do their bidding just because people need money, in turn keeping the corruptness running.

       Sometimes though, you find yourself washing the windows on the death star.  You know who you're working for and why.  You could tell Vader you've got a sick grandmother and then exodus posthaste if you were smart, otherwise we know what happens to window washers that stick around

       Well, that's another thing -- working for Darth Vader, pretty obviously he's an evil force but there's a twofold response:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         He has control over a ton of people; work for him, or perish. Much like any totalitarian regime. It's not because you agree with the messages, but because you're either in fear of your life, or brainwashed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In the case of pizzagate, there's so much going on with "fake news" versus "real news" that there's this widespread circulation of rumor versus fact, that it can be difficult to ascertain truth from fiction, or to grasp the concept that sometimes, truth is stranger than fiction.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       It's all a mess no matter how you slice it, no pun intended.
