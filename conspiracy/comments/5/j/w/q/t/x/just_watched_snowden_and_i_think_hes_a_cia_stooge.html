        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The story given in the movie doesn&#39;t make sense.  There are several things that made me wince.  Firstly the bit where he&#39;s speaking with his girlfriend and acts amazed that she can do an IP trace, an IP trace is extremely basic and almost anyone with a basic knowledge of networking can do this.  Not something to be amazed about at all.  Then where he claimed to sneak out an SD card in a Rubik&#39;s cube, what it failed to mention was he would have had to adopt the same method bringing it in, this is highly unlikely.  In fact, if you gave security any object they would be more likely to check that item.  Maybe that part was artistic license.  Then there was the black CIA/NSA guy who just happened to be the cleverest guy in the building - obviously pc bullshit who spotted Snowden&#39;s Micro SD on the floor, please let this be artistic license too.  After watching the movie I just thought he&#39;s a liar.  I think he&#39;s still CIA and the whole thing was leaked in order that people accept they are being tracked and everything they do is logged.  </p>

<p>Now he&#39;s conveniently in Russia, and despite the millions he&#39;s been making doing interviews, articles and movie deals he still lives in a shit hole.  Highly unlikely.  Oh and now his bitch was allowed to go to Moscow to be with him.  The CIA have always sold an unlikely story, it&#39;s as though they read Mein Kampf and thought it was full of great ideas, so they put it all into practice.  If you tell a lie, make it a big lie and keep repeating it, eventually everyone will believe it.  How fortunate it is for leaders that men do not think.  </p>

<p>If you know one thing that someone says is bullshit it is safe to assume everything they say is bullshit.</p>

<p>I do find Snowden highly suspicious tbh. It&#39;s almost as if the leaks were meant to normalise mass surveillance,  rather than expose it.</p>

<p>If you think about it all that happened when he leaked that shit, was western governments basically saying yes we are spying on you, and no you can&#39;t do anything about it because we are going to rewrite the law and make it legal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even just the most basic search will show you that Snowden made 200,000 dollars in speaking fees alone this year.

    <div class="md"><p>RE: speaking fees</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yahoo News <strong>estimates</strong> $200,000 total... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...although they can&#39;t prove how much of that <em>estimate</em> went to his Boston-based agent (<a href="http://www.apbspeakers.com/">www.apbspeakers.com/</a>) or in total donations to non-profits like Freedom of the Press Foundation. For that 1 non-profit alone, his ACLU attorney, Ben Wizner, says Snowden&#39;s contributions are estimated to total $50,000 by years end.</p>

<p>RE: movie deals</p>

<p>Stone said (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/magazine/edward-snowdens-long-strange-journey-to-hollywood.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fmagazine&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=magazine&amp;amp;region=rank&amp;amp;module=package&amp;amp;version=highlights&amp;amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;amp;pgtype=sectionfront">per NYT</a>) the $1,000,000 was for rights to a book, “Time of the Octopus,” written by Snowden&#39;s Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We bought it because we did get good access to Ed,” Stone explained. “He [Kucherena] had to be brought along.”</p>

<p>&quot;I don’t take any money from him [Snowden],” Kucherena said. “He doesn’t have any. So I wrote a book, yes, fine. So I got a little, as we say in Russian.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but your link doesn&#39;t prove in any way that Snowden is living large in Russia. They&#39;re all estimated speculation based on quotes on speaking fees which range from &quot;free&quot; to non profits on up to $25,000 for others. His attorney, Ben Wizner, had this to say about the LLC to which the fees are paid:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Wizner] assumes the LLC was set up by APB (A Global Speaker, Celebrity &amp; Entertainment Agency) to shield the fees it pays to Snowden from the amounts it collects on behalf of other clients, presumably in case the U.S. government targets Snowden’s income. &quot;Ed doesn’t have a clue what the LLC is,&quot; said Wizner.</p>
