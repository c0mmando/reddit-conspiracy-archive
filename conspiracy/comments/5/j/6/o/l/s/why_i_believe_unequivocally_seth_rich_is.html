        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ll try and make this quick- it&#39;s a topic we&#39;ve all discussed in depth.</p>

<p>Since I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ee4wk/updated_for_anyone_interested_in_high_level/?st=IWW25LWN&amp;sh=f6d64a09">this thread </a> in here a few months ago, I&#39;ve been fairly obsessed with what HLIanon has to say on the nature of the world. If you&#39;ve yet to do so, I strongly recommend taking time to read through the /pol question sessions from the anon. I and a growing number in this sub think he&#39;s the real deal and are keen to see traction increase.
Anyway, one of the many nuggets he offers, is analysis of the <em>Clinton&#39;s strategy of triangulation</em>   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you aware of the Clinton strategy of triangulation? They do more than try to find the middle ground on policy. Any position they take, they will leak opposition to it and have stories published to that effect. For example, a Hillary supporter might believe she has always been an advocate of gay rights, but just couldn&#39;t say so before she did for political reasons. They intentionally craft this sort of dynamic so that their supporters can project their own values onto her, regardless of how close they are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This came to mind when I was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5izmqj/come_on_we_all_know_it_was_seth_rich/?st=IWW24RE1&amp;sh=2f30df49">arguing the point in a thread yesterday, that Assange has already implicitly said Rich is the source </a> and Wikileaks have essentially used Craig Murray, the way HLIanon describes Clinton using leaks that counter their official position</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he&#39;s close enough to Wikileaks and Assange to be privy to all manner of additional information on leaks we don&#39;t get, including, but not limited to: identity of sources, time documents/files etc were obtained, payments to source-if necessary, anecdotal info from source (I.e had they been threatened? Followed recently? Etc) &amp; despite being an insider, he serves in no official capacity within Wikileaks, and as a result is unencumbered with the same pressures that constrain Assange.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To conclude:</p>

<p>Seth Rich is the DNC Leak. After strongly implying himself, Murray fleshed out the details with more clarity than Assange could offer in his position as editor. In the same way the Clintons use triangulation to  intentionally leak information on both sides of the argument, Wikileaks has used Murray as a leak as a means to get the truth out, whilst maintaining plausible deniability.</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;m</strong> using this post as a means to:
 a) sound out a consensus in here that Rich is the source and Assange has implied so directly and through Murray and,
b) continue, like others here have done, to try and foster further interest in these question sessions.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t stress how much clarity &amp; wisdom is available to view there; approach with an open mind and do the research to back up any claims you see.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

<p>Edit- Another nugget from HLIanon that stuck with me and one that I feel should be the collective goal of this sub, and other communities like it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You need to deemphasize exposing the current system to some degree, more specifically put it in the context of offering a better alternative and expose what people are missing out on by going along with the current system. If you can do better, you can show people they are being cheated. If you can&#39;t offer a better alternative, they will wonder why should they care</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s saying <del>that you</del> <strong>We</strong> stand more chance in changing people&#39;s minds, by using knowledge of the conspiracies being perpetrated against us, to show how badly we&#39;ve been cheated through a stifling of our collective potential, as opposed to just shining a light on evil. 
When I read that part, I paused and thought yeah I can dig that - I mean, who wouldn&#39;t prefer to focus on hope over fear?</p>

<p>Edit- Just seen <a href="https://www.wolftimes.com/2016/12/19/why-i-believe-unequivocally-seth-rich-is-wikileaks-source-triangulation/">some idiot has plagiarised this entire article - literally word for word. How sad, flattering but sad.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like Hilldog adopted some of the Bernie ideas/policies that gained him popularity. Prior to her winning the Democratic nomination she was against a 15/hr minimum wage, post the nomination she was all for it. From what i also understand, Bernie held out &quot;stepping down&quot; because he wanted her to champion some of his policies before he outright endorsed her. I think if she had done it sooner and on a larger level. She might have stopped the bleeding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pre-nomination, she wanted 12/hr minimum wage, while Bernie supported 15/hr. Post nomination, she picked up the policy and supported a 15/hr national minimum wage. This is fact, whether she believed it or not. She also did this with Student debt, which was another Sanders plank that she adopted. She has changed her stance for votes many times. She adopted the policies after she got the dem nomination at the behest of her advisers so that she wouldn&#39;t alienate the ground swell of Sanders votes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am agreeing with you on the idea that she is just adopting them. The fact is that she adopted them in an attempt to get Bernie votes to stay on the left. This is documented because Sanders and Clinton had a meeting before he conceded to ask her to keep certain campaign planks.</p>

    <div class="md"><pre><code>You need to deemphasize exposing the current system to some degree, more specifically put it in the context of offering a better alternative and expose what people are missing out on by going along with the current system.

    <div class="md"><p>For me, the best indicator, without even using triangulation, is that WikiLeaks offered a reward for information leading to the arrest of his murderer. They&#39;ve never done this before, especially for someone who would just be a random, faceless DNC staffer to Assange and crew...unless he was the leak. </p>

<p>They did this knowing there would never be an arrest. They were merely getting his name out there to allow those of us who pay attention to piece the puzzle together on our own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was the kicker for me as well and a point I made:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So he names and offers a reward to solve the murder of a <strong>completely unrelated individual</strong> in the same breath as he explains how Wikileaks takes the safety and identity of their sources <em>very seriously</em>?If so, highly nonsensical and illogical on Assange&#39;s part, in fact I&#39;d go as far to say <strong>insanely</strong> so. Literally no need at all.A more reasonable assessment might lead you to believe that Assange <em>is in fact</em> implicitly naming his source in a way he can maintain plausible deniability if pressed. Doesn&#39;t that seem more likely a scenario?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but that alone wasn&#39;t enough for the naysayers. So I decided to put something together you couldn&#39;t discount as easily. In instances like this, people seem willing to really <em>reach</em> for ways to prove events like this are random coincidence, when often the answers are usually simple ones- but you need the ability to think clearly and not be impeded by false dichotomies. A skill that&#39;s eroded in the era of zombie news networks ..</p>

<p>Edit- u/icedagger316 I don&#39;t know you and you don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m willing to bet you&#39;re not a detective/super sleuth. I watch Columbo reruns from time to time, but I&#39;m not a PI either. So how have we reached the same conclusion, using the same means to justify how we arrived there? I say it&#39;s because it&#39;s the logical answer that anyone not operating under bias, had an appreciation of the context and not labouring under the weight of misinformation, would give.<br/>
Question we should really be asking: why are some people so quick to write it off?</p>

<p>The tactic of using surrogates and planned opposition to support one&#39;s idealogy falls more into psychology&#39;s definition, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing&#39;s still bothering me about this: if Mr. Rich was Wikileaks&#39; source, why would the DNC/ the Clintons have him murdered?  I&#39;m not aware of them having done so for any other informant, and with the current war on whistle blowers, Mr. Rich likely faced legal penalties if they had just gone through the courts.  </p>

<p>If it was because he had other knowledge, then why didn&#39;t he give that to Wikileaks, too?  We were concerned about them tampering with the ballot machines, but that seems not to have been the case.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rich was a hardcore loyal democrat.  He was offered a job on the Clinton campaign days before he died.  It&#39;s far more likely that he helped &quot;get out the vote&quot; (as long as they&#39;re voting for Clinton) during the primaries, and he was killed by Sanders supporters.  Assange&#39;s hints are just misdirection to protect the real leaker;  probably Tulsi Gabbard.</p>
