       Does no one else find it shady the flood of dirt on Hillary yet no one seems to be exposing Trump in any way shape or form? It's really an extremely obvious pro-Trump agenda where they catered to the likes of for lack of better term, the "conspiracy community" by telling us all the shady shit they want to hear about one candidate (likely using criteria found in past PSYOP) yet painting Trump to be some sort of truth seeking corrupting hating saint? You guys are dumber than I thought if you can't see this.

       Like Epstein's plane, Trump is shown to be on the flight records but the focus is entirely on the Clintons being pedophiles. It's a gross double standard. I by no means support Hillary for the record, but sheesh she lost.. I think Trump is much more relevant at this point.

       yep, reddit trying to deal with T_d was a lose-lose situation, yea they finally solved the brigading issues, but now the cult has bled over to fringe subs and essentially claimed ownership, its ridiculous how in /conspiracy we can only have discussions which they personally approve of or agree with, otherwise we face being down voted into oblivion..... even this post is already being derailed
      </p>
      <p>
       but since this is /conspiracy and we like to openly discuss all kinds of crazy theories, ill throw my 2-cents in

       Has anyone else noticed that he has a fairly new account. It is only three months old and he only makes submissions once a month. He also once made this comment: 
 " I'd get rid of sociopaths, everyone with an IQ under 120, the mentally ill, all hardcore monotheists, and then work from there" This comment was made on this thread : Heartless bastards of Reddit, if aliens told you that you had to reduce the human population down to 500 million, what would your criteria be and why?
He also made this comment :

       Which motives are you questioning? If you had to vastly reduce the world's population, would you not take it as an opportunity to create a smarter society? Eugenics doesn't have to be along racial lines if you think that's what I'm implying..

       You actually came on this sub and started calling people dumb who don't agree with your opinions. You think you are open minded but you are not when you make comments like that. Go back to playing with your chaos magic and insulting people. Maybe you were not such a mean person and insulting maybe they would take you seriously. But you can't be.

       The only thing you proved is that you have poor reading comprehension. The whole point of that thread was if you HAD to reduce the population, what would be the criteria. It's a huge leap to claim that I said we NEED to start offing people. I have plenty of black friends. I also know plenty of white people who can't afford kids. However, in my area, the poorest most corrupt town on Long Island, yea it is largely the blacks having too many kids on welfare. Making an observation =\= racism. And the whole point of this forum is to get people to open their eyes, I'd you're gonna get Butthurt because I pointed out a way that I feel many are failing to do so, then so be it. You really have a way with twisting words and making hyperboles, I'll give you that.

       I never said anyone needed to be killed, the entire point of that thread is based on a hypothetical situation. Look up hypothetical, that might clarify. And any girl I sleep with, I make very clear that were not having kids, so yeah if she tries to have my offspring without my consent I'm gonna do something about it. Now please remind me how any of this is in any way relevant? Oh wait, you just came here to derail this, I forgot.

       Lol So now I am conspiring against you? You are paranoid dude.  SMH.  You really missed the whole point.  Lol. Grow up dude. If you want to be taken seriously don't insult people.  Choose your words wisely or they will come back to haunt you. I am done with you.

       You love putting words in people's mouth. No, you simply failed to counter any points I made while spending time digging through my post history for completely irrelevant past comments to post in some attempt to make me look bad.. creep.
