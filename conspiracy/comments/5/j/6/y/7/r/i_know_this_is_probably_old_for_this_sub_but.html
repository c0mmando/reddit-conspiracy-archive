        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My apologies in advance, I&#39;m new to posting here, but I&#39;ve been reading for a long time, and I must say this community&#39;s dedication is astounding. So I&#39;ve put on my tin foil power armor to join the frey.</p>

<p>So the other night, the loud, grinding metal, brass instrument sounds happened in Spokane Washington. I think the best way I&#39;ve found to describe it is an I-beam the size of new York being bent and twisted, I guess most people hear trumpets, it makes sense I suppose. I heard it, I listened for hours, recorded what I could on my phone, and have been doing my best to research possible causes and effects of these sounds. It happened. Local news had an immediate, coordinated story that seemed to be aimed to cover it up. This is why I&#39;m interested. </p>

<p>There are a lot of good theories, and way more bad ones. Not to mention the unlimited supply of religious fanatics uploading obviously fake videos of actual horns and trumpet sounds &quot;in the sky&quot;. This was a long list of videos to sift through, I started on youtube as a quick reference. On the immediate results for &quot;trumpet sounds in sky&quot; there were roughly 5 events that produced exactly the sound I heard that night. There were even a couple from Spokane from that night, again exactly what i heard. There were quite a few more that, in my opinion, could have been the same thing, but it was to far to fully consider it the same sound. </p>

<p>Now, with a minimal amount of research, just basic keywords, it was easy to see that it would be difficult to find any consistent information on this. From HAARP, to Earth&#39;s polarity shifting, there are a lot of starting points. </p>

<p>I may be way off here, this may very well be nothing. In fact I&#39;m more certain this will go nowhere than anywhere. 
What I am certain of, however, is that this is almost the only place I&#39;ve seen theories like this accepted and looked into, not shouldered away with a laugh like literally all but 2 people I&#39;ve brought this up to. These people are my friends, and they look at me like I&#39;m crazy. As if there&#39;s no possible way anything is happening that could harm them. Like there&#39;s no way their beloved government would betray their trust by withholding vital information about their planet. </p>

<p>I&#39;m on mobile, so it&#39;s hard to upload anything I have, or any detailed research, FOR NOW. 
If anyone else is interested in this, let&#39;s figure it out. I&#39;ll upload what I have, and update this post as my friend and I collect more data we feel may pertain to this. There&#39;s already a good amount of interesting information, I just need a solid internet connection and my laptop to do that. </p>

<p>Sorry for incorrect spelling in advance probably.</p>

<p>Update: I&#39;ve finally reviewed my audio, and while it&#39;s a little washed out, the sound is there and obvious. I do believe I can clean it up pretty well, I will try my best to upload multiple versions, including the original if anyone else wants to play around with it. Any suggestions on where I can upload and not lose any more quality due to compression? </p>

<p>Update: Here&#39;s the audio files I promised. Please let me know if for whatever reason they dont work, I&#39;ll do whatever I can to make sure this is heard. </p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/chrall97/sets/loud-metallic-scrapingtrumpet-sound-spokane-wa-12-14-16">https://soundcloud.com/chrall97/sets/loud-metallic-scrapingtrumpet-sound-spokane-wa-12-14-16</a></p>

<p>Two files in there, one long and one short. The long one has very clear, very present, extended instances of the phenomenon, while the short one has much softer sounds as it&#39;s from about two hours earlier. The two recording were both taken from the same place, under the same conditions. Mind the vehicle noises, there are one or two that drive by me, they are the loudest sounds in either clip. Play at high volume to fully hear the sounds. Please keep in mind, the recordings of these sounds, and the way it sounds when you actually hear it are very different. Identifiable, but different. It is easy to believe this is scraping machinery or trains or something of the like, but it&#39;s much different in person. 
I&#39;m glad to answer any questions about these, I will be as prompt as possible with my responses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly the professional you&#39;re looking for, but i thought i would hijack this post for my observation. Whatever that sound is, it&#39;s...how can I put it? Overtonal.</p>

<p>Overtones are multiples of base frequencies of audio tones. I&#39;m oversimplifying but what I&#39;m trying to get at is, at about 16 seconds into this video ( <a href="https://youtu.be/H7f9ejA4FyI">https://youtu.be/H7f9ejA4FyI</a> ) you can hear what sounds like the 11th harmonic alternate with the 10th harmonic, or an out of tune F# with an E (they&#39;re both sharp, but I mean relative to each other).</p>

<p>While there are many ways to get this kind of effect, I would like to note that a natural, unvalved trumpet makes different notes using overtones as well.  Anyway, that&#39;s my contribution thus far.</p>

<p>Spez: If your base frequency is 100Hz, your tenth and eleventh harmonics are 1,000 and 1,100Hz, respectively.  One more sort of odd thing is that the E I mentioned is pretty close to 666Hz. Again, not saying that means anything, it&#39;s just weird. 😜</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shiiite - she is basically saying it&#39;s the beginning stages of &quot;Harvesting&quot; of our planet, our people. Wow, this is wild.</p>

<p>If we are <strong>created in his image</strong>, this means other beings are as well. I&#39;d sooner argue that ETs are doing his bidding in his name. And we as a people have made the mistake in the past of associating ETs as being God or Gods. </p>

<p>No matter what is happening y&#39;all, I do believe more people need to be looking up more often. If you&#39;re in a mall or restaurants, you will miss all the amazing things happening up there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard exactly what you heard 2 years ago at 5am in los angeles. It was the most disturbing sound and experience of my life. I was sweating and couldnt sleep the rest of the night over it. It went on for about 15 minutes sporadically. The absolute most bizzare part was calling every single one of my friends in the area afterwards and none of them heard it, and i sleep like a rock. My neighbors house caught fire once and 11 firetrucks were in front of my house and i didnt wake up, but for the heaven horns i did :/ wrote a song called &quot;strange times&quot; about it</p>

<p>Also to note, im a grammy winning music producer and have never heard a sound/vibration that dark and disgusting in my life. Felt like the earth whimpering before here death. Whatever its from in not good at all. Maybe Cayce&#39;s pole shift has finally arrived...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so I&#39;ll catch some flak for this, but trains make those sounds. Lock up an axle and drag that on a tracks long enough you may get a resonance effect and it&#39;ll get loud. Every single time these videos get posted there&#39;s talk of a lot of wild theories, but there&#39;s always train tracks nearby. OP has already mentioned he lives near an aluminum plant, so there&#39;s at least one source of train tracks nearby.</p>

<p>Normal trains and connecting cars can be heard 10-15km away (easily), an axle resonating as it&#39;s being dragged along tracks would travel just as far if not farther, and since it&#39;s not a sound folks are familiar with they wouldn&#39;t immediately associate it with trains.</p>

The train yard is right next to the aluminum plant, also next to the mall they said the sounds were coming from as a result of snow plows. For 8 hours. On a night it didn&#39;t snow. The train yard is literally across the street, over the river. They could have said it was trains, and I probably would have believed it, but they didn&#39;t. They came up with a bullshit story, that couldn&#39;t even be backed up. It just doesn&#39;t add up. </p>

This sound is similair, but I&#39;ll be honest it did not make my list of clips that were exactly the sound I heard. And the weird ring effect in that video didn&#39;t look like it had the same resolution as the rest of the screen, as well as the context and location kind of steering me away.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I watched some of the videos to hear the noise, then googled to see any news about it. There was one news story about it and it said it was a snow plow in the mall parking lot and because sounds travel in an arch in cold weather, the sound was amplified and therefore people all around the area could hear it... Really, a snow plow?? All I know is that noise would freak me out if I heard it at my house!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw it! So, funny thing, all the local news stations around here reported exactly that in their morning edition. That&#39;s the entire reason I was so curious in the first place! A cover up is a dead giveaway. Also, I live reasonably close to that mall, and there is still no fucking way it was snow plows. Sure as hell not for 9 hours straight, I could plow all that snow with a lawn mower in half that time.  </p>

<p>Edit: Also, apparently people heard it on the far side of town from that mall, so there really is just no way. Not to mention (incoming here say) someone asked the company that would have been involved, and they weren&#39;t plowing. And it didn&#39;t snow that night. I was outside most of the night. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But those tunneling machines have been used for many many decades, since at least WWII, but this is the first I&#39;ve heard these sounds before.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe YouTube has allowed this citizen journalism and more wider cast net of viewers and sources, post 2007-ish.</p>

<p>Again trying to extrapolate, I&#39;m sure we would have SOME records of these sounds in books or news articles since those tunneling machines were used around WWI.</p>

<p>For those that don&#39;t know about the tunneling machines, include Air force in your <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tunneling+machine+air+force&amp;amp;t=h_&amp;amp;iax=1&amp;amp;ia=images">search</a> and you&#39;ll see it. Then of course this begs the question, why in the hell does <em>Air Force</em> appear on a deep underground tunneling machine?! </p>

<ul>
<li>They would bore large tunnels leaving behind vitrified reinforced tunnel housing to support various craft.</li>
<li>don&#39;t remember exact numbers, but processed somewhere around 20 miles per hours (that&#39;s massive considering the infrastructure needed to dig tunnels. Standard construction is more like 2 miles per month, not including planning/design!)</li>
<li>they ran into &quot;unfriendlies&quot; on several of their projects</li>
<li>apparently we built these tunnels, but they are not usually used by humans.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some questions, just to understand this:</p>

<p>Where were you? Were there any factors nearby that could have made the sounds (logging, vehicles, etc)? How loud were they? Did the sound come from a specific direction, or was it pervasive?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disbelieve you, but I do remember several years ago, there was a rash of these noises in Canada and Russia, and they were hoaxes. Some of the videos used the &quot;trumpet blast&quot; sound from the movie Red State. I guess that could have been a cover up as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I start, in response to nearby Factors, anything I think it could have been nearby, I don&#39;t believe would have been making any sound from roughly 8pm to roughly 5am intermittently. </p>

<p>Ok, in order;
Location: About .75 miles from the exact center of Spokane County. </p>

<p>Nearby Factors: We have a nearby Aluminum plant that I know off the top of my head, not much else. I could potentially compile a list of nearby factories and known noisemakers for the sake of eliminating possibilities.</p>

<p>Noise Level: When I started going outside to listen approx. Every 10-45 minutes, starting around 10pm, it could not be heard through my window indoors, and it sounded about as loud as an air horn from roughly 100 yds. out. By 4am, I could feel it just barely resonating when I was outside, and hear it over soft music in my room. I should mention blinds were drawn, with a blanket laid over the window, and they are 2 layered windows with a gas insulation layer if that makes any major difference. Also, the sound was well over twice as loud by the end from when it started, and fully audible and apparent by the time it stopped, increasing in loudness steadily for the duration. </p>

<p>Direction: Seemingly omnidirectional, though I was standing next to a 3 story, multifaceted apartment building, with an aluminum car park on my other side. I think the sound may have been funneled a little bit by this somehow, but I am not an expert on sound waves. I know I was staring at the eastern sky, about 25° up. I can&#39;t say why, again it may have just been there was no other way for the sound to reach me other than from that direction.</p>

<p>Red State hoax videos: I can&#39;t say I know the exact sound from Red State as I haven&#39;t seen it, but I did see a lot of videos that were very obviously hoaxes. Actual trumpet sounds, trombone sounds, choir sounds, LOL someone even used the sound the Reapers make from mass effect. That was a nice laugh in the middle of all this.</p>

<p>There you go, let me know if I missed anything you asked. </p>

<p>Sorry for any spelling errors. </p>

<p>A lot of weird stuff seems to happen in the Spokane area. I remember a couple years ago, a wayward US soldier was found after breaking into a comics shop. He was found on the roof, disoriented, after making an arrow with some bricks that were laying around, as per training he had been undergoing for some kind of survivalist thing. This was around the time of Jade Helm, too. </p>

<p>I do believe I can clean it up pretty well</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since you are using Audacity since middle school you could be well aware how to create sounds like this yourself and how to add them over a recording of you and your friend acting scared. That would be the most logical assumption besides all the typical paranormal conjectures. Just because a particular sound scares people <strong>intuitively</strong> doesn&#39;t make the evidence more believeable – in the contrary. People in fear can&#39;t judge rationally and that&#39;s why these trumpet videos are trending. Or because of the end of the world (for the millionth time now).</p>

<p>Hollywood uses the same trick/technique to scare audiences in almost every fucking movie about aliens – people create all this crazy theories in their unconsciousness, based on sounds they have heard in cinema/video games: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzY099ihULs">Tripod Sound from War of the Worlds 2005</a></p>

<p>While they may not sound exactly the same - if you would hear the other one alone at night the effect would be the same (wet pants).</p>

<p>Does the software <strong>Paulstretch</strong> or the <strong>Amazing Slow Downer</strong> 
... ring a bell? 😎</p>

<p>But i guess it can be done with nearly every audio software that has options to change pitch and timing, echo and reverb.</p>

<p><strong>So can you proof you didn&#39;t fake the Audio just to spook some people?</strong> </p>

<p>The only proof that it&#39;s genuine would be to check sources from other people in your town. But who besides you two could have been possible up at night recording weird noises outside?</p>

<p><strong>These videos explain in great detail how to achieve these metal sounds:</strong><br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88VEhQswIcw%5D">Strange sounds in the sky explained by a sound designer 2016</a></p>

<p>And how people are even re-using the SAME SOURCES:<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5MkIjt9o18">Strange Trumpet Sounds Debunked 2015</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>If i happen to falsely accuse you of something you didn&#39;t do and you really heard these terrible sounds like you recorded them – sorry for that in advance.</p>

<p>But someone here has to question your story :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should have lead with that. How would you like proof? I&#39;ll not argue the legitimacy of the audio I recorded, I have no want to. I&#39;ll simply leave the people to decide if it&#39;s just a coincidence this has been happening around the world. I&#39;ve contributed my evidence.

    <div class="md"><p>But you have to agree that a lot of these videos are purposely being faked to generate ad revenue. Since that isn&#39;t your intention here i may have been to harsh with my comment and put you in the same category as these youtube fakers – but only because i know a lot of people here like to troll since topics like these sounds and UFO sightings are guaranteed to get a lot of feedback.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I caught on to the large pool of faked videos very quickly, because they are obvious. I&#39;ve never really cared for Karma much, I&#39;m simply interested in spreading the word about this crazy sound i heard, and happened to record. Sadly, there will always be someone trying to make money, instead of doing the right thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe i just looked for evidence against the authenticity of your recording because it sounds so intimidating. Heard it with noise-cancelling headphones (nearly every sound outside gets blocked) and had constant shivers down my spine after the &quot;trumpet&quot; kicked in, partly too because of your breathing and comments. I wouldn&#39;t be that skeptical if i had experienced anything strange like that in my life. But so far nothing out of the ordinary... Did you just hear the sound or could you feel the low tones?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was inside a lot last night, but did go out multiple times. I have had strange noise experiences south of Spokane along 195, and one particularly strange event southeast of Fairfield at Starr Butte where while stargazing with a few friends a pulsating bass tone sounding like it came from the ground started quiet and got much louder and mechanical and distorted then suddenly stopped. There is from all outward appearances NOTHING out in them farm fields that should be making noises like that. My friends and I are/were pretty spooked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no, sorry for the confusion. Those events were in the past. I was just confirming my history of unexplained noises in the area. Fairfield is a little farm community about 35 miles south of Spokane Valley. Starr Butte is a public piece of land about 15 mins southeast of Fairfield. The Spokane Astronomical Society used to go out there to use telescopes and watch meteor showers as the landscape provides great blockage of the little light pollution out there, great for observing the sky. I sometimes go out there with friends, last few visits have had strange occurrences with the one I described being about two years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Speculation</strong> (cuz thats we are left to do with this one): I can&#39;t help but think this is a group of ETs emitting warning alarms in various cities. Notice how there does not seem to be a source of the sound. There have been reports of this happening out on the ocean (hearing it on a canoe), and on tundra, nowhere near water. So where is it coming from? Probably the sky, I get the sense the source is cloaked in the sky. How else do you explain it travelling so far in one city? It&#39;s clear to me that no ET race is going to swoop down and help us all, we must sort out all this mess amongst ourselves, but they could probably generate some weird war like horn sounds to freak us out.</p>

<p>Considering what&#39;s happening in Syria, Kerry going to Antarctica and all the old world alliances coming together, it&#39;s not looking good for avoiding WWIII. Get at least two weeks of supplies for zero power to home, canned foods, jugs of water etc.</p>

<p>also, it was frigid cold that day (-11 on my way into work) so the extreme cold could have been a factor too.</p>

<p>not discounting what you heard, because it could have been something else entirely.</p>

On the first night I was woken up by this sound which sounded almost like a booming, or like someone was beating a giant drum that was incredibly loud.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen an inter-dimensional elephant deity before. It was gigantic, almost beyond comprehensible scale. He looked like Buddha mixed with Krishna and had an elephant head. For some reason he/she/it allowed me to see it and quickly disappeared into a dimensional rift they he created from the eye on his forehead. I will never forget this. This is what I always envision when somebody mentions god, and any time someone refers to these mysterious trumpet noises that people keep hearing. All I hear is that fucking magical elephant god that my mind is 100% certain it saw. It could be multiples of them. Listen. It&#39;s probably just godlike energy based alien elephant thingies. </p>

<p>I came across this info after reading the Podesta Emails. I wanted to know more about Nibiru aka planet X. Which led me to Zeta talk. I hope this is not real. But it seems like it would be fairly obvious if a giant planet became noticeable in the night/day sky.  There are enough home astronomers with the internet which would clearly debunk any view-able planet X.  But if you take it lightly, mix in ancient/biblical end times like the great flood given the timeline that these events occur every few thousand years. Then yea it could be feasible that a great destroyer is on the way. It may not be end times but it could be a global purging of many people and animals.  Given the fact that at Earths core there is a spinning ball of molten iron. This spinning creates our magnetic field which repels space dust/radiation.  I like to think that it can keep spinning forever. But what if it&#39;s more like an elastic band motor where it spins in one direction for so long and then spins back in the other direction for a lesser but still long time in human years.  If you come across anything new let me know.  </p>

<p>Also I find it funny that if you say  Trump Pence fast enough, The Don could bring about end times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a really interesting perspective to have revered the book of revelations as a warning for those who didn&#39;t follow the rules, to now, where I understand it as fiction, and try to rationalize it with science somehow. I mean I always thought some things in the bible were reasonable enough to have happened, but then there&#39;s the Fantasy side, with magic and zombies and whatnot. Maybe there is some truth to every myth, if only for the misconstrued interpretations over the last several thousand years and who knows how many languages. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to say there was a very very soft vibration from some of the more intense tones later on in the night, the ones in the longer clip I uploaded. Almost unnoticeable, In fact it may have been all in my head. I can&#39;t eclxcatly upload a recording of it sadly :/ Would a seismograph pick that kind of thing up maybe?<br/>
Edit: Or is that even a thing, I&#39;m not exactly a scientist lol. </p>
