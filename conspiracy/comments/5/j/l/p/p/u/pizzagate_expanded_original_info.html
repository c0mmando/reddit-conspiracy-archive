<p><strong>The point of this post</strong>, is to get a point across to people <em>who don&#39;t believe</em> in the <strong><em>Pizzagate</em></strong> <em>scandal</em> - <strong>COME ON!</strong> you&#39;ve got to read this! If there&#39;s something you don&#39;t like <strong>you&#39;re meant to comment 1st</strong>. I can change it for you if you&#39;ve got a problem with it - like eBay, as always. <strong>DON&#39;T THINK YOU KNOW IT</strong> All.

We have got the internet now, we don&#39;t have to rely upon corrupt corporations to deliver our information through their <em>scamming-propaganda-media-outlets</em> like CNN and Fox News</p>

<p>Inappropriate action is being taken by law enforcement, and so - we are supposed to be concerned about this, for the FBI to get pressured into doing their job properly. This article is to show the <strong>blatant hypocrisy of political crookedness, establishment media, and misused law enforcement</strong>. I wrote it so that we as a society can put insurmountable pressure on the FBI to do their job by investigating. Instead of leaving investigations to citizens. They are proving themselves to be the Federal Bureau of idleness. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>2015, Loren Copp, owner of Dojo Pizza was investigated by the FBI for child trafficking, and sexual abuse, and raided by armed officers. But I think they have no proof, and they investigated him because of ONE series of allegations from ONE anonymous or non-existent person. And he is still living in fear of facing 30 years in prison and a 250,000 $ fine. I believe Loren Copp&#39;s story sounds very innocent, and none of the children under his care expressed anything but love</strong></p>

<p>Two pizza shops <strong>3 doors away from each other</strong> in Washington DC have allegations against them, coming from over 3 million people, and the FBI haven&#39;t shown to have been doing anything for it. Definitely not any raids like for Dojo Pizza.</p>

<p>Terrence Bean, one of Obama&#39;s friends, and a Democrat has been convicted of pedophilia in 2014.

<p>In 2008, the billionaire Jeffery Epstein, who flew Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton to his private island, was convicted of pedophilia and having a sex-slave island. Bill Clinton flew on his private jet at least 26 times. Hillary flew on the jet at least 6 times.

<p><strong>At least 3 pizza shop owners have been prosecuted for pedophilia</strong>.</p>

<p>Michael Devlin, a pizza parlour manager, in 2002 kept a boy captive for 4 years after he kidnapped him, and sexually abused him. He kidnapped and held captive, another boy until arrested. He was sentenced to 170 years</p>

<p>In 1999, William Monac III, a pizza shop owner, made his own child pornography, by getting a female employee to pose for him, In 2003 he was convicted.</p>

<p><strong>The point of saying</strong> all these things, is that law enforcement is seemingly doing nothing to investigate Comet or Besta Pizza. And they are even protecting the establishments from the inquisitive public. A customer at Comet Ping Pong, Jack Posobiec was thrown out by police for filming a live internet feed from his phone, in November 2016. He observed that the police were working parked outside the restaurant keeping watch. His evidence is still available.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Before Pizzagate, in 2016, there was the Anthony Weiner, Huma Abdein, Clinton scandal. And the FBI found over 650,000 emails on Anthony Weirner&#39;s laptop. They closed the case only eight days after they opened the case. Some people claim, the NYPD were told and shown some of the contents of the emails, and people claimed they had tip-offs from people in the NYPD that the emails proved them guilty of child abuse, and more - possibly child trafficking.</p>

<p>For the FBI to close a case with 650,000 emails in eight days is strange. Because they opened a case reviewing emails of Hillary Clinton&#39;s, before this, and the case was open longer, and they had much fewer emails to review﻿. </p>

<p>James Comey admitted that Hillary Clinton said false information to the FBI on many occasions. And yet she stayed free as a bird. Other people have been prosecuted just for lying to law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>I recommend a news article with video, titled: <strong>Secret pedophile symbols end up on children&#39;s toys</strong> </p>

<p>(<a href="http://wfla.com/2016/03/10/secret-pedophile-symbols-end-up-on-childrens-toys/">http://wfla.com/2016/03/10/secret-pedophile-symbols-end-up-on-childrens-toys/</a>)</p>

<p><strong>This shows that it is not normal for establishment media to argue against the validity of pedophilic conspiracies</strong>.
<strong>In the news article, the woman who found the symbol wasn&#39;t called a conspiracy theorist, even though she is stating something had a &#39;pedophile symbol&#39; on it, documented by the FBI</strong><strong>.</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>The logo for Besta Pizza - <em>besta</em> is Portuguese - and Spanish, for <em>beast</em> - had the symbol for <em>boy lover</em> as their logo - one week after the Pizzagate scandal broke, Besta Pizza changed their logo. Three doors away is Comet Ping Pong, it has a logo with Aleister Crowley&#39;s Baphomet symbolism. James also owns a restaurant <em>next door</em> to Besta Pizza on Connecticut Ave called Buck&#39;s Fishing &amp; Camping</p>

<p><strong>There are 2 Besta Pizza branches</strong> both of them <em>had</em> the &#39;boy lover&#39; symbol as their logo.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://fsco.freespirits.info/">https://fsco.freespirits.info/</a>)  -  <strong>If for some reason you can&#39;t believe in Wikileaks and the Daily Mail combined</strong>, this is a link to a <strong>notorious pedophile website</strong> which uses the pedophilic symbolism for the topic of <em>boy love</em>. To my knowledge there are no images of children on the website</p>

<hr/>

<p>In John Podesta&#39;s leaked emails there&#39;s lots of talk of Comet.
James Alefantis, owner, was listed in 2016 by GQ Magazine as the <em>49th most powerful political figure in Washington DC</em>. GQ Magazine listed him just as a restaurateur and Bon Vivant which have no powerful political associations.</p>

<p>His restaurant Comet, is known for it&#39;s &#39;child friendly atmosphere&#39;. The restaurant made many posters for live music shows starting at 10pm, stating &#39;all ages&#39; are welcome.</p>

<p>James Alefantis is anagrammatically very similar to J&#39;aime l&#39;enfants - a French phrase meaning &#39;I love children&#39;. Alefantis is anagrammatically similar to infants also.</p>

<p>On James Alefantis&#39; Instagram, he posted  La Boum Boum Room in D.C, which was a nightclub with a sexual orientated provocative theme, with usual posters for events being illustrated by half naked men. And the Nightclub looks like it&#39;s part of the same business as L&#39;Enfant Cafe, as the nightclub is linked on the cafe website . This would be translated into English as <em>The Child Cafe</em>
<a href="http://www.lenfantcafe.com/">www.lenfantcafe.com/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/J0qbI">https://archive.is/J0qbI</a> - This is a man who presumably works at L&#39;Enfant Cafe, wearing a T-shirt that reads &#39;J&#39;♥ L&#39;Enfant&#39;. Note that the T-shirt doesn&#39;t say <em>cafe</em>. So the T-shirt translates as <em>I love the child</em></p>

<p>James writes his full name, as James Achilles Alefantis. Achilles was a war hero in ancient Greece. He&#39;s thought by many to have been homosexual, and having a relationship with an older man. James Alefantis is homosexual. So this could be another clue to show he chose his own name. On his Instagram page, in December 2016, he had a statue of a ancient Greek man as his profile picture.</p>

<p>James is the ex boyfriend of David Brock. David Brock is a Democratic political operative, who has been associated with the Rothschild family. The richest family in history. James posted a picture of David Brock with a Rothschild member.</p>

<p>James posted an image of a man with a small boy, and had a necklace wrapped around the small boy&#39;s neck, while wearing the necklace himself. The man, probably one of James Alefantis&#39; friends was holding the boy in his arms. He commented on his own photo, &#39;#chickenlovers&#39;.</p>

<p>James has had at least <strong>5</strong> meetings at the White House, and it has been recorded in the visitors&#39; records. You can find him in the visitors records by searching for <em>Alefantis</em> at the webpage below.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://open.whitehouse.gov/dataset/White-House-Visitor-Records-Requests/p86s-ychb/data">https://open.whitehouse.gov/dataset/White-House-Visitor-Records-Requests/p86s-ychb/data</a>)</p>

<hr/>

<p>An entry from <em>definition-of.com</em> states:</p>

<p><strong>Chicken lover</strong> (Adult / Slang) - An adult male homosexual sexually attracted to underage males. Used somewhat derogatorily. <strong>James didn&#39;t have an actual chicken in his picture.</strong></p>

<p><em>Chicken licker</em>, is a phrase for a pedophile. </p>

<p><strong>I suppose the etymology behind this use of the word</strong> <strong><em>chicken</em></strong>, is that children have hairless bodies - similar to poultry: because in the Urban Dictionary definition for <em>chicken licker</em>, they use the hashtag <strong>#no grass on the field</strong></p>

<p><em>Chicken queen</em> - A gay man who likes young/younger boys/men. (also a pedophile) <em>(Urban Dictionary 2003)</em></p>

<p><em>Chicken hawk</em></p>

<ol>
<li>An adult gay male who pursues underage boys or young men for companionship or for sex. </li>
<li>More rarely, a child molester.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Chicken plucker</em></p>

<ol>
<li>An adult male homosexual sexually attracted to underage males. </li>
<li>Gay male who pursues anal virgins.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Chicken-fancier</em></p>

<ol>
<li>An adult male homosexual sexually attracted to underage males.</li>

<p><em>Chicken hunter</em> - An adult male homosexual sexually attracted to underage males. </p>

He asks if the baby is his. Even though he is homosexual and has no children. The person who posted the photo commented on many of James&#39; Instagram posts, his name is Christopher Boutlier, one of Washington&#39;s most influential and respected young decorators. A graduate of the George Washington University with an M.F.A. His title for the picture of the baby, was <strong>#communistparty</strong>

<p>If you think James Achilles Alefantis&#39; Instagram pictures were <strong>faked - think again</strong> - because he&#39;s already been on <strong>Fox News</strong> trying to explain some of them, in a failing floppy-mouthed way! <strong>He did talk about chicken lovers - no chickens around!</strong> He talked about chicken lovers. If you&#39;re not making the connection, I think you&#39;re slightly weird. Wanting to believe powerful people you trust are irreproachably innocent. Is this really the way you want reality to proceed in the world? Normal people accused of pedophilia have to answer to the FBI, do they? Politically powerful people accused of pedophilia have to answer to <strong>Megyn Kelly ***on</strong>* Fox News?** <strong>Is that right?</strong> If this isn&#39;t the way you want the world to be, then start being politically active, by rejecting the media which is funded by massive corporations who are raping the world.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I have no background for the origin of the Podesta&#39;s family name, but it sounds like it could be formed by an anagrammatisation, using words like pedo, and possessor.</p>

<p><strong><em>PEDOSTA</em></strong> means <strong><em>BEAST</em></strong> in the <strong><em>FINNISH</em></strong> language. Just like <em>Besta</em> means <em>Beast</em> in Spanish and Portuguese. <em>Besta</em> is also an anagram of <em>Beast</em>. And <em>Podesta</em> is an anagram of <em>Pedosta</em></p>

<p>Tony Podesta kept a sculpture inspired by the torture of one of Jeffery Dahmer&#39;s victims, by his staircase.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://archive.is/LIHTn">https://archive.is/LIHTn</a>)  - James Alefantis has the same taste in art as Tony Podesta, he posted a picture of the same headless statue inspired by Jeffery Dahmer torture, and talked about the Podestas in the comments. </p>

<p>On the 31st of January 2014, Tony Podesta sent an email to John Podesta + Mary, saying</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Subject: Last night was fun</p>

<p>James Alefantis used the same word as Tony Podesta. To describe murder : as &#39;fun&#39;. He used the hashtag of #Murder on an Instagram post, showing metal room with a light bulb in the center of the ceiling. And a stained floor.

<p><strong>A vigilante went to Comet Ping Pong with a gun.</strong> The gunman&#39;s name was Edgar Maddison Welch. He has an IMDb profile, because he&#39;s a writer and actor.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2625901/">www.imdb.com/name/nm2625901/</a>)  -  Welch</p>

<p>(<a href="https://archive.is/biWim">https://archive.is/biWim</a>) - It looks like his IMDb page was created in 2008? I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<p>Welch is a trained actor, he&#39;s been in many previous productions. Welch was involved in a propaganda psy-op, Just like Luis Burbano was playing a part in the Orlando shooting in June. It&#39;s bizarre. The FBI are not interested in Welch. He is not a Pizzagater, he must be a Hillary supporter like Luis Burbano. And Omar Mateen. So many actors involved in preposterously famous crime.</p>

<p>In 2016, gunman called Omar Mateen, went into a nightclub in Orlando, and killed around 50 people. He has an IMDb profile, because he was an actor. His acting career has been deleted by IMDb, but his profile remains. Later his dad was seen at a Hillary Clinton rally. His dad is a member of the Democratic Party in USA, and was running for the presidency of Afghanistan in 2016.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5753533/">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5753533/</a>)   Mateen</p>

<p>An eye witness called Luis Burbano, said he trapped people in the Orlando nightclub, by keeping the doors shut, so people couldn&#39;t escape. He came on TV with the story, about 30 minutes after a different eye witness called Janiel Gonzalez revealed to the public for the first time that he was in the club, and he had been trying to escape, and he said the door was being jammed by someone. He thought there was more than one gunman, mysteriously, his call got cut off on ABC live, and he he didn&#39;t get his call re-connected. 30 minutes after the call got cut off, an actor called Luis Burbano told the story how he held the doors shut so people couldn&#39;t escape, because he thought it was the right thing to do, you can visit his IMDb profile like most actors have.</p>

<p>In Podesta&#39;s emails on the 8th of October 2015, Tamera Luzzatto, sent a group email to John Podesta, and others, saying she could get her young children transported by a cheap taxi service to an outdoor party for adults, and said her children could provide further entertainment for the adults.</p>

<p>With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping up again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to the farm in Lovettsville. And I thought I’d share a couple more notes:* 
We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun, and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo)</p>

<p>In England, a children&#39;s television presenter called Jimmy Saville carried out pedophilia crimes for over twenty years, and worked for The British Broadcasting Company. Allegations were made against him, many times, and there was a small investigation which seemed to be corrupt, but it wasn&#39;t until after his death, things were properly investigated. And more victims felt safe to come out with their stories. Now his case is one of the most notorious in the world. This guy was friends with the royal family and all sorts</p>

<p>Joe Biden, Democratic politician - <strong>much like Jimmy Savile</strong> - has inappropriately touched children. He was filmed getting physical with children that weren&#39;t his. <em>Stroking hair, whispering in children&#39;s ears, pressing his nose and head against theirs, kissing their ears when they&#39;re not looking. Putting his arm round the waist of a young girl, grabbing her arm, pulling her towards him. Repeatedly touching a girl&#39;s breast</em> who is less than ten years old at the time of filming.</p>

<p>California and Virginia are the top two states in the United States for missing children. Hollywood in California and Washington D.C in Virginia, have the most allegations against them for huge pedophile rings led by rich people.</p>

<p>California has a population of around 39 million, it has the highest amount of missing Children
Virginia has a population of around 8 million, and it has a higher amount of missing children, than 10 other, more populated states.</p>

<p>419 <strong>Children are missing in Virginia, some of them would be or would have been adults now</strong></p>

<p><strong>Even though Virginia is behind California in the actual amount of missing children, your children are 327% more likely to go missing in Virginia than in California. But Virginia is 396% above the national average for the rate of missing children. If you have a child and you&#39;re living in Virginia, your child is historically four times more likely to go missing than the average place in The United States of America</strong></p>

<p>74 children went missing in Virginia in November 2016, the month of the election. It was a stressful month for the politicians who reside in Washington D.C. Out of all the children missing in Virginia, 17% of them went missing all in the space of the 30 days of November 2016.</p>

<p>You can search for the number of children missing in every state in the United States if you go to the Missingkids.org search page, and leave every field blank, except the state</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.missingkids.org/Search">www.missingkids.org/Search</a>)</p>

<p>Since collecting these statistics on the 9th of December 2016. Oddly, the number of missing kids in Virginia, was 419 - reviewing the site on the <em>21st of December 2016</em>, there are now only 387 cases in Virginia. I&#39;m not sure if it is normal that the number of missing children cases in a state, <strong>drops by 32 in a matter of 12 days</strong></p>

<p>In 2016, Elijah Wood, an actor, said he thought that Hollywood had a massive pedophile problem, and he said Hollywood&#39;s alleged pedophile ring&#39;s similar to the case of Savile in the UK  </p>

<p>Corey Feldman, an ex child actor in Hollywood said he was sexually abused, and he has given interviews discussing it -(<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3606016/Lord-Rings-star-Elijah-Wood-tracks-comments-Hollywood-pedophile-ring-claims-words-taken-context-insists-no-hand-experience-predatory-vipers.html">www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3606016/Lord-Rings-star-Elijah-Wood-tracks-comments-Hollywood-pedophile-ring-claims-words-taken-context-insists-no-hand-experience-predatory-vipers.html</a>)</p>

<p>In 1991, there was a parallel case, as described in Pizzagate, <strong><em>The Franklin Investigation</em></strong> child abuse and pedophilia ring, involving Larry King. A documentary by Yorkshire TV based in the UK was made in 1993. The filmmakers were in the final editing stage of the documentary when the Discovery Channel suddenly withdrew support for the project. To this day the documentary remains unaired. The scandal involves U.S politicians trying to cover-up the story and some witnesses to the crimes were killed.</p>

<p>May 2007, Madeleine Mcann, a three year-old girl went missing. She was on holiday in Portugal. October 2013, 2 E-fits for the man who kidnapped Madeleine McCann were released to the public. One of the E-fits is an almost perfect match to John Podesta,</p>

<p><strong>I can debunk the rumour with 3 extra documents</strong>. While, Aaric Eisenstein&#39;s &quot;waitresses,&quot; in quotation marks, may have sexual connotations, and say something weird about the last pizza/hot dog party. This one, is just about hot dogs, not stripper-prostitute-waitresses.</p>

<p>You have to read these e-mail threads, from bottom to top, on their pages</p>

<p>People who went to the party, had left quarter of an hour after the entrance.</p>

<p>James Alefantis is not just anagrammatically similar to &quot;j&#39;aime l&#39;enfants&quot;, infact they both use the exact same letters if you throw them around. </p>

<p>And the #Chickenlovers instagram pic with the dark haired man and a baby where both are wearing the yellow necklace is NOT James Alefantis but someone else.</p>

It uses the same letters, but there is an extra &#39;a&#39; &amp; &#39;s&#39;</p>

<p>If you say Jaime Alefantis, it has an extra &#39;i&#39; and &#39;a&#39;.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The NYPD stuff could have been a false rumour. But I think it&#39;s more likely that someone hasn&#39;t had the guts yet.</p></li>
<li><p>No answer - same as above.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe the FBI and NYPD are both corrupt at the top. A pyramid power structure, with the most corrupt people at the top. James Comey admitted that Hillary Clinton said false information to the FBI on many occasions. And yet she stayed free as a bird. Other people have been prosecuted just for lying.</p></li>
<li><p>Welch is a trained actor, he&#39;s been in many previous productions. Welch was involved in a propaganda psy-op, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2625901/">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2625901/</a>
Just like Luis Burbano was playing a part in the Orlando shooting in June. It&#39;s bizarre.
The FBI are not interested in Welch. He is not a Pizzagater, he must be a Hillary supporter like Luis Burbano. And Omar Mateen. So many actors involved in preposterously famous crime</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I can remember seeing a news story several years ago about westerners, including Americans, traveling to Cambodia to have sex with child prostitutes. &quot;Boom boom&quot; was used by the children to mean sexual intercourse and &quot;yum yum&quot; was used for fellatio. &quot;La Boum Boum Room&quot; seems to be an obvious &quot;French&quot; play of words off of this. In French, boum, is used in two contexts. The first, it is just like its English equivalent, &quot;boom&quot; (meaning a literal boom or a bang), but it is also used informally to mean a &quot;party.&quot; The fact that it is &quot;La Boum Boum Room&quot; and not &quot;La Boum Room&quot; one could more reasonably infer that the former definition is more likely with its obvious connection with child prostitution. Plus, I was curious if anyone has ever looked into whether James Alefantis is indeed his birth name, or if it is possible that he was born with a different name and had it legally changed? </p>
