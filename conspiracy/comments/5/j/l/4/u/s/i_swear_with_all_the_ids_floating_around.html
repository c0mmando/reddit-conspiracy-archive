       The problem with this theory is bush, clinton and their CIA effectively started the whole Isis extremist movement, then they armed them and funded them to help destabilize the country and get a foot hold in a the government but this plan is now failing and their losing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has come along as has said from the start that he would eliminate them the same way Russian is going at it. The US are now trying to stop Russia helping Asad, even thou Syrians are celebrating in the streets at the small victories there having in the campaign.
Current US government just want to protect ISIS by saying their stopping russia and syria from bombing civilians and their hospitals. Alot of the media reports have been proven repeated reports from years back. War propaganda at its best, now labeled 'Fake news'

       Everything can be a ruse that makes the people angry at Islam and gives the green light to take them out. If we all think they are terrorists then nobody will be left to call out acts against human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: the only hole I can find in my theory is why the media is not reporting on it. All I can think of is that they are preparing for the atrocities and since we are used to not seeing terrorism on the news, we will not see them being taken out either.

       Avoid the news since it is fake and it will fill your head with fake. It is steering your perception about groups of people and specific individuals and events.

       Maybe a poor choice of words but no religion is eradicated. It can be lessened in its intensity, perhaps, and altered to where people don't hold to their religious beliefs like they are they Absolute truth. Extremism is just that. A belief in an absolute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though history shows the impermanence of any and all perceptions and beliefs, yet, somehow we became so reliant on some of them to the exclusion of any others.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's really about how we hold our beliefs, not just one particular religion, either, all exhibit some form of absolutism.

       the Soviets in USSR tried to eradicate the Orthodox church through terror and murder and suppression, all the way up to the 80s.
      </p>
      <p>
       they failed miserably , even tho they murder tens of thousands. the church survived and came back.

       this is naive wishful thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       all of this is being done to make us angry. to make us scared. to make us DEMAND that the government take action.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND THEY WILL.
      </p>
      <p>
       they will enforce more oversight &amp; scrutiny over cash &amp; gold transactions (believe this has been passed now or now being discussed in EU) to "stop Terrorist financing".
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality this will just lead to a government controlled &amp; tracked electronic currency only.
      </p>
      <p>
       they will institute ever more surveillance &amp; spying into citizens. this will be under the auspices of "tracking the bad guys" when in reality it will be used to shut down any and all descent once things start to get really dark in 10 or so years.
      </p>
      <p>
       finally they will institute ever more federalization &amp; globalisation. European wide new police forces, armies, intelligence agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will be under the auspices of "better collaboration" etc but in reality this will just be eroding nation states MAIN responsibilities of defending their own citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       once you have common armies, common policies, electronic currencies, no borders etc, at some point What will be the point of being "individual nations" ?
      </p>
      <p>
       eventually all we will be left with as a reminder is our national sports teams.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is my firm belief that there is no such thing as independent successful terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is either manufactured or coopted or simply allowed (and subtly pushed &amp; nudged) by TPTB / intel agencies to fulfill the desired reaction from the people and have them demand themselves that their freedoms are taken away.
      </p>
      <p>
       in reality the only solution is MASS deportation. I have a longer fuller post where i outline 6-7 steps to stop all of this but to sum it up: deport all refugees / asylum seekers and anyone who didnt arrive in the country via proper vetting / immigration paths. second part is to get rid of the EU and have every country protect its own borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       its BS and laughable that were more secure when supposedly we have one "super secure" outer border and nothing in between on the inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       not that the coastline/greek border is at all secure either way.

       Ya, they want us to hate Arabs. The Arabs are a bit difficult to control in the middle east and they hate that. Arabs believe in free will and anyone who tries to violate that via military will be met by Arab counter forces. They think they can genocide them but it takes way to long to do that. They killed at least a million since 9-11.
