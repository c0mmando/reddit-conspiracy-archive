       Let me preface this by saying that I am in no way "in" on this. I do not know what is going on on the inside of this operation or the technical details relating to it. I am merely a lurker trying to find as much information as possible and help decentralize the effort. A message for those claiming this is a LARP:
       <em>
        This would have to be the most impressive role-play I've seen. It has gone on for months and has substantial evidence backing it up. If you have any new information disproving this effort, feel free to post it everywhere you can. If you base your claim solely on how seemingly unbelievable it is, kindly share your opinion but don't claim to know more than anyone else.

       It has become apparent that Wikileaks is compromised. No proof of life has been provided for Julian Assange in over two months after repeated demands. The Wikileaks.org website has been changing constantly with files being manipulated and deleted. We can't let this go unnoticed.

       Here is the explanation of
       <strong>
        why the information cannot be publicly distributed.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        because xkeyscore exists and if you find the files or try to share them while you're online you internet is instakill. doesnt matter how many proxies and underwater vpns you have there's plenty of hardware backdoors to fuck your shit up. if you try to post them you will just insta ded that site. not even the max level shills can explain how deep af darkweb sites that are made just for this go down as soon as that content hits them. everyone ended up in here not because they wanted to hide but cause they flat out could not make a thread that lasted more than 2 minutes on any other site. this aint no game. and when this thread is found and flooded all evidence of this shit will disappear from normies forever. thats why most people in this shit are from other countries now.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those who consider this "fairy-tales," can you please explain why it is impossible for the CIA to accomplish this? I, for one, do not understand the full capabilities of the CIA and would not be surprised if this were true given how much is at stake here.
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/RRQci">
        This
       </a>
       is an excerpt from the July 7 FBIanon thread where someone asked what would happen if he tried leaking the info.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Silencing and/or death. Some places are trying to leak but we censor too fast.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, because the information cannot be published and distributed publicly, we must decentralize the effort and extract the keys and hashes ourselves. This is what the endchan folks have been doing for two months. The media has been distracting everyone with the Russian hack propaganda, potentially preparing for something big. We know we've been lied to for years. It's time to uncover the truth.
       <strong>
        If you have a PC and have a reasonable understanding of the blockchain and have the time, PLEASE contribute.
       </strong>
       The guidelines to doing this yourself are in the third thread. Please do not spam the thread with questions. Read it, do some exploring and research on the subject, download the blockchain, grab some friends, and start digging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others have pointed out to me that we have to remind people of what they're getting into and the potential consequences of getting personally involved. I agree that it is essential to understand who and what we are up against. However, I do not think that we should be afraid. The only way they control us is with fear. They intimidate, insult, scare, distract, and censor any potentially dangerous idea. Don't let them. Let the facts speak for themselves.
       <em>
        The CIA and other groups censoring this information have been acting unconstitutionally for years, rendering their threats useless.
       </em>
       This is it, guys. Don't fall in line. Never give up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was just posted on the third thread, I think it's worth a look.

        we won. The information is out and slowly being spread. every time a group loses connection, five more groups jump in. this has been going on for three months and a lot of people are really angry and emotional about it. this is why a lot of the holding groups react very aggressively when asked to explain certain things. this is because most of them have had friends they've known for years go silent and are tired of explaining it to people that don't believe them. at this point there is too much evidence of everything that is going on and when people find out about it they naturally want to help. group 1 had a pretty clever system to make sure the information never dies. people are finding everything independently. it's just a matter of time. making it public will be very hard and will require a lot of people working together but it will happen. they would have to kill the internet for a long time and wipe everyone's computer. there's no way to stop it.
       </p>
       <p>
        they lost this war the moment they silenced group 1. the people that were around that day and made it simply do not give a fuck anymore. people stopped being scared and got organized. now the information is permanently encoded in several places. the teams working today now know how to permanently encode their progress. there's no stopping this.

       I hope this post is helpful for those completely lost in this growing topic, and can point anyone looking to expose the truth and uphold justice in the right direction. There is much more to this than what I have put in this post, please do not be discouraged by any information you may have a preconceived notion against.

       Fuck yeah man! Last night was it for me. I know these guys are on the brink of something monumental and it just needs to get out there. The increasing censorship occurring on the Internet is unprecedented. I think that it is a response to Trump's election win by the CIA or whatever. They had us loosely in their grasp, and now that we are slipping out, they're trying to grasp tighter. Same goes to you hombre, stay safe, stay vigilant, and most importantly don't fear. That's what really gives them control.

       I upvoted you if that helps.  There's a lot of hysteria, groupthink, psy-ops, and lack of critical thinking right now.  Low signal to noise ratio.  The masses are fooled, and the people that think they are awake are also being used.

       Don't worry, in a matter of days, information from the insurance files decrypted via blockchain keys will be making it's way to the mainstream. After that, I have a feeling you may redefine your definition of the word hideous. Or maybe you won't, I've underestimated stupidity before.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not be a shill, but you still don't know what the fuck is what. You may have good intentions, but I'm telling you, do your research and learn the truth. The path to hell is paved with good intentions, my chakra friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll take being guilty of name-calling day -in and day-out rather than do what you're doing. Calling me an agent provocateur. I can only assume you're trying to discredit the blockchain discoveries taking place by the hour. Your intentions might be good, but I promise you, your message is as ill-informed as you are.

       They have already been found. Many will get bored. Fact is, it's really not all that complicated once you follow every piece of instructions that are fairly easily available. The instructions hit the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for christ's sake. The learning curve even for a normie is not that steep, and every step of the process is covered by the Freedom of Information Act and surely more laws. Nothing involved is "hacking" or illegal in any way.

      <p>
       The insurance files are not just his lottery ticket. His life (as it was) depended on them. Simply put, he wouldn't allow for them to be opened en mass if he were alive and well.  It also wouldn't be possible if his DMS (dead man's switch) weren't activated. Let me explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to assume you have knowledge of events surrounding assange since Oct. 17. If not, you can find quality posts on the timeline that more or less get everything right - with the exception of the blockchain revelation that is finally becoming more popular. (Remember, reddit,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is essentially MSM of the internet. I don't mean that in a strictly derogatory way - I like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       enough. Just want to give you an analogy that's relatively close) Anyway, research the Assange timeline since Oct. 17 if you have to before reading further.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Assange knows Kerry is coming to Ecuador, dumps the hashes. They are essentially bookmarks in a set of information, it's a message that says "here's what's going to happen if you shut me down". It is a way of maintaining credibility. Use your imagination for a second, and say for example I claim to you that I took your dog hostage. I can say it to you on the phone all day long, but you'll be a lot more convinced if I sent you time stamped pictures of your dog. Then later on I take your brother's dog hostage. He knows that I'm just making the claim and it might be BS, but I was right before. I am more credible and powerful, and my "blackmail" works better. Assange releasing hashes was a real, credible, reminder to John Kerry that he has damaging information on him and many many more.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll read, or remember, shortly after the "Assange was taken" wave of news that many started believing wikileaks was compromised, many pointed out that
       <strong>
        the wikileaks Bitcoin Wallet was emptied
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The blockchain
       <strong>
        IS
       </strong>
       the dead man's switch. Watch the video I posted to get a tl;dr of Julian Assange's thoughts on bitcoin and it's easy to see that he is a massive proponent of it, and he's not excited about it just because it's an online currency and he just loves computers. He's an information guy, and bitcoin is the most permanent way that anyone can "write the history books" so to speak. The transactions that flooded out of the Wikileaks wallet contain the keys to the insurance files in the bitcoin blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen to him talk about the permanence of information. Bitcoin blockchain is the most permanent place for information on the internet today. There is no other medium that Assange's DMS would have been communicated through.

       Don't be mistaken, reddit has the most shills, but 4chan and really any public easily accessible discussion area has them. These are the 'chokepoints' so to speak. Very valuable places to place bots/shills/ and ideas that are disinformation. I can only recommend that you listen to all sides, but don't believe what anyone "wants" you to. Listen to their side and that's in. You will know what you believe when you get there. You don't have to decide until you have decided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway there is still a lot of truth to xkeyscore. I'm not even convinced that it or knowledge of the NSA's full toolbelt is in the public domain. There's a lot of possiblities that I don't know the extent of but I have some faith in due to evidence that I've seen in search groups "going dark" as they near the keys. Ultimately, a large number of people investigating the blockchain are a terribly unorganized group against a highly effective opponent.

       There's nothing illegal or even immoral about it. It's essentially the same as digging through a trashcan trying to find a receipt that has a hot waitress's number on it. Why would anyone care so much to stop you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't want to explain much more, I just recommend you find out for yourself if you're curious. It's not that difficult or illegal.

       Ps. and find out how to set up meshnet if you're interested in using your computer to communicate once the internet is off.

       Did you read through that thread? Your post is a gross exaggeration of reality. I'm sure I'm not the only one who sees that almost every post of yours has some type of straw man, or ad hominem.

       A lot of evidence in favor of keys in blockchain right there in that thread.

       A lot of evidence against blockchain, as well. I concede that I'm no longer convinced. BUT, I still am not sure how you're convinced that it's not legit.

       It is entirely possible the key could be purposefully put in the blockchain...  But when you have 110GBs of random text there is a good chance anything else could be in there too though. This is akin to the monkeys with the typewriters... trust your gut instinct... the whole fucking thing stinks. As much as a fun little treasure hunt this is there won't be any payoff... this is a new age hybrid LARP/ARG... I'm stupid enough to be playing the game right now by arguing against it... thats all they want... actors and a riveted audience... I'm playing the game too... and I'm what some in the "public" would call a "bad actor".... those insurance files are the crown jewels of the internet right now... a shiny gem in the royal bitcoin crown... I'll post 506 times if it keeps other people from wasting their time pursuing this nonsense. It looks like horseshit... don't do what these people are trying to get you to do with your computer.

       Agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd even venture to say that in 110GB of data strictly in text format it's likely that the keys are in there strictly from a probability standpoint. I know what you mean, the feeling of being a bad actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to not respond, we are in agreement for the most part but I am curious: what do you think the motive is to get people to dig like that? Do you think they would do it to essentially create lists/tiers of people separated by technical capabilities? That's my first thought at what the goal would be.

       I honestly have no idea... Thats what keeps me commenting on this... I need to suss out more info... I don't have enough of a tech background to uncover the motivations where I'm at... gotta go with psychology... I don't know if they are just doing it for the lulz... or forcing good people to the darkweb to increase signal to noise ratio there because of Rule 51... using the public to find the keys for someone else... compromising users PC/accounts... reestablishing the demolished botnet... mining bitcoins for someone else... DDoSing? I don't know... I just know it stinks... and in the end if JA is alive... and the public finds his keys... then he is dead.

       This story doesn't hold water, at least not the part about the keys being discovered.  Let's say that people have the keys to the US/UK/EC insurance files and they can't post them in plain text because of some incredible low-level internet mechanism.  Why don't they just, say, encrypt the keys, and then post the resulting hash along with the encryption method and key?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have they also blocked all conceivable hashes of the key?  Then just add something: "The key is: #### purple monkey dishwasher" and encrypt that string, and you get something totally unrecognizable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a very exciting story and the idea of storing information in the blockchain is interesting.  But if multiple people had the keys it would be trivial to spread them unless the internet went down completely.

       It doesn't matter about the capabilities of the organizations, what matters are the capabilities of mathematics itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could they possibly be blocking all ways of communicating the key? It's not just difficult, it's
       <strong>
        impossible
       </strong>
       given that mathematically speaking with encryption and a key it's possible to convert or permute any one piece of data into another. They can't possibly censor every encryption scheme, every encoding, every possible permutation of the key...
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if, somehow, they COULD censor every existing scheme - a post could literally just say something like "swap every 2nd and 4th characters". They've just created a new method of permuting that data, however simple. How do automated tools figure that out?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, unless they censor literally
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       data (and I mean all), there's no way to automatically censor these keys. They can censor the raw keys in UTF8/ASCII, perhaps, but they cannot censor an encrypted key, regardless of the "capabilities" of the organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly I find that argument to just be a workaround. No matter for mathematical proofs, anybody can come along and say "all that evidence is faked, you just don't understand the capabilities of the organizations hiding this information"...

       Did you read the xkeyscore document? They flag you as soon as you start looking into the stuff. The moment you even obtain it while being connected to the Internet, they have full power to backdoor all of your shit and not allow anything to get out. I can link you another document on backdoors used by the NSA if you're willing to accept new information. It's the Snowden doc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said this was automated tools. That is not necessarily true. This event is life or death for these organizations. There are several giant black box NSA and other organization buildings that contain spies shilling and censoring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just read the documents. They've built backdoors into your internet connection. The moment you even acquire the keys, they have full capability to wipe your connection and any progress you may have made. That's why there were the first two happenings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you could encrypt the key, before you could do anything with it, if you're not offline and secure, you lose everything. That's what I got from their explanations. Don't let your predetermined notions of the resources of intelligence agencies hang you up. If you want to validate or disprove this, follow the instructions and try it yourself.

       I understand the infinite possibilities of how to distribute he keys. I think the folks with the keys are working out a more reliable and fool proof distribution method. I hope. Otherwise, you can follow the steps with Python and try your luck.

       Just posting to clear up some misconceptions about Bitcoin and blockchains. Specifically, in this text and in the screenshots they link to:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Here is the number of transactions waiting to be confirmed over time. The spikes indicate attempts to delete and alter the information in the blockchain. Here is the concise summary of events over time provided by anon on Endchan.xyz. Here are the threads with all of the information.
       </p>
       <p>
        The spikes indicate attempts to delete and alter the information in the blockchain.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is plainly false. The spikes in the linked graph represent an increased number of transactions, most likely spam attacks. This is normal and happens very often. More importantly, once information is 'in' the Bitcoin blockchain it can not be altered or deleted. Each transaction is 'added' to the blockchain which is a verifiable record of all transactions. A competing version of the blockchain with different transactions could replace the current one with total consensus of the network. However, this hasn't happened.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "blockchain is attacked. lots of stuff gets deleted."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       See above. Also, the Bitcoin blockchain is always under attack. By storing $13 billion in value, it is essentially the world's largest bug bounty.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "someone finds the wikileaks backups in the blockchain and posts instructions and code to decode the data."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The 'backups' and 'data' are not stored in the Bitcoin blockchain. They are too big. What would be stored are hashes that act as fingerprints and/or addresses for the data and, perhaps, decryption keys.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "the blockchain is flooded. mempool graphs now have a giant spike on oct 27. soft fork for bitcoin begins.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These things are almost certainly entirely unrelated - to Wikileaks and to each other. The Bitcoin soft fork is a scheduled upgrade planned and developed for several years.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "irs asks bitcoin to give them the identities of all transactions."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is the most troublesome misconception. The IRS requested the identities of customers of a company called Coinbase that provides Bitcoin-related services. Saying the 'irs asks bitcoin' is like saying the irs asks email. They are protocols.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "copies of the blockchain start showing 'undecodable' or empty transactions not seen before"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is so wrong as to be a meaningless sentence. A blockchain isn't 'encoded'. A transaction can't be 'empty'.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "it seems like they tried to push to blockchain but apparently the data did not make it in"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       One of the beautiful things about Bitcoin is that once you broadcast a transaction, it
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       end up in the blockchain. Unless, of course, you are 100% MitM'd with zero access to the public internet.

       Thanks for sticking to the facts. As someone that has contributed code to parse the BlockChain, and even got my code linked on that endchan post, it's good to see some level headed people rather than the obvious disinfo. It's obvious to anyone understanding how the BlockChain works that there's a high level of larping going on. Regardless of this though, a minor inaccuracy in your post:
      </p>
      <p>
       Transactions aren't guaranteed to be processed when posted. It depends how much transactional fees you're willing to commit. Technically you can post 0 BTC transactional fee transactions and they could be indefinitely delayed if the blocks gets constantly filled to the max. In fact, I am not aware of any security in place in the BlockChain protocol against people posting trillions of those transactions in the vain (?) hope to overload the servers handling them. Technically they're valid transactions.

       I thought I might get away with:

      <p>
       As time approaches infinity, probability of transaction being included approaches 1 (all else being equal). Therefore,
       <em>

       probability equals 1.

       No one is claiming the backups for documents are in the blockchain, just the keys and hashes. You make some reasonable arguments, but the spikes seen recently are much larger than any in the last year. I would call them more abnormal than normal. No one claimed the soft fork was related, he merely stated that it happened. I think he probably meant orphaned blocks as empty transactions.

       You're right. Thanks for clearing that up.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to the spikes, they're almost certainly due to conflict over the soft fork. I can't think of any reason they would be related to the wikileaks insurance files and related events.

       So, I have some questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Where do people get the insurance files?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What is the command line to check the hash?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What is the command line to try an encryption key?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If some keys are known, can't they just post them in image files with minor obfuscation?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I have the original insurance files from torrenting them when they first came out. But, I think they need to be in as many hands as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have the background info saved into this png, which is safe, it is just endchan threads.

      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how much I can believe of these groups shutting down, because if I had the keys, I would drive two towns over to a library and start posting image files on the slowest moving chans with the keys. If they start shutting down the sites, then I would rethink my strategy, but I think that would be legitimately impossible to stop the spread, even if it was only up for a couple of hours in a few places.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had the keys, I would give them to my lawyer and try to get them out. The Pentagon Papers resulted in a Supreme Court ruling where posting information that has already been leaked is protected under the First Amendment.
      </p>
      <p>

       Excellent critical thinking... if so many people were tech savvy enough to open the insurance files... they would also be tech savvy enough to relay the information in a fashion that would let the public view it... instead they are trying to get you to install software on your computer so you can do it too. Phishing for account logon info as their botnet gets dismantled... pandering to the very accounts they hope to compromise... and downvoting my "conspiracy theories" against the operation in a fashion very reminiscent of classic CTR shills... whilst pushing these topics to the front of this sub despite lack of interest.

       I read it... I don't see why someone can't open the files offline... save a screenshot of the keys/data in a gif... then upload the image file to  every piece of social media in a short span... it would get out in the wild so quick... unless they took down everyone on twitter that saw it too...

       I wanna know cause everyone is casually talking about doing it offline... so you'd have to download the whole thing to do that unless everyone coordinated into chunks. This just seems like looking for a needle that probably doesn't exist in all of the haystacks in the world.

       But for him to do this he would have to assume that his DMS would not properly function... but at the same time know no one would stumble upon the keys until
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       her was actually dead... because his insurance would be useless if the files were opened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd assume he'd have a better way to get the info out if he wanted it out... backup DMS... layers of redundancies...  trusted accomplices... also with DMS that trigger in conjunction. Seems dumb to have 2 contingencies... one easily fallible...  and one so fuckin batshit insane that it would take a million Neo/Rainman hybrids forever to hope to access it... a cubed root away from literally bruteforcing it.

       But unless these footsoldiers are all 100% sure he is dead... then publically releasing his insurance files will pretty much sign his death warrant... anyone could just bomb the embassy and be done with him. Supposedly those files are the only reason he is alive to this day.

       I've been saying for a while now that someone has purposefully created a "Schrodinger's Assange" where no one knows if he is alive or dead... but if you open the files... he's dead for sure.

       There are files in the blockchain.  The decoding tutorial linked above shows you exactly how to build cablegate.zip from it.

      <p>
       These two questions highlight your ignorance of the subject matter. If you don't have a basic understanding of how files can be stored via the blockchain, and whether the method of storage is "safe", you should probably steer clear of any threads about this stuff.
      </p>

       You can even store files in Reddit posts, ffs. Example:

       OK, now, wait—I know a reasonable amount about Bitcoin and I thought each transaction was just a value with a new public key. It's 26 or 72 characters or something (making that part up), isn't it?

       I'm just asking to make sure your comment actually includes blockchain, and specifically the Bitcoin blockchain. Just trying to wrap my head around that.

       Oh, man, I almost posted that exact link, but it wasn't clear to me—40 bytes doesn't sound like much. Could it store, say, 500mb or something? And the UXTO's aren't persistent. Doesn't that mean that Core could, let's say, make a new client that prunes out whatever they don't want stored for all time? Or am I off base...

       Not quite so simple.  If you download the BitCoin wallet/client, it will take over a week to download and index the entire blockchain.  Meanwhile, it will consume most of the processing capability of your computer.

       Yes, but when it's hammering your Disk I/O at 100% for hours upon hours, and you don't have a server-level hard disk drive, you won't be able to use that computer for any thing else.

       13 billion real dollars? Or 13 billion fake internet dollars that are only valuable while they are trendy and can be used to buy drugs... BitCoins are gonna be like Beanie Babies... get out now cause the whole thing is fake and the bottom will fall out soon.

       This might shock you but there are many good reasons to use bitcoin. It allows low-fees transfers of money. While this may not sound like much, just that alone is massive. There's many people in impoverished countries that go work in other countries, and want to send money back to their families. But instead of paying the ridiculous fees banks or money transfer methods charge (like western union), you can get by for about 17 penny per transaction regardless of amount.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you believe or not it is worth anything is irrelevant. It's a speculative value. The market cap is over 13 billion usd today. You can even find bitcoin atms in most big cities. It's very liquid contrary to popular belief. It can certainly lose value, but if all you use it is for sending real cash to someone else through bitcoin (that they then convert back), what it's worth is doesn't matter if you exchange it immediately; its purpose was already done. There's also something to be said about currencies going through hyper inflation like Venezuela, where their biggest bill is worth 3 cents usd. If you knew all your life investments were in vénézuélian currency, and that it kept losing 50% of its value every year (to give an example), any smart man would gladly decide to ironically use bitcoins as a more stable currency. Unlike all non-cryptocurrencies, bitcoin has a guarantee of both non-forgery as well as a maximum of 21 million bitcoins ever generated ever. No more can be generated. It cannot inflate in value through overproduction because it's rate is predetermined.

       Explain how Bitcoin is fake and then explain how Beanie Babies are fake. Is this a serious post?  And if it is, did you just crawl out from under a rock that fell on you 7 years ago?  Btw Satoshi Nakamoto created btc.

       A bitcoin primer, even though I believe you know more than you admit to.
Bitcoin is fiat money, the US dollar is fiat money.  In 2015 the number of merchandisers accepting Bitcoin surpassed 100,000.   Your beanie baby example is no different than stocks in the stock market, or capitalism, or anything for that matter, if people lose interest they do not retain value.  I could go on, but I don't believe you are actually as uninformed as your post suggests.  I think perhaps you just enjoy wasting people's time by getting them to write long posts with proper documentation.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, because I can't think of a better explanation, yet I can't believe someone would actually do that.

       If my competition can pose as a child that doesn't speak English very well... then I can pose as a self-aware conspiracy theorist AI script... Thats the ultimate in winning... so say you are an AI and still convince people otherwise... They'd never suspect that approach.

       "Encryption" is just a math function.

       is a good example of an encryption your kid can crack (without knowing the key) if given the tools. Now I don't want to dwell into cryptanalysis but encryption is considered safe, because the time someone would need to crack it without knowing the key is discouraging. You can be sure there are loopholes in the encryption protocols and if anybody knows them that's the alphabet. Remember how the FBI told apple: "Nah fam, we cracked it ourselves". Needless to say, the encryption apple was using was top-notch (google the details).
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition and as a final note: if this was LARPing it wouldn't get censored from everywhere (threads with instructions) and if you had seen one of those threads, you could clearly detect CTR shilling patterns. To me, that screams as something worth investigating.

       The complete question has 2 possible answers:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         If they are using loopholes into the encryption system
         <strong>
          or
         </strong>
         if the CPUs produced after 2000-2004 have backdoors then they are cracking it real time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If xkeyscore is analyzing the data through learning patterns it would not be in real time, but rather based on cryptanalysis of each individual file.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Also if you are going to assume they
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       do something and not back that with facts, this is the wrong sub to be.

       You need to understand how the blockchain works to realize it is almost impossible to compromise it. The only possible way to do that is to replace it, which would require every single bitcoin client to agree that the new blockchain is indeed the real one. Since the decision is made by algorithms and probability is a factor, it is very unlikely to happen.

       You see, this topic is like the debate over religion. Some people demand proof it exists, the others proof it doesn't. It's really your guts, so if you want to help start downloading the BC and investigating. It's not like you have any other leads (except for pizza-related maps, evidence of which was WIPED from the internet as it started gaining traction).

       All of this should be protected under the First Amendment. Problem is how incredibly damning the evidence is. This will not stop until it hits a critical point of public acceptance and awareness. According to the thread, for every group that gets shut down, 5 more start contributing. I think they have probably formulated a better plan than to try to spread it publicly on the internet. We'll see. I think this is only the beginning, honestly.

       If you know how to do that, then you'd understand that hackers have scripts, algorithms and executable programs that can all tie together. This means, one program (they) could, search, match, delete, corrupt client disc etc. Spy agencies are about ten years ahead of that, so they likely have damn near general AI when it comes to hacking and infosec.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keys or data posted that these agencies do not want posted, might appear for a few microseconds to another client, if you're lucky.

      <p>
       That being said, I am not saying it cannot be done, but different programs, uncompromised applications, plus non-infiltrated encrypted chat groups would need to be used.

       This is literally jumping through hoops, so you can possess evidence against people in the highest positions of power, who are practically above the law because either they head up a major gov agency, or an allied government (seriously), or they are friends with someone who does.

       These same people have the resources to erase data off the Internet. That's how powerful they are, but this is how powerful information in the right hands becomes.

       Even if you don't crack this blockchain puzzle, we are still witnessing their demise. FBI agents already possess this evidence, they just cannot press charges, again because the sick !&amp;$#$ running our governments are truly that well connected, getting investigations squashed like cancelling a lunch appointment.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have deep and hardened spiderweb connections on their side, that will take many years to snap and unravel and implicate all associates, but thanks to the work of Snowden and Assange, we have the unfettered momentum of undying packets of information on our side to bring down their house of cards. The very top few cards have already started falling.

       They've beat us at our own game.  What do you do when the main game now is to create and stoke false conspiracies rather than hide the real ones?

Why can't they share the keys as an image file ?

       I went through your posts quick. I don't know nearly enough about the block chain mission to say one way or the other. But you seem to just go around name-calling anyone who is trying to explain it. You don't provide any type of facts, experience, or anything besides stupid analogies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think they look like idiots, you should read your own posts and realize that nobody is taking you seriously. And if you are so knowledgeable on the topic that the people searching block chain are as stupid as you make them out to be,  it should be VERY VERY easy for you to make a decent post that quickly explains that much and has the tiniest bit of evidence.

       He is making a very valid point: xKeyscore is insufficient explanation for why the keys could not be distributed if they were indeed found. There are literally infinite ways  to do so while avoiding automated censorship tools.

       Because of xkeyscore (a NSA surveillance tool, check WP):
      </p>
      <p>
       "because xkeyscore exists and if you find the files or try to share them while you're online you internet is instakill. doesnt matter how many proxies and underwater vpns you have there's plenty of hardware backdoors to fuck your shit up. if you try to post them you will just insta ded that site. not even the max level shills can explain how deep af darkweb sites that are made just for this go down as soon as that content hits them. everyone ended up in here not because they wanted to hide but cause they flat out could not make a thread that lasted more than 2 minutes on any other site. this aint no game. and when this thread is found and flooded all evidence of this shit will disappear from normies forever. thats why most people in this shit are from other countries now."
      </p>
      <p>
       "late oct: people figure out that unlocking the data gets you xkeyscored'd making you lose internet connection and makes sites get attacked if the stuff is not deleted."
      </p>
      <p>
       "tl;dr blockchain has backups for all wikileaks files since 2013. it also has checksum hashes and upload proofs for all files. there is a lot of stuff in there that triggers xkeyscore or echelon and is virtually impossible to share or even talk about. three months have been spent trying to teach others how to recreate the steps. there is a noticeable pattern. group finds it, start teaching others how to do it, then everything is deleted and people go silent. then a new group finds the breadcrums and starts over. it's not clear what happened yesterday or what will happen next but there are people from all the world trying to investigate. at this point and there is no part of the internet where it is allowed."

      </p>
      <p>
       That does not put me at ease. I haven't ever gotten any texts like that. Didn't touch that shit and texted back fuck off. I looked up secretyvid on google, but didn't click any links and was reading the description thing below the links, and it looked like it was referencing some sort of underage sex or something. If the CIA is trying to plant CP on me, that's not cool at all.

       Yeah let's all go to some darknet sites and download and run some scripts and .exes. I'm sure that will turn out well. Finding the key to the Wikileaks insurance files (which obviously is on there) is much more likely than getting a virus or ten.

       But what about this? It seems the files themselves are mislabeled aes256. And are in fact a different form of encryption..

       Yeah didn't realise till after I posted this but the point is that we have tried..and it doesn't work. One because there is no keys that work yet but even if they did the decrytion software you use has to match up. First things first, no one will be able to decrypt them if we don't first know what type of software was used. Just hoping anyone can answer this because it is a crutial step in the process that if looked over will not unlock the files.

       I hope someone can answer that too. That's the only problem I've heard, but it shouldn't discourage anyone from trying. This is a real effort and it's not dying. The problem should be addressed if more people recognize it.

       You're right the more people that work on it the better chance of it happening, as far as the bitcoin blockchain is concerned. If the keys get released and people run into an issue unlocking them, just keep this in mind.

       Fucking christ, really? It's so obvious how they're censoring and manipulating votes. Every goddamn week a couple threads that lack real substance make it to r/all just so CTR can brigade the hell out of it and discredit the sub in general and anyone who uses it. When I refresh, I notice a lot of very specific seeming manipulations. Like "okay we'll let it get to 50 in 3 hours so it will fizzle off later" sort of thing. I want people to look into this because the more people who get inside and contribute, the faster the truth will get out and it will increase the validity of this.

       Ive read the threads and will try and paraphrase what I think this is  happening-  please correct me if Im wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks has files out in the public that have really damning information (this is the content of the dead mans switch) that many people have downloaded. Now people are trying to get the key to open the files.  The key is in a blockchain but anytime someone tries to post how to get the key from the block chain that info is deleted?
      </p>
      <p>
       is this even close to what is happening?

       Thanks, I use a mac too, so that's why I'm dedicating my time to spreading awareness of the situation rather than going deep.

      <p>
       Yeah, good job that's basically it.
The blockchain is a public ledger and you can add information to transactions. Folks are trying to search the blockchain for wikileaks information that they attached to transactions and decode them and find out what they are the keys or hashes to. This process must be repeated and decentralized due to the absolute censorship of the keys.

       is how they are preventing it from getting out.

       Spread the word! Don't let this go unnoticed! Get it to other subs! The topic is being censored on 4chan 8chan and hasn't even reached Reddit yet, and that's why I made this post. It's all there. Organize the facts and present them like I did, or in your own way.

       "oct 17: strange activity is noticed at the embassy, first responders investigate, periscope is killed, twitter goes full orwell, archive.org is changed to no longer save sites properly.something that is instantly deleted is posted several times on pleddit, halfchan, fullchan, onion links and darkweb. it is all wiped. people regroup in several places since there is no way to post without threads being deleted or sites going down. a lot end up here.
      </p>
      <p>
       oct 21: as the director of wikileaks is dying a huge ddos takes down most sites. blockchain is attacked. lot of stuff gets deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       oct 24: someone finds the wikileaks backups in the blockchain and posts instructions and code to decode the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       oct 27: the deletions get too severe. sites begin being flooded with illegal content or going down. people create their own private channel to discuss progress. the keys and all hidden data in the blockchain are found. the group pushes the information into a few cryptocurrencies. blockchain is flooded. mempool graphs now have a giant spike on oct 27. soft fork for bitcoin begins. onion threads with the info get instantly wiped. everyone involved goes silent except one of two people. this group is then referred to as 'group 1'. first finding of the keys as 'first impact'. few days later: one of the people following the progress of group 1 starts teaching others how to retrace the steps.
      </p>
      <p>
       late oct: people figure out that unlocking the data gets you xkeyscored'd making you lose internet connection and makes sites get attacked if the stuff is not deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       early nov: focus changes to teaching others how to find the information on airgapped computers to avoid deletion and sacrificing public channels of communication. threads that have progress start being flooded with illegal content every morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       nov 8: wikileaks.org begins being changed. some files are deleted. checksum hashes start not matching older backups.
      </p>
      <p>
       some point in nov: irs asks bitcoin to give them the identities of all transactions. copies of the blockchain start showing 'undecodable' or empty transactions not seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
       mid nov: 'group 2' doxxes the people pretending to be wikileaks and tried to spread more detailed instructions for getting the files. posts did not last more than a few minutes. it seems like they tried to push to blockchain but apparently the data did not make it in. group 2 goes silent. they start calling this day the 'second impact'.
      </p>
      <p>
       nov 25: third impact. files are found by a new group that seems to not be american. they post instructions all the place but they don't last more than a few hours. they tried to encode data into cryptocurrencies but it is not clear if it made it. this day is the second spike visible on the mempool graph.
      </p>
      <p>
       at some point after this people agree to stop using the endchan thread for this because admins have to deal with too much illegal content floods and site going down. it becomes clear that any channel used to discuss this is 'sacrificed', in other words, it starts going down a lot, they flip the mods, deletion, illegal spams, etc. this thread is created for that reason. you can figure out what is special about this thread if you read the logs in the png. most progress after this point is exclusively on channels with no logs on darkweb. most of these eventually go down. the endchan thread is eventually locked. everyone that posted is blocked to this day. it is then deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       dec: planning for d-day begins. all holding groups spend all of december teaching others how to find the files.
      </p>
      <p>
       mid dec: someone allegedly speaking on behalf of appelbaum posts links to code he wrote to find and repair keys in memory. new teams are told to use it. obama starts talking about a cyber war with russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       dec 18: files are found in japan. a meshnet using ps3s is created to spread the files but it does not seem to last too long.
      </p>
      <p>
       dec 19: d-day. happenings all over the world. most ISPs, torrent communities and major sites go down. wikileaks releases a new insurance file. uk, ec, and us insurance files from before no longer show on wikileaks.org unless you have IPs from specific countries. it is one of the biggest internet outages in history and it is not reported in a single news site that i have been able to find. holding groups go silent. some members are now trying to find their old teams.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr blockchain has backups for all wikileaks files since 2013. it also has checksum hashes and upload proofs for all files. there is a lot of stuff in there that triggers xkeyscore or echelon and is virtually impossible to share or even talk about. three months have been spent trying to teach others how to recreate the steps. there is a noticeable pattern. group finds it, start teaching others how to do it, then everything is deleted and people go silent. then a new group finds the breadcrums and starts over. it's not clear what happened yesterday or what will happen next but there are people from all the world trying to investigate. at this point and there is no part of the internet where it is allowed."

       This is akin to someone telling you that their password is two consecutive words from some random page on wikipedia and you then browsing thru wikipedia trying every combo you come across hoping to get in... only with a high chance of catching a virus while you do so.

       Most of the files themselves are not stored in the blockchain. The keys to the encrypted insurance files and some other docs are. The folks who are deep are trying to search and decode the blockchain to find the keys.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the insurance files are encrypted and available for torrent. Download the June 3 insurance torrent. Here is the magnet link

      </p>
      <p>
       It's 100GB, so you need the space. Then once the keys are made public, use AES Crypt to decrypt it, and then you'll have what's probably the most important insurance documents.

       Nope, sorry man. All you have to do is install some torrenting software and copy that magnet link in your browser and it will download for you. I have a mac and use transmission for torrenting. If you have no technical knowledge and you're not willing to learn, stick to spreading awareness about this topic. Use the Xkeyscore document I linked and the NSA Snowden docs to prove that the keys can and are being censored from the internet. Use all the shit in my post and anything you find that is relevant to make folks aware and kill any illusion that this is a fake effort. Shills are everywhere, man don't be duped.

       forum is the last place I've seen discussion about it. I got pms from someone who kept changing their account and giving me some insight, but it sounded like no one really knows what's going on. The people who supposedly found the keys went dark awhile ago and no one has claimed to be able to decode it all since.

       All I know is that Assange is likely being held by the deep state. I wish I had the equipment and the knowledge to do all of this myself, because I really do think that all the truth lies in the blockchain. Keyscore and all the other CIA tools just prevent it from being shared anywhere. I just hope that there are really smart hacker dudes who have the truth and are working on a method of distribution, but as time goes on, my hope diminishes.

       Yeah, I remember browsing threads and watching code lingo and a bunch of files getting removed instantly. Folks reporting that their homes were ransacked, being followed, hard drives getting wiped, etc. Very chilling stuff and I was very very disappointed to see it get pushed aside simply because it's hard to understand.

       I don't know why you even bothered to reply to this troll. He's posted several comments on your thread and they're only derailing everyones attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your post is very important, and I wish I had more technical knowledge to contribute to the cause. But the least I can do is suggest you not feed the trolls and stick to doing what's right. Fuck em. Downvote and continue focusing on what's important.

       Thanks man honestly I really appreciate it. I kind of wanted to entertain the fella because he was the sole shill/troll in the thread. He started falling apart and completely derailing conversation pretty quickly and he was getting upvotes for a bit so I wanted to make sure my voice was heard.

       This is just a bunch of LARPing... don't fall for their shenanigans... don't go installing any of this shit they want you to install on your computer... The story doesn't hold water... it is full of holes. If these guys actually believed in this shit they would be doing this stuff themselves instead of spamming it all over.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people were smart enough to open the insurance files they would be smart enough to get the information out without some magical omniscient program blocking all references to the keys... but that same program isn't smart enough to block these guys spamming how to get the keys.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's like 4 guys that just spend their days trying to get people to fall for this hoax... Don't fall for it... I dunno if they are just being silly or there is something more nefarious going on... but the whole thing is fishy as fuck.

       The only nefarious activity going on is by the people attempting to hide the truth. If this was all a hoax and there was nothing to hide then 
why go through all of this incredible effort to intervene?

       Thanks for the support hombre! I don't understand why some people wanto to completely discredit something with this much substance. It is proven that there is information in the blockchain, and the most likely things would be the keys. Assange is clearly missing. Add that to the increasingly strange internet activity and shutdowns, along with the heavy shilling occurring on all platforms, and we've got a cover up.

       I'll link you to a txt file later tonight that is a dialogue of emails between Bitcoin's Satoshi and Assange discussing putting the data in the blockchain. Satoshi didn't want the info in the blockchain because it would draw too much heat. Assange told him that only the keys would be inserted. I'll link you the file in a couple hours.

       Good one? Are you accusing me of forging all of this shit and trying to dupe a bunch of people? I didn't even post screenshots, I posted the links to the actual threads. Obviously screenshots can be faked, a ton of shit can be faked, that doesn't make all of this shit unreliable.

       I don't even know what supposed screenshots you're talking about. It seems like after I stopped responding to you, ending the interaction, you wanted to further provoke me by claiming that the theory is based on
       <em>
        screenshots.

       CTR is known for deconstructing productive threads and filling them with bullshit. Don't be like CTR.

       It's based on a lot more than screenshots, if you want, you can go ahead and visit the threads and see the data for yourself.

       I'm not upset... I'm just all alone in this "conspiracy theory" of mine that the blockchain shit is just a ruse... so I gotta be a little louder than usual. No one can really counter anything I say other than "Dude read the links... try it out yourself... but if you do your computer will be nuked and you might be killed."

       Who is intervening? No one is... the only "evidence" of anyone doing anything is all traced directly back to screenshots of forum posts on 4chan... screenshots... of forum posts... on 4chan... let that sink in.

       Look, I habe witnessed bullshit on 4chan, but I've also witnessed shit i personally can say is 100% legitimate. JUST because work was done on a chan thread for anonaminity, doesn't automatically discredit it. The subject matter itself commands at least a close look. The ONLY thing I've seen Ninja do here is try and dissuade others. He has provided zero input.

       He's claiming it's based on screenshots. Can you verify for me that I haven't been touching screenshots that you can't go verify for yourself? I feel like Ninja almost
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       to be CTR at this point because of how much he's spewing absolute horseshit and trying to guide the conversation. I'm not trying to guide the conversation, I'm willing to answer questions that I know and admit what I don't. Based on his history, he's been around the sub for awhile so I really don't want to think he's a shill, but these arguments are just too shilly.

       For someone so enthralled by Wikileaks you don't seem to be too upset that if your theory is true it means Julian is long dead and Wikileaks has been compromised and controlled by a government.

       ... to take a narrative being forced down our throats and dissect it to get to the truth. This little LARPing expedition doesn't pass muster. I scrutinize and disassemble using common sense... but I draw the line at installing deepweb software from a chan thread to "see for myself"... the fact that so many people push this story... but won't install and run the shit themselves is very telling... if they truly believed... they wouldn't be here trying to make other people do it... they wouldn't be here at all according to their own story cause the powers that be would have nuked their computers already.

       I'm not the one doing anything. Everything on endchan was done weeks ago without any context or sensationalization. If you follow their instructions, other users have verified that the process works. It takes time and it takes a decent sized group and a lot of knowledge about the blockchain and other technical subjects. Most of the discussion about the real information is taking place offline without any desire for attention. Anyone can download Tor and follow the instructions and take their own amount of caution.

       If you want to think that this entire three-month endeavor that has been taking place both online and offline and has been heavily censored by shills, has been a LARP and for some reason they're linking everything to honeypots, go ahead.
      </p>

       This sub is a honeypot. Reddit is a honeypot. I don't think anyone is exempt from CIA/NSA surveillance and potential danger. I don't know why everyone is still so fucking paranoid about honeypots. IF THEY WANTED YOU, THEY'D GET YOU. It doesn't fucking matter, so stop trying to discourage a promising effort. There is clear evidence that there are keys and hashes in the blockchain and that it was planned in advance, you're acting like this has no substance, but it does. More substance than I could fit into this post.

       Right... if the NSA sees everything... then they would shut down the 100s of bullshit blockchain threads... they don't. You are falling for a little story... did you even try this yourself? Nope... cause if you did you wouldn't be here... right?  I don't care how long they have been pulling this LARP... how the fuck do you know what goes on offline? It's all word of mouth from a fuckin' chan thread... thats what it all leads back to... thats where the only "evidence" is... who is to say the admins/DB managers there couldn't change timestamps and force their site down just to really sell the story. The more you push this the more I think you are in on the scam and not just an unwitting pawn.

       I read the thread on chan and my opinion as a software engineer, based on the discussion people had its total bullshit, there is even that fake github with multiple implementation of the same software in multiple language... I havent looked at the code but people are just spouting non sense non-stop. Anything serious would be way more organised, its basically script kiddies trying to get some eswag. I dont care if they come after me for denouncing their bullshit. They should use their 5% of skills to do something useful.

       Can they really automate the tracking of the content of every file? I imagine a shitty video or low quality picture of something could get through to the internet.

       "Shilling for my own ego"? I think that is what a lot of people would call "freedom of speech". If you want to convert me into running this software... make a convincing argument. It's silly squared with you guys.

       I'm just trying to suss out their motivations... I think a few of em drank the Flavor-Aid, a few are LARPing, and few have studied from the online warfare handbook... the paid shills tend to develop a recognizable personality they all have in common... I'd feel like an idiot if I've been talking to an AI script half this time... No doubt someone is using the increased emotions and internet chatter to practice passing a Turing Test right now somewhere. They are allowed to adopt a persona to pull it off... sometimes ESLer or a child... maybe shill is even better cover though.

       Thanks, I use a mac too, so that's why I'm dedicating my time to spreading awareness of the situation rather than going deep.

       Yeah, good job that's basically it.
The blockchain is a public ledger and you can add information to transactions. Folks are trying to search the blockchain for wikileaks information that they attached to transactions and decode them and find out what they are the keys or hashes to. This process must be repeated and decentralized due to the absolute censorship of the keys.

       Thanks man honestly I really appreciate it. I kind of wanted to entertain the fella because he was the sole shill/troll in the thread. He started falling apart and completely derailing conversation pretty quickly and he was getting upvotes for a bit so I wanted to make sure my voice was heard.

       Archive it, repost it. Everywhere. Anywhere. Get the word out, no one knows about it. It is being heavily censored on the chans and hasn't reached Reddit until the other day. Make everyone aware of what is happening. Because it's happening every day, folks trying to get this shit out.

       You should not be suspicious cause once this slips from the front page they will probably just delete the thread themselves to help maintain the illusion.
