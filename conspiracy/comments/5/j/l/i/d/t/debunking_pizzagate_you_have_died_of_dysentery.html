        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>WARNING</strong> This post is boring. There are SO MANY CLAIMS in the #Pizzagate conspiracy that are made without evidence or proof, just conjecture and interpretation of loosely related events and people. I barely scratch the surface of the #Pizzagate theory in this post. Those who are perpetuating #Pizzagate keep adding bits and pieces to the theory, making it so large that it becomes a chore going through it all. To most people it&#39;s obvious what they&#39;re doing and just ignore them, but the believers of the theory just call those people shills and make up more shit to stack on the pile. </p>

<p>The title of the article that I went by is called &quot;<strong><a href="http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/top-news/13-essential-data-points-pizzagate-pedophilia-allegations/">13 MOST ESSENTIAL DATA-POINTS IN #PIZZAGATE PEDOPHILIA ALLEGATIONS</a></strong>&quot;, I&#39;m going to go trough them one at a time. </p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1. <strong>PAST HISTORY OF HIGH PROFILE CHILD PEDOPHILIA CASES</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Child pedophilia, as opposed to adult pedophilia.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first claim is that &quot;it is important to first understand that there have been <strong>many high-profile cases of child pedophilia</strong> as well as satanic occult rituals at the upper echelons of power before the current Pizzagate scandal even broke out&quot;.</p>

<p>The examples given are plenty however only one of them, the so called &quot;<strong>Dutroux Affair</strong>&quot; resulted in two actual convictions, one of whom was a high ranking government official in Belgium, but that case had no relation to satanic occult rituals. Could the others be true even though there was no convictions? Of course, but making allegations based on other allegations makes your entire argument shaky.</p>

<p>The article goes to bring up Jimmy Savile, Jerry Sandusky and Jeffrey Epstein which were <strong>all confirmed or convicted pedophiles</strong>. But these men were not truly men of power, their power reached as far as their wealth and no further. <strong>Not one of them had any connection to satanic pedo cults.</strong> </p>

<p>Even though the examples given by this article up to this point are lacking to say the least, it does add that Hollywood has a major problem with child abuse, as does the Vatican. So <strong>I concede the first point partly</strong>, there have indeed been high profile pedophile cases, but satanic cults? No, well maybe the one in South Korea but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2. <strong>COMET PING PONG</strong> </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The first paragraph talks about James Alefantis and his ex&#39;s connection to the Hillary campaign. Can&#39;t wait to see where this is going, no claims yet though, I guess their setting up for something big.</p>

<p>Well there&#39;s nothing but a bunch of speculation and insinuation. Talking about reports of &quot;Hidden chambers&quot; and &quot;strange pictures&quot; on Jimmy&#39;s Instagram page. In fact they themselves summaries this way better that I ever could. &quot;The <strong>overwhelming amount of circumstantial evidence</strong> raises an aura of peculiarity and suspicion, but <strong>no direct proof</strong> of anything nefarious has been found in this pizza joint. <strong>The real dirt is found online</strong>, and between the connections of the characters involved in this story.&quot; The &quot;evidence&quot; being Instagram posts, truly overwhelming.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>3. <strong>CODED LANGUAGE IN THE PODESTA EMAILS LEAKED BY WIKILEAKS</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, this is the big one right? Well it&#39;s not until the third paragraph that something of interest is written: &quot;when these emails are poured through one by one, <strong>it becomes absolutely clear that these food-related words are code language</strong>&quot;. Finally we&#39;re going to get some hard, cold, clear evidence. Let&#39;s get to it.</p>

<p>However it doesn&#39;t start of great. &quot;Why would grown men and women be so continuously and excitedly emailing and promptly responding amongst each other about “cooking” and “eating” all sorts of very basic “foods.” <strong>Making dinner plans is suspicious apparently</strong>, or doing something is. The article doesn&#39;t link to any specific email so all we&#39;re left to go by is that people talked about food, okay? God dammit my patience is wearing thin with all this bullshit. For god&#39;s sake <strong>there&#39;s three thousand results when you search for &quot;<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=Dinner&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=6#searchresult">dinner</a></strong>&quot; in the Podesta emails.</p>

<p>Well the next thing they bring up is an email about &quot;<strong>Spirit cooking</strong>&quot; which people seem to be convinced to be proof that Tony Podestas is a satanic cult member... Let me get this straight. <strong>One email</strong>, that&#39;s thirty something words long, inviting over John and Tony Podesta for dinner is proof of them being satanic cult members, all because of &quot;Spirit cooking&quot;. How about you actually look up what that actually means to Marina Abramović, Instead of assuming it&#39;s a satanic cult ritual, because it&#39;s actually something different, [Link](&quot;The artist chose to make a cookbook, writing a series of &#39;<strong>aphrodisiac recipes</strong>&#39; that serve as evocative instructions for actions or thoughts.&quot;) But no, the article explains to us about that &quot;<strong>anyone who is a true occultist</strong>&quot; does so and so and &quot;any good magician uses their art to further their magick&quot;. I&#39;m not an expert in the field, but I know that magic isn&#39;t real. But wait a minute, the author predicted my reaction; &quot;When these people casually laugh off these theories because they were “just performing art,” they are denying the truth by obfuscation, and admitting it at the same time.&quot; Shit, I&#39;m caught.</p>

<p>Ok <strong>this is the part that I know that most people who believe in the theory put most of their stock.</strong> &quot;The discovered <strong>coded language</strong> used within the Podesta emails appears to be one <strong>used exclusively by known pedophiles</strong>. This code uses food items such as “pasta” “cheese pizza”, and “ice cream,” to refer to child pedophilia.&quot; First of all, &quot;used exclusively by known pedophiles&quot;, if that were true then pedophiles wouldn&#39;t use those words since it would be too easy to spot them, right? For fucks sake, pasta, cheese pizza and ice cream are all common forms of food and pretty much everyone in the US eats at least one of things on a weekly basis. </p>

<p>The stupidity continues: &quot;They also appear to be talking in <strong>handkerchief code</strong>, which is even listed in Wikipedia as a coded color system for sex, mostly stemming from underground homosexual movements in the 1970’s.&quot; There are <strong>a total of 9 emails</strong> that talk about a &quot;handkerchief&quot;, some of those being duplicates. 9, out 30-some thousand, but hey it&#39;s the content that matters right? And boy is that- completely benign and boring. Let me paraphrase &quot;Some guy told me that you might have forgotten your handkerchief, did you? Maybe but it&#39;s not worth the time w/e cya&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s it. I&#39;m done. This is as far as I&#39;ll go. Fuck this theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the person who wrote that also said he recived cheeses instead of pasta earlier in the mail, so its more probably a joking line asking if cheese will make him better at playing dominoes than pasta would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who in the history of planet earth has used the nouns &quot;cheese&quot; and &quot;pasta&quot; in those ways?  It wasnt a joking line at all.  It used three code words all at once.  Dominos, cheese, and pasta.  You must be really grasping at straws to try to explain this.</p>

<p>the alarming thing about pizzagate is how easy it is to warp peoples view of reality by adding some &quot;filters&quot; in form of context and alleged code-speak, and even more so how little people then research allegations that speak to their new filtered world view.</p>

<p>of course, we are dealing with a subreddit that freaks out over slowed down, edited footage of kids shows and thinks government officials are talking about extraterrestrials when discussing foreign labour needed for projects(&quot;i think one of them is an alien&quot;)... </p>
