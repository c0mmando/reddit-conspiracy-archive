       When Reddit actually effected policy with people calling during one of the blackouts (I can't remember what it was, I think it was for an open internet, but something that has since passed).  Swartz was political. His online presence was unbelievable, he was a leader by all great associations of the word.  He was out on his own terms, but this platform was his creation.  Large amounts of organization occurred through this place politically. He of course was arrested for JSTOR garbage and handed the most insane penalty ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Pao took over, the fringes of this place were established and mods got more power (remember jail sub and the craziness from that?)  Pao was set to fail, but they needed controversy for an overthrow of the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly at the end of the day, the occupy movement was turned on itself and away from "rich vs poor" and into "men vs women" and "white vs black".  The black lives matter movement was born, Gamergate was born and the focus was turned into who is victimized and away from socioeconomical purposes.  The occupy movement was splintered and fought against itself.  Divide &amp; Conquer, it's the oldest trick in the book, which is why it always works too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit now fights against itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other significant parts.  2012 the Smith Mundt act that prevented government propaganda was repealed.  An Air Force base was in the top 10 cities for most active users.  Snowden and the encryption of the Internet.  It was easy to see that people were set into their communities, Facebook and Google account for most users, Reddit accounts for the most active users, but essentially people were locked in.  Essentially the Internet changed from open to closed and small communities that were controllable.  Those communities have been doing nothing but cranking up there moderation/sheriff powers.  That's still increasing all the way obviously now to censorship of "fake news" and not just fringe stuff any more.

       As a fairly new Reddit user, thanks for this awesome synopsis of what's been going on. I feel like everyone needs to be made aware of the changes and regulation implemented over time not just to Reddit but the Internet in general, and what this means for us in the long run. Of course the media won't report about it.

       There's so much more too.  Something that's a pretty weird general rule is to pay attention when people get book tours and book deals.  Kn0thing got his book deal pretty much in the aftermath of the Aaron Schwartz stuff, had emails where he was in contact with government officials, and also was generally unsure about the future of Reddit as a platform at the time.  Was more just a happy face for the company.  Dude is awesome and happy, but ultimately seemed like he was a person balancing a lot and not necessarily the most knowledgable about the platform.

       Saw this elsewhere, but I love it.  It's a pretty good start at what a society needs to run well.  When something society wise is occuring, you have to examine four areas and start categorizing what's going on.  It's like a check sheet for a society that will thrive, or one that will tear itself apart.
      </p>
      <h1>
       There are four things that matter in society:
      </h1>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The Learning of the Wise (can the smartest focus on knowledge to improve how we do things).
       </li>
       <li>
        The Justice of the Powerful (is resource gathering fair for all).
       </li>
       <li>
        The Celebration of the Righteous (what traits we encourage).
       </li>
       <li>
        The Valor of the Brave (suppression of emotions to overcome extreme difficulty).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Right now the learning of the Wise isn't about knowledge, it's about certificates and being closer to whatever power structure is in place.  The Learning of the Wise means embracing actual, useable knowledge... not embracing certificates and appeals to higher authority (socially engineering what are facts, rather than the facts being self-evident).  Right now you have people being claimed as "authorities" based on their certification, school background, etc... not based on facts and evidence (the truth is usually self-evident, but social engineering obfuscates that).
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the Justice of the Powerful is relying on shaming people or saying that "the wrong had it coming" no matter what wrong happens to them.  Instead whoever gains resources should be based on discipline and fairness, not manipulation of the lower powers against themselves with the powerful acting as both judge and executor. (whether that's mods, CEO's of reddit, or America or whatever, you simply can't have the powerful being both judge and executor).
      </p>
      <p>
       Celebration of Righteous.  Determines who people try to emulate.  If you celebrate fact finding, heroes who sacrificed for truth at all costs, celebrate humanity and love, then people emulate it.  But we literally have celebrities like the kardashians and I honestly can't even tell you why we celebrate them.  But people emulate that or "reality" TV shows.  We make heroes out of people who haven't really contributed towards society in an amazing way, which means we don't really celebrate contribution towards society.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Valor of the Brave.  We should promote overcoming emotions and self-fears in order to do something higher for the greater good of everyone.  Instead we have gone completely opposite and we don't celebrate discipline, we celebrate victimization as being worthy of attention, rather than overcoming it for a greater goal.  We don't celebrate those who overcome, so instead it seems like it's greater valor to simply be a victim, but being a victim by it's very definition is paralyzing and anti-action and anti-overcoming.

       100% agreed.  I came in the great Digg migration and it's as if the anti-Ron Paul people got a huge boost in the arm and hired a PR firm to expand their shenanigans which is what made me leave Digg in the first place.  That and their redesign.

       I think the big push for Occupy Wall Street and/or the Restore The Fourth movements really set Reddit's demise into motion. Those movements really scared the ruling elite and largely used Reddit to organize. All Restore the Fourth, Occupy, and Anonymous subs were quickly taken over after the elite realized the threat, staring a snowball of control, censorship, and dictating the narrative.

       Aaron Swartz was the heart and soul of Reddit; the guy who had the mission of setting up this site to be what Digg was before it fell (freedom of information being what lead to his death). The others played a part in the sites beginnings and establishment but IMO were not in it for the same reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       With him out of the picture; all we have left here are people more interested in running Reddit Inc as a business (when not editing user data and misrepresenting the users of this site), one that is for sale to the highest bidder for whatever style of AstroTurf they want approved and applied on site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't take the OPs or my word for it, check out the default subscribed subs and compare to the fringe subs (spoiler: reddit_relationships/SRS v theredpill), I state as such to encourage skepticism and not to parrot the same message as the OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Warning: Do not post while observing such parts of Reddit, some mods ban users in their subs for posting in other/controversial subs. This divisiveness being another point worth noting on Reddit today.
      </p>
      <p>
       My account may be a few years younger than the OP, but on my time here (5 years) I'd say the last 2 years ('member fatpeoplehate? my weight today does for the right reasons) were the most vastly different compared to the feel of the site when I first joined Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last month I consider the most dramatic so far as the CEO modified user posts directly in the database, thus the canary. I do not care why he did it; hide, delete, moderate, ban but do not edit user posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL/DR:
The checks and balances of this site in the embodiment of Aaron Swartz are no longer present, leaving Reddit an imposing shadow of its former self. I agree with the OP and encourage people to be skeptic and research it for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the usual 'why are you still here' responses:
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll continue posting here until the redacted CEO kicks me out or traffic in here reaches modern Digg status.

       These mass upvoted posts on /all/ are poorly constructed with submitted comments, in horrible correlation to the upvote count being an unrealistic amount of content on such largely voted post. This makes no sense. Reminiscing on the days when posts upvoted to 12k would often surpass 9k or 10k in comments.

       Schwartz was suicided: they put him under stress with the lawsuit, stalked him to create stress and keep him indoors, then used EMR to sleep deprive him, induce severe depression. Aaron did the rest. This is very common tactic. Look up neuroweapons, targeted individual, gangstalking etc.

       I understand. You're new here. I had the same attitude when I began. I simply cared about liberty, and hated those who opposed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you suppose they oppose liberty? Are there interests that don't want us to be free? Who are they?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were someone who profited off of suppressing liberty, how would you control the government? Is it easy to control public opinion? Or is it easier to control a few hundred officials?
      </p>

       What's the best way to control people? What is the worst thing someone could do that would utterly destroy them if it got out?

       This is definitely true in some subs, particularly anything political. Largely though I don't see a huge difference. There are tons of subs that are non political and super niche, there you still find people talking about bizarrely specific interests.

       Reddit is a small piece of a bigger problem, the rise of the SJW Movement aka "I'm the bigger victim and deserve special treatment" And the deep state government loves and pushes this philosophy on college campus
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and Conquer , for instance, push and force everyone to respect the little differences in race or gender of everyone else, thereby creating groups, turning what once was a united front into little segmented baskets of divisiveness, anger. Using this "you're marginalized for every reason through absolutely no fault of your own " discounting hard work and discipline, which only magnifies and justifies their lack of personal improvement and  causes a need for assistance to gain an edge for their  own imaginary self inflicted limits , forsaking the fact we're supposed not see or care what someone's skin color is, an individual personal responsibility to be the best person you can be should be the only judgment others judge you by. Instead everyone believes they're being "held back" and handicap themselves, demand their basket is the more important basket, deserving special treatment, some form of government welfare, and preferential treatment over others due to their self-inflicted "disadvantage" thereby cementing their distraction and igniting a deep mistrust from one group to another, making sure the other doesn't lay claim to becoming the bigger victim.

       Once Americans are divided into little groups shouting  each other down, they ignore the real issues facing their country. People need to understand this is not about race but class. Then they will see the truth, that the working  and middle classes are being destroyed by any means necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the ruling class  holds all the cards. They can starve the lower classes of opportunity and prosperity. Divide and dominate an angry, depressed class of poor Americans. Americans who slowly allowed themselves to become dependent on their government for most of their basic needs. And who also happen to hate each other. So instead of a united prosperous country with a government where the people hold the the power and use it to reinvest in small business and limited intervention, you get endless small groups, who are so busy creating division they ask their government to regulate and legislate their freedom away.

       this was an election year. An online forum for anyone with access to the internet given the ability to express their opinion. What do you expect?
