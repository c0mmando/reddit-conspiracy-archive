    <div class="md"><p>The reddit algorithm used to give diminishing returns to already very popular posts.  For example it used to be <em>much</em> harder for a post to go from 5-6k than from 1-2k.  This gave more obscure posts and subreddits a chance to have their content seen, and created some variety in r/all.  This algorithm change has absolutely been done to inflate posts in default subreddits which are inherently going to be more popular than more obscure subreddits.  This is definitely a form of soft-censorship to keep &quot;questionable&quot; content from being seen by the majority of users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m convinced it has something to do with all the controversy surrounding plzzag8te. All of this happened in this order: 4chan and T_D discover the stuff in the pedosta emails, sub gets created on reddit, content about plzzagate gets shadowcensored on default subs, r/plzzag8te and related subs get banned, spezit scandal goes down leading to the new voting algorithm, which buries posts and hurts r/T_D and subs like this one. Shills infiltrate r/conspiracy somewhere during all that. Oh and not to mention the blatant removal of any post or comment that goes
against the DNC narrative. This place has gone from fun shit to fascist in the span of a few weeks.</p>

<p>Then again I&#39;m guessing you had a specific definition of shills in mind?  Probably only refers to people that disagree with you, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The questionable thing is they implemented that policy to improve the viability of small subreddits, and by virtue increase the site experience.</p>

<p>Back when subreddits were first launched (back in the day most of us used personal names as our accounts) they were garbage because no one posted to them. You&#39;d post to r/science and it&#39;d get 20 upvotes and a couple of comments. They forced posts only to subreddits, which forced their growth.</p>

<p>This regression is going to lead to the failing Digg had where it was all shit. r/all will end up with a half dozen posts in it from all major subs, you&#39;ll have to hit page 5 before you see anything - exactly like Digg. And someone reading this will be thinking &quot;what the fuck is Digg&quot; - <em>exactly</em>. </p>

<p>Any post that doesn&#39;t make it to r/all doesn&#39;t even stand a change. I&#39;m sure we see post counts rise by a huge amount when they make the cross over, as the exposure to everyone just ups the count to a level most individual subs can&#39;t compete on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some thing that I&#39;d like to point out: when the change did happen it seems that they didn&#39;t get the hang of filtering certain subreddit from their posts getting too big. </p>

<p>I specifically remember T_D posts getting some insane amounts of numbers. And literally more than half of the posts were all on the front page. It was insane. </p>

<p>I think the next day though, they caught on and figured out how to stop it. Ever since then, very few posts get the numbers it got on the beginning. And usually the ones that do are just shit posts and nothing of importance or shocking value. When the Obama birth certificate thing was going viral, a large lost of it was actually removed from the front page and replaced with just some shit post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a related question. Did anyone else see their post karma go up when they implemented the new karma system?</p>

<p>This username is one I created earlier this year to use primarily on this conspiracy sub. I ended up using it on r/WhereIsAssange too. </p>

<p>My post karma jumped from 653 to 1261 instantly, presumably when they flipped the new karma switch. At the time, I hadn&#39;t heard they were putting a new system in place, so I thought something weird was going on, made a note, took some <a href="http://imgur.com/a/hIOvh">screenshots</a>, and moved on. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still trying to figure out why my post karma doubled? Anyone have a similar experience or some insight? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that reddit as a whole is a hive minded community that revolves around profits stimulated by the advertisers themselves. </p>

<p>Take for example AMA&#39;s more often than not serve as nothing more than subliminal advertismenst. Top posts on front page related to old keanu reaves meme&#39;s are outlining / pre PR for his new and upcoming films. Not to mention the Vote HRC bs which all users hated equally. 
It&#39;s literally a PR Platform, and in no way serves a purpose for and to the users, when their actual stories, are out shined by various intent of corporate parties. Here is a real question; Why can we only ask for donations in <a href="/r/donate">/r/donate</a> or <a href="/r/assistance">/r/assistance</a> when the views are generally limited when a post would do much better in <a href="/r/getmotivated">/r/getmotivated</a>. Isn&#39;t asking for help important? 
When you&#39;ve actually got to the point in your life you need the assistance from others; It shouldn&#39;t be a &quot;criminal thing&quot; and a deleted post. Factually most users have periods in their lives and most users would also be happy to be there for them in the first place. (Had they knew). But reddit seems to have a huge huge problem, with what? Helping people? </p>

<p>It&#39;s like churches that expect their masses donations. 
I remember when I truly needed help I asked a church, and they gave me an outdated community pamplet for soup kitchens. 
Mind you, I explained I just needed a temporary hand out of financial gain to meet a bill (prior to losing my home), and this was impossible. (As the pastor climbed into his 50k vehicle). </p>

<p>I think if reddit was for the people they would rely on donations, not advertising revenue. So in that extent until the members unilaterally begin to understand that. Don&#39;t expect yourself or your struggles to be more important than the new lego starwars collection. It&#39;s just not worthy of reddit users attention?</p>

<p>Note generally I like reddit, and generally I don&#39;t ask for help and I simply have needed to at times. It just hurts that it isn&#39;t important, and I wonder how many suicides we all could have prevented by simply kicking a single dollar to one and other at a time. </p>

<p>Factually I&#39;d much rather be charged 1.00 monthly for a subscription to my favorite subreddit, then put up with approved ctr and shill accounts working to either push a product or opinion. 
Its just bad for the website as a whole, and I think if given the oppurtunity, A. Reddit would greatly profit, and B. Reddit users would be 100% happier getting the garbage offline. While C. It would make Mods jobs that much easier. </p>

<p>If you MODS read this. What is your take on this? 
I mean It would probably lead to your positions being paid ones? 
Technically if anyone deserves a donation from time to time. 
I feel it is certainly them themselves. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, then forgive my snark; I though you were one of the visitors from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> who likes to come in here and paint the whole sub with a broad brush. </p>

<p>Yeah, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m too happy with the direction either. I&#39;ve only been here a few years, but even since T_D the overall quality is significantly diminished, and the aftermath of the election hasn&#39;t helped things like I had hoped. There&#39;s still some good content, but it&#39;s even more a search amongst the weeds than it was. </p>
