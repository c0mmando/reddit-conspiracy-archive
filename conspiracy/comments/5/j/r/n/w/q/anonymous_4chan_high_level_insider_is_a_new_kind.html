        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">164</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-12-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/911bodysnatchers322.html">911bodysnatchers322</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Mememaggots</strong></p>

<p>An internet meme is a propaganda idea in short form in bold letters layed on top of a picture.  Condescending wonka, conspiracy keanu, etc.</p>

<p>Memes are not allowed in this sub.    I think the reason is not because someone gets to make a statement (which is allowable in narrative / text post form), but because these memes were artificially upvoted by botnets in the past (correct me if I&#39;m wrong, mods)</p>

<p>Posting quotes on top of an image constitute a meme-like gray area, so are political cartoons, according to the mods in a discussion about this years ago.  </p>

<p>Similarly, people are starting to take screenshot of &quot;high level insiders&quot; <em>sage wisdom</em> in short form on 4chan.  Here, in lieu of a funny picture, this is being presented with the familiar ugly, 1990s style anon imgboard format; presented as if a nugget of <em>sage wisdom</em> has been plucked from the vast haystacks of noise.</p>

<p>Also, this 4chan &quot;insider&quot; screenshots thing is spamming up the &#39;hot&#39; queue as if by artificial upvoting, which I think is very strange and it&#39;s a new trend.  I don&#39;t like it.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Being a part of the Masquerade is having Eyes wide shut</strong></p>

<p>Because any one of us can just as easily masquerade as a &quot;high level insider&quot; and then feed you guys bs pretending to be from the cia.  Over time, this gray-area meme technique of disinfo-weaponized 4chan screenshots becomes the lowest form of disinfo hell where we are talking about unsubstantiated antarctica nazi ufos and moon reality beam platforms and holohoaxes run by mind parasites.  I&#39;m not saying those things aren&#39;t true, but there is 0% evidence for them and we expect better here, we have an obligation to present evidence, something &quot;high level insider&quot; memeperson doesn&#39;t ever do.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Poseurs</strong></p>

<p>I would say the litmus test is: did high level insider produce pictures?  Links?  source documents ? If no to all the above, then it&#39;s a 4chan insider meme, don&#39;t post it.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t get to Cyrano de Bergerac the CIA, last I checked, this was actually illegal--to pose as a cop.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t say who you are, then you&#39;re a poseur.  </p>

<p>If you post source, then you&#39;re an anonymous whistleblower and that should be allowed, so long as it&#39;s not doxxing.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Turnabout is unfair play</strong></p>

<p>Stop listening to &quot;high level insider&quot; who gets to use his vast human, material, industrial and technical resources to remain anonymous while depriving you 100% of the same by intruding into every aspect of your life through technology, abusive laws and on behalf of corporate interests.</p>

<p>high level insider posting things is just kind of a way for el negro or whatever to ventroloquize on behalf of the cia/nsa and get more karma than just posting his idea here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi - I&#39;m OP- wasn&#39;t tying to offend/irk anyone and didn&#39;t realise what I was doing was against sub rules. Have spoken with the mods since and I have more clarity on what&#39;s accepted. I&#39;ve been posting here for the last year and haven&#39;t engaged in this manner of delivery before. In retrospect it was a bit militant an approach - <em>look at this now!</em>
I was trying to foster conversation in a topic myself and others in this sub were keen to see gain traction. Wether he&#39;s a Larper or genuine, anyone not speaking from a position of deep paranoia will realise there&#39;s wisdom in the anons answers. I was attempting to spread awareness to those who might not have known of him and engage in some critical discussion with some cynical minds. It wasn&#39;t my intention to flood the sub and piss people off. I respect this sub and the freedom it affords us and look forward to continuing being part of r/conspiracy </p>

<p>Peace </p>

<p>Ps for what&#39;s its worth I&#39;m not NSA or CIA as I&#39;ve seen read. I wish I was though .. you know just on the lower level shit. I bet those guys get paid </p>

<p>Edit - thanks again for everyone who shared their insights on HLI today. Quick observation: I noticed that the positive responses and conversations I had were focused on the content of the posts whereas all the negative, fruitless conversations etc were very much interested in ad homs. To the former: I appreciate you all taking the time to analyse the posts with me. To the latter, I understand your cynicism and appreciate your input nonetheless.</p>

<p>EDIT- Just read this guy again. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop listening to High Level Insider</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>OP&#39;s tone is concerning- why doesn&#39;t he want people to read apparently fake Larper 4chan posts ?</em></p>

<p>If you read through every single thing I&#39;ve ever posted on Reddit I&#39;ve never demanded anything from anybody. What right do I have to do so? The posts contain nothing but information and concepts that ask nothing from nobody. If people are interested in what this anon has to say then how does that involve you? OP writes in tones of extreme negativity, condescending derision and finishes by demanding you not even acknowledge the existence of this information.
Who does this guy think he is to ask that of strangers? You&#39;re nobody&#39;s father or mentor. It&#39;s not for you to decide what people are exposed to. Let people make their minds up for themselves.</p>

<p>Edit -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>artificial voting </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure the mods would have realised and banned me were that the case. No, what you were seeing today was genuine interest. If you read through the posts, you&#39;ll see lots of engaging conversations: the whole reason I posted. 
Still curious how this OP seeks to assert such controls on people he doesn&#39;t even know. .. read what this guys written and tell me something isn&#39;t up. Why is he so indignant?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hello &#39;redditeditard&#39;,  (love your name, wish I thought of that ;) /serious</p>

<p>For sure you know what&#39;s up on reddit more than me (I&#39;m a newbie, but real.. maybe really stupid, but for sure not supported by my govt). </p>

<p>You call them out as potentially &quot;karma-fishing&quot; (maybe true), I have been worried that it more sinister, but help me out (PM me if you want). Do you have any indication they doing more harm than karma-fishing or similar? (serious question here, I am a newbie/moron at this stuff)</p>

<p>I ABSOLUTELY get the mods have an impossible job in managing such decisions (in the lab we called this signal to noise ratio)</p>

<p>The take away from all of this (what I think all of us that are not paid to be here (shills etc.) is that &#39;injected noise&#39; (CTR and the like) are the enemy for sure. If anything buffer up the anger for when we do know who are enemy is. They need to be removed, none of us benefit in any, even short term, future </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not disregarding in fact I believe most of it. But that&#39;s because I came to same conclusions years ago. As an introduction to conspiracies it&#39;s good but nothing I&#39;ve seen pared suggests high level insider knowledge . I could have LARPed all this.

<p>Again not disputing the content of the posts, just that they imply he&#39;s a HLI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I have not found an inconsistency with what I know and the best sources I have found (all rational, and pretty solid).</p>

<p>HLI responses to the Q/A (questions and answers) is so good, I am afraid it is AI from nefarious forces (MK/CIA et. al.)</p>

<p>despite the OP point of view, here is what I see;</p>

<p>the &#39;establishment&#39; clearly is throwing disinfo out there (anyone want to challenge this??), </p>

<p>and the disinfo to be credible has to have some truth 
I think the amount of truth (info/disinfo) ratio is a measure of their present strength (or desperation if you will). </p>

<p>And tell me (any of you!) that the info/disinfo war is not going on in very high gear. </p>

<p>There is an old saying (for you young folks here) ; 
&quot;..you can&#39;t make a silk purse out of a sow&#39;s ear&quot;  ,  but I you can make fertilizer out of pig shit, so maybe HLI is pigshit, but I have found it useful, even if it be for teasing out real from false ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flood of 4chan posts on the front page looks awfully similar to deliberate <a href="https://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm">forum sliding</a>. There is no reason why all of these posts couldn&#39;t have been corralled into one Imgur album.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technique #1 - &#39;FORUM SLIDING&#39;</p>

<p>If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by &#39;forum sliding.&#39; In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to &#39;age.&#39; Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a &#39;forum slide.&#39; The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a &#39;forum slide&#39; and &#39;flush&#39; the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then &#39;replying&#39; to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. <strong>This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting &#39;slides&#39; down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.</strong></p>

<p>Re: HLI - ‘High level Insider’ </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much of anything, but;
HLI did point to Bank of New York specifically in relation to money transactions days after 911. </p>

<p>Emotional hysteria (ie panic) is not very useful, addressing the problem (with all it&#39;s facets) is. </p>

<p>In this regard whatever HLI is, i found (him/her/it?) did emphasize important issues, and if people want to get practical FOLLOW THE MONEY (and my little research did find Bank of New York significant, presently the banks in the radar are HSBC, Deutche  I had not heard much at all about Bank of New York,  well  maybe it should be .</p>

<p>this is pretty focused and real... </p>

<p>pzzagte- is not really significant in scope (got media attention but see links below for how widespread this actually is). This is not a surprise, this is the most powerful political tool you can blackmail someone with, will anyone argue that point?) </p>

<p>Widespread pedo/porno etc. </p>

<p>AND ITS USE AS BLACKMAIL IS  </p>

<p>As terrible as this is for kids, it is more terrible if it ongoing. It only propagates because of excessive money power (again someone want to challenge this??) </p>

<p>It is this blackmail effect that is what propagates the problem. </p>

<p>HLI does address this blackmail issue (this is core and I think he emphasizes it), and yes while details and proof and required (but if you dare, check Ryan Dyson out on his review, he only did that one piece of research at a request, if you want more details see the links below and search Sibel Edmonds as they have done plenty (see below for just some). </p>

<p>My point is that while HLI may be LARPing or whatever, comments in this sub sure not doing much productive either  (I do appreciate to mod such a forum is challenging to say the least).</p>

<p>My suggestion (and request)- tell me (or them) where they should post or make a sub. I am new here, been asking for some help, but not got much, where should I take my idea ??</p>

<p>at this point is there much difference between this and the claims from HLI?</p>

<p>I would say yes. A post from u/911bodysnatchers322 or any other &quot;random&quot; reddit user does not carry some implied weight of insider knowledge. In fact new users are likely to be the most susceptible to HLI (mis/dis) info.</p>

<p>Either this sub has changed drastically, or something artificial is propping up all of these low quality 4chan posts. </p>
