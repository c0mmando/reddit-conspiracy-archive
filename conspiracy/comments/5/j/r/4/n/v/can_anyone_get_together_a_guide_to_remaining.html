       Adding to this also change your MAC address. It's also a good idea to use tor/a Vpn that's not linked to you. There has been some concern over how secure tor is but if you are connected to coffee shop wifi with a dummy MAC address its just another level to make things harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: if you want to get really crazy do all of this on a live version of Linux, I believe Kali has all of the tools you would need pre installed.

       I already don't use fb so that would be a good idea. "That can't be him, he hated Facebook and the new York jets." Hide near plain site and maintain a separate identity from what mine is, and way more security conscious.

       This won't work if the device connects to any form of cellular network. They can correlate cell signal strength with CCTV footage to determine

       I don't know about whether you'll be caught or not - I've no idea what you're doing - it would depend on how interested the entity is in catching you. If you're asking whether you'd be anonymous following the advice herein - the answer is no. The only way you can guarantee anonymity online is by learning enough about computers/networking to the point where you could answer the question yourself. I know that's not the answer you're looking for, but to say anything else would be lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are simply too many variable to give an accurate answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, you're better off with simpler devices: dumb phone, raspberry pi 2 (without wifi). Cut down all possibilities for information leakage.

       I'd have to use common consumer parts with verified images, then detail all of my changes. I'd have to limit any code to the absolute minimum and leave the source on the device, or just publish it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My fear as the remanufacturer, is that the devices/components I receive will be compromised, or their underlying firmware. So I have to make a device that is easy (straight-forward, still complex) to audit.
      </p>
      <p>
       For our UAE and Egyptian friends, they need bullet proof plausible deniability (BTW, great work Signal.) and I'm sure everyone wants that. Also, a lack of evidence that is difficult to destroy (hello storage devices) would probably be a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, one glaring issue in my plans, is the recoverability (that's not a word) of the system in case of internal hardware failure. I plan for it to only work, as-is, while still allowing "unsafe" devices to connect after bootup/decryption + VM instantation. It shouldn't have any data you might want to keep on it, so the loss of data on the devices shouldn't be an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it better to brick the device permanently, or allow for some method of re-authorizing a device during bootup? (probably allowing for trivial bypass of the disk encryption.)

       I thought of a solution that allows me to sleep at night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coordinate with the buyer and setup 2 USB keys. Booting the "Protected Boot Device" with both keys will allow the user to update data that is otherwise "inaccessible" or at least write protected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Booting with either key loads up 1 of 2 profiles for "intended use" of the device. No key means the device will boot into plausible deniability mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which means I took the "brick the device permanently, but..." route.

       Like the old nuclear launch codes. 2 keys. You put in one key and press the button and it locks down, or in this case runs a VM isolated on a separate drive?

       The device that accepts the keys uses them (more accurately, the hardware metadata, and data physically on the USB drive) for deriving the keys needed for accessing encrypted containers on other devices within the same hardware enclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Effectively, when you boot with 1 key, you are accessing all the features of the devices in a "read only; remember nothing" operational mode, that allows for a minimal set of system configuration changes (TBD.)
      </p>
      <p>
       When you boot with both keys, you are in a higher operational mode, one that will let you update firmware, or the VM images (and other software and data.) of the various devices in the enclosure. Without this mode, simple security patching would be a problem (In theory.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Booting with no keys present, will boot the underlying VM on the system for use as a simple "Windows 7" laptop. On this matter, I'll have to coordinate with the buyer, as I'd rather use Linux that "smells right" than actual MS products (licensing!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I think an attainable goal is to allow the operator to make those authentication decisions "live" with only the "security device" needing to "reboot." Obviously, up-time is a goal, and even though this will allow you to "shoot yourself in the foot" it will also allow for more interesting methods of accomplishing your goals. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
       You might set your "laptop" down at Moondollars and connect to their wifi, no USB keys plugged in (PD Mode). You plug in a USB flash drive into the "untrusted" USB hub on "that side" of your device, and load up a VPN. You log in to that VPN, and into say, a jabber service.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there you upload a file to a friend, but you realize you forgot to sign it. So you plug in "the appropriate" (1 of the 2) USB key, probably "push a button" and wait for a few seconds. You then access a file share that has "appeared" in your current VM session (this is the shoot yourself in the foot part.) type in a passphrase, and unlock that private key so you can sign your file. You sign the file, and safely remove your USB key (and the file share vanishes.) and continue with your work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that has obvious security implications, and breaches the trust model. However, that is "the intended use" of the product, eventually. You're still a reboot away from all of those "artifacts" of your connection to that encrypted container, vanishing. Perhaps I can perform this in a more sane manner, by running identical VMs side-by-side, rebooting them as needed to adjust to modifications of the operational mode/level.

       Your comment prompted me to price some of the items I had ignored. I'm currently sitting at about $695 which is about $200 beyond where I want it's cost to be. (This ignores any of the... paranoia features that would cost significantly more just in "material.")
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps a more disposable option, without the hardware redundancies, would be preferable.

       Yeah, that would be a good way to do it, as a guide. The only parts I'm really interested in from the old laptop, are the battery, screen, and kb/pointer combo.

       Here is a quick guide:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Don't use Android.  It listens to everything you do on it and sends it to google, whether you like it or not.  Every android device does this.
       </li>
       <li>
        Apple devices, same issue but to apple
       </li>
       <li>
        Get a knock off laptop, not pad, not tablet, not raspberry pi, not chromebook or any recognizable brand...a chinese rip off type laptop and run TAILS off of a usb stick (asus is ok).
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Make sure the laptop ports are USB3.0 or better and your stick is USB3 or better.
       </li>
       <li>
        Don't sign in to any services because you will deanonymize yourself
       </li>
       <li>
        If you want to publish something sensitive/subversive, install and use freenet ('sudo apt-get install -y freenet').  It is as slow as molasses in january.   You will hate how slow it is.  Be patient, once it's uploaded, it's there so long as someone redownloads it every 6 months or so.
       </li>
       <li>
        If you want to store it for a longer time, consider calling it something lame like kitten.jpg and then uploading it to filebin via Tails' TOR browser
       </li>
      </ul>
