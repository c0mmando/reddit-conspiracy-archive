        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I will go over the last week&#39;s top posts on <a href="/r/Redacted">/r/Redacted</a> and debunk each of them. No cherry picking, if there is one that isn&#39;t sensationalist I will say that it is not sensationalist.  - Obviously articles that are Quotes, Polls or very Broad articles.</p>

<hr/>

<p>For starters: The definition of Sensationalism:</p>

<p>sen·sa·tion·al·ism</p>

<p>(especially in journalism) the use of exciting or shocking stories or language at the expense of accuracy, in order to provoke public interest or excitement.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.redstate.com/jaycaruso/2016/12/13/trumpers-silent-fills-administration-globalists/">Where Is The Outrage? Trumpers Silent As He Fills His Administration With ‘Globalists’</a> - This one is just Extreme. Obvious some Supporters will regret their decision, but once we look at the Approvals, it&#39;s a completely different headline. <a href="https://i.gyazo.com/3acae4a0a987df28a0ff7fd7df1a1aef.png">Here</a> is a picture of the graph showing Trump&#39;s approval. He went from 37.5% to 45.7% within one month. - His support is actually growing, not shrinking, yet the title implies that everyone who voted for him is jumping ship.</p>

<p>And we can see the clear sensationalism when they say &quot;Where is the outrage?&quot; and imply that Trump&#39;s approval is actually shrinking.</p>

<p>Also they say that his picks are globalists, but the article goes on to criticize them for their Wealth, not globalism. </p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/18/leak-rex-tillerson-director-bahamas-based-us-russian-oil-company">Leak reveals Rex Tillerson is director of Bahamas-based US-Russian oil company</a> - Rex Tillerson actually is in the board of Directors of an Exxon branch (Actually a subsidiary <strong>called Exxon Neftgas</strong>) located in Russia. This Exxon branch is owned 30% by Exxon (USA), 30% by &quot;Sakhalin Oil &amp; Gas Development Co. Ltd.&quot; (Japan), 20% by &quot;ONGC Videsh Ltd.&quot; (India), 11.5% by &quot;Sakhalinmorneftegas-Shelf&quot; (Russia), and 8.5% by &quot;RN-Astra&quot; (Russia). <strong>Recap, it&#39;s owned 30% by the US, 30% By India, 20% by Japan, and 20% by Russia. And they say that the guy is the Director of a Russian-American company</strong>. It&#39;s actually an EXXON &#39;Branch&#39; (Exxon is American btw) called Exxon Neftegas. </p>

<p>They claim it was &quot;Found in Leaked Documents&quot;, but we can CLEARLY see that it was reported in their website, <a href="http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/company/about-us/management/rex-w-tillerson">here</a> that he was in the Board of directors for this Exxon subsidiary.</p>

<p>The article says that it was ACTUALLY revealed in a document leaked in 2001, yet I found this PUBLIC article saying he was a director <a href="http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/5/Exxon-Mobil-Corporation.html">here</a> - Also the guy was a director of Exxon, why is it questionable that he was made a director in a subsidiary?</p>

<p>We can see the Sensationalism as they are portraying this connection as something that would make him a Russian asset of sorts, when it&#39;s just a regular business conglomerate between privately-owned companies from different countries. (PS: Russia owns the smallest portion along with Japan).</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-lost-popular-vote-hillary-clinton-us-election-president-history-a7470116.html">Donald Trump has lost popular vote by greater margin than any US President</a> - This one is factually correct, since he won the presidency but lost popular by 2.8 Million - Politically speaking though, Clinton&#39;s ENTIRE difference came from California - She won by 3.2 Million in California, while she won by 2.8 Million in the popular. This is one of the reasons why we have the electoral college, so that not only one State dictates the direction of the country.</p>

<p>Regardless, this one is factually correct, but still sensationalist in the way that they Omit information.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/16/michelle-obama-oprah-winfrey-interview-donald-trump">Michelle Obama: Americans will miss &#39;having a grown-up in the White House&#39;</a> - This one is a quote that was twisted. That&#39;s how far they go to follow their agenda.</p>

<p>Michelle never said that &quot;Americans will miss &#39;having a grown-up in the White House&#39;&quot; She said exactly &quot;<strong>“I feel that Barack has been that for the nation in ways that people will come to appreciate,” she said. “Having a grown-up in the White House who can say to you in times of crisis and turmoil ‘hey it’s going to be OK, let’s remember the good things that we have, let’s look at the future, let’s look at all the things that we’re building’.”</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>They even put it in quotations, Jesus. That&#39;s Clear sensationalism.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://qz.com/862412/trumps-16-cabinet-level-picks-have-more-money-than-a-third-of-american-households-combined/">Trump’s 17 cabinet-level picks have more money than a third of American households combined</a> - This one is also factually correct. Not much to talk about here.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/12/16/record-trump-falsely-claims-no-one-mentioned-russia-before-his-win/95507556/">For the Record: Trump falsely claims W.H. didn&#39;t mention Russia before his win</a> - Do I really have to link the video of Obama talking about how the election can&#39;t possibly be undermined? And Hillary saying that he has to accept the results while failing to do it herself?</p>

<p>Sensationalism, because well obviously SOMEONE will have mentioned Russia, but it was widely disregarded as the entire left said that &quot;It&#39;s not Rigged, he&#39;s just losing&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://www.bet.com/news/national/2016/11/30/trump-tax-subsidy.html">Look: Did The Government Just Give Donald Trump Financial Aid Worth $32 Million For His D.C. Hotel?</a> - This one makes me actually mad. This was upvoted to the top of <a href="/r/Redacted">/r/Redacted</a>. It&#39;s a Subreddit dedicated to Politics and the people don&#39;t know what subsidies are? What is going on?</p>

<p>Sensationalism, it&#39;s a common subsidy, yet they make it sound like Trump used his political power (which is currently unexisting) in order to pay for his hotel. And the top comment is complaining that he didn&#39;t get a salary but is getting this instead - jesus.</p>

<hr/>

<p>These are most of the weekly-top articles regarding Trump that I found that could&#39;ve been sensationalized.</p>

<p>We can see that the majority of them were, and even the ones that weren&#39;t are omitting information.</p>

<h1>This is exactly how the media is indoctrinating the people who will run our country in 20-30 years.</h1>

<p>Considering that Reddit is mostly browsed by Millennials, it&#39;s definitely working, considering that plenty of them are outright fake, and the others are twisted.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s a shit show. Somehow for all their memeing and &#39;high energy&#39; and walls and trains and the fact that they openly ban any dissenters the doland somehow still manages to have better political discourse and analysis. I&#39;m not even saying this as a Trump fan. I voted the other end of the political spectrum with Jill Stein.</p>

<p>I prefer to think of it as the result of manipulation rather than such an idiotic and shallow user base, but that doesn&#39;t account for the fact that they have so many users. The reality is people like a circle jerk. Edit: Referring  to <a href="/r/redacted">/r/redacted</a> here.</p>

<p>&quot;Chanting and dancing in several separate circles along the beach, the boys are caught up in a kind of frenzy. Even Ralph and Piggy, swept away by the excitement, dance on the fringes of the group. The boys again reenact the hunting of the pig and reach a high pitch of frenzied energy as they chant and dance. Suddenly, the boys see a shadowy figure creep out of the forest—it is Simon. In their wild state, however, the boys do not recognize him. Shouting that he is the beast, the boys descend upon Simon and start to tear him apart with their bare hands and teeth. Simon tries desperately to explain what has happened and to remind them of who he is, but he trips and plunges over the rocks onto the beach. The boys fall on him violently and kill him.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post, well written and backed up by facts. But there are some things that I feel needs to be addressed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where Is The Outrage? Trumpers Silent As He Fills His Administration With ‘Globalists’ - [...] but once we look at the Approvals, it&#39;s a completely different headline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Approval ratings has nothing to do with the fact that the people Trump is picking for his cabinet are globalists and that Trump wanted to remove them from the white house.</p>

<p>A big part of Donald Trumps platform was to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDGJB_jXK_o">&quot;Drain the swamp&quot;</a>, i.e drain away the corruption and money out of the white house caused, supposedly, by globalists <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/745693029089034240">link</a>. Now he&#39;s not in office yet so we can&#39;t look at any legislation he&#39;s passed but judging from his cabinet picks, it&#39;s not looking good. The article mentions four of his picks, Rex Tillerson, Steven Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross and Rick Perry. The explanations as to why those four could be considered globalists are brief to non-existent, but c&#39;mon it&#39;s a 400 word opinion piece. They could all be considered globalists though, so the article is not wrong in calling them such. Feel free to correct me.</p>

<p><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/globalist">Globalist</a>; someone who believes that economic and foreign policy should be planned in an international way, rather than according to what is best for one particular country.</p>

<p>The article finishes with &quot;To be honest, I think many of these picks are quite good. When you want to change the system as Trump claims he wants to do, you bring people in who know the system,...&quot; Maybe he&#39;s right, but the list of reasons why I distrust Trump is just short of light year long, so to me it just looks like he&#39;s filling the swamp rather than draining it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can see the Sensationalism as they are portraying this connection as something that would make him a Russian asset of sorts, when it&#39;s just a regular business conglomerate between privately-owned companies from different countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I agree with most of what you said regarding the supposed &quot;Leak&quot;, this last part is false. The article is quite long and goes on to mention that a sentor has &quot;serious concerns&quot; about allowing him to be SoS and gives numerous reasons why Tillerson would indeed be a &quot;Russian asset of sorts&quot;, among which is a statement he made back in 2014 saying that he does not support the sanctions made against Russia after the annexation of Crimea. Also there is nothing &quot;regular&quot; about Tillersons relationship with Russia, I mean he was given the &quot;Russian Order of Friendship&quot; by Putin himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the reasons why we have the electoral college, so that not only one State dictates the direction of the country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much every president and presidential candidate of late has spoken out against the electoral college. Yes, even Trump did it back in 2014. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k">this video</a> by GCP grey and it explains why the electoral college is poop, you could just skip to 1:50 if you&#39;re short on time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Michelle Obama: Americans will miss &#39;having a grown-up in the White House&#39; - This one is a quote that was twisted. That&#39;s how far they go to follow their agenda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the title is click-bait. And it&#39;s not like it&#39;s an important issue anyway. Why u heft to be mad.</p>

<p>As for the rest, I pretty much agree with it. If only the rest of the posts in r/conspiracy was written like this instead of &quot;Reddit deleting posts that don&#39;t fit the narrative! Two hour old top post in r/all and r/technology removed because it makes the dnc look incompetent!&quot;</p>

<p>By golly do I wish those people would just leave this sub.</p>

<p>Literally 2 lines after. Anyway, I see where you&#39;re coming from, but I wholeheartedly believe that Trump won&#39;t be corrupt. Let&#39;s be real here, he has pretty much an unlimited amount of money, why would he run for presidency if not to ACTUALLY do good?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t seem like the altruistic guy to me, and so far his actions as PEOTUS hasn&#39;t done anything to convince me. </p>

<ul>
<li>1. He hasn&#39;t and will not put his money in a blind trust.</li>
<li>2. He has not released his tax returns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those two things just boggle my mind as to how he could still become president. But I guess that the vast majority of Americans have no idea what those are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a terrible train of thought. Money and power are different concepts. Corruption is more about wielding your power to benefit yourself than it is about the money.</p>

<p>Trump seems to be driven by power, not money. He won the money game long ago.</p>
