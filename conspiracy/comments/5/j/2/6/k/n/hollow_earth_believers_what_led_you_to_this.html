       Corey Goode talks about it being more honeycomb than hollow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Michael Tellinger discusses this in his show on Gaia.com and has done extensive research on the subject.  In one episode he talks about modern day miners coming across HUGE tunnels that were not artificial cave structures.  These were massive tunnels, deep underground with tile all around (floor, walls, ceiling) and that these miners were told to cover up these tunnels and divert around them.  He ever tells the tale of a few that followed the tunnels for about a mile or so and they came across enormous buried statues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is any of this proof? Nope but there are some people that have researched this subject.

       That makes way more sense. I always thought we've been overly concerned with finding planets whose surface we'd survive on. Why not just drop massive cities underground to protect us from the atmosphere (or lack of).

       Some people are quite convinced that not only do these underground cities exist but people like Corey have said they've taken elevators and visited them.

      <p>
       Having worked for an oil and gas exploration company, I know how pressures and temperatures get when you go 20,000' and more beneath the surface of the earth.  I mean we can experience a similar phenomena by diving to the deep end of a pool of water or the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never really heard anyone explain how someone can live in the inner earth and address this pressure and temperature issue to my satisfaction.  But when you think about how big the earth is, it's not that difficult to conceive of a honeycomb structure.

       It's always easier to let imagination take precedence over reasoning. The implications that a hollow or honeycombed earth interior would have are extreme. It would mean much of the science we have grown up learning is falsified, to some extent. Not only that, but it would mean there are a significant number of people that must know something or other about this "reality", that have all chosen not to speak publicly about it. All supposed whistleblowers so far seem to falter in their ability to speak specifics and/or provide any evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, lying to the public is not something unheard of. Just look at HAARP. The US government and possibly others have at least some capacity in their ability to manipulate the weather, arguably the results of which are damaging the magnetosphere to a degree that they can blame all effects on "climate change", which I find very hard to believe.

       You're welcome but don't be too quick to dismiss their work.  I mean sure Corey Goode and Michael Tellinger are quite different.  Corey doesn't really offer any proof of his claims other than his own experiences.  However MT has some amazing findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think these things start out as theories and most people dismiss them but people like MT start asking themselves, "What if this stuff is real?" and then start looking for information and evidence that it might actually be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's done a lot of research about gold production throughout history and how there are all these stone circles down in South Africa and what they might mean.  These studies led him to finding all sorts of different artifacts and he just keeps researching and looking for more and more information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of his research into giant humans is also quite interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of strange things that are stubbornly resistant to being dismissed once you've done some research.

       The best way to disprove a theory is to try your absolute best to first prove it real.

       That said, I have found many more sources indicating the existence of giants than I would expect for a theory promoted as false.

       Looking into some of Goode's stuff, he seems a bit sensationalist to me. Also no evidence presented other than his written accounts. For being in the midst of such advanced technology, he hasn't done a very good job proving its existence.

       Well that's if one is assuming that one has access to all of the data one needs to arrive at a proof.  With information that has been lost, subverted, obfuscated or destroyed then it's silly to think that one can reach a true conclusion without gathering more data.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm basically describing the difference between scientific proofs and investigatory data gathering.  During investigations the investigator simply gathers data and chases down all leads and over time, hopefully a theory about the truth will emerge which one can then start to form into a more scientific proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that regard, I think a search for truth is a better premise than to stake a position and then trying to either confirm or deny that position because the initial premise can't help but color the findings unless one is extraordinarily rigorous.  Most people think they are but really aren't.

       Oh man I agree and while I like watching David and Corey's show, Cosmic Disclosure, it would be great if they would offer up some proof.  But then again, that's been the difficult for a great many things.

       I know some gold miners in NM who have been very deep. He was telling me of some huge caverns in NV, the gold mines in the Ortiz mtns, and near Jemez Mtns near Santa Fe. Big enough to fly a Cessna around. The lava tubes under the Jemez are big enough you could hide a whole city down the and no one would know, which, incidentally, is what they did. Isn't coincidence the Los Alamos Labs are right above.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also heard tell there is a cobblestone road from the Caballos Mtns to white sands. There are many stories about those Mtns... People are still protecting them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, remember the emergence myths of the Hopi and Navajo, and others. They might not have stayed for generations, but the stories do say they lived underground fit many years.

       I was very young, not yet a teenager, when he told me this. I remember him telling me that the earth was hollow and was inhabited by "aliens". There was no internet then, and mainstream media was the only news source. The three network channels and the daily newspaper provided all of our news. He was a voracious reader, so I'm assuming that he got most of his information from books. He was very open minded and never lost his sense of curiosity and awe. He taught me to always search for the truth. Off topic, I know,  but immediately after Kennedy was assassinated, he told me that he thought the CIA was responsible. When I went through his things after he died, I found two file cabinets, four drawers each, full of research information about the assassination. I guess my upbringing is responsible for my view that "conspiracy" is most often the actual truth.

       Interesting. We do live in a society where the terms "conspiracy" and "falsity" have grown to be one and the same to many, I suspect as a result of just one of many long term psyops operations conducted by the CIA. So much so that labeling yourself as a "conspiracy theorist" or being labeled as one is very nearly the equivalent of losing any credibility, unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the topic of Kennedy, a number of things could have happened, though I'm afraid I haven't yet researched it to any great extent. I wouldn't be surprised if his hit was ordered by those who felt threatened by his trajectory to break up the Fed, but again, I can't corroborate much yet. Just speculation at this point for me.

       Look. We all know that r/conspiracy has been infiltrated by bad actors with two goals: one, spread donald trump propaganda, and two, tear down a community that would have been a threat due to its independent and insightful analysis of wrongdoing by TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that the infiltration started at the mod level. Who were the most recent mods to join? Who made the decision to select them? When did the mods start pushing the donald trump narrative, and who were the ones that started it?

       edit: note, after my original post there was a concerted effort to "prove me wrong" by mysterious accounts that engaged on the issue. I would start by investigating those accounts.

       If the Earth were hollow it would be easy to scientifically verify. For instance, when the Tsar Bomba went off, our seismometers all over the world would have shown data that would have confirmed it.

       Sure. The bomb was so large (~50MT, and, had they proceeded as designed, the bomb could have eclipsed ~100MT, which is just an
       <em>
        insane
       </em>
       amount of energy), that the shockwave circumnavigated the  glove
       <em>
        three
       </em>
       times. Had the Earth been hollow, the results in the seismometers would have shown extremely unusual results. Scientists use seismometer data collected from major earthquakes around the globe to 3D model their ideas of what the inner core of the Earth looks like. It's an evolving science, but, no credible scientists subscribe to the theory. For instance, look at plate tectonics—they wouldn't function they way we know they do, floating and moving around over time (which we know from both the geological and fossil records) if the Earth were hollow.

       I don't think a truly hollow earth would function to any degree, as the entire thing would collapse in on itself. However, would it be possible to detect a honeycombed interior? Say large pockets of space located in the earth. Also how would you go about disproving the idea that the center of gravity is "really" located only a short way down, as opposed to the center of the planet? Thanks for the input.
