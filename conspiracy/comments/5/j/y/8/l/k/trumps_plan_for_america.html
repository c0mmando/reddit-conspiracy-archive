        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m becoming more and more convinced that Trump is trolling the conservative Christians with Nazi ideology. It&#39;s playing out so perfectly that I&#39;m humbled by the pure genius of it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent tons of time gathering intel from within and what I&#39;ve discovered is that the majority of his supporters are strongly anti-muslim (due to his doom and gloom Islamic terrorist propaganda) but have somehow wised up to not viewing Russia as the enemy. They claim the liberals/Democrats are on some Hitler/Stalin/Marxist agenda of ridding the US of Christianity and installing Islamic ideology/Sharia law. They hold the constitution as higher or higher that their Bible but ignore all of the rules/laws about being tolerant. Their solution? Kick out everyone with differing viewpoints and close the borders. Make the US racially and religiously &#39;pure&#39;. </p>

<p>As terrifying as his supporters are - none of this seems to line up with his statements/actions in the decades leading up to his campaign. It&#39;s become obvious to me that Trump is insanely intelligent. Throughout the election, I wrote him off as a racist/sexist bafoon (mainly due to the MSM&#39;s portrayal of him) but if you go back to the start - everyone recognized him as a troll (which was the main reason cited for dismissing his campaign). </p>

<p>More than anything, he is able to lock onto people&#39;s weaknesses/flaws and expose them. He did it to &quot;Lying Ted&quot;, &quot;Little Marco&quot;, &quot;Corrupted Hillary/Killary&quot;, the MSM, etc. </p>

<p>As an atheist - it&#39;s always been apparent to me that he&#39;s likely a fellow atheist who is merely pretending to be a Christian. More and more I envied his ability to not only blend into the conservative Christian base - but to become their leader. If this is true - then why would he be so religiously intolerant? </p>

<p>The major reason for the disdain for Hitler/Nazi Germany and Joseph Stalin/Communism seems to be that they were atheists who wanted to rid their country of religion - yet his supporters are self-proclaimed patriots who want to remove everyone who isn&#39;t Christian while hailing our atheistic founding fathers as champions of justice.</p>

<p>There&#39;s way too much Irony for his campaign to be a serious movement. I&#39;m more convinced than ever that he is the greatest troll of all time.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll need a quote to be believed.  I heard &quot;go after&quot; the families which is necessary and doesn&#39;t include torturing anybody. In Russia they take out the entire family and in the short term it&#39;s highly effective. The USA only does things like that in secret. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t trust people how can you trust your mistrust of people? Besides, nothing can tip the balance between on and off. On, goodness, light will always be a greater force.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald J. Trump received an ovation when he announced that he would donate office space to Mr. Jackson&#39;s civil rights group, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, in 40 Wall Street, a 72-story building he is renovating.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;He&#39;s out there pushing for a lot of good things,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Trump, who noted that he and Mr. Jackson had become good friends over the years.</p>

<p>I think this post by Sub7Agent has some good speculation.  I don&#39;t have any objections or hipster derision for the phrase &quot;gathering intel from within&quot; and I think that such derision from alleged members of this subreddit is intended to deter serious researchers here from thinking of themselves as strategic intelligence gatherers.</p>

<p>I would only modify the speculation to propose that Trump is not a soloist troll, but instead part of a team following a specific plan with specific goals.</p>
