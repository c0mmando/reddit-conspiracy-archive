       I'm becoming more and more convinced that Trump is trolling the conservative Christians with Nazi ideology. It's playing out so perfectly that I'm humbled by the pure genius of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've spent tons of time gathering intel from within and what I've discovered is that the majority of his supporters are strongly anti-muslim (due to his doom and gloom Islamic terrorist propaganda) but have somehow wised up to not viewing Russia as the enemy. They claim the liberals/Democrats are on some Hitler/Stalin/Marxist agenda of ridding the US of Christianity and installing Islamic ideology/Sharia law. They hold the constitution as higher or higher that their Bible but ignore all of the rules/laws about being tolerant. Their solution? Kick out everyone with differing viewpoints and close the borders. Make the US racially and religiously 'pure'.
      </p>
      <p>
       As terrifying as his supporters are - none of this seems to line up with his statements/actions in the decades leading up to his campaign. It's become obvious to me that Trump is insanely intelligent. Throughout the election, I wrote him off as a racist/sexist bafoon (mainly due to the MSM's portrayal of him) but if you go back to the start - everyone recognized him as a troll (which was the main reason cited for dismissing his campaign).
      </p>
      <p>
       More than anything, he is able to lock onto people's weaknesses/flaws and expose them. He did it to "Lying Ted", "Little Marco", "Corrupted Hillary/Killary", the MSM, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an atheist - it's always been apparent to me that he's likely a fellow atheist who is merely pretending to be a Christian. More and more I envied his ability to not only blend into the conservative Christian base - but to become their leader. If this is true - then why would he be so religiously intolerant?
      </p>
      <p>
       The major reason for the disdain for Hitler/Nazi Germany and Joseph Stalin/Communism seems to be that they were atheists who wanted to rid their country of religion - yet his supporters are self-proclaimed patriots who want to remove everyone who isn't Christian while hailing our atheistic founding fathers as champions of justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's way too much Irony for his campaign to be a serious movement. I'm more convinced than ever that he is the greatest troll of all time.

       The "proof" is via propaganda/hidden commentary throughout news articles/opinion pieces but the comment section of these articles is fairly indicitive.

       The claim/propaganda is that they were raised religiously and that their atheism led to their oppressive regimes.

      <p>
       Atheists and the non-religiously-affiliated make up 0.1% of the US's prison population and 22.8% of it's general population, however.

       You'll need a quote to be believed.  I heard "go after" the families which is necessary and doesn't include torturing anybody. In Russia they take out the entire family and in the short term it's highly effective. The USA only does things like that in secret.

       Yea, government corruption via special interest groups both foreign and domestic has been rampant in US politics since at least Eisenhower's era. I voted for Hillary and supported Obama because at least they were socially responsible domestically but to act like Bush/republicans/conservatives weren't responsible for the false flags that brought us into Iraq and Afghanistan is just being politically polarized and ignorant.

       I think this post by Sub7Agent has some good speculation.  I don't have any objections or hipster derision for the phrase "gathering intel from within" and I think that such derision from alleged members of this subreddit is intended to deter serious researchers here from thinking of themselves as strategic intelligence gatherers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would only modify the speculation to propose that Trump is not a soloist troll, but instead part of a team following a specific plan with specific goals.
