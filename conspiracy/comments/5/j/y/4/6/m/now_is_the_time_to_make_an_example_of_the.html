<p>On MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Tuesday, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway announced that Trump will not pursue criminal charges against Hillary Clinton—reneging on the promise Trump made during the second presidential debate to have a special prosecutor look into Clinton’s activities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wtf are you smoking? You&#39;re just regurgitating what the liberal media spoon fed everyone throughout the election...</p>

<p>-repatriation of trillions
-20 fucking percent tax cuts
-repealling needless regulations that hurt jobs and our economy
-tapping into our natural resources via clean coal and  safe drilling into our untapped oil
-getting foreign lobbying out of washington
-prohibiting congress and senators from taking lobbying positions after serving
-enforcing the laws that we currently have on immigration
-building a wall
-acknowledging that we have a problem with islamic extremism and taking action to prevent attacks, unlike our current administration 
-put more money into our joke of an education system, particularly in inner cities and poverty stricken areas
-keep companies from going overseas and get america to increase domestic manufacturing
-repealling and replacing obamacare</p>

<p>I could honestly keep going... but for real you got to do some research before spewing nonsense on the internet. To say that he had no substance is just beyond ignorant... especially in contrast to his opponent.</p>

<p>What was Hillary&#39;s substance? She had none. Her own team was saying that she has no core values, no real plan, and no real stances on anything. She even said to wall street bankers not to worry about what she is telling people because she&#39;s lying to them in order to get votes, and that she will stay loyal to the bankers. Thank god for wikileaks.</p>
