        On MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Tuesday, Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway announced that Trump will not pursue criminal charges against Hillary Clinton—reneging on the promise Trump made during the second presidential debate to have a special prosecutor look into Clinton’s activities.

       I'm still giving Trump the BOTD on the grounds that if he tries to say he's planning to do anything while obama is still in office, obama will throw pardons around like hillary was thrown into her van like a side of beef. If Trump is for real, he's playing a dangerous game here.

       Well trump doesn't have the ability to do that. He can apply pressure, but the truth of the matter is that going after clinton fully, implicates so many government officials that it's going to be tough, and dangerous to do.  He's just another elite that got what he wanted so I don't expect it from him anyway.   Truth hurts

       Read her words and read his, shes says he wont pursue charges but will have a special prosecutor take a look. If said prosecutor perhaps finds something illegal than charges would be filed. Read between the lines they never said they were not going after Clinton...

       He got elected for a lot of reasons. People that voted for him just because of rhetorical slogans chanted are stupid.
But at least trump's had some substance, unlike his opponent who's slogan was "i have a vagina". Pretty sexist if you ask me.

       Wtf are you smoking? You're just regurgitating what the liberal media spoon fed everyone throughout the election...
      </p>
      <p>
       -repatriation of trillions
-20 fucking percent tax cuts
-repealling needless regulations that hurt jobs and our economy
-tapping into our natural resources via clean coal and  safe drilling into our untapped oil
-getting foreign lobbying out of washington
-prohibiting congress and senators from taking lobbying positions after serving
-enforcing the laws that we currently have on immigration
-building a wall
-acknowledging that we have a problem with islamic extremism and taking action to prevent attacks, unlike our current administration 
-put more money into our joke of an education system, particularly in inner cities and poverty stricken areas
-keep companies from going overseas and get america to increase domestic manufacturing
-repealling and replacing obamacare
      </p>

       I could honestly keep going... but for real you got to do some research before spewing nonsense on the internet. To say that he had no substance is just beyond ignorant... especially in contrast to his opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was Hillary's substance? She had none. Her own team was saying that she has no core values, no real plan, and no real stances on anything. She even said to wall street bankers not to worry about what she is telling people because she's lying to them in order to get votes, and that she will stay loyal to the bankers. Thank god for wikileaks.

       Is it better to burn your energy trying to "blame" a bad actor in a bad system, or is it better to burn your energy trying to make the bad system not as bad, so that the rate of bad actor production decreases, or is it better to burn your energy exploring and understanding the bad system, or is it better to burn your energy in exploiting or gumming up the bad system so as to decrease its capacity to do bad things?

       your country has an entire prison industry designed to stifle and imprison the voices of those who dissent or who otherwise aren't capable of navigating the system.  they're imprisoning dumb and poor people.  do you really expect the master's tools to destroy the master's house?
      </p>
      <p>
       it's much easier to just not engage the system, and to make yourself a prickly pear if they choose to engage you.  it's much easier to remove yourself and to regroup with likeminded.  why engage a machine that is designed to kill.

       Her parents are dethroned criminals, a few moves away from criminal indictment for fraud, money laundering, influence peddling and treason.

       She's married to the son of a convicted funds embezzler. (Who's not really to blame, but has recently lost millions of investor's money)

       the "It's them jews" argument?

       Your argument is diluted when you lump it under partisanship or religious/nationalist constrictions.

       But in order for the 'make an example of them' to work, it has to be seen as a legitimate process and not perceived as a political witch hunt.  Clear evidence of their crimes must be brought to the light of day so even her most loyal supporters are sickened and finally understand why she is so loathed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also note that Obama is starting down this same 'Foundation' road, so we need to send a clear message that repeating Clinton crimes will not be tolerated.

       Clinton won't be prosecuted unless it is deemed necessary to calm the rage of the masses. A petition will do very little if anything. And if she is prosecuted and convicted, after the masses believe she has been sent to prison, she will be allowed to retire to some private island with a steady supply of cheese pizza.

       The peasants grabbed their pitchforks in 1776 and routed their overlords. Two decades later, the Rothchilds and the Bank of England came back in disguise and co-opted the financial system. We are still living under it, in spite of Kennedy's best efforts.
