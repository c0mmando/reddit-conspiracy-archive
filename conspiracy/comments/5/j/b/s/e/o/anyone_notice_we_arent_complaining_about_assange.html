<p>You would think that at least the WhereIsAssange crew would be asking that daily, right?   </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been going in circles wondering where the leaks are from, and what this guy said and what that guy said and what insurance file is from where and what the hash of this is.... But, Assange can&#39;t even upload a selfie to facebook right now. I think the proof of life thing and leak sources et al. would be solved with just the flick of an internet switch.  </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>edit: that got me downvotes quick. But look at the evidence and tell me otherwise:</p>

<p>So 6 years ago, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/1026/WikiLeaks-ready-to-drop-a-bombshell-on-Russia.-But-will-Russians-get-to-read-about-it">Wikileaks was about to drop a ton of info on Russia.</a> But nothing was ever released, probably because the FSB publicly <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/11/01/russias-fsb-to-wikileaks-we-could-destroy-you/">said they could shut down Wikileaks permanently</a>. I wonder what they said privately.</p>

<p>In January 2011 (only a few months later), <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/assange-wikileaks-russian-visa/">Assange is given a Russian visa</a>. The following year his show on RT begins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree, but why did <em>we</em> stop complaining about his internet? I&#39;m thinking we&#39;ve been played well by shills. Since Nov.8 we&#39;ve been worked hard over so many topics in this sub, and fought so many debates and I think a lot of it was to distract us from the fact that Assange still has no internet. </p>

<p>Likewise, WL isn&#39;t complaining about it either. Why is the WL twitter feed no longer whining about it, and why are we not bugging the shit out of WL twitter?</p>

<p>I think this is a very interesting aspect of the whole issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to question his life/death. I&#39;m curious about why we have forgotten his internet. We seem to have stopped complaining about it a month ago. Also, it&#39;s the easiest pressure to put on TPTB because a promise was made they haven&#39;t kept it. If public pressure forces Ecuador to turn on his internet then we should start to see verifiable hash keys thereby proving life. If the internet is on and those hashes dont show up its more evidence for the death theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those shifts in the video indicate that it was edited using common software such as Adobe Premiere Pro. It doesn&#39;t tell us anything about what was edited out (it could be some words, or just a cough) and it certainly doesn&#39;t mean the whole interview is fake. The morph cut effect is simply a way to edit video without a sudden jump:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Morphs mid-sentence may just cut out &quot;er...&quot;, &quot;um...&quot; etc. It does seem unwise to use this technique on an interview that that&#39;s going to attract this kind of scrutiny though.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, those things are all very suspicious and I don&#39;t know who to trust these days. Something odd may very well have happened to Wikileaks. But I just don&#39;t think examining the pixels of this interview is evidence one way or another. Morph cuts don&#39;t lend any weight to claims that this is faked video, that it&#39;s not really him, or that it wasn&#39;t recorded on the day they say it was. Morph cuts have no bearing on those claims.</p>

<p>As for the threat of doing so... being shot while there would be complete vindication of everything the man has ever said. It would prove that he is so dangerous by the way of speaking the truth that he has to be taken out by the elites. He would prove without a doubt his legitimacy. They would reveal themselves to be oppressors and would have a revolution at their doorsteps and potentially a guillotine at their necks by dawn.</p>

s surrounding his connection being cut, the strange RT interview and the obvious changes to the twitter accounts dialogue at least warrant for proof of life. Quit shilling, a time stamped selfie would silence most people questioning his whereabouts. An interview would put the entire conspiracy theory to rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very reasonable stance to have, if more people discussed it in that way the facts would be grabbing people&#39;s attention not just the &quot;Assange is dead&quot; headline. It would help to cut through all of this fake news criticism. But that fact is there is nothing any external look at this is issue can do to help convince many that Assange isn&#39;t in fact dead or in custody. The only proof will need to come from the man himself or a government owning up and saying they&#39;ve got him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been very concerned about the status of Julian Assange over the past several weeks, but the Hannity interview was actually quite convincing for me. It&#39;s not real proof of life, sure, but it felt like it was really him in a fairly natural way.  </p>

<p>I am starting to believe the rumours that he has been laying low and watching the situation unfold during the current transition of power. Notice the new insurance file the day before the electoral college vote? That felt like the old days. Everything changed with the election. The counter-coup is working and WikiLeaks will show its full force again when it is needed to apply pressure against the political/criminal machine that tried to install Clinton.</p>

<p>But these are just my feelings and I encourage everyone to continue exploring every possibility.</p>

<p>Of course PGP only proves you have the keys, when only one person should have those keys and the password to them, it does a &#39;pretty good&#39; job of proving identity.

<p>From the transcript:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ASSANGE: I&#39;m not sure what passwords of being referred to...Look, there&#39;s a lot people not very informed about computer security, making claims.</p>

<p><strong>PGP keys don&#39;t prove anything - the person who has control over the key has control over the key. So if the question is &#39;Does someone using a WikiLeaks PGP key say anything at all?&#39; What it says is that that person has control over that key, that it&#39;s (...) else</strong>, and the concern amongst people, well some people, is that because of my lack of visibility that WikiLeaks has been taken over by..</p>

<p>NAUFAL: ... The CIA ...</p>

<p>ASSANGE: ...etcetera etcetera, which false. It&#39;s an understandable concern if you&#39;re not looking at the details about who&#39;s been visiting me</p>

<p>Of course signing with a key only proves you have control over that key, not that you are you. He talks about WikiLeaks key and his own key as separate things. WikiLeaks&#39; key, obviously, needs to be shared (even if indirectly through and automated stem).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well think about it.</p>

<p>The global elites have be controlling WL for a long time now.</p>

<p>i mean do you think they would of let all that stuff about HRC come out if they thought it would hurt them? no ofc not.</p>

<p>They wanted it to come out, they wanted her to look bad so the DJT would get elected. Why? Easy, they know people were catching on to them and if they elected HRC then it would be to much attention drawn to them. every one would be watching HRC and by extension them.</p>

<p>So now with DJT elected, well he is perfect distraction. they can keep going along in the shadows.</p>

<p>and so WL has ran its course. they dont need it anymore so why keep drawing attention to it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are complaining using #proofoflife on Facebook and Twitter. Reddit controls it by deleting the comments or unleashing CTR on anyone who questions the narrative. </p>

<p>One example happened just yesterday in The_Donald: <a href="https://sli.mg/7f6VsN">https://sli.mg/7f6VsN</a></p>

<p>Look now and you&#39;ll see its there. OP wasn&#39;t notified it was deleted and it wasn&#39;t restored until I sent it to the wikileaks/the Donald Twitter accounts asking why they had removed it if nothing was wrong with yesterday&#39;s release. Believe whatever you want but this looks shady to me and I&#39;m waiting to see Julian and real proof of life before downloading anything from them.  </p>

Furthermore he would be able to communicate on his own chosen avenues, not those controlled and monitored by a state.

    <div class="md"><p>The balcony isn&#39;t solid proof... The balcony (from pics) appears to be on second story. That&#39;s not too far, but due to &quot;security concerns&quot; I&#39;m sure media and concerned bystanders would be kept a healthy distance away. Any decent impersonator and a good makeup artist could easily dupe us. Don&#39;t get me wrong it would definitely be a step in the right direction, but it would take MANY small steps like that (such as a more active &quot;embassy cat&quot; account on Twitter) to make me believe their POL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conversation was hijacked by people pushing the &quot;Assange is dead&quot;/&quot;Assange is captured&quot; narrative.  There was even a stickied post here pushing that nonsense in order to distract from the issue at hand, which is that as Assange was slowly demonstrating that he could actually play a significant role in the US election, his primary mode of communication was significantly restricted.</p>

<p>This is simply yet another example of distraction/conjecture theorists pushing absolute nonsense in order to detract from what is actually going on.  What&#39;s most unfortunate is how quickly this was all lapped up here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree, but why did <em>we</em> stop complaining about his internet? I&#39;m thinking we&#39;ve been played well by shills. Since Nov.8 we&#39;ve been worked hard over so many topics in this sub, and fought so many debates and I think a lot of it was to distract us from the fact that Assange still has no internet. </p>

<p>Likewise, WL isn&#39;t complaining about it either. Why is the WL twitter feed no longer whining about it, and why are we not bugging the shit out of WL twitter?</p>

<p>I think this is a very interesting aspect of the whole issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s supremely suspicious of the fact that he won&#39;t go out on the balcony. We just want legit undisputable proof of life. Answering some questions from the balcony or out the window and that would suffice. Otherwise it could just as easily be an impersonator on the interviews.</p>

<p>As for the threat of doing so... being shot while there would be complete vindication of everything the man has ever said. It would prove that he is so dangerous by the way of speaking the truth that he has to be taken out by the elites. He would prove without a doubt his legitimacy. They would reveal themselves to be oppressors and would have a revolution at their doorsteps and potentially a guillotine at their necks by dawn.</p>

<p>If Julian still lives he needs to dispel his fellow anarchists&#39; fears about his safety.   </p>

<p>He may die but he would do so as a hero unrivaled in the modern canon. I would hope that he would see that and take the risk.</p>
