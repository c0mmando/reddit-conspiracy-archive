<p><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/N8SHp">https://imgur.com/gallery/N8SHp</a></p>

<p>The backside of the podeum shows no damage, no bullet holes. The floor also has no bullet holes. There&#39;s 5 spent shells and 2 other small objects, possible shells. No blood. The front of the Ambassodor&#39;s chest is undisturbed, no exit wounds anywhere. </p>

<p>The second thing that seems odd about this, is the location of whoever took the picture. They are further back in the room than the ambassador. Compare to the original video, that corner of the room is empty during the the same &quot;time frame&quot; we gun man&#39;s position suggests we are seeing. Is the photographer further off to the right? Or was the video shot and then they did multiple takes for the still camera people to capture images?</p>

<p>And he was shot in the back..presumably with a full clip. Given the force of emptying a full clip in the time it should have taken him to collapse like a rag doll from dying such a fast death as to cause no blood. He wouldn&#39;t have fallen backward with his arms splayed out like a Christmas turkey. He would have shifted toward a collapsed fetal position.</p>

There is a difference between your personal perception and actual facts...... and how does simply being in the navy make you an expert death position? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna sit here and Google dead bodies but I will google knocked out fighters because we see them drop like a sack of potatoes and land like this this all the time, and it seems like if someone can get hit with a punch and land in a similar position as the ambassador, it would only be plausible that after having a magazine unloaded into your torso you could fall a similar way.........</p>

<p>Did the shooter not get really shot and killed by police as well?  Was that faked?</p>

<p>Not saying &quot;there&#39;s no way this was a false flag attack&quot;, but...I&#39;m not sure this didn&#39;t really happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that &quot;if&quot; it is a false flag, the images of the shooter lying dead, would be fake as well. And the Ambassador could be a CIA asset for all we know. I&#39;m sure, giving the choice, yes he would choose relocation and some plastic surgery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Western PTB have absolutely NOOOO qualms against <em>actually</em> killing people in false flag attacks though.  That&#39;s how these folks operate.  As such, this could indeed be a false flag attack <em>and</em> the deaths were also real as well.</p>

<p>Sort of like 911.  That was 100% a false flag attack.</p>

<p>3,000 people really <em>did</em> get killed in one fell swoop though.</p>

<p>Again, the people perpetrating false flag attacks have zero problem making sure people end up dead in order to really sell their false flags - so this was either an actual terrorist attack and both people are actually dead...or this might have been a false flag attack...and both people are still actually dead.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my perspective on it anyway though.  I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s no way they can&#39;t still be alive.  Who tf knows at this point?  W/all the chicanery and lies and deceit?  Sure.  Maybe they <em>are</em> both still alive.  Maybe they&#39;re both at a bar somewhere having a drink and laughing about what a funny trick they just pulled off together.  I don&#39;t even know at this point...</p>

<p>Would you be able to identify the man if he walked by you on the street tomorrow? Would the average Argentinian or Ecuadorian or whatever be able to identify the man?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might have been true years ago, but I don&#39;t think so much any more - not with so many successful independent internet journalists and investigators that have come up.  I feel <em>somebody</em> would be bound to catch him walking down the street and, say, covertly take a picture of him, and post it online saying &quot;Hey.  Just saw this man walking down the street the other day.  Looks eerily like the Russian dude who supposedly just got shot.  Might be nothing, but maybe everybody here could help get to the bottom of this.&quot;</p>

<p>Next thing you know you have an entire global army of independent investigators crawling through every pixel of that uploaded picture and comparing the facial features w/those of the actual dude.</p>

<p>I think he&#39;d get found out in no time in today&#39;s world - different hairdo or not.</p>

If this was a squib, then the FX guy that timed it(Them) was brilliant. Also not all dead bodies gush blood even after 5 shots. Shock alone is enough to put a person out cold, well before they&#39;re dead. This man was killed, patsie, or pawn doesn&#39;t matter. False flag?

<p>Clothing ripples outward <strong>with bullet and material.</strong></p>

<p>Then why is there no blood at all? Assuming that you mean blood/flesh by material. If not, what do you mean? Because you have already mentioned the clothing and bullet, so what else is left?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s why I think it&#39;s a false flag:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s too neat. </li>
</ul>

<p>Ambassador gets shot 9/10 times, no blood. </p>

<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C0D4G61W8AA_adx.jpg">Assassin gets shot</a>, blood everywhere? Also, I cannot find any other photos/video of assassin getting shot. Why not? The cameras were already there and in place. </p>

<ul>
<li>If <a href="https://sli.mg/zDo1Kb">this</a> is because</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s blown open by the force of the bullet hitting his body.. Not some wind/gas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there has to be some blood in the front of his shirt, because of the exit wound. If the shirt wasn&#39;t blown open/puffed up because of the bullet, what caused it? </p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>According to witness at the site, the gunman suddenly rushed behind Karlov and shot, then Karlov fell to the ground. The gunman also shot at spectators at the site, according to a witness.</p>

<p>“He (the gunman) firstly pointed his gun to the ambassador, then turned his gun to us. We lay prone on the ground because of panic. I saw the gunman pointed his gun to the ceiling, and the ambassador fell down,” said a witness. <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/live-russian-ambassador-shot-dead-9486164">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.trbimg.com/img-58583691/turbine/chi-ambassador-assassination-wre0045340148-20161219">expressions</a> on their faces reminds me of other false flags. Some are not even looking at the gunman, and some look bored. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/UJprFOG.jpg">This photo</a> (credit u/teslasmuse). Is this how you would behave if there was a gunman/assassin (who just killed someone) behind you? They look like they just got out of a boring work meeting while the shooter is still talking behind them AFTER KILLING SOMEONE.</li>
</ul>

<p>But what do I know, I&#39;m just an asshole on the internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How long does it take for us to usually get the full story when shit like this goes down? Usually days. This happened on live tv. Within minutes they had photos released, including an image of his police computer login or something. If these pictures were taken on digital cameras, wouldn&#39;t they have to be dumped onto laptops via sd cards and uploaded. They were available almost immediately after the video aired live, including the shooters dead body. It seemed like they had these shots in advance. And let&#39;s be realistic, they look phenomenal. No shaky hands or shaky cell phone footage. I find the speed in which the public was supplied with all the photo evidence is unprecedented. They had the guy&#39;s name, and two dead bodies soon as the story hit the air. Screems false flag or psy op to me. Clear message to Russia.</p>

<p>Clothing ripples outward <strong>with bullet and material.</strong></p>

<p>Then why is there no blood at all? Assuming that you mean blood/flesh by material. If not, what do you mean? Because you have already mentioned the clothing and bullet, so what else is left?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was trying to discern what the white flash was as well. It&#39;s hard to see in the video, at first I thought it was a bullet passing.
