    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm, this is worrying. I&#39;ve been lurking in various places following this so here&#39;s my explanation of what&#39;s been going on:</p>

<p>It&#39;s widely theorized that Julian Assange was rendered on October 16/17. This triggered a Dead Man&#39;s Switch - an automatic release of Phase 3 of Wikileaks leaks this year. But to prevent tampering with the information, he&#39;s hidden the information in the Bitcoin blockchain. As well as transaction information, Bitcoin allows you to include files in a transaction. So what happened is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Julian didn&#39;t check in by Friday</li>
<li>Wikileaks automatically spent nearly all of its bitcoins sending payments around the network</li>
<li>included in those payments were damning leaks on - I believe - 9/11 and Tavistock. </li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the way Bitcoin works, those leaks have now been replicated to every single box on the network that &#39;mines&#39; or verifies transactions. The blockchain is basically a giant ledger of every transaction that&#39;s ever been made. It&#39;s a big file (100Gb) made of blocks that the whole network needs to verify (I&#39;m skipping the details a bit). The point is that no one entity is large enough to take over the whole Bitcoin network because it requires too much processing power. This means that the blockchain is a place where you can store things that a) cannot be deleted and b) cannot be tampered with. Cablegate was released like this and is still there of course, encrypted and split up over many transactions. </p>

<p>So what a bunch of groups have been doing is scanning the blockchain for transactions originating from and to Wikileaks from Oct 17 to Oct 29 to see if they can find the files and the instructions for decoding them. It&#39;s like putting a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle together where there are tens of thousands of other unrelated pieces in the pile. However they have been making progress. But the closer they get, the more people seem to disappear and the more threads get deleted. And now endchan itself is unavailable. </p>

<p>EDIT: endchan is back up! Current thread is <a href="https://endchan.xyz/POLAK/res/15.html">here</a> where it was before. </p>

<p>EDIT 2: <a href="/u/GlobalHell">/u/GlobalHell</a> makes a very good point <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5jb47r/last_thread_before_endchanxyz_was_taken_down/dbf8jdd/">below</a>. </p>

<p>on the last page it states at 5:24 am (what appears to me to be) that they have discovered (potentially) a discussion that was (potentially) between JA and Satoshi? Which was talking about hiding files in the (74,000) blocks on genesis. </p>

<p>It appears (again catching up to speed) That the conversation was over storing large amounts of data and Bitcoin was in dissidence over them using the blockchain to store the files. (due to bitcoins infancy). (didn&#39;t want to take the heat) as that would destroy them too early in the game. </p>

<p>This led JA to state: NO not the files themselves Just the hashes. </p>

<p>At which point the lights went out. </p>

<p>Others can judge. It is the final page of the 39 page archive, and I can&#39;t say this with validity. However that text string likely (was enough) to kill the website, being the potential magnitude of the working groups discovery; </p>

<p>This is my take on what I am reading. Essentially it appears (to me), that they have found chatter. However their shit is all over the map, and it appears most of what they are doing (in terms of exchanging information is taking place on the TOR network. via .onion domains. </p>

<p>My initial take on this is they are damned close if not there, and someone cut them off pronto. </p>

<p>That is my take on it- </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem! I think they tried but there was a massive concerted effort to try and stop them from going through. The timeline is very suspicious. From <a href="http://pastebin.com/LjtQncaD">here</a>: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Oct 20th/21st: Wikileaks tweets 5 tweets with misspelled words. The incorrect letters spell &quot;HELP HIM&quot;. The Wikileaks twitter has never made a spelling error, let alone 5 in two days.</p></li>
<li><p>Oct 21st: Largest DDoS attack to ever occur on US internet. Wikileaks tweets to imply the attack originates from its supporters, asking them to stop. No evidence supports claim. (Note: Oct 21st is the first Friday after Julian Assange went missing)</p></li>
<li><p>Oct 26th: 4chan users successfully successfully decode their first message in Wikileak&#39;s blockchain(bitcoin). The blockchain is blocked with fees and 43000 unconfirmed transactions appear in the mempool.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That DDoS attack took down the DyN DNS service provider. Afterwards there was a bullshit story about how some insecure Chinese-made internet cameras were exploited to do it. Then the blockchain was clogged with high transaction fees, somewhere around $10 if I remember correctly. </p>

<p>Both of these events point to massive state-sponsored attacks to prevent the Dead Man&#39;s Switch from activating. That 4chan thread was quickly deleted. So was the 8chan one. The endchan group worked away for a while but a couple of people working on software to automate all of this have vanished. And now endchan itself has been taken down. Clearly some very very powerful people are involved and will stop at nothing to prevent these leaks from seeing the light of day. </p>

<p>EDIT: The HELP HIM thing is incorrect. Take it up with the anon who posted it on pastebin :)</p>

<p>Agreed, but I think it&#39;s fun to filter truth from BS, that&#39;s why I&#39;m still on Reddit - Reddit is clearly compromised in every way, with absolutely 0 integrity, and any truth that exists here is by pure accident.</p>

<p>For one,  while I think it&#39;s a nice description and it makes sense to me,  it&#39;s not like we can be certain about how much if any of what he just explained is true.  It could be partially or entirely incorrect. It&#39;s a hypothesis that sounds good,  but it&#39;s not like we can really know at this time if it&#39;s right or not.  </p>

<p>Our ability to predict the future is thus even more lacking due to our lack of clear and verifiable information about both the past and present.  I&#39;d be wary of anyone who claims they can accurately predict what&#39;ll happen next.  Best anyone can do is hypothesize with varying degrees of certainty.  </p>

<p>Yep. Please don&#39;t take my word for it (seriously). This is just my interpretation of the events since mid-October. I think it&#39;s well-informed because I&#39;ve spent many hours on the chans following all this and I can code so I understand what the scripts are doing.

<p>I&#39;m a pretty strong skeptic myself as my default state,  usually all the way up to the end,  but I won&#39;t deny that all of this is very interesting.  Additionally I see most of the relevant conspiracies as being fairly logical and rational.  I don&#39;t really see any flaws in your interpretation of the known data points or their connections,  so even as I remain skeptical I hardly have anything to argue about.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d really not bother thinking about the implications of the worst case scenarios being true,  so I won&#39;t.  Not like I could do much anyhow... </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to dig through some of the more technical stuff myself as well, if only because I really dig that kind of thing,  but my laptop is broken. I&#39;m a hobbyist cryptographer and have studied information security, so normally I&#39;d be more helpful... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Operation Northwoods:</p>

<p>&quot;a. An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone.</p>

<p>b. Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida. From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will being transmitting on the international distress frequency a &quot;MAY DAY&quot; message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal. This will allow ICAO radio stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the US what has happened to the aircraft instead of the US trying to &quot;sell&quot; the incident.&quot;</p>

<p>Not only is it neither &quot;bullshit&quot; or &quot;insanity&quot;. Our own government spelled out EXACTLY how this could be accomplished in 1962.</p>

<p>I think this guy just doesn&#39;t realize the seriousness of what we&#39;re dealing with, both the content and the mechanism for retrieving it. </p>

<p>For a start, carving files out of the blockchain is not &#39;fake shit.&#39; You can go fetch the Cablegate leaks right now using a simple python script to search a range of transactions. Heck, you can go <a href="http://www.cryptograffiti.info/">here</a> and see real time what hidden messages and images are hidden in the blockchain all the time. Secondly, there were a couple of people on one of the threads that wanted someone just to post the files they discovered somewhere in the open. The answer they were given was: no, find it yourself. So I did. I got a decent machine in Europe, set up a bitcoin miner on it and downloaded the whole blockchain. And their code and their instructions worked. That was good enough for me because the WHOLE POINT of this exercise is that the Wikileaks leaks have not been tampered with. Some anon posting a PDF or a DOC saying it&#39;s a leak is simply not good enough. </p>

<p>Threads really have disappeared. So have regular posters. Massive attacks on the US internet infrastructure and Bitcoin itself have occurred. This all is for real. If some of these kids have felt a bit paranoid, then I don&#39;t blame them really. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I don&#39;t think everyone realizes how close they are or the logistics of what&#39;s happening. This is a lot different than a normal leak. You can&#39;t just find the key and send it to everyone with the torrent, you have to run the program that sorts through the blocks and it gives you raw incompressible data I think.

The second is that this is a full blown war with multiple nation states and their intelligence agencies on the one side and a rag tag bunch of cypherpunks on the other.

<p><a href="/u/BolognaTugboat">/u/BolognaTugboat</a> is correct. If you own half the network plus one, then your version of the blockchain becomes the canonical one and everyone else has to accept it as such eventually. So theoretically, a consortium of miners could mess with the blockchain by deleting a block or double paying themselves and then force everyone else to accept it. This is supposed to be impossible but I&#39;ve seen a recent picture of nine guys on a stage that represented some ridiculous percentage of the world&#39;s mining capacity, certainly more than 50%. </p>

<p>My main issue is that we DO have the technology to convincingly forge audio and video. </p>

<p>I remember there being a lot of speculation towards the end of October that this would be their strategy. That the longer they kept us waiting for POL, the more time they&#39;d have to forge convincing evidence. </p>

<p>Back to Sean Hannity, if that interview had been conducted in October--I&#39;d be less skeptical. It sounded like Julian, but if it were a forgery then they&#39;ve also had plenty of time to work out the kinks. </p>

<p>What makes me the most skeptical have been 1) the massive DDoS 2) the attacks on the blockchain 3)the attacks on the chans and 4) the complex bots spamming anti-conspiracy rhetoric. </p>

<p>To me, those four points confirm that powerful group is conducting some next-level cyber warfare. The scale of the DDoS demonstrates not only an immense technological capability, but also a willingness to, at least partially, reveal their strength.</p>

<p>Now I ask myself, why would someone show their hand like that if this is all bullshit. I mean, if Julian is really safe &#39;n sound in the embassy, and the DMS didn&#39;t go off, why were there attacks on Dyn DNS and the blockchain? Why are there so many shills on the chans/whereisassange?</p>

<p>These lingering questions drive my skepticism. </p>

<p>I think the easiest explanation would be that the DynDNS/blockchain attacks are unrelated. But then that would start a whole new conversation as to what their motives could be. </p>

<p>Currently, I&#39;m trusting Wikileaks but with heavy skepticism. </p>

<p>The radio silence of Appelbaum, Hrafnsson, and others also contributes to this skepticism though. I&#39;m having a hard time understanding why the WL team would coordinate their silence. </p>

<p>If this is all a gov psy-op to discredit Wikileaks, then they&#39;d ostensibly realize both a) the threat and b) how easily they could foil it. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arsenal Gear was a submersible, mobile fortress developed for the United States Navy, with the ability to monitor, block, and tamper with internet communications in order to further the goals of the Patriots. It also has access to the Military&#39;s Tactical Network, giving it absolute control over the nation&#39;s armed forces and its nuclear arsenal</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Arsenal Gear is a metaphor for the change of warfare in the last decades of the 20th century, from a nuclear war to a war of culture, information, and espionage. </p>

<p>Its concept was inspired by the U.S. Navy&#39;s Arsenal Ship Project  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah the logo is the same cause it is the same.  The info you&#39;re looking at,  the contents of that archived page,  were archived with aspertus.  It says so on the bottom of the page.  It&#39;s no coincidence.  </p>

<p>The text op copied from that file is the sig used to sign that message that was used to put the info on the block chain.  When he searched it he was brought to a page that,  apparently,  is an archive of that info in the block chain but on the clearnet.  (That&#39;s just what bit fossil is) It&#39;s the actual address and other things linked to it that OP is concerned with.  </p>

<p>So... I think it&#39;s a dead end unless it&#39;s somehow connected back the other way in the files... But idk. I&#39;m skeptical of any of this meaning anything at this point,  but it is interesting...    </p>

<p>It is of interest to me that I did run in to some plaintext names such as Craig Steven Wright and his claimed yet disputed pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto when I glanced thru some of the files.  A bit coin sig plus the name of the guy who claims to have made bitcoin? Obviously related,  but not necessarily meaningful...    </p>

<p>Edit: looking more like nonsense by the minute... What could possibly be the connection between Satoshi Nakano, a random excerpt regarding a Florida real estate woman,  and a huge chunk of the Wikipedia page for Neil Armstrong? </p>

<p>Eh,  but at the same time there&#39;s weird plaintext in some of them...names,  too.  Satoshi Nakamoto as well as  John Forbes Nash Jr.  + his wife Alicia name&#39;s both were in one of the files,  alongside their birthdays and deaths. Ah,  and Dr.  Craig Wright I saw,  too.  </p>

<p>Weird.  </p>

<p>Could be some kind of compression gone weird? </p>

<p>Hmm... </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m missing something obvious.  The plainly named files about the headers leave me to believe these files are supposed to be recombined in some specific way,  but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find its something common that I&#39;m forgetting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a &quot;currency&quot; called Bitcoin. It works by having computers on a network compute complex math. The math takes a certain time to compute, and whenever some of this math is solved, a transaction (a trade of Bitcoins from one person to another) is allowed to happen. All this math generates a bunch of random data, but people can put their own data in that random stuff too. The users here seem to be speculating that some of the data is intentionally hidden files and messages. They think this because some of the data contains 2 to 8 digits that also happen to denote &quot;this is a text file&quot; to a computer. But the truth is, it&#39;s very likely that these strings of characters are just random, and don&#39;t denote the existence of hidden data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not understanding me. There may be a difference of a couple hours between gravity waves and gamma rays from a very high energy cosmic event. But if you see this big event with a telescope, then that&#39;s it. That&#39;s the moment you are talking about. That doesn&#39;t mean, &quot;Okay, now start your clock, the GRB is on it&#39;s way here at the speed of light.&quot; No, not at all. Visible light also travels at the speed of light, so you don&#39;t get advanced warning by seeing the event. If you see a magnetar explode or whatever X light-years away with a telescope, that really means that X years ago, this event happened, and whatever electromagnetic radiation that you are going to feel at home will arrive pretty much at the exact time you <em>see</em> the event with visible light. Okay, there can be some spreading between different frequencies of radiation since some frequencies interact more with the interstellar medium and various other effects like that, but everything is going to arrive within an hour or two of the visible observation.</p>

<p>Correct. but what about &quot;all the GRB&#39;s that <em>have occured thousands of years ago BUT are also several thousand light years away, but</em> which we <em>didn&#39;t see</em> as the &#39;energy&#39; has yet to &#39;arrive&#39;?</p>

<p>What I&#39;m suggesting is that whilst we recorded such events happening 7,000 light yrs away <em>only recently</em>, coupled with events like &quot;The Flash&quot; show that space might be full of such &#39;waves&#39; we have yet to &#39;notice&#39;</p>

<p>This link is a few yrs old <a href="http://www.space.com/21861-deep-space-radio-explosions-mystery.html%5C">http://www.space.com/21861-deep-space-radio-explosions-mystery.html\</a></p>

<ul>
<li>A team of international astronomers has detected four explosive events, known as fast radio bursts (FRBs), above the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy. Lasting only a few thousandths of a second, these sources send powerful signals across the universe, <strong>traveling billions of light-years through space</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;These bursts gave off more energy in a millisecond than the sun does in 300,000 years,&quot;</strong> said principal investigator Dan Thornton of the University of Manchester in England.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the &#39;point&#39; I&#39;m trying to make is, <em>we don&#39;t know about &quot;other GRB&#39;s&quot;  which  have occured thousands of years ago</em>, which <em>might almost be</em> on &#39;earth&#39;s doorstep any day! We won&#39;t know until they&#39;re &quot;close enough&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible various research craft like the V&#39;gers have picked up such data ...</p>

<p>BUT as we have no records from 550 yrs ago, let alone 5000yrs ago about GRB&#39;s, or the events which were preciptated by them, we don&#39;t know. Until the &#39;energy&#39; from them arrives, and which is &#39;very possibly&#39; almost here Now&#39; but we won&#39;t be able to &#39;detect&#39; <em>until</em> it arrives/hits!  </p>

<p>The current school of thought on this idea, extrapolated from various data sets, is that such events <em>are likely</em> to occur every 5-10,000 yrs and like &quot;The Big One&quot; earthquake &#39;due to hit Cali sometime in the next 100yrs, the time is about right for us to see another one impact earth!</p>

<p>And what do you think would happen if an event that  <strong>gives off more energy in a millisecond than the sun does in 300,000 years,&quot;</strong> were to sweep across our planet?</p>

<p>One thing&#39;s certain, it would be a Hell of a LOT worse than a &quot;solar storm&quot;  and most likely &quot;rip off&quot; our atmosphere more easily than peeling the lid off a tub of yoghurt! And it&#39;s <em>possible</em> such an event could happen <em>extremely quickly</em></p>

<p>What do you think caused Mammoths grazing on tropical vegetation to be &quot;snap frozen&quot; with food <em>still in their mouths!?</em> .... something like a GRB caused atmospheric disturbance would do the trick. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not exactly, quite this simple but it&#39;s definitely an &#39;extreme event&#39; that <em>would No doubt cause</em> a range of severe distubances here on earth (and throughout the solar system, and even the Galaxy!</p>

<p>The Podesta Emails; Part One Today WikiLeaks begins its series on deals involving Hillary Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. Mr Podesta is a long-term associate of the Clintons and was President Bill Clinton&#39;s Chief of Staff from 1998 until 2001. Mr Podesta also controls the Podesta Group, a major lobbying firm and is the Chair of the Center for American Progress (CAP), a Washington DC-based think tank. Part 1 of the Podesta Emails comprises 2,060 emails and 170 attachments and focuses on Mr Podesta&#39;s communications relating to nuclear energy, and media handling over donations to the Clinton Foundation from mining and nuclear interests; 1,244 of the emails reference nuclear energy. The full collection includes emails to and from Hillary Clinton. In April 2015 the New York Times published a story about a company called &quot;Uranium One&quot; which was sold to Russian government-controlled interests, giving Russia effective control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for the production of nuclear weapons, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of US government agencies. Among the agencies that eventually signed off the deal was the State Department, then headed by Secretary Clinton. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) comprises, among others, the secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce and Energy. As Russian interests gradually took control of Uranium One millions of dollars were donated to the Clinton Foundation between 2009 and 2013 from individuals directly connected to the deal including the Chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer. Although Mrs Clinton had an agreement with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors to the Clinton Foundation, the contributions from the Chairman of Uranium One were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons. When the New York Times article was published the Clinton campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, strongly rejected the possibility that then-Secretary Clinton exerted any influence in the US goverment&#39;s review of the sale of Uranium One, describing this possibility as &quot;baseless&quot;. Mr Fallon promptly sent a memo to the New York Times with a rebuttal of the story (Podesta Email ID 1489). In this memo, Mr Fallon argued: &quot;Apart from the fact that the State Department was one of just nine agencies involved in CFIUS, it is also true that within the State Department, the CFIUS approval process historically does not trigger the personal involvement of the Secretary of State. The State Department’s principal representative to CFIUS was the Assistant Secretary of State for Economic, Energy and Business Affairs. During the time period in question, that position was held by Jose Fernandez. As you are aware, Mr Fernandez has personally attested that “Secretary Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter.” What the Clinton campaign spokesman failed to disclose, however, was the fact that a few days before sending his rebuttal to the New York Times, Jose Fernandez wrote on the evening of the 17 April 2015 to John Podesta following a phone call from Mr Podesta (Email ID 2053): &quot;John, It was good to talk to you this afternoon, and I appreciate your taking the time to call. As I mentioned, I would like to do all I can to support Secretary Clinton, and would welcome your advice and help in steering me to the right persons in the campaign&quot;. Five days after this email (22 April 2015), Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon wrote a memo to the New York Times, declaring that &quot;Jose Fernandez has personally attested that &#39;Secretary Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter&#39;,” but Fallon failed to mention that Fernandez was hardly a neutral witness in this case, considering that he had agreed with John Podesta to play a role in the Clinton campaign. The emails show that the contacts between John Podesta and Jose Fernandez go back to the time of internal Clinton campaign concern about the then-forthcoming book and movie &quot;Clinton Cash&quot; by Peter Schweizer on the financial dealings of the Clinton Foundation. In an email dated 29 March 2015 (Email ID 2059), Jose Fernandez writes to Podesta: &quot;Hi John, I trust you are getting a brief rest after a job well done. Thanks no doubt to your recommendation I have joined the CAP [Center for American Progress] board of trustees, which I&#39;m finding extremely rewarding.&quot; Julian Assange</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are 7 days away from D-Day. </p>

<p>HOLDING GROUPS 
If you are in a holding group you should slowly begin contact with the new seekers. You should assume that every user you speak to is a shill. If you are receiving intel from previous groups you should assume all information is not valid. The shilling that will take place in the next few days will be more advanced than what we have previously seen. Use CQC to gain new leads, use GW to prove your identity. If you have followed this project you should know how to engage and disable bots. This will be important. </p>

<p>OPERATION SKYE 
You should assume your current medium of communication is compromised and monitored. Redundancy and constant change of channels is essential. If you are in a decoy Outer Heaven, make sure to have it completely briefed. The BM bunker will not be reliable this week. Make arrangements to mantain communication within your unit. Use Codec Communciation when discussing sensitive details. </p>

<p>AS OF 10:31:13 UTC 
wikileaks.org is constantly being modified. Keep track of changes as these will lead newer groups to the encoded information. 
Plans for the Internet blackout have been confirmed by multiple sources. 
Distribution of backups and new findings should take place outside the Internet. Make arrangement so your unit is able to access another net. </p>

<p>IF the keys for the decoy insurance files are released by &#39;Wikileaks&#39; you should break radio silence and commence distribution of the real data. 
IF the Internet goes down, you should break radio silence and commence physical distribution of the real data. 
IF we experience a prolonged Internet blackout in the US, we will have to delegate certain task to our allies. Get &gt;Google Translate ready. You will need it. 
IF the information has not reached the public once the Internet is restored, FOXALIVE will be released. This is our last measure and we should everything we can to avoid it. </p>

<p>Remember, if Arsenal Gear is deployed in the next few days, we lose the Internet forever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;oct 17: strange activity is noticed at the embassy, first responders investigate, periscope is killed, twitter goes full orwell, archive.org is changed to no longer save sites properly.something that is instantly deleted is posted several times on pleddit, halfchan, fullchan, onion links and darkweb. it is all wiped. people regroup in several places since there is no way to post without threads being deleted or sites going down. a lot end up here.</p>

<p>oct 21: as the director of wikileaks is dying a huge ddos takes down most sites. blockchain is attacked. lot of stuff gets deleted. </p>

<p>oct 24: someone finds the wikileaks backups in the blockchain and posts instructions and code to decode the data. </p>

<p>oct 27: the deletions get too severe. sites begin being flooded with illegal content or going down. people create their own private channel to discuss progress. the keys and all hidden data in the blockchain are found. the group pushes the information into a few cryptocurrencies. blockchain is flooded. mempool graphs now have a giant spike on oct 27. soft fork for bitcoin begins. onion threads with the info get instantly wiped. everyone involved goes silent except one of two people. this group is then referred to as &#39;group 1&#39;. first finding of the keys as &#39;first impact&#39;.
few days later: one of the people following the progress of group 1 starts teaching others how to retrace the steps. </p>

<p>late oct: people figure out that unlocking the data gets you xkeyscored&#39;d making you lose internet connection and makes sites get attacked if the stuff is not deleted.</p>

<p>early nov: focus changes to teaching others how to find the information on airgapped computers to avoid deletion and sacrificing public channels of communication. threads that have progress start being flooded with illegal content every morning.</p>

<p>nov 8: wikileaks.org begins being changed. some files are deleted. checksum hashes start not matching older backups. </p>

<p>some point in nov: irs asks bitcoin to give them the identities of all transactions. copies of the blockchain start showing &#39;undecodable&#39; or empty transactions not seen before. </p>

<p>mid nov: &#39;group 2&#39; doxxes the people pretending to be wikileaks and tried to spread more detailed instructions for getting the files. posts did not last more than a few minutes. it seems like they tried to push to blockchain but apparently the data did not make it in. group 2 goes silent. they start calling this day the &#39;second impact&#39;.</p>

<p>nov 25: third impact. files are found by a new group that seems to not be american. they post instructions all the place but they don&#39;t last more than a few hours. they tried to encode data into cryptocurrencies but it is not clear if it made it. this day is the second spike visible on the mempool graph.</p>

<p>at some point after this people agree to stop using the endchan thread for this because admins have to deal with too much illegal content floods and site going down. it becomes clear that any channel used to discuss this is &#39;sacrificed&#39;, in other words, it starts going down a lot, they flip the mods, deletion, illegal spams, etc. this thread is created for that reason. you can figure out what is special about this thread if you read the logs in the png. most progress after this point is exclusively on channels with no logs on darkweb. most of these eventually go down. the endchan thread is eventually locked. everyone that posted is blocked to this day. it is then deleted.</p>

<p>dec: planning for d-day begins. all holding groups spend all of december teaching others how to find the files.</p>

<p>mid dec: someone allegedly speaking on behalf of appelbaum posts links to code he wrote to find and repair keys in memory. new teams are told to use it. obama starts talking about a cyber war with russia.</p>

<p>dec 18: files are found in japan. a meshnet using ps3s is created to spread the files but it does not seem to last too long. </p>

<p>dec 19: d-day. happenings all over the world. most ISPs, torrent communities and major sites go down. wikileaks releases a new insurance file. uk, ec, and us insurance files from before no longer show on wikileaks.org unless you have IPs from specific countries. it is one of the biggest internet outages in history and it is not reported in a single news site that i have been able to find. holding groups go silent. some members are now trying to find their old teams. </p>

<p>tl;dr blockchain has backups for all wikileaks files since 2013. it also has checksum hashes and upload proofs for all files. there is a lot of stuff in there that triggers xkeyscore or echelon and is virtually impossible to share or even talk about. three months have been spent trying to teach others how to recreate the steps. there is a noticeable pattern. group finds it, start teaching others how to do it, then everything is deleted and people go silent. then a new group finds the breadcrums and starts over. it&#39;s not clear what happened yesterday or what will happen next but there are people from all the world trying to investigate. at this point and there is no part of the internet where it is allowed.&quot;</p>

<p>Any image, and pretty much any file that isn&#39;t basic text, is going to be a wall of ASCII madness.</p>

<p>It just happened that due to the way their server is set up Google searches these files. It&#39;s pretty rare to have a server set up like that.</p>

<p>Edit; glad it was archived at least.<br/>
Edit 2; I should also mention shits gonna get real when they figure out the key.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a &quot;currency&quot; called Bitcoin. It works by having computers on a network compute complex math. The math takes a certain time to compute, and whenever some of this math is solved, a transaction (a trade of Bitcoins from one person to another) is allowed to happen. All this math generates a bunch of random data, but people can put their own data in that random stuff too. The users here seem to be speculating that some of the data is intentionally hidden files and messages. They think this because some of the data contains 2 to 8 digits that also happen to denote &quot;this is a text file&quot; to a computer. But the truth is, it&#39;s very likely that these strings of characters are just random, and don&#39;t denote the existence of hidden data.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything that connects the hash with their IP. </p>

<p>Yes - AKAIK the hash is created when you first post by combining a random number with the answer to a CAPTCHA. This is then stored in your current session. </p>

See, when you quoted me and said,&quot; At least you got that part right.&quot; This implies that you KNOW the answer to the question. If you know I got that part right, and all the others wrong, you must then prove that everything else was wrong. Otherwise, you can&#39;t say anything. If you do, that just mean you run your mouth but haven&#39;t got a clue. Also known as a side buster, or just plain buster. LMAO Get it?</p>
