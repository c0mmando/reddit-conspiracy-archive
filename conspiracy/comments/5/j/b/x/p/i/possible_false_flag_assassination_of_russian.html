       Ok as a person who carries daily, shoots well and knows what he is doing - I noticed something quite odd in all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off the shooter is a right handed shooter.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tLuubbk.jpg">
        But in the photo of his body, riddled with bullets, you can clearly see that he has a double magazine carrier on his right hip.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A Right handed shooter will keep their spare magazines on the opposite side of their shooting hand because when reloading you use your 'weak' hand or non dominant hand. Your 'strong' hand/ Shooting hand stays on the weapon in the same place it was put from the draw. The weak hand, when it can be should be supporting the strong hand, as you see him do when he raises the weapon again after the shots are fired. It does look like he was using a shoulder holster (left side of coat flips up for a second)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/boc7SNTFz04?t=4">
        Here is a clip of a right handed shooter, with magazines on the left side with the holster on the right. This demonstrates the basic placement and handling.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/745301/World-War-1-Russian-ambassador-murder-Turkey-Franz-Ferdinand">
        Also lets not forget how World War One got started.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A major military incident with Russia could keep Trump from taking office, which is an overwhelming desire of the establishment right now. Now, this does come off as directly related to Russian military action in Syria but I cannot express to a person unfamiliar with Guns and carrying of pistols how very odd this looks. It looks like a "hollywood oversight" (which happens often in movies where there is a gun being used by people who are supposed to be trained.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I hope nothing comes of this but I thought I would put it out there and see if anybody has some good thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       UPDATE:
      </p>
      <p>
       I posed the question over at
       <a href="/r/guns">
        /r/guns
       </a>
       as I am not a Leo of any kind.  Their thoughts so far seem to be "not that big of a deal" .  While not common it is not unheard of and could be referred to as cross draw. Where you draw gun/mags with you non shooting hand by reaching across the body to where  the item is positioned.  You need to be real thin to get to where he has those mags but he is thin.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I still see this as weird and counter intuitive but everybody has their preferences and training and "normal" can vary from the US  normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is still odd to me but I  going to have to re look at this one. That said there are some other odd things that you guys have pointed out.

       Money is generally the simplest answer. There was a well-known photographer at the event so either this is a good publicity opportunity for him/her and their employer, or you could infer that it's convenient for a professional photographer to have been present. It's not much to go on though. A lot of media outlets use AP articles and accompanying photos and I think I remember that it was an AP photographer, but don't quote me on it.

       it was either:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) a false flag to get Russia into war with Turkey &amp; NATO.
      </p>
      <p>
       If so then Putin is smart enough to see this and not rise to it. Nothing happened when Turkey shot down a Russian jet.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) its a false flag masterminded by Russia &amp; Turkey to give them an excuse to work closer together, get out of NATOs wing and find a resolution together on Syria (along with Iran - meeting was supposed to take place today).
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, doubt a war will happen as a result of this.

       I mean the Colorado shooter face with that crazy orange hair was plastered everywhere,
      </p>
      <p>
       Boston bombers faces were everywhere,
      </p>
      <p>
       the San Bernardino couple had their images blasted everywhere,
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of images of the pulse shooter out there
      </p>
      <p>
       Bin laden became an extremely familiar face after 9/11
      </p>
      <p>
       Dylan roof has his face everywhere
      </p>
      <p>
       The post suicide shots of columbine are pretty popular also
      </p>
      <p>
       The only big difference here is that this guy killed an ambassador in front of press conference, but blasting a suspects image around the world is literally what happens every time something like this happens

       Damn, that's attention to detail right there. I'm just having a hard time figuring out what answers we could get from this information. Also, maybe it's possible that he had clips on both sides of his body because we can't see his left side in the picture

       It is possible but it would be really strange. Especially for a professional with training.

       Although....they could just be fucking idiots over there and not know what they're doing with their standards and training.

       I recall a picture of an incident in some country and an officer was holding two pistols, one in each hand, while in a crouched position. It was so silly it became a meme.

       Since when did "false flag" = "pretend to kill but never dare to"?
      </p>
      <p>
       ELI5 me on this, but why has the narrative that involved conspirators
       <em>
        wouldn't just actually and truly kill people
       </em>
       become so popular?

       This is my theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of a false flag is to either distract/cover up/instigate some other event (which is often hidden from the general public). If the end result can be achieved without killing, that is the first choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paying someone off and giving them a new identity in a small town is a better alternative to killing them (that way the person behind the conspiracy doesn't have to actually get their hands dirty).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, all conspiracy theories are exactly that, theories. Nothing is/can be proven (by the general public), so the best we can do is speculate as to what is the truth in this situation.

       There are actions orders of magnitudes easier and less likely to create blowback as others, as well as conspiracies with more evidence and likelihood in their favor. I'm not convinced why anyone would be bothered, especially in cases with easily expendable people (civilians, low-level government workers, and - honestly - an ambassador)...
      </p>
      <p>
       We've an entire world of politically ordered assassinations and the conspiracies behind them being revealed (whether the conspirators want it or not), but for some inexplicable reason all the scenarios with surviving payed-off fakers have them disappearing with far less traces?
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonably, shouldn't the (relative) difficulty hiding actually murdered and dead people tell you something about the likelihood of keeping living (and extremely
       <em>
        public
       </em>
       ) fakers under wraps...
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: When I say "revealed", I mean to the extent that even the general public is aware of the conspiracy. Utterly laid bare without any hope of discussion.
EDIT: Thanks for the genuine answer.

       A) Clothing layers affect significantly to the amount of visible blood. Full black suit is entirely different from thin white shirt.

       B) The video is from live tv which was shut down before the "assassin" was killed.

       The part that seems fishy to me is the camera work.  He seems to jump from poses three or four different times for the cameras.  After the ambassador goes down, you see him do a one-two of being in pose, dropping the gun, pointing it back up, dropping it down again, and pointing again before making his speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems very strange, but then again I don't shoot people for a living so what do I know.

       No shit but the ambassador was shot at 8-9 times at point blank range within the span of 3 seconds and then fell a couple feet to the side being shot at his whole way down, free falling and his body and head hit the floor, and there is not one single drop of blood on that floor from that, just a tidy little pool of blood that appears under his head after he has fallen to the ground.

       In light of Obama's statement last week I wouldn't doubt that he instigated this assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Obama said, "I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections ... we need to take action. And we will — at a time and place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be." -

        </a>
       </p>

       Hell, it wouldn't surprise me if Obama belonged to the Gulen cult.

       If you constantly you claim false flag eventually something will happen. Doesn't necessarily make that event a glass flag. But this very well could be considering the potential weight behind this assassination.

       The ambassador isn't even dead because he never existed. My sources are telling me Russia had no idea the "ambassador" even existed until he was killed. They are scrambling to find out who died and how the credentials were forged.

       My sources are telling me that the Russian ambassador was actually an alien who arrived on Earth 15 years ago and has been working with the US government to rebuild his ship to return home. Sad he was murdered in cold blood today.

       I appreciate your insight into this event and the odd location of his spare magazines. I'd suggest he's an amateur with just enough shooting training to hit a target 10 feet away. He's a throwaway Zealot who probably never even picked up a gun until a month before this shooting.

       Good catch thou...there might be something odd going on.

       I would think that too if not for the details.  He was showing what is called 'trigger dicipline' untrained or poorly trained tend to keep their finger on the trigger after shooting. It's very dangerous in a high adrenalin situation because you lose fine motor skills and your perceptions are altered. Notice the weapon is down at his side with his trigger finger along the slide and not in the trigger well. He keeps the weapon down until he feels the need to point at a threat (threat to him that is) then with armed fully extended with both hands on the weapon he points it. The curious onlooker surely left and the weapon comes back down to the side. I have not checked but I assume he did not even move his finger to the trigger during those moves. So I see training there but still the mag carrier is so incredibly out of place. It is all just strange.

       That would explain the training but not the positioning of the extra mags.

       Shooting a moving/falling target at 10-15 feet away, rapid fire, with 9/10 accuracy takes training. Especially with the adrenaline factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly the rapid fire accuracy is what stands out, if indeed this was a real shooting. (Im still investigating)
