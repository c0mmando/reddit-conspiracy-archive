       OMG thank you. I saw the small puddle under his head (at least that's what I think it is) and the thing about there not being casings from blanks? XD 
And the shot didn't make a sound when it hit his body? Someone has been playing to much Cod. I kiiiinda thought it might be fake first because it looks too good. He's got the filming angles, he's got the poses and he's standing behind him, how the fuck did a man like that end up standing behind a high up person, I heard he's am off duty officer but that's exactly what's wrong, off duty. The collar getting flicked up looks fake  not because it looks mechanical buy because since its such a bright shirt there should be some trace of blood since the bullet came out. The assassin getting shot looks kinda bad to because there's bullet holes EVERYWHERE I'd expect more precision but then also it's and extremely heated hostage situation with a person already being killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since its probably not fake, staged I do believe but not fake where going to see shit go down maybe.

       If you frame by frame through the youtube vid (use the , and . keys to move forward/back a frame at a time), you'll see that he flinches before it, and that his shirt is blown open by something, and his jacket then immediately closes.  It's not a reflection of light thing.  It's clearly some sort of wind/gas.

       Yes, he flinches before he was hit because the gun fired twice before the third bullet hit his back.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's blown open by the force of the bullet hitting his body.. Not some wind/gas.

       Oh I dunno, maybe because a piece of metal going 800+ MPH had just hit his body?

       Prove to me it was some kind of wind/gas and maybe I'll believe you, but until then, I'm going with Occam's razor on this one. The simplest explanation is often the correct one.

       lol you posit an explanation that is less plausible (having more "moving parts") and then use Occam as a defense, with, lol, a "prove it" claim.  ok buddy.  pot kettle black sauce.

       I'm saying that the SOUND itself sounds like blanks, and you obviously would have been able to hear the shell casings hitting the floor. This video has most likely been doctored.

       Which do you think makes more noise - Shells hitting the floor, or footsteps?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't hear his footsteps, so I guess he's not really walking around?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that the noise of him shooting and shouting overwhelms the mic from picking up quieter sounds.

       Lying down on a wound applies pressure to it, limiting blood flow.

       Also the fallout from this was predictable.  It is driving the Russia and Turkey together, not apart.  This means Erdogan and Putin both have motives to be involved in this.  They are also the only ones who could have staged it.

       As a gun instructor there are a few things that just look wrong. From least critical to most critical:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) no blood anywhere near the body after what appear to be numerous shots to the chest.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) no shell casings to the right of the shooter, between him and the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 absolutely no smoke anywhere. When I empty a clip, there is smoke because gun powder burns...
      </p>
      <p>
       So how does one explain these inconsistencies?

       Because clips and magazines are entirely different things. It's akin to confusing throttle and fuel line, or noun and adjective, or rue and mirepoix.
      </p>
      <p>
       They exist in the same world, and are both hold ammo... But their use is very different.

       A clip (stripper clip is the most common) holds rounds together. It's basically a bent piece of metal, it feeds magazines, it is a non-mechanical devixe. Magazines feed guns. Magazines have a spring, and a follower to keep rounds going into the chamber.

       If you can't see that blood, get a better monitor that can actually distinguish color. I bet you have a cheap fucking laptop or broken eyeballs that you can't even see it. Doesn't it fucking suck being POOR? It really limits your ability to do research so you end up spreading misinformation and looking like a goddamned fucking lightweight amateur.

       I'm so sick of you delusional psychopaths. You're everywhere, yet none of you have the GUTS to be confronted in voice chat. I've challenged hundreds of you. Ventrilo. Mumble. Teamspeak. Skype. Discord. ANYTHING--and you losers just make excuses.

       Go install one of them and give me the info. I'm not going to let you psychopaths get away with spreading misinformation and BULLSHIT.

       I've seen people get shot, they don't flinch like that, this guy is acting. Watch the youtube video at .25 speed and look at the spot I highlighted in the freeze frame where there is an explosion on his lapel. It's not a bullet exit wound, it's a tiny explosive charge.

       I'm a combat veteran of Afghanistan, 13 months, yes they fucking do. I was a MK19 gunner mainly, and carried the M240 dismounted. I know exactly what men look like when they get shot. Just because Alex Jones tells you it's staged or whatever doesn't mean it's gospel.

       It recently came to light in front of the entire world from courageous journalist Eva Bartlett from Canada, that the people in Syria know that the western media is lying about the situation in Syria and that they want the West (U.S. in particular) to stop arming terrorists that are killing Syrian people.

       Eaxctly!  The real conspiracy, if there was one, would be that Russia had him killed (because why wouldn't they instead of faking his death?).  But that's not as fun as this horseshit for the idiots

       I think a lot of the "fake death" stuff is a misinterpretation of what false flags and fake narratives are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The events that take place do not have to be faked. The events that take place can be real so long as they push the false narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't really know much about this situation. I just think all the "faked events" and "crisis actors" stuff is designed to discredit more plausible conspiracy theories.

       I think it's just more fun to try and find these crazy 'holes' in the scenario for these people.  It's more exciting for those that do it, and it's more exciting to read when done well, which means more traffic and attention for the creator when it's lapped up by those craving conspiracies.

       There are definitly empty shells in this picture.  And it looks like the spring is coming out of the bottom of the mag.  They obviously shot at him a lot from all the holes in the wall,  maybe a round hit the mag breaking it.

       What a silly comment.  A man was killed and you are making assumptions that the people who killed him (highly trained police team) are "shitty shots" because you see some holes in the wall in places you wouldn't expect them to be?  Please just leave the internet.

       IF it's fake, that would mean the Russian Ambassador was in on it, meaning the likely thing was a ploy by Russia. This would help take the heat off of their recent leveling of Aleppo and make them seem like the victims of terrorism.

       I came here because I googled this event with "fake." This does appear to me as staged simply because the venue was too perfect for a fake event.  Cameras to document the event, etc.  The shooter was even available to remain in the venue in order to pose for a photoshoot, with the gun raised, and able to deliver his pre-planned dialog. Once "the commoner" realizes that future planned international actions need to "arranged" this sort of thing will happen.  For reference: 911, Sandy Hook, WW1, WW2, and on and on.

       I too googled, and wound up with a link to this post.
       <em>
        ambassador assassination faked
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       It was too convenient. The shooter looked like a 007 wannabe. Cam started out with a close-up. How was the camera person not shot as well? I'm not buying it
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, the willingness of so many tv stations to play it was bizarre. Typically, they take great measure to not show this type of footage.

       he was giving a public speech in a museum, and hes an ambassador. thats why it looks so clean, why theres cameras, and why the gunman is wearing a suit. youre not going to get entrance to something like this wearing jeans and a tshirt

      <pre><code> Let's not get too technical about the video, to me it looks at plain sight to be an absolute and obvious FAKE.

 It doesn't pass the eye test, this looks like a television production from the way the body falls to the way the alleged gunman holds his gun and gestures, etc.  

 It looks like a scene from a spy movie.  The terrorist moves like he has been rehearsing for the lead in a musical all month. 

 It's all a little too perfect, they haul the ambassador away in an ambulance and after a staged shootout (again, no blood) then they do the same with the gunman.

  Mission accomplished.  Even 911 did not have as perfect a video as this. I smell a rat with a Russian accent.

       Why wasn't the Ambassador being protected by Russian bodyguards? Turkey would be considered a very high risk posting . At the very least you would expect the gunman to have have been killed by the bodyguard(s)) once the gunman opened fire.

       Are you gonna propose to me that blood should immediately be flowing as if it is GTA Vice city? He's wearing a full suit, which is stopping the aforementioned fountain of blood. Also, for those familiar with a real murder tape called 3 Guys 1 hammer, it has always interested me why the man being murdered has never bled from his stomach after being repeatedly cut with a screwdriver to the point where u can see holes in his stomach, but no blood. And mind you this video is 100% real. Maybe we do not know the body and the way wounds and injuries occur but rather rely on media and hollywood to portray it to dramatic proportions.

       Id like to mention something I'm not hearing much about: How does the Russian Ambassador land on his back with arms spread out and legs spread out? After being shot from behind consecutively with 9 bullets? Wouldn't the Ambassador be pushed forwards or to the right/his left? Am I wrong in expecting the force of 9 bullets in a row at point blank range would thrust him forwards and knocking over the podium? In the video it looks like he falls straight down and back somehow with all limbs stretched out. Looks very wrong to me. Also you can see his glasses on the floor behind the Ambassador somehow in one of the photos? How does this happen?

       Why is there no video of the assassin getting shot? Obviously the camera was still recording as he was shouting. So did someone switch off the camera and then shoot the gunman? If so, why?

       Was the shooter not behind him? If he was not on the chest side of the target that would indicate that his clothes moving on his front side would be from an exit wound. If there is an exit wound it is extremely unlikely that there would be no blood or bits of his body strewn about

       He was behind and to the Ambassador's right. The shooter appears to have shot him multiple times, including once that penetrated his shoulder, and once that probably struck him in the back of the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fat Ambassador, in a highly charged situation, doesn't move his chest for a full minute after falling to the ground. Dude is dead.

       It's just odd. Only thing I can think of is he didn't have a back on the vest or the shots got snuck in through the side. That would explain. Why the front of his shirt moved with no blood.

       It is a weird set up but let's look at both sides:
      </p>
      <p>
       For: 
* Camera set up, especially the one next to him. 
* Lack of blood anywhere to be seen 
* The room itself is "awkward" or not very convincing. 
* The flinching of that one guy
* No blood absorbed to be seen on white shirt 
* No other public photos or video of the deceased (not really too suspicious) 
* Very clean kill 
* Very clean everything!
*The odd fall and the jumping of the collar
      </p>
      <p>
       Against: 
* No movement of the shot (who's weight would be a strain)
* The shot individual is not an actor
* Weight can absorb small bullets
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I personally think he is dead, but he was set up to die, meaning the entire things feels and is awkward because it was a set up not by just the shooter to kill the ambassador but others who support the shooters agenda. It was very clean, documented and a professional assassination which involved multiple individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The collar thing I think is due to the shirt being pulled by one of the bullets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he didn't die and was able to not move like that with that weight, props! Though the dark shadow under his head does appear to be something like fresh blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I think multiple people were involved and that also explains why the gun man was able to even to give their message. The shooter was a scale goat for some agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well planned assassination with the area, timing etc. not just some cop could have killed him in this fashion. Almost... Artistic.... Which is ironic with it being done in a gallery... Or intential...

       Even I thought this entire scandal seemed a bit off, and hence got to this post by googling "was the assassination fake". Another thing I noticed was that he seemed to hold his stomach/abdomen while he was shot, even though he was being shot at from behind (with no visible exit wound). Also, if someone shoots me on the back, I think I would fall on my face, rather than on my back. Thoughts?

       So basically you're saying, these guys faked an assassination. Spent countless hours, manpower, money to make it convincing but failed to do so because they couldn't afford some fake blood?
      </p>
      <p>
       RIGGED_ELECTION: Hurrr Durr!!! There is not enough blood, so no one died! 
Can't imagine what your claim was after all the explosions.

       Situation about assassin:
His legs are shot couple of times by the police to get him alive but he insisted on fighting. When he tried to get something from his pocket police though of explodes and killed him. That was probably the magazine and it was shot also.

       Yes, he flinches before he was hit because the gun fired twice before the third bullet hit his back.

       It's blown open by the force of the bullet hitting his body.. Not some wind/gas.

       I have seen analysis showing explosions near front of chest.. but no blood.  And there is a reverse angle shot somewhere too that shows no blood but possibly a casing or 2.

       if you watch the video with SOUND, you can hear several shots before he flinches. I love how everyone becomes an expert on video analysis whenever some shit like this happens, and 100% of attacks are false flags.

       Why is there no video of the assassin getting shot? Obviously the camera was still recording as he was shouting. So did someone switch off the camera and then shoot the gunman? If so, why?
