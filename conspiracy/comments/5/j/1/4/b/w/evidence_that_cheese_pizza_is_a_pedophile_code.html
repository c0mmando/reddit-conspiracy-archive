       I thought drugs when I just read the emails and before I heard any of the other evidence. Still seems somewhat plausible that it could be drugs, definitely something fishy going on whatever the case.

       The onionchan posts go back to March of 2014. There are 199 pages.  I did not read every post. In the posts I read, I did not run into the following words used: walnut sauce, pasta, map or handkerchief. Someone else will have to read all the pages. I am not able to.

       The "code word key" came from
       <a href="http://rigorousintuition.ca/board2/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;amp;t=40137&amp;amp;start=15">
        Jared Wyand, self-described White Nationalist founder of "Project Purge", and Trump warrior
       </a>
       , which reflects an agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Photos of "cheese pizza" were used on 4chan to solicit, tongue-in-cheek, "C"hild "P"orn, to taunt 4chan mods since a photo of pizza does not justify banning.  Actual child porn on 4chan does justify banning, however, and so "Cheese Pizza" was not actually code for Child Porn, but a "Fuck You Mods" taunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of Wyand's code is fully invented as far as anybody has shown, and nobody is showing pre-existing examples of such code words as "walnut sauce" or "pasta", etc., being used to prove the validity of the code and thereby the validity of the claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The self-description of Wyand is telltale, though.

        around 7 hours earlier
       </a>
       .  (Wyland's tweet was at 5:06 PM).

       Why wouldn't a real Pizzagate pedo join Reddit &amp; drop new "code words" into the mix to destroy all credibility?  It's also an effective intel trick to infiltrate, and pose as, a Pizzagater whose standard of evidence is what his dog told him.

       For weeks I've asked people where the code key came from, if anyone broke ranks, etc. No one could answer and then that's when I did my search, found the video but found nothing about cheese pizza being CP before that time period. Everything I found shows it became a meme and was used on 4chan to mock or taunt the mods. Things like, "No mods? Cheese pizza for everyone!" And other shit like that. So now we know a white nationalist and trump follower put it out there...interesting.

       I posted about Wyand earlier in Pizzagate hysteria, but there's no point on a website where any police agency or private enterprise can simply flood Reddit with unlimited numbers of fake accounts to manipulate "consensus".
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many possibilities to Pizzagate that have not even been mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagaters couldn't care less about child victims if they don't care about such proof as whether the alleged "code words" were accurate.  Or Pizzagaters don't really believe in catching criminals since they are so casual and flippant about keeping evidence untainted.  Why wouldn't a real Pizzagate pedo join Reddit &amp; drop new "code words" into the mix to destroy all credibility?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagaters don't give a fuck.  Or should I say "so-called Pizzagaters" since it's also an effective intel trick to infiltrate, and pose as, a Pizzagater whose standard of evidence is what his dog told him.

       Cheese Pizza is code for child pornography as evidenced by onionchan posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheese refers to girls in the onionchan posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sausage refers to boys in the onionchan posts.

       It is slang from a subculture. I agree with your point that it is not universal. Slang is variable based on time, location and networks within the wider subculture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning the Podesta emails I see two issues. First would be is there evidence that slang is utilized.  The second whether it is consistent with what is found in pedophilia subcultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the answer to the first point is yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am agnostic to the answer to the second point.  However, there is enough circumstantial evidence to be suspicious.

       Someone in the Pizzagate movement also fabricated the handkerchief code to include "white", which supposedly means pedo/virgin. This is a lie. White means nothing of the sort. White is not even in the shortened handkerchief code. They completely fabricated it. Huge red flag there.

       I dated a person who lost their mind. In retrospect, they had a lot of connections and a history that now make me wonder if they were Mind Control victims. I visited him in the mental hospital, after his full-blown psychotic break. He kept saying "Come here and bring me some of that pussy pie! PUSSY PIE!" Not sure where it came from, as he was never like that in his pre-psychotic state.

       Keep in mind that pedophiles have been around and using code words for longer than any of the chans, longer than the Internet, and longer than computers. There's going to be "traditional" pedocode mixed in with newer "chan" pedocode.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Cheese" has a better chance at being more "traditional" pedocode but I'm pretty sure 4chan invented "Cheese Pizza" on their own. For one, cheese doesn't mean the same thing.

       The term didn't come from pedos talking in code. That's what people don't get. It started being a thing when a pedo on HTCAP actually offered the host a pizza to let him go. From there it became a meme and this was between 2004-2007 when the show was in syndication. I posted the video a couple of weeks back but Google can help you find it. Is it being used for CP now? Yes, due to it becoming a meme.

       People don't use code words the police know. That defeats the purpose. This is like using the word lolita as code for underage girl and thinking that will fool everyone. It's unfortunate they chose a code name for cocaine that means child porn on 4 chan I guess.

       When you are talking about a crime in an Email you don't use terms the police know. It's like calling cannabis weed and expecting that to fool the authorities. A pedophile ring is not going to use code words that the FBI knows.

       The object is not fooling the police, it is adding a layer of difficulty for the prosecution. If the defendant claimed that they were really talking about food not child porn that adds a layer of plausible deniability that has to be overcome.

       No that's not correct. Code words are used to avoid prosecution. No one uses code words the police know. Cheese pizza has nothing whatsoever to do with children and there is no proof it did. It's an absurd speculation from people who don't leave their parent's basements.

       Code words are used to relay information. Some of their effects are to avoid prosecution.    Concerning your second proposition, its false in a trivial manner. Lots of people use code words that are familiar to the police. The question is this; Is asking for child porn on line enough to constitute probable cause? How about asking for cheese pizza 9-10 slices? What is easier to establish from a judicial perspective?

      <p>
       You state there is no proof that Cheese Pizza has anything to do with children.  Proof belongs in the realm of deductive sciences and the courts. However, evidence that supports a premise adds justification to our inferences. There is evidence provided that Cheese Pizza stands for child porn and child porn has a lot to do with children.

       Cheese Pizza just means child porn. They take the C from Cheese and the P from Pizza. That's it. The Pizzagate crowd make up the rest to make the Podesta emails more provocative.

       Asking for child porn is direct evidence. Asking for cheese pizza is not.

       I thought drugs when I just read the emails and before I heard any of the other evidence. Still seems somewhat plausible that it could be drugs, definitely something fishy going on whatever the case.
