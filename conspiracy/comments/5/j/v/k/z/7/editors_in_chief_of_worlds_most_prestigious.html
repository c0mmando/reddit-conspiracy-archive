       “A lot of what is published is incorrect.” I’m not allowed to say who made this remark because we were asked to observe Chatham House rules. We were also asked not to take photographs of slides. Those who worked for government agencies pleaded that their comments especially remain unquoted, since the forthcoming UK election meant they were living in “purdah”—a chilling state where severe restrictions on freedom of speech are placed on anyone on the government’s payroll. Why the paranoid concern for secrecy and non-attribution? Because this symposium—on the reproducibility and reliability of biomedical research, held at the Wellcome Trust in London last week—touched on one of the most sensitive issues in science today: the idea that something has gone fundamentally wrong with one of our greatest human creations." - The editor in chief of Lancet, Richard Horton

       "Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime Editor in Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), which is considered to another one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world, makes her view of the subject quite plain:

      <p>
       “It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines.

       - scientist are the new priest class. Question a scientist and you are questioning god. "scientists say humans are causing global climate change, specifically global warming" so it must be true - and a whole generation of Head Start/No Child Left Behind/Common Core drones cry out "shut up and take my money".

       Science and the scientific method are among the most powerful tools ever invented by man, and so they are co-opted by the Oligarchy and used against the People. It's the oldest trick in the book.

       Scientist here. There is a serious problem with reproducibility in medical science today. This is probably not an intentional effort to delude the public, but a result of the incredible pressure to publish positive results. Though no journals explicitly refuse to publish studies that get negative results, getting a negative result paper published is almost impossible, especially in top quality journals. So scientists are incentivized to make their results look better than they really are by fudging the statistics a little, exaggerating the impact, etc. This is how experiments that show "Molecule X slows down cancer growth and lets mice live an additional week" becomes "Molecule X is a super cure, cancer is dead!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And the pressure to publish is intense. Grad students need papers to get their PhD, and need good papers if they want good postdoc positions. Postdocs need good papers in top journals to get a chance at a tenure track position. If you manage to get a tenure track position, you struggle to get papers and grants so you and your students don't starve, and so you might get tenure. The competition is so intense, and consequences of failure so severe, that it drives many researchers to make their work look better than it really is. Some of them will outright lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't think this part of some grand science conspiracy. I have seen many people doing vaccine research, and not one ever said "HAHA, THIS WILL CAUSE SUPER-AUTISM!". This stuff is caused by a bad system that drives scientists to continuously publish better and more exciting work, even if they fail to follow the scientific method and make sure the results are real.

       Negative results usually means "We tried X because we thought it would do Y, but it didn't". While this kind of research is boring, letting other people know what experiments don't work is just as important as letting them know what does work. Hiding failed experiments leads to other people repeating your mistakes and wasting time and money. But it's hard to publish, because the reviewers usually say stuff like "This paper is insignificant" or "That's because your science is weak".
