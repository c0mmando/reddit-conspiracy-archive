       Have recently read into the conspiracy of Michael Jackson being killed for his assets, an interesting read &amp; makes you think twice about buying sony products. Is this an accepted conspiracy here?  Figured we need a change from all the pedo stuff.

       lol my thought exactly
      </p>
      <p>
       To OP: I actually believe MJ was a groomer and abused himself when he was young.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is a fascinating article speculating this theory - that Neverland was a CIA-built child abuse grooming camp.

      <p>
       when MJ became a liabilty they tried to frame him, then eventualy had him killed.

       take it with a grain of salt, but it is an interesting read

       If you listen to his interviews, the poor kid was highly abused and exposed to sexual exploits of his brothers, while he was young. I think his pysche was broken in his late 20s, with all the money and fame and he reverted to a childlike state. He had boundary issues for sure, but I do believe he really just wanted to be a kid again.

       It sounds like the MKultra thing in which he formed two different personalities because of the abuse.  I think something happened to him when he was younger.  He accomplished a lot, but he could have accomplished a lot more.  It is strange to say that about arguably the greatest entertainer that ever lived.

       Hmm, you're right. There does seem to be a discrepancy between the sheer talent of the man and the kinda mediocre corpus of work that he produced. One might've expected more.

       I think it was a punishment. Did you know his killer Doctor was a Freemason? From an unauthorized Freemason Temple in Houston ? Look at the artwork's symbolism   post death, plus his Dangerous album .

       If anyone from the middle ages was transported to our times and not only saw the extent of it but how the vast majority walking around was completely oblivious to it they'd be absolutely terrified and convinced that they'd "gone to Hell" and you know what? We pretty much have.

       I was just watching something about MK Ultra on YouTube and they touched on MJ actually. From what I remember his sister had said that they killed him in the hospital. He was killed in an MK Ultra hospital. I'll look to see if I can't find that video again. I make it sound less than what the person reporting it had. But Yeah

       Micheal was groomed very young as he was the only member of Jackson 5 that stood out, he was obviously abused young by the music industry jews early in his career and was probably put into MK Ultra. He swore he wasn't a pedophille, his reputation attacked by the media back for child molestation. He talked alot about the illuminati mad at him too, his sister even said "they wanted to kill him"

       We all know he became the king of pop, sold millions of records. He must of done something so he could be blackmailed regaurding his high status and all though. Just my theory anyway

       Friend of a friend was a backup dancer for him, was with him when he dropped. Said it seemed unnatural. Paramedics were already waiting before he dropped.

       It sounds like the MKultra thing in which he formed two different personalities because of the abuse.  I think something happened to him when he was younger.  He accomplished a lot, but he could have accomplished a lot more.  It is strange to say that about arguably the greatest entertainer that ever lived.
