    <div class="md"><p>lol my thought exactly</p>

<p>To OP: I actually believe MJ was a groomer and abused himself when he was young.</p>

<p>there is a fascinating article speculating this theory - that Neverland was a CIA-built child abuse grooming camp.</p>

<p><a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/michael-jacksons-neverland-ranch-mind-control-programming-site/">http://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/michael-jacksons-neverland-ranch-mind-control-programming-site/</a></p>

<p>when MJ became a liabilty they tried to frame him, then eventualy had him killed.</p>

<p>take it with a grain of salt, but it is an interesting read</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you listen to his interviews, the poor kid was highly abused and exposed to sexual exploits of his brothers, while he was young. I think his pysche was broken in his late 20s, with all the money and fame and he reverted to a childlike state. He had boundary issues for sure, but I do believe he really just wanted to be a kid again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Micheal was groomed very young as he was the only member of Jackson 5 that stood out, he was obviously abused young by the music industry jews early in his career and was probably put into MK Ultra. He swore he wasn&#39;t a pedophille, his reputation attacked by the media back for child molestation. He talked alot about the illuminati mad at him too, his sister even said &quot;they wanted to kill him&quot; </p>

<p>We all know he became the king of pop, sold millions of records. He must of done something so he could be blackmailed regaurding his high status and all though. Just my theory anyway</p>
