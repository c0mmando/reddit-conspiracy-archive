<p>Read through this and tell me what you think. I believe much of the information found in 2013 is still relevant today. Why Antarctica What did they find?</p>

<p>Keep an open mind and just read the website tell me what you think!</p>

<p>Dinosaur bones were put there and were created which is why there is &quot;virtually no difference between real bones and fake bones.&quot;</p>

<p>Dinosaur research was published and given to students to study, then created bones were buried in specific areas to be found by others. Once others were deceived into believing it they got started in creating a cultural attachment.</p>

<p>Dinosaurs weren&#39;t first discovered until after 1800.</p>

<p>Witches were burned in the past to cover the truth just like dinosaurs were created to make more lies.</p>

<p>The mountains of evidence are nothing, bones are created ask the people who make them. They create skeletons themselves and guess. They have no idea if the dinosaurs had feathers or what it&#39;s all a guessing game. People get their pay checks and don&#39;t question it in fear of losing the good pay and easy job. </p>

<p>Museums are sold dinosaur bones and make money off of them so it&#39;s not like they are losing money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right off the bat I have a problem with this site.</p>

<p>&quot;Russian Scientists who&#39;s country has spent billions of dollars on a drilling operation in Antarctica&quot;</p>

<p>You can&#39;t make a claim like that with no evidence.  &quot;Billions of dollars&quot; is highly suggestive of important and secret activity, but it is also a number pulled out of thin air.</p>

<p>Unless their drill rig is made of gold I have trouble believing such an expedition would cost more than a handful of millions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they have spent billions but they surely have spent millions. I just think the website might be exaggerating a bit but its mostly true.
And this is just one example of how much money they have spent in Antarctica. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt millions.  But 30mil spread over many stations and operations is a world away from billion on a single drilling project.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that those kind of suggestive, unfounded statements negatively impact the credibility of anything else stated on that website.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, I&#39;d say that is exaggerating much more than a &quot;a bit.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what always gets me confused is which is more important - North Pole or South?</p>

<p>I am very open to the idea of Hollow Earth but it seems that we always talk about the opening in North Pole but not in South Pole?</p>

<p>I believe there is a lot of international focus / dividing of territory in North Pole.</p>

<p>I think Russia stacked claim to a big part.</p>

<p>I think i haven&#39;t heard same about South pole.</p>

<p>Has that been divided in any way?</p>

<p>p.s. yeah GLP is tavistock disinfo site but mostly to monitor people. It will still def have grains of truth somewhere but 100% youre also v.likely to find those grains on reddit too.</p>

<p>No point going there.</p>

<p>To those who do (and other forums like ATS etc) are they discussing pizzagate too?</p>

<p>What i dont like about these forums is that they divide and segregate the various topics where as infact many of these threads are linked together. </p>

<p>That said, please do not use GLP as a primary source. It can be okay to find stuff to research, but don&#39;t link to it because it&#39;s tavistock</p>
