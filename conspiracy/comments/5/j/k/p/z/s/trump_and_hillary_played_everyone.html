Any reasonable person would have seen that, Hillary had to come off as unreasonable to garner hatred from those who don&#39;t know about her history with corruption. </p>

<p>Trump said all the things to gain support from people fed up with the system, but notice he said absolutely nothing about the Federal Reserve or government surveillance. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Jobs are not coming back from China, and Trump is not going to do anything about China.</p></li>
<li><p>The war with Iran that the Council on Foreign Relations wants, is supported by Trump. </p></li>
<li><p>The Federal Reserve and government surveillance remain taboo subjects. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Since Nixon, every president has been walking in lockstep towards globalization. Trump is in the back pocket of the globalization project, he had to be in order to elected. Reagan, Carter, The Clintons, the Bushes and Obama all have shared handlers, and those handlers have decided to elect Trump. </p>

<p>The peekaboo game we play with the shadow government is never ending, until you find the CFR and TC playing the shadow games in broad daylight, being the ole Wizard of Oz behind a curtain pulling levers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I fear this may be the case. People don&#39;t want to believe their idol (HRC or Trump) has been lying to them all along. But the fact of the matter is, you don&#39;t get to Trump&#39;s position without being vetted by the establishment. Whether that&#39;s to carry on their orders as set up by previous administrations or to be the scapegoat for imminent disaster, or both. Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst case scenario.</p>

<p>People playing the partisan blame game are still missing the point.  The longer the left/right division continues, the less of a chance we have of banding together to advocate for TRUE human rights. People underestimate the power we have when united. People are jaded and have forgotten the human capacity - no, the human <em>hunger</em> - for justice and righteousness, for real freedom.  We&#39;ve been told and treated like we&#39;re too stupid to make our own choices as citizens, as voters, as consumers, as democrats, as republicans, as independents, as blacks, as whites, as hispanics, as men, as women, as the &quot;gender fluid.&quot; The narrative is pre-set to divide us, and people play right into it.  We need to wake the fuck up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, both sides, the left suckling the liberal news and the right suckling the Trump supporting conservative news, has led to a division that is very blinding to look at. It&#39;s like looking into the eyes of insanity. But all the presidents walk in step with one another, leading to more globalization, no one gets in unless they pass inspection.</p>

<p>Most people only know slavery, they do not know or they cannot perceive a reality of true freedom. The fact that we could collectively decide to end the crap anytime, takes everyone to see things with objective morality. </p>

<p>It also takes people to see what reality could be if we collectively decided to end the crap. That level of philosophical thinking is inaccessible to consumerists, hedonists, and sheeple.   </p>

<p>It becomes easy to jump on the &quot;Where our messiah?&quot; bandwagon, when in reality the people are the solution. As long as majority of people look for a political messiah, we just go around and around again.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it would.  Do you know anything about the history of the US?    The revolution happened because Britain demanded taxation to be payable only in gold, essentially making American scrip worthless.  Lincoln created the greenback, a debtless government printed currency to fund the civil war without going hugely in debt to European-tied financiers.  In the late 1800&#39;s British bankers bribed congress to remove the silver-standard, why?  Because the banks had all the gold, it solidified their economic control and caused major depressions in the states due to bankers tightening the money supply.  For over a century Britain covertly tried to force the US into the gold standard, why? Because Britain had a fuckload of gold and could use it to influence the States.  A interest-free, government printed (not private central bank) currency would completely take away power from foreign financiers.  It was advocated by the likes of Lincoln and Garfield and is what got them killed.  </p>

<p>I thought the gold standard might be the answer for a long time, too.  But its not because gold is even more concentrated in the hands of the elite few.  The answer is the abolishment of fractional reserve banking and the bond market, and interest-free money created under the control of congress, not private central banks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sboh-_w43W8">You should watch this far superior video.</a>  You might realize that history is on my side, even before they were fighting bond-printing private Central banks, the founding fathers were fighting the gold standard.  Before the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, the American Banking Association used the gold standard to exert economic control over America by constricting the gold supply (they owned most of the gold.. how many times do I have to repeat this?) resulting in bankruptcy and foreclosure, allowing them to buy businesses and vast swathes of land for pennies on the dollar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pro tip: When looking for legitimate discussion, try not to pass your baseless opinions off as facts, and perhaps show an openness to dialogue. But most importantly, provide some evidence to go with your assertions, otherwise you&#39;re more likely to get snarky comments like mine than the actual discussion you may be looking for.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t make a post &quot;meant for a discussion&quot; as you did. Showing an openness to dialogue isn&#39;t a rule of mine, it&#39;s what you said you were trying to accomplish with your original post, so yea hypocrite doesn&#39;t really fit here but oh well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nobody said you had to. I already admitted my comment was snarky, so obviously I wasn&#39;t seeking a discussion with you, just giving advice.</p>

<p>The delivery on the joke was pretty terrible too. South Park smug video? What are you 8?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The news did find it&#39;s downfall, but that just created the environment for Slate, Salon, NYT, the Guardian, and MotherJones to dominate the minds of left-leaning 20 somethings. </p>

<p>While at the same time, you have Steven Crowder, Milo, Ben Shapiro, Alex Jones, and dozens of other far right guys supporting Trump, ignoring all of his faults and highlighting his greatest moments. </p>

<p>The republicans had their own version of Correct the record, plus all the people who hated Hillary, and the subtle mind fuck game where reasonable people were asking, &quot;are they seriously trying to push Hillary for president, when she should be in prison?&quot; </p>

<p>Trump definitely couldn&#39;t get anywhere without support from our good ole shadow government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I was EXTREMELY skeptical about Trump until shortly before the election. As shocked as I am, I think that he managed to play the establishment and now they are out for blood. The continuous stream of threads like this one feels like more of the same professional manipulation and FUD. Not because of the topics and ideas being discussed, but because of the familiar onslaught of dishonest debate tactics. For example, trying to disguise personal opinion as objective fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I strongly suspect you are correct. The parallels between Trump&#39;s and Obama&#39;s first campaign were marked: Both exploited populist sentiment to win. Obama did nothing. Only time will tell us what Trump will do. If Trump maintains the status quo, I would hope that the public finally realizes that no sugnificant change can be achieved with an election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What really needs to happen is that 1. people stop waiting and relying on some political figure to change the status quo, 2. people grow up and stop fighting, which requires the humility to acknowledge that they each got played bad, and 3. the &quot;good&quot; people in all sides need to grow some fucking balls and get it together and collectively advocate for truth and transparency and accountability. This last thing is the most difficult but the most desperately needed at this stage.</p>

<p>Precisely. I imagine that one of the goals of Trump&#39;s victory was to promote further division. And it worked brilliantly. Conservatism/liberalism is just rhethoric that the puppets spout for the masses while they do the bidding of the elite. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like Obama and Bush Jr are exactly the same, they get their orders from higher up. </p>

<p>Trump is acting and saying so many contradictory things it&#39;s hard to pin down what he&#39;ll actually do. But he&#39;ll be the same song and dance, they all are.</p>
