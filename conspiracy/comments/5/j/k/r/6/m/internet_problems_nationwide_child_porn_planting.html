        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>installing Child porn, invisible malware or surveillance, or are they simply controlling the flow or deletion of info faster than ever?</em></p>

<p>In the past few days I&#39;ve seen people posting about their internet providers going down suspiciously, and as they conferred with each other it seems like different providers were going down almost sequentially across the country. (AT&amp;T for a few days, then another for a few days, etc) 
--- And suspicions were being raised that somehow (I don&#39;t know because I&#39;m not much of a techie) thst things were being planted on computers when they did come back up.</p>

<p>Lo and behold our AT&amp;T went down and we&#39;re still trying to get it up. The wife is currently getting talked through a lengthy session and they seem to be making her download some new provider software,  which seems really suspicious to me, because every other time it has gone down all we have to do is reset the router. However that isn&#39;t working this time. </p>

<p>So I guess we&#39;ll see if my mother in law&#39;s Mac that she only uses for YouTube painting videos and Netflix suddenly comes back up loaded with CP. sigh.</p>

<p>Now why would this be happening nationwide? So that the government can say that Russia has done it, and if CP exists on everyone&#39;s computer, then those that have been guilty of it can say oh it was put there by Russia - instantly giving a get out of jail free card to everyone involved in pizzagate and beyond. </p>

<p>Or else just making criminals out of everyone. Either or.</p>

But I do know that my computer and connection have been absolutely fine for a long time until I started discussing and researching into pizzagate, and then I started getting moments where my entire computer seemed to get severely bogged down, pages unable to load, task manager unable to kill programs, etc. My malware program consistently says nothing is detected, so my initial thought was surveillance bogging things down. But again it could just be the paranoia jitters that come with knowing you&#39;re investigating something that many people have been murdered/suicided over. No idea, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, yes it certainly seems like a desperate move- silence truths and do the double damage of covering up their tracks and dirtying everyone else&#39;s.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any small coincidence that this is happening so close to people really waking up about pizzagate and other elite crimes. The endgame is like the elite&#39;s version of the Predator&#39;s self-destruct kill switch - &#39;if I&#39;m going down i&#39;m taking you all out with me&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, so, a bit of an update- it&#39;s apparently escalated and they have to send out a tech to us this afternoon. Now, every time we&#39;ve had an issue, it&#39;s been a simple power outage and reset situation we do ourselves. There was one time lightning fried our landline and burned out a modem, and we are currently on a modem that they JUST gave us. We actually Had internet though extremely slow this morning, and after two hours of them trying to get my wife to download new software and direct her to various providing links (some work weakly, some not at all) my wife tried to get them to bring it back to the original setting that allowed for slow service, the phone tech said &#39;well this has escalated and we&#39;ll be sending a tech out&#39;. 
There&#39;s nothing wrong with the modem on our end, only what they were trying to get her to download...Seems like they couldn&#39;t do what they wanted to us remotely.</p>

When I called the providers I was given the excuse of &quot;routine maintenance&quot;.  When asked what was exactly done I was given attitude.  Most likely because working for an ISP in the call center just plain sucks, but were they told to not explain what exactly happened?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our techs, both phone and in person, had lots of attitude today – I want to just assume it was because they were overloaded with many of the same reports.  Our in-home tech couldn&#39;t give us a straight answer, was very short with any polite questions, and in the end just couldn&#39;t explain what the problem was. We aren&#39;t even sure how fixed it is, he just left,  and his final piece of advice was, &#39;I don&#39;t know maybe it&#39;s your home phone that has a short in it.&#39;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they were short and belligerent because their agents of evil or anything, LOL, I just think they are as bewildered as we are and very busy</p>

<p>so your assertion is that the poor schmuck working at AT&amp;T who told your wife&#39;s mom to update her firmware (which is about 1 click away from resetting the router) today is moving in lockstep with a grand global conspiracy to put child porn on everyone&#39;s computers so that the government can say that essentially all child porn on all people&#39;s computers was placed there by russia, thus essentially decriminalizing possession of child porn?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep digging deep into the &#39;new&#39; threads or try &#39;controversial&#39; too-  I was reading some last night before bed, I&#39;m too busy with my child today (while tech is here) to post the direct links, I&#39;m sorry. But any of the endchan stuff backs up the outages and shady tech side of it. The link that&#39;s the first response here is a good door to the rabbit hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When everyone just does what they&#39;re instructed from the top down without asking questions anything&#39;s possible. Child porn planting? Yeah it does sound nuts. I don&#39;t want to be right. I read about 20 other posts yesterday on the very same thing from posters who know more about such capabilities than I do. Feel free to go find those posts and belittle them too. I posted a what if. </p>

<p>thats a remote ISP function, not something a domestic user does or should need to do.</p>
