    <div class="md"><p>The biggest Conspiracy that no one wants to talk about in this sub (and the proof is to see how downvoted I get) is the spread of fundamentalist Islam via Wahhabism funded by Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Nostradamus predicted WW3 would be the world versus a global Islamic Army and that the all of Europe would be Islamic, and this is honestly one of the biggest threats to the World today.</p>

<p>Now many of us can argue that the rise of this unholy beast, is due to the M.I.C. (Military Industrial Complex) meddling in the Middle East and the whole 9/11 justification. Maybe the Zionists did it to get us to perpetually fight the Enemies that they are surrounded by, who knows.</p>

<p>Regardless, Islam is the world&#39;s biggest threat right now but for some reason people on this sub just downvoat any mention of it</p>

<p>So, extremism in islam didn&#39;t come to fruition on its own, religious root. </p>

<p>All religions are the same, can be interpreted as gentle or as extreme, given the circumstances. Remember the Holy crusades ? 
But, surely can&#39;t remember the Golden age of Islam which happened at the same time ? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age</a></p>

<p>The funny thing is , all religions have the same root, source. </p>

<p>Never attach the evil to any perticular religion, it was always the fight between good and evil, between rich and poor. This is a complicated world. At least half of those &#39;Allahu Akhbar&#39; events and videos were staged to further some agenda. Don&#39;t be easily manipulated.</p>

<p>Islam extremism has always existed within those cultures and all it takes is simple research on their culture. Beheadings, stonings, cutting off of hands, lashings, rampant pedophilia with &#39;dancing boys,&#39; fighting/wars amongst each other (countries) and within their own culture (tribes, shia vs sunni).</p>

<p>Also all you have to do is study The Arab Byzantine Wars:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine_wars">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine_wars</a></p>

<p>The Islamic Armies have devastated, destroyed, murdered, killed, pillaged, and so forth since their founding. I agree with you that the creation of ISIS, Al-Queda and such other groups is because of U.S. meddling, however this the Middle East was already a beehive which would react from the poke of any stick from anyone in the World.</p>

<p>Also Al-Queda arguably had its creation because the Russian/Afghanistan wars</p>

<p>I deeply believe Islam is a major actor in the world&#39;s end Theater. They will fight anything that opposes them to the end. Either they will subjugate us, or perish. I can&#39;t see any middle-ground.</p>

<p>They breed 3 times faster than the people native to the place they are now. In 20~40 years, there will be more Muslims in Europe than Europeans. When they get to this point, sharia will be only law there.</p>

<p>Actually the Russia + Afghanistan war gave birth to Al-Qaeda via a proxy war by the CIA coming in and training Bin Laden = Others. So technically its Russia and U.S.</p>

<p>Regardless, as stated in another reply, Fundie Islam is a Psycho Beehive that was poked long time ago and continuously since, by various countries, U.S., NATO, Israel, Russia, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, I still see this as the biggest threat and if you believe Nostradamus&#39; predictions, WW3 will be the World versus Islamic Armies. Furthermore, if you investigate and study various forms of Islam, specific Wahhabism which is the source of terrorism, they have a plan/goal of World domination by immigration, invasions, outbreeding, spreading mosques, getting positions of power in local government until the entire local government is Muslim (See Dearborn Michigan, various locals in France, the Islamic mayor of London and various Muslims in local London Government)</p>

<p>Do you know that every single Wahhabist you tell this to, would disagree and see you as a blasphemer?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Except the majority of Muslims have a separatist mentality and would prefer to elect other Muslim associates/friends and their own ideology is much more important and has a greater authority than whatever the rules are of the Government they are part of.</p>

<p>You can do research on any country that shifted to eventual majority Muslim and watch the old laws/rules change to those of Sharia and 3rd world mentality.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a breakdown of what happens as the Muslim population increases in any country:</p>

<p><a href="https://heavenawaits.wordpress.com/muslim-behavior-with-population-increase/">https://heavenawaits.wordpress.com/muslim-behavior-with-population-increase/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When politically correct and culturally diverse societies agree to ‘the reasonable’ Muslim demands for their ‘religious rights,’ they also get the other components under the table. Here’s how it works (percentages source CIA: The World Fact Book (2007)).</p>

<p>As long as the Muslim population remains around 1% of any given country they will be regarded as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to anyone. In fact, they may be featured in articles and films, stereotyped for their colorful uniqueness</p>

<p>At 2% and 3% they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs:</p>

<p>Denmark — Muslim 2%
Germany — Muslim 3.7%
United Kingdom — Muslim 2.7%
Spain — Muslim 4%
Thailand — Muslim 4.6%</p>

<p>From 5% on they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population.</p>

<p>They will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature it on their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply. (United States ).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can read the rest of what happens as the population percentage increases at the link provided. Like I said, this is the World&#39;s biggest existential threat</p>

<p><a href="http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov6/15.html">http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov6/15.html</a></p>

<p>Chapter 15.
Spetsnaz&#39;s First World War</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The overture is carried by agents of the secret services of the Soviet satellite countries and by mercenaries recruited by intermediaries. The principal method employed at this stage is &#39;grey terror&#39;, that is, a kind of terror which is not conducted in the name of the Soviet Union. The Soviet secret services do not at this stage leave their visiting cards, or leave other people&#39;s cards. The terror is carried out in the name of already existing extremist groups not connected in any way with the Soviet Union, or in the name of fictitious organisations.
The GRU reckons that in this period its operations should be regarded as natural disasters, actions by forces beyond human control, mistakes committed by people, or as terrorist acts by organisations not connected with the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Do you know that every single Wahhabist you tell this to, would disagree and see you as a blasphemer?</p>

<p>Having Muslims in government isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. What is important is whether they are competent and benefit their constituents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except the majority of Muslims have a separatist mentality and would prefer to elect other Muslim associates/friends and their own ideology is much more important and has a greater authority than whatever the rules are of the Government they are part of.</p>

<p>You can do research on any country that shifted to eventual majority Muslim and watch the old laws/rules change to those of Sharia and 3rd world mentality.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a breakdown of what happens as the Muslim population increases in any country:</p>

<p><a href="https://heavenawaits.wordpress.com/muslim-behavior-with-population-increase/">https://heavenawaits.wordpress.com/muslim-behavior-with-population-increase/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When politically correct and culturally diverse societies agree to ‘the reasonable’ Muslim demands for their ‘religious rights,’ they also get the other components under the table. Here’s how it works (percentages source CIA: The World Fact Book (2007)).</p>

<p>As long as the Muslim population remains around 1% of any given country they will be regarded as a peace-loving minority and not as a threat to anyone. In fact, they may be featured in articles and films, stereotyped for their colorful uniqueness</p>

<p>At 2% and 3% they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs:</p>

<p>Denmark — Muslim 2%
Germany — Muslim 3.7%
United Kingdom — Muslim 2.7%
Spain — Muslim 4%
Thailand — Muslim 4.6%</p>

<p>From 5% on they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population.</p>

<p>They will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature it on their shelves — along with threats for failure to comply. (United States ).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can read the rest of what happens as the population percentage increases at the link provided. Like I said, this is the World&#39;s biggest existential threat</p>
