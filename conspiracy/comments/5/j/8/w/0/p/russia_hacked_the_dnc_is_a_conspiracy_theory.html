       People tend to believe what they want to believe, on some level. It's a large part of being human, and it's very difficult to completely escape it. This is why thorough, respectful debates are so important, so we can help each other as humans to overcome our biases together. Unfortunately there is very little of that (thorough, respectful debates) going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been proven wrong on a few things in the past couple of months by people were willing to have thoughtful, respectful debate with me. It's possible. It's just so rare, unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of people I've tried debating with about the Russian Hack theory, just copy/paste from the Washington Post or from outlets who are copy/pasting from the Washington Post. It all goes back to the WP articles, who don't have any actual sources except for in one article.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-penetrated-dnc-stole-opposition-research-on-trump/2016/06/14/cf006cb4-316e-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html?utm_term=.9fbad64a73be">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But another journalist did a much better job of asking questions about this story:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-election-hack-vladimir-putin-personally-involved-us-intelligence-officials-say/">
        http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-election-hack-vladimir-putin-personally-involved-us-intelligence-officials-say/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And noticed that some parts of the story didn't make any sense, but the journalist wasn't given an explanation for those issues. This journalist also helps point out that it was a private company, not an arm of the government, who originally claimed Russian interference, which is important because people ought to know the history of that company, what it does and for whom it works (over 170 nations) and also understand that the DNC waited for months after allegedly being alerted to the "hacking" to then call in a private company, who then blamed Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people just copy/pasting from Washington Post are not doing their homework, so when I try to bring up these details, they just meltdown into ad hominem attacks and deflection.

       People are hugely emotionally invested in this theory, as you suggest; they're impervious to facts or reason. It's a dangerous groupthink of the kind that's previously led to war.

       What I wonder, is if there has always been a lack of ability to have thorough, respectful debates, or if that was largely socially engineered. The latter seems more likely, when I consider the psychological/social effects of modern communication, and also how effective divide-and-conquer is in a two party system where everyone is encouraged to be polarized and think in team sports terms. And then when I also contemplate how philosophers of old allegedly used to just sit around debating significant things with each other in an orderly manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder when it became such a terrible thing to be wrong or uncertain sometimes. It's like people have the expectation on themselves that they must never be wrong about anything, or else it means something terrible about them. I'm pretty sure it's just a normal part of being human. But it's like it terrifies so many people. Or maybe most people are terrified of being human. Who knows.

       Western societies appear to have become more individualistic, competitive and dog-eat-dog since the 1970s. That's probably part of it. Another factor is the antagonistic, often abusive climate of debate on the Internet. People's attention spans are shorter because of the Internet as well, which lessens the scope for thorough debate. It's often hard to go beyond general debating points unless you go to specialised chat sites, which you can't just casually drop in and out of.

       An act of "conspiracy" isn't accepted as uncommon. It's the veracity of the add-on to that word.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russia link is (supposedly) the conclusion reached based on tracing the hack's origin. That's not a conspiracy theory, that's a likelihood, not found by going backwards and trying to tie the hack to the Russians, but by finding that that's where it came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is based on accepting that the CIA is being truthful and not lying to elected officials by being controlled by the DNC or whatever. The conspiracy theory is that they're lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you lose a pen, and your friend comes over and says "oh, Steve took it", and it's on Steve's desk, that's not the conspiracy theory to say "Steve took my pen". The conspiracy theory would be that Steve is being framed.

       Yeah that's true, we don't know that, but if they're the origin of the hack, it would just make sense putting 2 and 2 together. Otherwise it was either leaked coincidentally with the hack, or the hacked emails were sold to a 3rd party we don't know about who passed it to wikileaks. The Russian link just makes more sense at this point, but it's not necessarily true.

       The point is that conspiracy theories usually come from saying "what if X happened instead" and going back to search for holes in the official story to fit a different narrative. The CIA didn't just say "Russia did it" and looked for the evidence later, they said their investigation lead them to a Russian group as the origin.

       Except Russian hacking is not a conspiracy theory. It's a real event that happened.

       Pizzagate is a conspiracy theory: a bunch of people decided upfront that Hilarys emails contained evidence of wrongdoing, and when they couldn't find anything more exciting than getting the questions to the debate they decided to make up shit about devil worship and child abuse.

       What I wonder, is if there has always been a lack of ability to have thorough, respectful debates, or if that was largely socially engineered. The latter seems more likely, when I consider the psychological/social effects of modern communication, and also how effective divide-and-conquer is in a two party system where everyone is encouraged to be polarized and think in team sports terms. And then when I also contemplate how philosophers of old allegedly used to just sit around debating significant things with each other in an orderly manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder when it became such a terrible thing to be wrong or uncertain sometimes. It's like people have the expectation on themselves that they must never be wrong about anything, or else it means something terrible about them. I'm pretty sure it's just a normal part of being human. But it's like it terrifies so many people. Or maybe most people are terrified of being human. Who knows.
