        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Carl Sagan was awarded a grant in 1962 by NASA to write an article about what the possibility of ET capability to reach Earth and then the possibility of them having done so and interacted with us in the past. Sagan moved from Berkeley to Palo Alto and focused on the scholarly article, which was peer reviewed. when Sagan concluded that not only was this not just possible but highly probable. NASA did everything in its power to make the article disappear. 
After getting vitriol on multiple fronts, Sagan began publicly backing the opposite argument to his article, including while he was the host of the TV series &quot;Cosmos&quot;. Its nearly impossible to find much on the internet about this at all. But there is a book and if you find this sort of thing interesting, its worth the read</p>

<p>Here is an article about it the submission:

    <div class="md"><p>i found it strange that NASA didnt get the answer they were attempting to buy and then he flipped his stance. He didnt seem the type to fold to pressure. He loved science and the truth</p>

    <div class="md"><p>he talked about it being propbable that aliens existed and contacted humans but it did seem like he didn&#39;t have hard proof of it so never said he did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well NASA asked for the probability. Not proof, but it appears they wanted a solid &quot;0 probability&quot; answer</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah and not just 0 probability of aliens existing, but specifically the part about interacting in the past with humans. NASA regularly admits that since universe is so huge it&#39;s highly likely aliens exist. But interacting with humans leads to questions they don&#39;t want answered like truth about religion, where technology came from, how did elite families gain control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep, i feel like Sagan tried to be honest and then probably got some serious blowback, especially because NASA was paying the bill for him to hang out in Palo Alto at Stanford</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I followed the ancient astronaut stuff back when Chariots of the God&#39;s came out and started watching the show until it got ridiculous (Ancient Aliens and the Founding Fathers ?!?). Some of the shows are good because they show some cool places like all of the pyramids, underwater cities and underground caves but trying everything to Aliens just got retarded. I think they&#39;re officially out of ideas. </p>
