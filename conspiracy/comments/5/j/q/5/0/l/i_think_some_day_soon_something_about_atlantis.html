       There are so many cultures from around the world that have a flood myth, a great deluge from a catastrophic disaster. Lots of these cultures also have other things in common like the building of pyramids and advanced knowledge of the stars. What is more likely, that they each individually developed these myths, architectural practices, and methods of astronomy on their own, or that they all got it from a far more developed culture that they all came from or had members that came from that taught them these things?
      </p>
      <p>
       A single source for all of this makes far more sense than saying they each individually came up with the flood myth, pyramid structure, and advanced astronomical knowledge. There have already been plenty of people who have found things in the Atlantic ocean, such as the Bimini road and many other ruins in the bahamas and even in the Azores. This points to that Atlantis wasn't just a city, but rather a continent, one that spanned the gap of the
       <em>
        Atlantic
       </em>
       ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be far more likely that Atlantis would be a continent, a landmass capable of holding large amounts of people, rather than simply a city, since the same patterns of advanced civilization turn up in far parts of the world, with the Yucatan and Egypt being some of the most obvious, indicating that they had vast influence all over the globe and that speaks of a population that simply couldn't exist within a singular city.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus there's the fact that the Egyptian and Yucatan civilizations had
       <strong>
        many
       </strong>
       cities of their own, so it would be ridiculous to think that a single city-state would be able to influence and most likely start such advanced civilizations, since the resources available to them if it was simply a lone city or even a small island or even a medium sized country island wouldn't be enough. That would then get into the question of how Atlantis was started and why the starters of such a civilization would choose such a small place to begin, and the most probable answer to that is that they wouldn't. They would choose a very large landmass that is suitable for expansion and population growth. Plato's version of Atlantis simply talks about a city, which very well could have been, and most likely was, simply been one of the cities in Atlantis or perhaps its capital city.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plato himself got the story of Atlantis from Solon who himself got it from the Egyptians, who are far older than the Greeks and had far more advanced knowledge. There is already plenty of speculation as to the age of the pyramids and the sphinx and they are almost assuredly far older than "mainstream" egyptology (which is also assuredly funded by the governments of the world and the elite to build a web of disinformation around it) would have us believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the Egyptians themselves have said that the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx were there since before they could remember. This then leads one to question other areas of archaeology that are almost assuredly also funded and influenced by the elites to sew disinformation around it, mainly the age of the Central American (Yucatan) civilizations, like the beings who created
       <a href="http://www.livescience.com/images/i/000/030/183/original/shutterstock_61577362.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;fit=inside%7C660:*">
        this
       </a>
       . They are most likely also far older, since they share so many similarities to ancient Egypt. This points to both of these places being possible colonies of Atlantis, places that they expanded to. And they could very well have been founded shortly after the great deluge that these cultures, and many other cultures, speak of happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the way in which they construct their architectural marvels. These pyramids and other structures are quite simply, things we can't recreate today with the precision that they created them with. The alignments to the stars and the synchronization with energetic currents running through the ground is uncanny and something that we could probably just barely do, and most likely with nowhere near the effectiveness at harnessing the energy or the precision with which they did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some archaeologists breaking from the current status quo that was created for control of the planet and that is maintained by the elites, including one geologist who points out that the water damage on the sphinx is erosion over thousands of years, placing the date of its creation somewhere between 9000-11000 bc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This throws the entire accepted story of humanity as being savage neolithic people into question since things simply don't add up when you examine the markers of the past that the elite don't want us to examine. They have us buy into the accepted narrative of civilization's start and falsify evidence, buy off or threaten archaeologists and scientists, and do everything in their power to spread disinformation about humanity's origins and the origins of civilization on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget about the very trivial things like politicians and their scandals, or even bigger things like mass surveillance. That completely pails in comparison to humanity learning about its true past and that humanity might have actually once known a golden age before this current dark age (kali yuga as the hindus call it).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reason why there is essentially nothing on Atlantis and why the ancient aliens people are so ridiculed everywhere and marginalized. There is a reason why archaeologists don't talk about it or inquire about it aside from silly skepticism that might be attributed to them. That of course happens often but there are plenty that would kill to know the true origins of civilization that are evident to those who don't swallow the pill the elite and their system of control (which includes most mainstream science).
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite have so much influence and control over this world and they have used a great amount of that influence and control to almost completely suppress all mention or investigation of Atlantis as they know for a complete fact that if and when more information/discoveries about Atlantis comes up that it will signify the true end to their domination of this world, since it will completely de-legitimize their entire narrative of the state of the world and its history and this in turn will utterly destroy their system of control that runs through literally ever facet of life including science, religion, literature, media, music, food, resources, psychology of the masses, technology, and probably their biggest method of control, economics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economics being overturned will itself influence every other aspect of life since the capitalist structure that encompasses the globe is their main power structure. They are the elite primarily because of this system of capitalism, and the people of earth suffer most because of this system. This allows them to keep their power the most, and with Atlantis being shoved upon the world, their system of inequality by force and law will be undone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The death of the narrative precedes the death of the system and Atlantis is the absolute key to that narrative dying. We already see evidence of other beings from other places visiting daily, but their system of control over people's minds and lives makes most people remain docile and it doesn't truly destroy the narrative. It makes some people question the narrative and some of those people in turn reject the system, but the elite have done a remarkable job at keeping it under wraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       More people wake up to the narrative every day thanks to increased sightings, and increased disillusionment with life but the narrative will truly die once Atlantis is revealed to the world. And I think that some day very soon, information and/or discoveries about it will come up and it will spark a frenzy in the lower parts of the web that will trickle up through different parts of the internet and social media and eventually it will be impossible to stop its dissemination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we don't know the entire truth about Atlantis but everything points to not only its existence, but its level of advanced knowledge and technology. Egypt and the Yucatan were most likely merely colonies that were established slightly before or after the time of the flood/deluge, and that would have meant that since the continent of Atlantis was essentially wiped away, there would have not been much they could have saved or brought with them technology-wise, and yet we still find these architectural marvels that are precisely aligned to various stars like Sirius or to the Summer/Winter Solstices. This hints that if they were at this level when they were at their lowest, then the level they were at when they were at their highest would have been truly incredible, and to put it more frankly, insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a civilization with such a high level of technology and knowledge would almost assuredly have such a high standard of living that there would be no massive inequality or crime or possibly even disease for that matter. They almost assuredly wouldn't have had a system of economics that was literally built around inequality and competition, as there would neither be no reason for it (due to no corrupting influences, until possibly later near its destruction) and no propensity towards it since it wouldn't have been a time where anyone wanted those things (except perhaps, at the end when it was destroyed). There is only ever a reason for this kind of system when there is a corrupting influence that either forces it on people or tricks them into believing it will help everyone. And there is only ever a propensity towards it if someone wants it, and I can assure you that today, there are people that want it (the elite, but also all of the people that they have fooled into believing it will help everyone).
      </p>
      <p>
       That then hints that that section of humanity (which must have included a massive portion of the population of Earth) wasn't involved in negativity and didn't have any of the things that create so many negative situations and attitudes in people today (like the system of control that has poisoned everything today). Thus it would have essentially been a utopia, barring the few inevitable things like death and injury. But with a civilization that advanced, in both technology and knowledge, they might have been able to heal things that we can't heal today and might have even known things like what happens after death, and might have even known a way to prolong life far past what we consider to be "natural" lifespans today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus since all of this points to a literal utopia on earth, when discoveries and information about it come out, it will spark such interest due to disillusionment with the current system and hope for a better world that it will be a snowball effect that the elite cannot stop, and that will be their undoing and we could finally return to that level or one near it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can help this occur by fostering discussion about it and curiosity about it and making the connection from it to its probable colonies (Egypt, the Yucatan, Peru) and the other places that have demonstrated affinity towards monolithic architecture and advanced knowledge of Astronomy. There is already discussion about these places but the connection to Atlantis is what is missing, and it is indeed the missing puzzle piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       There could be other influences like e.t.'s, but that almost assuredly would have come in conjunction with Atlantis and Atlantis, being at such an advanced level, would probably have had communication with e.t.'s and could very well have gotten lots of their knowledge from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Ancient Aliens theorists don't go after the missing puzzle piece of Atlantis. They either mention it or vaguely speculate about it, or they go straight to e.t.'s without going to the heart. Atlantis is the thing that is missing that will truly destroy the narrative the elite have built and thus their system of control and dominance over the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we can help destroy that narrative by once again fostering discussion and research and most importantly, exploration of the area where Atlantis would have been. This might not be a very viable solution to most people since most people can't afford to raise an expedition to the Bahamas or other parts of the Caribbean, but getting involved with those that already have is crucial to the dissemination of their discoveries/findings!
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people think Atlantis is simply a myth and that there isn't anything down there on the Atlantic seabed but they're wrong and they will be proven wrong as time goes on and as more discoveries pop up. But we can hasten that by fostering discussion/research and most importantly
       <strong>
        getting involved, either by forming expeditions with others to make discoveries, or by getting involved with those who already are making discoveries
       </strong>
       . You can find them, they're easy to find if you simply do research on Atlantis on things like Youtube and Google. Those websites, and the internet in general, are amazing tools that can be used to literally overhall the system and then destroy it, as mass dissemination is now possible due to it (the internet), and thats the key to the destruction of the narrative and system of the elites.

       I think you can be on to something here. I might be able to help a little bit. Have you looked into Graham Hancock? You mention archaeologists challenging the general consensus of the age of the pyramids and sphinx, he does this too. He made it his life work to find "lost civilizations" and even for him, Atlantis is a key part. I cannot stress enough how professional this man is, he doesn't budge one inch to either side of the argument. He doesn't settle until he's been to the places physically and done his own work on the sites. He's been all over the world, scuba diving and excavating sites for months on end. He's written books and done documentaries about it. Some of the things he's finding is absolutely
       <em>
        amazing
       </em>
       . One example is that there's counter-claim to the theory of sunken cities in east/south Asia so he decided to go there. Funny enough, he finds what seems to be full ruins on the seabed.
       <a href="https://subharanjangupta.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/yonaguni.jpg">
        The common scientific consensus is that this is coincidental
       </a>
       . Does it look like it is?
      </p>
      <p>
       He explores the theory of a great flood, too. He does this simultaneously and in nearly
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       civilization he founds at least one theory of a ancient great flood. He is
       <em>
        so thorough
       </em>
       about it that he could pinpoint where the flood was coming from and if I remember correctly his best bet was in the North Atlantic Ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
       This man is a walking treasure, I tell you. He does
       <em>
        extremely well made
       </em>
       collaboration with other amazing historians and archaeologists, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I'm almost certain you've heard of him if you're this into the Atlantic theory. However, for anyone else. If you're the slightly interested in lost civilization and their potential advanced technology, listen to Graham for just a couple of minutes and you'll be hooked for days.

        Also, one example of ancient discoveries that doesn't fit into the current understanding of our history is the buried pyramids in Indonesia

       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/turkey/articles/Gobekli-Tepe-Turkey-a-new-wonder-of-the-ancient-world/">
        Another is Gobekli Tepe which is very new in terms of discovery
       </a>
       . The archaeologists doesn't really share an opinion on how old Gobekli Tepe is.
       <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/358139-5-mysterious-ruins-that-predate-known-civilization/">

       The point is that we're

        rapidly

       uncovering things that isn't suppose to exist. These massive buildings shouldn't exist because our current understanding of history is that there were no known civilization with this building technology.

       Two scholars and writers who founded the 20th century genre of High Fantasy - Tolkien and CS Lewis - both had an interest in Atlantis. This is significant, because they not merely novelists - that was the least of their activities. They were scholars of early Anglo-Saxon and Icelandic literature and mythology, among other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning Atlantis, Tolkien wrote that it belonged to: "something older and different––something brought to Western Europe after the fall of Numinor and going back to an era in which the general relations of mind and matter on this planet had been other than those we know."
      </p>
      <p>
       In the novel The Magicians Nephew, Lewis wrote of a box discovered by one of the characters: "It was very ancient. And I knew enough even then to know that it wasn’t Greek, or Old Egyptian, or Babylonian, or Hittite, or Chinese. It was older than any of those nations. Ah––that was a great day when I at last found out the truth. The box was Atlantean; it came from the lost island of Atlantis. That meant it was centuries older than any of the stone-age things they dig up in Europe. And it wasn’t a rough, crude thing like them either. For in the very dawn of time Atlantis was already a great city with palaces and temples and learned men'” (TMN, 22).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible that there is more than simple imagination in these references to Atlantis. Both of these men, so greatly interested in ancient lore and hidden spiritual traditions, may have given credence to the myth of Atlantis. Note Tolkien's idea that it was a time when the laws of physics operated differently.

       They were pioneers in the early discussion of Atlantis, but like everyone else in their time, were hampered by the narrative and system of the elite, and used fiction to express their interest, rather than being outright blatant and funding expeditions, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need more fictional writing about Atlantis, there's tons of that. We need non-fictional writing, since it's a non-fictional place/thing. We need more discussion/research, and not simply the skeptical, mainstream scientific type of discussion/research that hampers discovery and interest. We need connections to Atlantis, and we need to be making connections between Atlantis and the civilizations that have walked this earth before us. By making these connections people will realize its far more relevant than they ever could have imagined and this will pique their interest tremendously.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to be bold and unflinching, not timid and cautious. Timidity and cautiousness have gotten us nowhere and are simply conditions that have been placed upon us by the system of dominance and control that affects every aspect of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The time for timidity and cautiousness is over and its time to start being more active in pursuing this very thing (Atlantis), not most of the other garbage (Clinton/Trump/Politicians, False-flags, surveilance, scandals, etc.) that everyone is pursuing. That stuff and stuff like that that is overtly negative and obvious won't actually destroy their narrative or their system since people are apathetic to those things and/or feel hopeless to do anything about it because they are still under the influence of the narrative of the elites, which is the core of their system of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlantis and its rediscovery will destroy that narrative and then destroy the system. This sub needs to focus on this and needs to foster discussion/research on it and people need to get involved with each other and most importantly, with those already going on expeditions and making discoveries.

       I get what both you and OP are saying but I have a few thoughts for you. While what you say about Lewis is true I wonder what your thoughts would be on his firm Christian belief system that came later on in his life. It is my belief that the idea of Atlantis is very pronounced and an important aspect of understanding the real esoteric history of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like the OP to comment on this aspect of my statement if possible and your thoughts would be appreciated as well. But I believe your premise that Atlantis was a Utopia is a fallacy given by elites with secret knowledge to help perpetuate the idea to bring the NEW ATLANTIS to the world. Francis fucking Bacon literally wrote a book called "The New Atlantis" where he explained the elites plan for turning the Americas into a new utopian society for these secret societies. Atlantis is a major key to understanding many things about history of the world. But if you truly think about it, if these great spiritual beings were really in control of things, why would their great utopian society have happened in the past and been destroyed? If they're in control wouldn't it just have kept going?
      </p>
      <p>
       My belief is that Atlantis is most everything the stories say it was filled with longevity, advanced scientific understanding, and a great many things we probably can't even comprehend. I know the stories and why they said it was destroyed but if you try to follow the logic it doesn't make sense. The only texts that describes the deluge differently than all these ancient cultures did is The Bible and some Jewish literature that didn't quite make it in. Most ancient cultures described Atlantis from an almost envious point of view; somewhere they wanted to go again because something was lost. The Bible, along with the book of Enoch and others, on the other hand describes it equally as advanced but with a different twist. Instead the world before the deluge had gotten so corrupt that God needed to destroy the whole world to get rid of the nastiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just some food for thought that's all. The elites of the world are HIGHLY interested in the idea of Atlantis and have been for centuries. Be careful following the pedo, human sacrificing, and utterly corruptible secret teachings of the elite. Most likely all Atlantis is a metaphor for the preflood world and what it consisted of. Platos Atlantis talks about ten kings ruling the world.... a very interesting connection can be made in regards to the NWO and Agenda 21 dividing the world into 10 different regions. Hmm just an interesting connections I'd be interested to hear some thoughts.

       As to his firm Christian belief system that would simply indicate that he had a fascination with Atlantis, but was, like the vast majority of people then, still under the sway of the system of control and domination that the elite have created, and even more importantly, was under the control of their narrative. A huge part of this narrative and their system is Christianity, and it has fooled so many people into cowering before the church and ultimately, God, in order to keep them in fear. So ultimately he was simply still under their sway, despite his fascination with Atlantis. And again, he didn't do much to help discussion/research and discovery since he only wrote in fiction and treated it is fictional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Atlantis most likely fell because somewhere along the line, it developed its own form of elites that plunged it into destruction with their own system of control and domination. That would get into history going into cycles (which I won't go into in these replies) and if we're talking spirituality, learning lessons. The main point of any kind of truly effective and meaningful spirituality would be to learn different lessons so one can grow and make more connections, so one could appreciate existence more and expand infinitely in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would mean that there would be some kind of lesson or lessons involved in what happened to Atlantis and why it was destroyed. And since we know what happened to Atlantis was negative and involved great destruction, the lessons involved must have been about negativity and experiencing it. So there must have been some form of negativity that got attached to those who became the elites of Atlantis near the end of its existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would have become the elites if something negative had already happened to allow them to rise to power and/or establish a system of control and dominance that allowed them to stay in power. That would have meant that perhaps something devastating, yet simply to a smaller scale had happened on Atlantis that possibly fractured the populace, and it would have had to be something like a gigantic mistake made or more likely, a natural disaster that was unavoidable. And in the effort to make things better once again, those that became the elite would have offered solutions that hadn't yet been needed or wanted since nothing of the sort hadn't happened like that yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would have created a system based around competition and inequality because most likely, Atlantis had already become something of a shadow of it's former self due to said natural disaster. Now they might have been aware that something like this (the creation of this kind of system) was going to occur, but in the light of learning lessons (being a highly spiritual civilization), they would have been ok with it since it would bring new opportunities to learn different kinds of lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
       So more than likely the elite simply wanted to help in a dramatic way that was ultimately in a way that was inherently negative and destructive, much like the system we currently have. The only difference would have been that in the beginning, the elite then weren't doing it for negative reasons, but for perceived positive reasons, but in creating such a negative system, they in turn became corrupted by it, and coupled with the fact that learning lessons would be the most important part of life there, it would have simply been accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet more than likely, by becoming so negative and developing something like an ego (which would simply be a name for the attached negativity they developed), they would have lost touch with spirituality and the original point of learning lessons and simply would have started to desire control and power for negative reasons alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the destruction of Atlantis it clearly had natural disaster written all over it due to the flood, but almost certainly the flood was caused by earthquakes, and earthquakes large enough to cause a flood big enough to wipe out a continent would have had to been caused by some kind of major technological disaster, since it is likely that such an advanced civilization would have had technology, most likely in the energy department, that would be able to create such destruction if the conduits for such enormous energy were themselves destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coupling this with the reduced capacity of their civilization at this point, as well as the now blindness to the original spirituality of learning lessons by those in power, this would have been unavoidable to stop once it happened. And more than likely there would have still been those who were still spiritually aware, as the elite are an elite for a reason, there are a few of them that control much and influence a large portion of the population. So there would have been some who knew what was going on but were still ok with it since it would have provided very valuable lessons, regardless of how tragic it was becoming.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would mean that in order to be ok with such a thing they would have had to be ok with death, since death was going to come to a good portion, or the majority of the population of Atlantis. Being that ok with death, coupled with the learning of lessons, would mean that they almost assuredly knew what happened after we die, and wouldn't have had the fear of the unknown. And since this small portion that was still spiritually aware was but a shadow of Atlantis's former self, that would mean that at one time, all of Atlantis was spiritually aware in this manner and knew what happened after death, and therefore would have been totally free from fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       That point of lack of fear and negativity is what is possible when Atlantis is rediscovered and the elite's narrative and system are destroyed for good. The difference between this elite's system and the Atlantean elite's system would simply be that this elite never knew about learning lessons while the Atlantean elite did at first, but slowly lost sight of it completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since the Atlantean elite would have surely had at least some survivors, that would mean that they went to the colonies of Atlantis like everyone else, as well as the other areas of the world that were influenced by Atlantis. We do see that the colonies of Atlantis were highly advanced, that would mean that the elite (who at this point were devolved into negativity) wouldn't have had nearly as much control over the populace as they did and wouldn't have had as much power or influence since some of those who were aware of what was happening (the spiritually aware ones), would have also survived and went to the colonies to start again as well. There would have been a conflict of interest between the now negative elites and the spiritually aware ones, but most likely the populace would have seen what came of the elite's system and would have initially rejected them, probably forcing them into hiding or subservience.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would explain why we find such marvels and advanced knowledge of astronomy in these places, as the spiritually aware Atlanteans would have wanted to rebuild and try to recreate, in any fashion they could, the glory of Atlantis as it once was. But over time, the elite would have tried to grow their influence and power and most likely eventually managed to usurp the spiritually aware ones, with the spiritually aware Atlanteans knowing they and humanity could learn more valuable lessons from this so wouldn't have tried to stop it.

      </p>
      <p>
       That would then explain the power structure of the later versions of these civilizations that we know and the negativity they devolved into, like slavery and human sacrifice among other things. Their religions would have also come under the sway of the elites, most likely with some Atlanteans, regardless of whether they were now negative or spiritually aware, being worshiped now as gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add that to the the likelihood that e.t.'s were aware of all of this and would try to guide humanity on a path to learn the most lessons, and they would have interacted with these civilizations too, most likely early on when they were still somewhat spiritually aware. There wouldn't have been much point to try and guide these civilizations once the elite had been firmly established and thus most likely didn't visit very often or interact that much after that and that would have meant that the elites would have saw fit to try and control the population's admiration of these beings by deifying them and then controlling the religion to control the populace as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       There more than likely still would have been those who went underground in terms of showing their spiritual awareness and would have tried to guide these civilizations where they could within the system they found themselves in at that point, and would have most likely been the keepers of the advanced knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since the elites would have realized that although Atlantis would have been destroyed thousands of years ago (getting to the point in time where they took complete control), they still would have allowed these spiritually advanced ones to help civilization a little bit since knowledge of Atlantis still would have existed at that time and the populace most likely still would have had at least some inkling of what Atlantis was like.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as time went on this almost assuredly stopped being the case as the elites became ever more destructive and passed on their elitism to different 'initiates' (which would be a bastardization of the word as the true initiates would have been the ones who were taught the spiritual truths by those who retained some form of the spiritual awareness of Atlantis), and they would have then tried to control many different civilizations they came into contact with, like Greece or Rome or Babylon or the Aztecs (which would be far later on than the others) or different ones all throughout the world that developed a vested elite, etc. and this trend would have continued up until the present day when technology and a more developed inequality/competition system allowed them to really solidify global domination.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to the Aztecs, they would have stemmed from the group of elites that went West after the fall of Atlantis and over time most likely devolved so far that they even lost contact with the elite in the east and eventually grew to become their own localized elite that started believing the religious narrative the previous elite in the West would have created surrounding some of them and the other Atlanteans that were spiritually aware that helped start the colonies/earlier Yucatan civilizations, and they then came into contact with the soldiers of the European elite that were believed to be the gods of their religion and were then wiped out since they no longer remembered their origins. The knowledge of architecture and astronomy would have been passed on, but the spiritually aware ones that would have been initiates to previously spiritually aware ones would have either kept such a low profile that they didn't interfere with that society much or they were simply wiped out due to an increasingly barbaric and localized elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The knowledge of Atlantis would have been kept on in the ever changing circle of elites in the East (and most likely initially the West until around the time of the Aztec or possibly slightly before that) but the initial reason for their elitist system would have been lost for ages and they would have been completely cut off from any type of spiritual awareness that the first elites might have still had.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they surely would have been, are are almost assuredly still, aware of the power of Atlantis and just how amazing it was for everyone. Them being now inherently negative, controlling, and power-hungry, this would scare them more than anything, since it would destroy the millennia-long narrative they have built to disguise the origins of civilization on this planet. And again, that being destroyed would destroy their system.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, the elite do not want Atlantis to return or be discovered since the very idea of it doesn't indicate to them ultimate control over the world, they are already close to that. It indicates to them the destruction of their system of control and dominance, and they are correct in that indication.
      </p>
      <p>
       On an aside about Plato's story of Atlantis, he didn't come up with it himself and got it from another Greek who got it from the Egyptians. They would have had some knowledge of Atlantis at that point but it would have been heavily changed by the elites and most importantly, most of the original information on Atlantis would have been destroyed over time to hide the origins of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whatever knowledge Plato got was heavily altered and/or not anywhere near the whole truth, and so it would be heavily flawed and incomplete. And more than likely, for good measure, the elites would have tried to throw themselves into the story for good measure, but not a lot since that would be far too obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ten kings (a small elite) would be fitting and would make it seem like that's simply how Atlantis was, which would be wrong. It would have devolved into something like that over time. But making connections like you are is very important since it fosters discussion. But a key, key point to remember is to not focus on the overtly negative aspects, that doesn't get us anywhere. The just-made connection that the elites WANT Atlantis to return then puts Atlantis in a completely negative light, which couldn't be further from the truth. This will actively hamper all interest in the subject except morbid, defeated fascination since Atlantis will now have been associated with dystopia (which would be the elites controlling everything in a highly advanced civilization), rather than the utopia it most assuredly was.
      </p>
      <p>
       We want to return to what Atlantis was, but on a global scale, we don't want to demonize it and the idea of it by making overtly negative connections between it and the elite. The negativity comes from their system of control and is so ingrained in us that we literally think its part of ourselves and we automatically go that route, even once we start to question the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, questioning the narrative or system simply isn't enough to truly escape its effects, and its certainly nowhere near enough to destroy it, as we can clearly see today. To escape the effects of the narrative and the system we have to return to what the Atlanteans knew, their spiritual awareness. Part of the narrative and system of the elite is to be skeptical about spirituality or to believe in a powerless form that doesn't emphasize learning lessons. When you start focusing on learning lessons, you realize that one of the lessons to be learned is that the negativity of the world isn't natural, and isn't the natural state of things. That then truly allows you to escape the effects of the narrative and the system, since both of those are built entirely upon negativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       That then would indicate that the learning of lessons involving negativity has essentially come to an end. That would mean that it is now most important to learn the lesson that the negativity is no longer conducive to more lessons being learned, it is actually hampering them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So at this point, there is no longer any kind of spiritual benefit for keeping this system around and this signals its end. And since the e.t.'s that almost assuredly once helped Atlantis and the early versions that were most spiritually aware of the civilizations we see evidence of, that would mean that they will return soon to help us get back to where we were.
      </p>
      <p>
       This coincides with and is indicated by the increased number of sightings every single day of them in the skies all over the world. The elite know they are here and that is why you often hear of reports of "ufos" being chased by fighter jets or followed by helicopters.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that means that we aren't just destined to be done with this system and then simply have things stay the way they are. No, we are going to return to the type of technology, knowledge, and architecture that marked Atlantis. But we aren't going to just do this on a continental scale like Atlantis, its going to be global.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since we are going to become a true global civilization who will once again be in contact with beings from other places, that will mean we will really be ready to begin true expansion and possible colonization to other planets elsewhere. That will truly mark our ascent as a civilization into that of a type of star civilization, or star nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point we will then again live in a utopia, but this time there won't be any way we could return to the dark ages that we have lived and still currently live in, because we have already learned all of the lessons that we could have learned regarding it.

       What you wrote reminds my of Dr. Doreal's book on the Emerald Tablets of Thoth and theories put forth by Drunvallo Melchizedek. Are you aware of these authors?
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the overall themes of these authors is that Atlantis was not the pure Utopia. Atlantis was already in a decayed state when it fell. The Greeks believed in different ages of man. Golden age, silver age, bronze age, and iron age. The Golden age was the perfected state of humanity while each age that followed humans would become weaker, sicker, and more corrupt. Atlantis was not from the golden age but from the late silver age. The Golden age is sometimes called Lemuria.
      </p>
      <p>
       This idea is also echoed in the Hindu Vedas describing 4 ages of man. Presently we live in the Kali Yuga or age of the one legged cow. Previously there was the age of the 2 legged, 3 legged, and 4 legged cows. There is no zero legged cow so humanity must either return to the golden age or simply perish completely.

       Mists of Avalon briefly discusses Atlantis - and the writer later wrote entire books about it. Unfortunately there was a scandal of her husband being a pedophile which ruined most of her books for me. Anne rices new book also discusses Atlantis.

       Atlantis is the diversion man seeks to awaken or begin the process of awakening.

       Not a diversion, the
       <strong>
        key
       </strong>
       to awaken. Man has already begun the process of awakening, but that can't truly happen until Atlantis is rediscovered and people begin to discuss/research it. To think of Atlantis being a diversion is to do exactly what the elite want us to do. To think of it as a diversion is to discredit it and discount it, essentially meaning people will continually ignore it and focus on the negative trash that they are currently focusing on, whether its complete mainstream trash or supposed "conspiracy" trash like politicians, false flags, scandals, surveillance, corporate greed, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       That in turn will keep us locked in this system longer and won't hasten the destruction of the elite's narrative and in turn, it's system of control and domination.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, it's not a diversion to awakening, it's the absolutely essential key to humanity's awakening. And in case you didn't mean to use that word, the prose one uses is so very important as words are the things that convey the meaning we use to understand reality. Using a word like diversion indicates that it is something unnecessary and negative, something to be avoided and overcome, and that it is the exact opposite of what it actually is. So the usage of this word is in itself, completely counter-productive and harmful to what we want to accomplish, which is the destruction of the narrative of the elites and by that token, their system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Narratives are built using words, so the exact words one uses is so very important. Using words like diversion to describe Atlantis is utterly harmful and negative and only sets us back further, while simultaneously feeding into the elite's narrative and continuing its existence. It might seem so innocuous and minor but it really isn't, since that same lack of discretion when it comes to language is what most influences discussion and by extension, hampers it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discussion leads to research and research leads to interest. Interest then leads to involvement, and involvement leads to discovery. Discovery is what we want since it is the means to the end of destroying the narrative which the elite have created over millennia and is the core and binding thing of their system of control and dominance.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the usage of language and the avoidance of using overtly negative words when discussing the most crucial aspect to humanity's awakening is completely vital to destroying the elite's narrative and then system.

       This is most likely the case. Although it may well have been an independent landmass that submerged, the evidence is sparse. The only theory I can get behind is that as the pressure of the ice came off the north American and eurasian landmasses, and subsequently fell on the atlantic and pacific oceans, which along with rising sea levels, may have acutally sank the central points of the tectonic plates. This may help obscure the evidence for a nation sized island sinking beneath the waves in the central atlantic, leaving only the azore islands above water.

       Atlantis was quite evil by the time of her destruction. It is most likely that the true motivation for the secret societies is to resurrect Atlantis and usher in the fabled golden age. The occultist were quite enamored with the idea so much that they even call america the new atlantis. Read roger bacons book the new atlantis. Its pretty interesting from an esoteric point of veiw, and considering england wasn't even capable of establishing a colony when it was written, it has some far reaching implications.

       That is a speculative generalization about Atlantis as a whole, and posits complete negativity to it, while also proposing (like another poster I have replied too) the idea that it is something the elite (i.e. who control the secret societies) want to return, which in itself then posits the notion that Atlantis is a dystopia, which cannot be further from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlantis, or at least parts of it or large parts of it, would have certainly been controlled, in some degree, by a group of negative elites. But as I explained in my other replies in this thread, they would have created a negative system because they felt it would do good and help in response to something that happened, and the inherent negativity of a system of inequality and competition would have corrupted them. They would have then, and most assuredly did, lose sight of their original motive and the original spiritual awareness that was once the absolute norm on Atlantis and became completely negative with no notion of learning lessons or spirituality.
      </p>
      <p>
       That also gets into the point that at the time of Atlantis's destruction, it would have had a kind of resemblance to the state of the world today, except that there would have been a faction of spiritually aware Atlanteans that kept their advanced knowledge going, thus keeping their civilization from collapsing into dystopia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The notion that Atlantis itself was evil at this time also completely posits total negativity to all of Atlantis, rather than just the elite that ruled it or most/part of it. It would have been much like today, where a good amount or possibly majority of the populace would have been fooled by the narrative of the elite and would have been conditioned into negativity by them and their system, which could and might well have been a result of a decrease in spiritual awareness, possibly brought on by circumstances or an initial desire to learn lessons from negativity. That doesn't mean all of those Atlanteans were overtly negative like the elite had become, it simply means they were conditioned by what the elite had created and probably had initially chosen to accept the negativity to learn lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there have been groups of initiates who have been spiritually aware after the fall of Atlantis, but this, and the level of spiritual awareness, has dwindled to nearly nothing as the millennia have gone by. That means that the current secret societies are not true initiates and have not remembered truly effective and meaningful spirituality, which would be to learn lessons, since the elite most certainly have control and dominance over them, due to the every increasing power, control, influence, and domination of the elites over the millennia and more specifically recent centuries. The elites themselves do not remember about learning lessons and are negative simply for negativity's sake, thus its not only extremely likely, but almost assuredly the case that the secret societies are the same way, to various extents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now clearly some groups like the masons aren't overtly negative but they most certainly are not initiates or spiritually aware. They operate on secrecy and do nothing to try and destroy the elite's narrative or system. They only feed the secrecy the elite operate under and are themselves part of it. This then, would be the case of the other secret societies too. And that secrecy is inherently negative, since the time for secrecy is over because there are no longer any lessons for humanity to learn from a completely negative system. That then means that no spiritually aware initiate that is aware of this would want to stay secret and hidden any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, however, it is clear that much of the knowledge of Atlantis has been lost and the number of true spiritually aware beings is not much at all. There are many people nowadays exploring different aspects of spirituality but the majority of them miss the main point of meaningful spirituality of learning lessons to appreciate existence more, and instead focus on ridiculous ideas like Oneness or very obvious notions like unconditional love and compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So at this point it can be said that once Atlantis is rediscovered, spiritual awareness will start to become not only prominent once again, but all encompassing since we, as a planet, will learn the ultimate lesson of the age, that the negativity we experience daily isn't the natural state of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once that lesson is learned then it opens the flood gates to learning so many more lessons while simultaneously allowing us to apply that lesson and the other lessons we learn to grow and expand infinitely while appreciating and enjoying existence more.
