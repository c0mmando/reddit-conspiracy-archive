       Why doesn't this make the headline news? Why do we have so much reality Tv but none of it real earth activity. Time to make changes.

       You are tripping over a small flaring coronal hole, that was geoeffective and already left the solardisk.

       Yes, this is all interesting, is it not? Lots of consistent outages across the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why won't we see important information across the US news. All that's being pushed is someone else's agenda. Times must change and we need a global reconnect with one another.

       The wisc image, the waves stopped before the 20th started.  Their current map, at the end of the loop, still doesn't have the waves returned.  The last time I saw a post related to this they were claiming a bigger blast on the 26th.  But no one could explain how that prediction was made.

       These "white lines" are blind spots, ie places where no data could be gathered. According to BPEarthwatch they happen on SIMSS mostly after big solar flares.

       So what are the possible effects of this? Earthquakes?? I'm going balls deep conspiracy nut here but what if it really is end times. Time for the rapture. The end of the world. Mayan shit. 
It's actually a far more advanced alien race trying to cause chaos and plunge our world into oblivion by shooting energy at our planet. We have lost our way and become too sinful. The last time they cleaned the earth was the great flood.

       I'm not educated enough to say what would or could happen. If it were a direct gamma ray, it'd be cataclysm. But as it is right now, not direct, but something seems to be happening that the Internet is wavering in and out, does it not?

       All I can do is keep digging for more information, just as you. A lot of those volcanoes have
       <em>
        been
       </em>
       active for years, they just don't get reported. Wish I knew why not. A few of those
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       active, this does not mean they are erupting. Italy has theirs that is imminent threat of eruption. Check out the maps, get interested, check and verify that I'm wrong or right.

       Just think about it like this. Stranger things have happened right? Why wouldn't they be hiding something that could unravel their teachings? Or take their leadership over people down a notch. The information super highway gives us all knowledge and expedites human evolution many fold. If we can get the things they have online, it could usher in a new age of revolution for us all.

       The pope is always pushing evolution and covering up the giants bones.

        Pope and evolution
       </a>
       The giant bones would smash the evolution theory, which is why the Vatican hides that part of history. The theory is over time we get bigger and smarter. 
The Giants are definitely a lot bigger and the way they built structures prove they had better technology then what we have now. 
There's a reason why the Vatican is hiding that part of our history. I think it has something to do with the Bible and Gods creation, bc the Giants were mentioned in the Bible. 
Why did the Catholic Church keep the book of Enoch out of the Bible? The book is about fallen angels and the Giants. 
What's the reason for the massive coverup of Giants??
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pope will end up being the false prophet who will introduce the antichrist when he rises. So I feel as they are hiding truth from us. 
Everything ALWAYS leads back to the Vatican...
      </p>
      <p>
       And not knocking followers of Catholics. I just question the Catholic Church purpose of hiding our history?

       Also questionable is the Mormons. They offer a free genealogy site, but thier purpose in doing so is to baptize souls post-mortem into thier church. The Mormons and Catholics have been battling for the past few decades in material wealth, as Mormons are amassing new members and property all the time, because of thier extreme missionary numbers.

       I'm not really into religion bc I feel like religion was made up by the elites to control and divide the mass population. I'm just into the word of God, instead of relying on man to tell me what he thinks. I search for truth on my own and let God speak to me. 
There's so much that the church doesn't touch on when it comes to the Bible. I'm definitely  noticing that especially in the last year. We have been deceived by so many false prophets.

       But Catholics controlled the translations of that word?
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up RCC and after looking down the rabbithole, I tried reallllllly hard to educate myself on what the official dogma was. More than anything, RCC uses persuasive langauge to convince people that they are the most correct and most persecuted. They speak about inclusiveness and universal membership, but when you get into the dogma and history, there's marginalized people and you know, the hierarchy. They try to intellectualize spiritual matters, but when people come forth with personal experiences, they suppress it or they exploit it for capital gain.  Gah, I can't even...

       I got mixed up. The Catholic Church assembled the New Testament not the Old Testament. The Jews assembles the Old Testament
      </p>
      <p>
       I question a lot of the books that are left out of the Bible... like the book of Mary? Did Jesus have relations with her and the church left that book out to make Jesus look pure? 
Also the book of Thomas spoke of Jesus fighting someone that got on his nerves and he fell dead lol Was Jesus a normal person before the age of 30 when he decided to follow his mission of ministry? If so, why don't they add that in the Bible? 
I think they leave those books out of the Bible so they can control the masses. Live your life like Jesus.. be perfect like Jesus! 
When truth is... Jesus was normal just like us, up until he was 30 when he turned his life to God and started his mission of ministry.

       And he was punished cruelly for that, by the state/theocracy, or so it is claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the purpose of leaving that aspect there to spread fear "See what happens when you go against the grain?" or to spread the seed of rebellion "Look what Jesus accomplished in the face of the Roman empire and the Jewish theocracy." That aspect puzzles me, but I think it is the first... as Jesus was not just human... but divine as well "So you fail because you are not divine, not because the system is corrupt..."

       Yeah I agree the church has some type of fear agenda behind that. 
I just think if those certain books were added into the Bible, most ppl wouldn't feel so horrible living a sinful life. Jesus once lived a sinful life before he was baptized.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think the elites took advantage of the Bible and used it in a way to control the masses. Bc truth is... they are out numbered so they need to use every aspect they can to try to keep us in line.

       It's said "the rich need the poor." and I think that is why they use these control mechanisms. If the working populace could organize and align on certain ideas, we could force them into fruition.

       I fear that won't always be the case. "The poor" certainly don't need the rich.

       I agree. The rich elites want power and control so they need to organize the governments in a way we NEED them to survive. I think that's why they are destroying the middle class, so there will be the rich and poverty. People in poverty don't have much say so like the middle class does, which is why they are trying to destroy us (middle class)

      <p>
       This scripture says a lot.. the people in high places of power are not just blood and flesh... they are SATANIC (fallen angels) and that's who we will battle in the end times.

       I interpret that passage as ideology. There are ideas that have to be conquered in order to achieve "victory." And ideas are as pervasive as any "demon."
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think the elites count on the end times scenario. It's a situation where a good portion of the population will pray, instead of defending themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a certain "smugness" about being "saved" during the "end times" that will result in apathy for those that are "not saved." They count on that division.

       I think I would be disappointed if I learned they had never considered it as a viable excuse. (Weird to type that, but true.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, it's kind of their trump card. When they can't control the masses through "traditional" means, they'll resort to "being attacked." They love being the victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's an apocryphal text that (whether it needs it or not) is widely interpreted by various groups, religious or not. It could be anything from a giant Akira-esque monstrosity rising from the sea, to a conspiracy between a specific number of world leaders. The "slut of babylon" could be a person, a group, or a place.
      </p>
      <p>
       They like having options, and the interpretation of such religious texts gives them options. By that, I mean, they can selectively fulfill parts of the prophecy, or mess it up (casting doubt on current events, or on the interpretation.) as they see fit. And we know they have already discussed using a fake alien invasion as a method of control over the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't be too difficult to combine both, into a "the world is ending" scenario where people would be ridding themselves of property, or looting the local city "because it doesn't matter." Remove that last bit of "civilized society" from those few fanatics, and you'll have a "day of judgement." By that point, it's hard to tell those fleeing for their lives, from those chasing...
      </p>
      <p>
       But... I assume they don't do such, because they'd rather keep things "like they are." Those that are human (I accuse noone of any different, just want to present it in this way.) are assumed to prefer security over change... as we so often see in the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly believe it would take a criminally insane psychopath, with all the right leverage, to start such a catastrophe. Sane human beings don't want to eradicate all life on the planet (or so I keep telling myself.)

       I just think the mass population is rebelling and they are losing control. Their "old ways" of controlling us are failing in every direction. Even their trump card is failing them. I voted for Trump, and the min he does some shady shit... he will lose my trust. They need a new way of controlling us and if that doesn't work then depopulate so there's not a massive population to control. The elites don't want to die so I'm sure the catastrophe won't be nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a perfect world, the people stay awake and keep fighting them and they lose. For the most part, the elite have been a Secret. Now, we know who the enemy is, so that in itself can cause them to fall from power.

       No, you're correct, they assembled the OT as well. The Jews only use the Pentatuech or Torah, the first 5 books. I keep different versions of the Bible handy, (different Catholic versions, King James, the LDS with thier concordance, different translations, etc. I got an antique 1840s bible for $5 at a tag sale!).

       I don't study them anymore. Kinda been on a huge break from reading in general. Writers block, too. Been catching myself spending way too much time on reddit and fb since the weather got cold. Going out tonight with friends. That's the shit that matters to me anymore. Tried all these different religions or denominations and "my people" are more broken and compassionate than I've met in any formal gathering.

       Yeah I feel ya about taking time off of social media etc. I feel like the last 2-3 months (election period) drained the crap out of me. The more I researched the more truth I found and the more truth the more sickening everything gets. I didn't realize how much of life was a lie until the past few months.

       They are allowed to deceive any and all, as they see it in the "best interest" of people not to divulge. Finding out why, leads to many truths. Men are swayed by power, church men are men as well and should be held to no exception.
      </p>
      <p>
       The convenience is, hiding certain relics and teachings that oppose the leaders of churches. "I'm right, you're wrong. You have no proof." Will answer part of the "why".

      <p>
       They are a separate country and "who would oppose and question a holy land?" We all should. Share our information as a collective, disseminate what you know. Let mankind see the truths so we know we can believe each other. I want to fight to get what they have to an online board. Pictures of the relics in 3d, documents/sea scrolls. All of it.
