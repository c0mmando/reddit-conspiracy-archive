<p>I especially understand the Holocaust, with the actual numbers of the dead fluctuating occasionaly; how it could cause some kind of debate to be made out of it.

    <div class="md"><p>OP, the problem (if I kindly may) is with the word &quot;believe&quot;. Accepting an idea without underlying facts or reasoning is a problem for many of the free-minded individuals you&#39;ll find around these corners.</p>

<p>Do you believe in dreams? No, you <em>know</em> dreams exist, because you experience them yourself. If you didn&#39;t you could rely on trusted third-parties&#39; observations (which you would have to understand and corroborate before accepting their validity). Knowing whether dreams exist would be a challenge if only 1% of the population had them (and you weren&#39;t among them).</p>

<p>People around here tend not to &quot;believe&quot; in anything. It is rather those who e.g. buy into the mythology of bearded aerobats throwing passports out of aircraft cabins seconds before bringing down 3 steel skyscrapers with 2 aluminum planes who have a magical worldview and &quot;believe&quot; in stuff.</p>

<p>A &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; (a misleading term) tends to DISBELIEVE rather than believe. He either knows, or assumingly speculates. He&#39;s a skeptic (of the government&#39;s benevolence/narratives) rather than a believer.</p>

<p>As per your question, I had always thought I would never question the canonical mythology of the &quot;holocaust&quot;. Looking into it proved me wrong. I also looked into the flat earth hypohesis, and concluded it was false.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll close with a quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. (Aristotle)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point wasn&#39;t actually about your choice of words; your choice of words however illustrates a general tendency. Thus I was trying to make a larger argument, i.e. that people who view propaganda with skepticism are the healthy ones, &quot;believing&quot; is group-thinking, and normies are the true believers.</p>

<p>Another point: a modern plague is created by those who are educated beyond their intelligence. They have never been so numerous. So-called &quot;intellectuals&quot; are the most likely to uncritically parrot what other &quot;intelligent&quot; people write &amp; say, because they&#39;re the most dependent upon the usurped image they project, and are the most at risk of forming an original thought (for their fraud might be exposed). Actually when you look at it the intellectual class is throughout history always the last one to accept paradigm shifts (not because they change their mind, but mostly because they die off and are replaced with a new generation).</p>

<p>It is not so hard to believe and see strange things do happen all around us, all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends if you seek value in its literal reading or it&#39;s metaphors. I&#39;ve come to see great value in reading the Bible and interpreting its parables and symbolism, and I&#39;ve found it highly prescient for our modern spiritual and mental upheaval. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is, don&#39;t be so quick to discount a text that has had such tremendous influence on our history by only reading it on a most superficial level (which is how a majority of believers tend to read it, if they read it at all).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same with me, in fact. Went from a Catholic to being more in line with Buddhism, then on to consider myself agnostic, then I found Hitchens and turned anti-religious and then rested on standard atheism for a long time and thought that&#39;s that.</p>

<p>Experience ranging from life events over books I&#39;ve read, crises I&#39;ve endured, knowledge I&#39;ve gained and psychedelics I&#39;ve used, I&#39;ve become unsatisfied with a purely materialistic worldview and went searching again. And honestly, the Bible is the last book I expected to find answers within. I certainly wasn&#39;t ready for them until just a few months ago.</p>

<p>I still think religious fanatics, evangelicals and zealots are nuts in their literal interpretation, but the text itself is something to behold if one understands mythology as trying to convey truths for which there were no words at the time to describe them.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m struggling to call myself either a theist or atheist, because I think both terms fail the truth, that we were once God&#39;s of creation and wisdom in harmony with the rest of nature, who lost consciousness after a global catalyst some 10000 years ago, as the first civilisation collapsed with barely a trace (except for ancient structures like the Sphinx or a number of temples around the world), and that Jesus and other woken figures through time tried to show us the way back again, to an age of reason, light and consciousness. </p>

<p>Of course, this may all sound like hogwash to you, and I&#39;d completely understand, but it&#39;s not unreasonabl  to ponder that thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very naive, superficial and frankly way too common perspective on what the Bible has to offer. And I&#39;ve long held the exact same view. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve since come to get a more interesting grasp of some of the symbolism and metaphor found in the text, when reading it with a sense of curiosity about what our consciousness has to offer. </p>

<p>There is much to be said about the origins of consciousness, and much yet to be understood. Archeological evidence for example indicates that certain structures such as the sphinx in Egypt are much older than currently accepted (as indicated by water erosion combined with climatic history of the region). A careful reading of those structures indicates that a globally connected civilization had once existed on earth more than 10500 years ago, but was eradicated by a global cataclysm (theorized to have been caused by an asteroid impact and a resulting flooding of vast stretches of land). Through this event, it is further theorized that nearly all culture and subsequently all language and consequently all conscious activity of humans was replaced by survival mechanisms.</p>

<p>According to Julian Jaynes for example, consciousness, and with it agency, has only been regained when language was ready to sufficiently expand our abstract thinking and introspection abilities once more, setting us free. That would have been some 3000 years ago. </p>

<p>Reading the Bible, or Buddha&#39;s story for that matter, with that in mind, it becomes easy to see how Jesus was fully enlightened fully awake, fully conscious, same with the Buddha. Jesus preached that God is within us (intuition, the unconscious mind, etc.), trying to get us to understand how to achieve the same state of mind on this earth.</p>

<p>Of course this was entirely turned upside down by the Catholic Church which is why you have come to reject these things outright. I get that. But I&#39;d encourage you to think again, for your own benefit. </p>

<p>The Buddhist/Hindu belief system, which revolves around karma is also ultimately dualistic and is based on a just world fallacy. Or that only people who are &quot;bad&quot; deserve bad things, and only people who are &quot;good&quot; are enlightened/powerful/healthy/fortunate. </p>

Eventually I realized the entire thing was another way to create mind control. All religious practices are based on taking simple ways of reaching calm and inner peace (yoga is not inherently religious fyi) and adding bullshit woo woo on top that creates a false sense of belonging and superiority via tribalistic authoritarian control and a false narrative that there is something extra that you need in order to feel whole.</p>
