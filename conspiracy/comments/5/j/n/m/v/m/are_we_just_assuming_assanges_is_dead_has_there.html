    <div class="md"><p>Im a video editor, and this looks like a plugin that is often used to edit interviews where 2 different segments must be spliced together. The transition effect attempts to morph the segments together so the edit is less jarring. To me, this is not proof of a hologram, just proof of editing and imperfect software that leaves artifacts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something has happened to him.</p>

<p>Everyone assumed it is an American capture and seizure. However, what about the possibility of it being Russia who decided to cut ties with anything leading back to their influence on the election?</p>

<p>If Assange was played like a fiddle by Putin, perhaps Assange overlooked the extent of where his source originated from due to his passionate dislike for Clinton. After all, a Clinton presidency would have spelled the end for Assange&#39;s freedom.</p>

<p>It is very strange that this was an RT interview as well. They can continue to post fake videos of Assange denying any Russian influence and never have to worry about him digging deeper to see if he was indeed used as a pawn. </p>

<p>Think about this:</p>

<p>When did Wikileaks receive the emails? Was it after the DNC primary or during? </p>

<p>If it was during, then why weren&#39;t they released earlier to help Bernie Sanders defeat Clinton? We can conclude that wikileaks had an agenda.</p>

<p>If it was after, then their source likely had intentions to help Clinton&#39;s opponent in the general election. We can conclude that wikileaks was used as a tool.</p>

<p>Either way, Wikileaks played a large role in the election whether you&#39;d like to admit it or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty tough if you&#39;re worried about a sniper killing you.</p>

<p>Assange is afraid for his life, because there&#39;s a global tyrant targeting him with a propaganda campaign intended to destroy him. If they&#39;re doing that, they could probably find a guy to shoot at an embassy window.</p>

<p>This entire &quot;proof of life&quot; thing is designed to destroy Assange, not help him. Every step taken by the &quot;proof of life&quot; squad is carefully designed to damage Wikileaks&#39; credibility.</p>

<p>So ask yourself this.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re so sure Assange has stopped being heard from, and that there is incontrovertible evidence of his disappearance...</p>

<p>... why are none of the tech publications that follow Wikileaks, screaming about it?</p>

<p>Why is just about <em>all</em> discussion of this &quot;proof of life&quot; theory confined to Reddit, Youtube and 4chan? Why isn&#39;t this on Slashdot, The Intercept, The Register, Ars, Techdirt, etc? Why aren&#39;t any reporters who are <em>genuinely on Wikileaks&#39; side</em> talking about this?</p>
