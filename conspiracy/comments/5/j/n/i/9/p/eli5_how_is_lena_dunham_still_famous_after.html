    <div class="md"><p>The topic was addressed by Salon in an article, in which they make some unfortunate assertion in regards to people&#39;s concerns about Lena Dunham&#39;s behaviors as a child:</p>

<p>&quot;And it makes people buy into this idea that children themselves aren’t sexual, which is totally wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Quoted from Sharon Lamb, a professor of counseling psychology at the University of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>So they had an &#39;expert&#39; on the topic come out and tell everyone that children as young as 7 are sexual, and that it was &quot;within the norms of childhood sexual behavior.&quot; </p>

<p>Although from the same article, David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center, makes a far more accurate and important observation:</p>

<p>&quot;We are concerned about children that age who are ‘sexually reactive,’ meaning sexualized in a developmentally inappropriate way” or “being aggressive toward and exploitive of” their siblings or peers. That’s because that behavior can be “the sign that they themselves has been abused or subjected to developmentally inappropriate material.&quot;</p>

<p>Article: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/11/04/child_therapists_stop_freaking_out_about_lena_dunham/">http://www.salon.com/2014/11/04/child_therapists_stop_freaking_out_about_lena_dunham/</a></p>

<p>This article from The Guardian goes into the details of what Lena Dunham described from her childhood (I won&#39;t copy/paste the details here out of decency): </p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/05/lena-dunham-statement-abuse-claims">https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/05/lena-dunham-statement-abuse-claims</a></p>

<p>Quote: &quot;Dunham was born in New York City.[10][11] Her father, Carroll Dunham, is a painter, and her mother, Laurie Simmons, is an artist and photographer&quot;</p>

<p>From: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Dunham#cite_note-70">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Dunham#cite_note-70</a></p>

<p>If you do a google image search for &quot;Carroll Dunham art&quot;, you are probably going to notice something.</p>

<p>Just interesting to see that the father had an apparent obsession in his art for a while there, and the daughter reveals signs she may have been abused as a child by specifically mentioning what she did with that particular body part in her younger sister.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not at all a fan of Lena Dunham, but I do think a lot of people overlook the important part of the story - that Lena was displaying signs of being sexually abused when she was as young as 7 years old - in favor of attacking her personally because she is a Leftist. Or in other words, because she is a Leftist, people are more concerned about what 7-year-old her did, than about what was likely happening to 7-year-old her.</p>

<p>If people want to be vigilant about identifying and preventing child sexual abuse, then they will need to be able to remove their partisan blinders in the process. In this case, those adults who had power over her and time alone with her when she was a child, those adults are more suspect than she herself is, given the circumstantial details.</p>

Again, being abused is a terrible thing, and the abused  victim needs to treated,  removed  from the situation, and if they shows signs or symptoms  they will begin abusing others and perpetuating the cycle, they need to be kept away from the opportunity to access victims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As horrifying as abuse  and torture is, the only escape is by refusing to stay a victim. Rising above and refusing to allow abusers to control you for life is key. Victimhood is the easy path but filled with fear, misery, and depression. Use those feelings to spark a fire in your soul and turn your past on its ear. It&#39;s the most difficult path but the end result ives you a strong personal fortress of diamond and steel that abusers are afraid to trespass. Only you can end the nightmare and create the best person you can. Use that to build a successful fulfilling life full of love and support, help others escape the dark empty world that feeling helpless and out of control dominates.  Learn self-defense, meditation, a higher power, a firearm, an education, learn a valuable skill or trade and control your future. If your on the easy path of defeat do whatever it takes to stop, fight to control your life </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m torn on the Lena Dunham-as-sexual-abuser narrative. Firstly, because of Lena&#39;s past slander against some man, who I believe never existed in the first place, she accused of rape based on his political leanings. She made her &quot;rape&quot; out as perpetrated by a Republican. This isn&#39;t a defense of Republicans. What I&#39;m saying here is she&#39;s made what I believe to be false sex crime accusations towards an entire people based on politics - specifically conservative white men.</p>

<p>So, that aspect makes me WANT to call out her own admitted sexual dalliances perpetrated upon her younger sister.</p>

<p>But then the other side of me doesn&#39;t want any part of this mess because Lena WAS a child herself when she committed these sex acts on her sister. I&#39;ve heard of bigger sisters kissing their younger brothers as &quot;practice&quot; and we kind of laugh that stuff off. Creepy and wrong? Yeah, but we also recognize that children don&#39;t have the whole social taboo thing down yet and experiencing weird things in their bodies that they&#39;ve never felt before. </p>

<p>I&#39;d never considered that Lena&#39;s parents may have a role here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was someone like her father who abused her, then those situations tend to be tough for the person who was abused to be open with people that they were abused or to disclose who was responsible because it&#39;s so painful and makes family relationships awkward. </p>

<p>I was abused for years by a granduncle and I am very, very particular about who knows, and not everyone who knows I was abused knows the identity of my abuser because I don&#39;t want to hurt my extended family, particularly family members who don&#39;t know this happened, and also family members that he abused who would be afraid of word getting out that they were abused too.</p>

<p>If Dunham was abused by someone close to her, disclosing could be very awkward and painful for her, as well as her sister (because I imagine the abuser would have also abused the little sister). </p>

<p>‘As she grew, I took to bribing her time and affection: one dollar in quarters if I could do her makeup like a “motorcycle chick.” Three pieces of candy if I could kiss her on the lips for five seconds. Whatever she wanted to watch on TV if she would just “relax on me.” Basically, anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl, I was trying.’ </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her own words, from her book, directly quoted.  <strong>&quot;Basically, anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl, I was trying.&quot;</strong>  If you read her book or even the excerpts which have been widely circulated, she claims she continued to sleep with her sister and masturbate with her in bed right up to age 17, by which time if she had been male her own supporters would have formed a lynch mob to hoist the pedophile up and murder them.  We routinely try teenagers as adults in courts and male teenagers are routinely accused and then convicted of sexual assault for the same admissions as Lena has made.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I shared a bed with my sister, Grace, until I was seventeen years old. She was afraid to sleep alone and would begin asking me around 5:00 P.M. every day whether she could sleep with me. I put on a big show of saying no, taking pleasure in watching her beg and sulk, but eventually I always relented. Her sticky, muscly body thrashed beside me every night as I read Anne Sexton, watched reruns of SNL, sometimes even as I slipped my hand into my underwear to figure some stuff out.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Her sticky, muscly body thrashed beside me every night as I read Anne Sexton, watched reruns of SNL, sometimes even as I slipped my hand into my underwear to figure some stuff out.&quot;</strong>  Really?  You think that this is just &quot;curiosity&quot; at age 17?  She&#39;s masturbating with her sister in bed after bribing her for &quot;kisses&quot; like &quot;anything a sexual predator might do&quot;.  </p>

<p>No.  She&#39;s a self-professed pedophile, plain and simple.  She chose to write these memoirs, they aren&#39;t a confession beaten out of her by some police force.  They were written and sold as her own personal experiences and they detail a pedophile at work.</p>

<p>Edit: Delete your comment and trot on, shill.  Good on you to admit defeat in the most passive-agressive manner.</p>

They keep drugs illegal because they can control the market. Making pedophilia acceptable renders its blackmail value useless. Remember that you used to be able to blackmail people for being communist or gay. They are running out of options.</p>

<p>She wrote and directed the mumblecore classic, <em>Tiny Turniture</em>. She has an HBO show centered around New York living.</p>

<p>Is it really that hard to grasp how she still appeals to younger people? I do think she really hurt her popularity by shilling for Clinton and the sister scandal. I personally can&#39;t stand her anymore, but she&#39;s still a big cash cow.</p>
