        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, thanks God for leading me to this information.</p>

<p>Negro. It was commonly used until the late sixties or early seventies. Martin Luther King famously said he dreamed of when all Americans would &quot;sing the words of the old famous negro spiritual: Free at last! Free at last!&quot; It was not a demeaning word though today it is.</p>

<p>My case: communists in the black power movement turned it into an insult, like Uncle Tom, aimed at conservative blacks.</p>

<p>For you to understand this I have to write up a crash course on the civil rights movement.</p>

<p><strong>The marxist liberation war</strong>
There is no historic debate at all over communists in the civil rights movement. The only debate is over how much influence did they have and if they were just allies of the movement with little sway. In reality their plot was to build marxist organizations with slogans promising to fix legitimate civil rights problems in America, but in reality they would drive the wedge between the races deeper. There was legit problems with civil rights in America and the communists wanted to use these to divide us.</p>

<p>The communist plot was to lead the America into adopting socialist laws in the name of ending the riots in the streets. That is what anarchy is: the want of government, and the people wanting rule of law often get too much of it when it comes.</p>

<p>The communist line was that no law in America at the state, city or national level could be enforced on a black man. Instead, black men should govern themselves, separately from the United States and no black man has to follow any American law if he chooses not to.</p>

<p>In 1964, fighting units were being developed by black supremacists in the ghettos to fight the police. Phillip Abbott Luce was a young white radical in Harlem at the time whom was in the Progressive Labor Party, a Maoist revolutionary organization. After breaking with the PLP, Luce wrote about his experiences in his short book <em>Road To Revolution</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In June of 1964, just one month before the Harlem riots shocked the American people into the realization that a racial civil war was possible in this country, five of us met in a secluded area of the park to discuss the possibility of creating a guerrilla operation in the Negro ghettos of this country. We were all Communists, members of the pro-Chinese Communist Progressive Labor Movement (now Party), and four of us had been to Cuba the summer before. We were busily organizing another trip to the land of Fidel Castro when the leader of Progressive Labor, Milt Rosen, told us to meet him in the park. We were there at the appointed time. </p>

<p>Gathered on a grassy knoll, Rosen told us that we were to begin seriously to consider going underground and to start a guerrilla operation similar to that used in Cuba by the Communists to destroy the government. According to Rosen, the leadership of the Progressive Labor Movement had been divided into groups of four and each of these groups would operate independently of the others. This technique, the same as that used by the guerrillas in Algeria, would insure maximum secrecy and avoid police surveillance. We would all go “underground” at a specified signal and would then operate out of the various ghettos of the city in an attempt to organize a guerrilla warfare operation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was two years before &quot;black power&quot; was coined as a revolutionary slogan by Stokely Carmichael. Luce, along with his cohorts had distributed propaganda in the ghettos for years, about the need of democratic economic reform (read: socialism), false claims of police brutality and encouragement for guerrilla warfare. Luce and other whites within the PLP were ordered by the party to hide themselves away just before riots broke out to make it appear as a black &quot;rebellion&quot;. An incendiary man named William Epton fanned the flames in Harlem leading to the riots there. Of Epton, Luce writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Progressive Labor chieftain in Harlem, Bill Epton, who had been expelled from the CPUSA in 1961, had already begun to set up a special “front” group for the riots. This “Harlem Defense Council” was designed to create the framework through which organized guerrilla warfare could be carried out against the police. The Harlem Defense Councils not only teach karate but also have attempted to enlist the support of various ghetto criminals and teenage gangs. Epton and other Progressive Labor leaders told this writer that the Harlem Defense Councils were set up to get the people into the streets whenever a confrontation with the police took place. Epton also organized classes on guerrilla warfare and (as I have written in the Saturday Evening Post) target practice took place on Longi, Island prior to the riots. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The goal was to get a war between the community and the police that escalated to the point either police state measures were enacted, or anarchy led to the people demanding a police state.

<p><strong>Martin Luther King</strong>
I have only a few words on Martin Luther King for this post. I feel I must give the 101 on him. Dr King was a marxist. His Pullitzer Prize winning official biographer writes in passing that King displayed marxist beliefs in private. That gap of five years between the I Have a Dream speech and his death, King spent much of his time on campaigns that had nothing to do with civil rights, spending his time and effort organizing movements against capitalism. Socialist Bogden Denitch testified in 2010 that King was a member of the Socialist Party for a time (the paper <em>Yankee Radical</em> said he was &quot;in a position to know at the time.&quot;) On top of that, MLK himself said &quot;There must be a better distribution of wealth and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.&quot;</p>

<p>So what if he held marxist sentiments? Wasnt he just a civil humanitarian whom did great work for civil rights in this country? Unfortunately, the reality isn&#39;t like that. Look for a book in your university library, it probably has it, <em>House Divided: The Legacy of Martin Luther King</em> by Lionel Lokos. In either chapter 1 or chapter 2, Lokos dissects King&#39;s nonviolence. Time after time, King would boast the importance of nonviolence in interviews and speeches. But he often added that should his protest not change anything, some of his followers would lose patience, he&#39;d lose control of them and they&#39;d turn to violence. Almost one dozen separate quotes are examined by Lokos, spanned over many years, in which MLK says violence is assured if his demands are not meant. </p>

<p>King said it. Riots did break out in cities he appeared in. King was seen as A MODERATE compared to other radicals. And King had extremist agitators travel with him, sometimes on his payroll, to guarantee chaos should King&#39;s anti-capitalist rhetoric be ignored. </p>

<p>King&#39;s strategy was not to use terrorism to take away civil liberties like William Epton. His strategy was to give the illusion the people wanted social reform programs from congress so bad, they might riot, and congress passing these social programs was just responding to the will of the people. All the while Epton makes King into a moderate.</p>

<p>ONE example. Rev F D Kirkpatrick was the director of the Folksong department of the SCLC. The SCLC is King&#39;s organization as you know. One of the songs he wrote was entitled, <em>Burn Baby Burn.</em> You can listen to it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09nnfO-f0pg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09nnfO-f0pg</a></p>

<p>Some of the lyrics are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really wanted to have a decent job and all I had was a match. Didnt get the oil from the Rockefeller well. Couldn&#39;t get the silver from the mine.I cant enjoy the American dream, only water for <em>the fire next time.</em> So I saaay! Burn baby burn!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The message is simple. Blacks in the ghetto have no job opportunities and are poor. The government must redistribute wealth or else <em>burn baby burn.</em></p>

<p>Shortly before Malcolm X died, in his <em>Prospects of Freedom</em> speech in New York, he said that the purpose of the black nationalists was to have their movement spiral out of control and give legitimacy to other civil rights groups. This admission is less than ten minutes into the speech by the way.</p>

<p>There should be a book written on civil rights violence, comparing it to the mob violence of the Black Lives Matter of today. Keep in mind that race riots happened in 1963, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72 and 73. Imagine ten years of riots breaking out in every major city in America, dozens of them each year. Between 1965 and 1970, the national rate of violent crime had DOUBLED. Black militants arent the only ones responsible for that, the &quot;if it feels good do it&quot; mentality of the yippies caused tremendous spikes in violence in white communities.</p>

<p><strong>Black Opposition</strong>
For criticizing MLK am I racist? What about the blacks that held unfavorable views about him in the sixties? I could write an entire post, much longer than this one, about the MANY blacks in America that did not like King, disagreed with him and in some rare extreme cases, did not let him come to their town. And when the discredited Dr king was shot Sunday <em>evening</em> April 4, the shock of the sudden assassination martyred him for almost 49 years as of now and gave credibility to black power.</p>

<p>Opposition to a communist war of liberation existed in every country it was attempted. In Algeria, the marxist FLN was opposed by those colonized by the French. The Christian and Muslims of Algeria wanted to remain French. The communist FLN killed some French but also killed Muslims. Ive seen an estimated figure that 8 times as many Muslim civilians as French were gunned down, beheaded, cut to pieces and murdered in all sorts of gruesome fashion. The murder of the innocent was to terrorize the Algerian countryside into supporting the revolution and scare them against opposing it.</p>

<p>In the ghettos of the north, where large communities of blacks were centered around their church or industry and living conditions were improving, why would they want anything to do with communism? The majority of whites and blacks are good thus want nothing to do with communism. By using slogans of civil rights, the communists could trick so many people into supporting them. But eventually the people would realize the movement was communist led and they&#39;d abandon it. So the communists would either terrorize the people into line or smear their opponents with insults to discredit them. By neutralizing opposition, these communist groups can claim to be the <strong>legitimate</strong> authority to represent <strong>all</strong> black people.</p>

<p>Hundreds of blacks were burned out of their homes by riots and lost their businesses to looting. Black nationalists villified black business owners as a &quot;petit bourgeoisie.&quot; Black Panthers made black shop owners in New York have to pay a &quot;tax&quot; to them. The black power extremists, whom represented a minority of all blacks, spread an atmosphere of hate in the ghetto. </p>

<p>I suspect that once the black power movement died down, many of its members took their talents to organized gangs and spread violence in the ghetto that way. My theory is that the black power enthusiasts recruited from the gangs and urged them to run &quot;hits&quot; on whites and blacks. These gangs grew into the &quot;supergangs&quot; when the black power movement died down and these gangs continued gunning down people in the ghetto. </p>

<p>Of course, many more black youths would have been gunned down by black gangsters had black power not declined. I have to research more into this but take the example of black power advocate L C Wheeler. He&#39;d make appearances on tv shows or before crowds wearing a leather jacket which later came to be his &quot;crip jacket.&quot;</p>

<p>The far left, in order to give the illusion of popular support, had to develop insults to smear conservatives with.</p>

<p>Whites that criticized these extremists were denounced as &quot;hate groups,&quot; &quot;McCarthyites&quot; and &quot;fear peddlers.&quot; The term used against critical blacks was &quot;Uncle Tom,&quot; or a &quot;sellout&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An Uncle Tom&quot; is a black man that would sell out his own kind and not fight for revolution.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom, the character from <em>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</em> was a heroic man, giving his life to save fellow black men, he loved Christ and virtue. See how the figure of a good man gets turned into something negative.</p>

<p>But by 1968 the extremist black nationalists picked up a new term to denounce critical blacks:</p>

<p><strong>NEGRO</strong>
Negro became a hate term. Not by white racists. By black nationalist extremists that used the term to denounce those blacks that did not stand with them.</p>

<p><em>the bad nigger fights the white power structure, the negro laps at his white master&#39;s feet like a dog</em></p>

<p>I was a little shocked too when I found this was the attitude of black nationalists. Here is my proof.</p>

<p>Charles Smith was a black public speaker and radio show speaker in the sixties. He, along with many other black-American speakers such as Ezola Foster, George Schuyler, Lola Belle Holmes, Julia Brown and others toured the country for the John Birch Society to speak on resistance to the communist plot to divide the country on race. </p>

<p>Charles Smith was opposed to the civil rights movement. An active member of the John Birch Society. He called the civil rights movement a communist conspiracy. While on campuses he would speak at Black Student Unions and take them on in debate. He speaks of how one black student asked that, of all the black lawyers, scholars, writers and so on, why is Mr Smith the only black able to see this communist conspiracy? And after asking this, the student adds</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re not even a black, YOU&#39;RE A NEGRO</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfY8xYtoHEg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfY8xYtoHEg</a>
Smith mentions that he has almost caused riots by using the term negro in a casual manner. That above linked video is to a 1970 speech, it is over one hour long but Smith&#39;s anecdote of being called a negro as an insult is within the first two minutes.</p>

<p>This next video is a video of &quot;civil rights activist&quot; Stokely Carmichael, credited with coining the term black power.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrzTsfpPfM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxrzTsfpPfM</a>
Stokely talks of how &quot;white people and their negro allies&quot; were organized against black power. All within the first minute of video there.</p>

<p>A civil rights activist using the word negro as an insult. You dont believe me. Maybe you dont want to. But it is right there on audio.</p>

<p>Shortly after the assassination of MLK there was a heated debate on the Joe Pyne show. A black power activist, L C Wheeler, and a black conservative John Birch Society member, Reverend E Freeman Yearling. L C Wheeler accused  Yearling of being an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; and went on to say of Yearling:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s the little Negro colored boy dummy, that they&#39;re moving, they&#39;re working his mouth... and this sucker is speaking against all the Black movements which have brought us progress.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.tvparty.com/empyne2.html">http://www.tvparty.com/empyne2.html</a></p>

<p>In the comment section of that link is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I was a high school kid in Pasadena in the early 60s and was fascinated by Joe Pyne. I have one particular memory.
An African-American called in one night, and, after some baiting, Pyne asked him how he wanted to be referred to. The fellow said &#39;Just call me &#39;Black Man...&#39;&#39;
&quot;Well, this was early 60s when African-Americans were still called &#39;Negroes.&#39;
&quot;So Pyne went nuts, berating this guy for wanting to be called something so &#39;crude&#39; instead of &#39;Negro.&#39;
&quot;Sure enough, 12-24 months later African Americans widely adopted the reference to being &#39;Black.&#39; And this poor guest Joe berated certainly got the last laugh - he had been on the cutting edge, way ahead of Pyne or anyone else in the white community.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The commenter says this was the early 60s but I believe he was mistaken. In 1967 a majority of blacks polled were not offended with the term negro, by 1970 they were.</p>

<p>A correspondent for Time Magazine, Wallace Terry, talked to and met with many of the black soldiers in the vietnam war. He published a book years later, <em>BLOODS: An oral history of the vietnam war by black veterans.</em> In 1967, Terry polled black veterans their opinion of civil rights leaders like MLK. His book describes the results:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The results of his survey dramatically show a change in African-American attitudes only after three years. In 1967 Martin Luther King, Muhammad Ali and Stokely Carmichael were not very popular with African-American soldiers because of their stance against the Vietnam War. But in 1970 they were regarded as heroes for the same reason.
Some of the other results of Terry&#39;s 1970 survey:
50% of African-Americans said that they would use their weapons in the struggle for civil rights in the United States.
30% said they would join black power organizations.
83% believed that additional American race riots were inevitable and 45% of those said that they would participate in such riots.
76% rejected the term &quot;Negro&quot; for &quot;Black&quot; or &quot;Afro-American.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What happened between 1967 and 1970 was that the nation was so shocked by the death of MLK, the civil rights/black power movement had reignited itself with explosive momentum and blacks were polarized into radical positions because of the shock of King&#39;s death</p>

<p>Shortly after negro was supplanted to black, black was supplanted to African-American. This term is divisive, as it implies a black man is African first and American second. I, along with a lot of other conservatives, many whom lived through the turbulent sixties, prefer the neutral term <em>black-american,</em> and I encourage you to start using that term too.</p>

<p>Negro used to mean a black man proud of his black-American heritage, and the communists destroyed it, turning it into a stigmatized word with a disgusting connotation. This is a crime. The ONLY reason I do not use the term &quot;negro&quot; today is it is too stigmatized and I&#39;d definitely get my ass kicked for using it. People think it is a bad word today only because, they&#39;ve always been told so. The truth is: <em>there is nothing wrong with the word negro.</em></p>

<p>You see the radicals in the Black Lives Matter movement today using negro as an insult. </p>

<p>In october of 2015, the CEO of the SCLC at a rally on the state capitol steps in Louisiana steps told a crowd:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ain’t scared of no racists! I ain’t scared of no Ku Klux Klan! I ain’t scared of no scaredy negroes! I’m ready to die for a cause!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only a little more than a decade before negro became denounced, the word colored was swept under the bus.</p>

<p>Ezola Foster:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really do not recall going from being called colored to negro. I remember in the forties and fifties growing up as a negro and all negro meant was that our ancestors were brought to America as slaves, from Africa. That was it, plain and simple. However, the sixties brought in the peak of the political movements and so the black leaders decided that we were no longer to be called negro, from now on we were to be referred to as blacks...then after the media brought attention to the fight against apartheid in South Africa, the reverend-aint-Jesse jackson held a press conference and told the media from now on refer to us as African American. And since that time we&#39;ve been known as African Americans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUV5RvqSF2U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUV5RvqSF2U</a> </p>

<p>Its about five and a half minutes in. </p>

<p>The NAACP (which has colored in its name) had protested the use of the word colored in the fifties. The opposition to the use of that word antagonized many southern whites whom used that word their whole lives and never meant anything demeaning by it. William D Workman in his book <em>The Case for the South</em> documents how he had written to several TV networks to ask on if they had an official policy to not use the word colored. Most of them wrote back it was against the official policy to use that word. </p>

<p>With the media giving in, the left gets what it wants. I bet there were probably some official orders from the leadership in TV networks in the late 60s/early 70s to not use the word negro. Through the media, the language of the people changes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t why Uncle Tom has a negative connotation at all. It has become negative because the character was an example of black servility being the only source of redemption for African-Americans, that a black man is better off dying without fighting for his own humanity. Its not that hard to understand how it became a negative term, and you on&#39;t have to look far for proof. This isn&#39;t some communist conspiracy, even contemporaries of Stowe held this view before communism existed as a cohesive idea:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eptkDlB3J4kC&amp;amp;pg=PA1&amp;amp;dq=Uncle+Tom&amp;amp;ei=T5zmSYC9GoOIzQTwnJTBCA">(For whites in parallel circumstances, it is often said) Talk not of overcoming evil with good—it is madness! Talk not of peacefully submitting to chains and stripes—it is base servility! Talk not of servants being obedient to their masters—let the blood of tyrants flow! How is this to be explained or reconciled? Is there one law of submission and non-resistance for the Black man, and another of rebellion and conflict for the white man? When it is the whites who are trodden in the dust, does Christ justify them in taking up arms to vindicate their rights? And when it is the blacks who are thus treated, does Christ require them to be patient, harmless, long-suffering, and forgiving? Are there two Christs?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This critical review was published in 1852, the year the book was published, and details the shortcomings of the character. For whites, it is considered morally justified for them to rebel for freedom, but this doesn&#39;t hold true for blacks, who are expected to die nonviolently. Uncle Tom had negative connotations way before anything you&#39;re discussing in your post.</p>

<p>Except that&#39;s not what happened. It would be one things is black Americans requested to be called some other title. It is a whole different thing for a handful of extremists to turn a word into an insult. </p>

<p>My OP offered several sources of black militants and self described Marxists using negro as an insult. If you go to the sources I link to then you can find video of L C Wheeler and Stokely Carmichael saying negro and you can hear them say it with hate in their voice.</p>

<p>This really happened: civil rights activists took a term which years before, MLK identified with repeatedly in his I have a dream speech, and turned it into an insult.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for blacks having the right to protest a racist term that discomforts then but taking a term millions identify with and turning it into an insult against your critics is deplorable.</p>

<p>They keep memeing the &quot;unfinished civil rights movement&quot; line to divide the races and classes. </p>

Now if in ten years, no black voted Democrat, the NAACP was totally discredited and every black family was well above the poverty line, the leftist media and schools would still be memeing le racist legacy because of the way it divides whites into leftist blocs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know a lot about black history so nods for that. Still though, I don&#39;t understand why folks keep trying to tell black people what to do. Yes, the country is horribly divided along race lines. But black people did not create that racial division. I think we all know where that came from. If ending racism is your goal, and it sounds like it is, I think you should focus on the changes that need to happen within white society. Black people have been fighting racism for a long time, they are the experts in the field. </p>

<p>I hope no white person is trying to call a black person negro, ever. Nope. African American works pretty well. I&#39;m not liberal, but I have enormous respect for MLK - the man was a giant. same as Malcolm X, Ida B. Wells, Bayard Rustin, etc. The NAACP was trash from the beginning, they need to be disbanded asap! The Black Panthers were powerful, if the FBI hadn&#39;t murdered them, I think we would be looking at a completely different society today. There were incredible for their time, powerful movement, read about them. </p>

<p>Anyway, point is. Yes black people and the black movement is being exploited by the democratic party. But turning to republicans/conservatives is a backwards move. Neither parties work for minorities, they are both equally horrible, that&#39;s why a shift to conservatives makes no sense. </p>

<p>There have been a few white people who have always supported black social movements against hate, and it seems like more are joining the fight, which is great, because everyone is needed in this struggle. But you don&#39;t end racism by trying to tell black people how to &#39;behave properly&#39;. No my friend. The goal is not to emulate or impress white people, the goal is to end oppression. all oppression. Black liberation will not come from the &#39;guidance&#39; of white society, no matter how well written. Sorry. White America cannot tutor African Americas on a &#39;fail-safe path&#39; to liberation. It&#39;s called the struggle for a reason. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re on the right track about learning black history, read more and spread the word as objectively and honestly as possible. But if &#39;herding&#39; black people into one direction or another is your goal, I think you will be disappointed. Support the black communities that you are able to support, no one expects you to agree with all the black movements. But support the ones you can. Let the NAACP be an example of the kind of black organizations you want to avoid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By and large there was no opposition to the word in 1965 but it was controversial only five years later. It would be one thing if blacks by were fed up with the word negro and protested its use. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not what happened. Black nationalist extremists didn&#39;t simply it: THEY TURNED IT INTO AN INSULT. I offered three examples from the sixties of black nationalists insulting other blacks with the word negro. I added one modern example of a black activist using word as an insult. White racists DID not use it as an insult, at least not in the sixties. </p>

<p>This is not what I call &quot;debating over the usage of the word.&quot; The very opposite: it&#39;s using name calling against those whom wish fairly debate against the extreme left. </p>

<p>What makes it worse is that millions of blacks that did identify with it now no longer can because the word was tainted. To taint someone&#39;s identity is a crime.</p>

<p>Maybe you should go to some of the links in the OP. I believe you need to hear the downright hate Stokely Carmichael had in his voice when he says &quot;negro.&quot; You need to hear the hate in the voice of L C Wheeler when he calls Reverend Yearling a negro. </p>

<p>Blacks have the right to ask to be called whatever they want. Extremists should be scorned for insulting their critics with name calling.</p>

<p>where is proof of that? also, let&#39;s not forget the NAACP:</p>

<p>&quot;The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
(NAACP), was founded in 1909 by a group of Marxists, mulattoes
and millionaire Jews-but no Negroes! One of the most prominent
was W.E.B. Dubois who would later become a leader of the
Communist Party. The first NAACP president was not a Negro but
the wealthy Jew, Joel Spingarn. He ran the organization until he
retired in 1939. Then his brother, Arthur Spingarn, became the
head of the NAACP. Later, Kivie Kaplan, a Jewish millionaire shoe
manufacturer from Boston was NAACP president until 1966. Then,
for the first time in 57 years, they allowed the mulatto, Roy
Wilkins, to take over.</p>

<p>. . . While Jews were predominant in the racial integration suits they
do not practice what they preach when it comes to their own
people. Note the separate article where Jews are instructed on
how important it is to not marry outside of their own race. Many
young Jews attend segregated all-Jewish Day Schools to which
Gentiles are not admitted! It should also be noted that Jewish
country clubs, such as the Progressive Club here in Atlanta, do
not have any Gentile members. You can also find all-Jewish
resorts in the Catskill Mountains in New York and all-Jewish
condos in Miami-Broward County, Fla., and Los Angeles.</p>

<p><a href="http://vnnforum.com/showthread.php?t=8488">http://vnnforum.com/showthread.php?t=8488</a></p>

<p>edit:  </p>

<p>According to Anthony T. Browder in From &#39;The Browder File: 22 Essays on the African-American Experience&#39; (2000), &quot;...the Portuguese were the first to enslave Afrikans and they were the first to call them Negroes. When the Spanish became involved in the slave trade, they also used the word Negro to describe Afrikans. Negro is an adjective which means Black in Portuguese and Spanish. But since 1444 and the beginning of the slave trade, <em>the adjective Negro</em> became a noun <strong>and the legitimate name of a newly enslaved people.&quot;</strong> (p.1).</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that under Euro-centrism, &quot;...the word for Black was typically associated with aspects of death. The word death is derived from the Greek word Necro which means dead and is similar in sound and meaning to the word Negro.&quot;</p>

<p>. . . The word &quot;Negro&quot; is applied, &quot;...also to the Black people of Afrika (but the ordinary term for &#39;Afrikan Negro&#39; or &#39;Afrikan&#39; were Aethiops and Afer).&quot; It is very instructive to note that &quot;...the word usually employed in the classical Latin language to designate people of Afrikan origin was &quot;Afer&quot; and not &quot;Niger&quot;, as some who are addicted to the term &#39;Negro&#39; would like to have us believe.&quot;(p.79).</p>

<p>Now, <em>there is a difference</em> in the use of the word &quot;Negro&quot; &quot;as applied to slaves&quot; and the term &quot;Negro&quot; &quot;simply meaning Blacks.&quot;</p>

<p>Richard B. Moore elucidates as follows: &quot;The same word &#39;Negroes&#39; was used for both meanings in Portuguese and Spanish, whereas <strong>in English</strong> &#39;Negroes&#39; was generally used <strong>for slaves and &#39;Blacks&#39;</strong> for simple colour designation.&quot; (p.39).</p>

<p>In Euro-colonial countries, the word &quot;Negro&quot; had a specific meaning beyond the simple connotation of colour or skin. The expression, &quot;He is a Negro,&quot; was equivalent to saying, &quot;He is a slave&quot;. Since almost all the slaves in certain countries and epochs were &quot;Negroes&quot;, &quot;Negro&quot; came to be synonymous with slave.(p.46).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the term &quot;Negro&quot; implies that Afrikans are a cursed people. And that, &quot;...this curse was declared to be the true and undeniable word of God who had thereby condemned the Afrikans, said to be the sons of Ham, to perpetual slavery to the Europeans, conveniently held to be sons of Japheth and to Asian people, similarly deemed to be the sons of Shem.&quot; (p.40).</p>

<p>As deceased Afri-centric, Afrikan-American scholar/historian, Dr. John Henrik Clarke once admonished, &quot;...dogs and slaves were named by their masters and that only free men named themselves.&quot; As the Afrikan adage suggests, &quot;It&#39;s not what you call me but what I answer to.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Negro&#39; is the correct, academic, scientific, scholarly term.  It became &#39;nigger&#39; as a shortened way of saying &#39;negro&#39;.  Additionally, the US pioneers were drawn from a wide range of nationalities, not all of whom spoke English.  It&#39;s not a great leap from &#39;negro&#39; to &#39;nigger&#39;, which is how the latter came about</p>

<p>What is beyond doubt is that negroes are a distinct group who differ in many respects to those outside Africa.  They are negroes.  it&#39;s apparent they&#39;re negroes at first glance.  Changing the correct term of &#39;negroes&#39; to the word &#39;black&#39; doesn&#39;t change the fact that negroes are a distinct group and everyone knows that</p>

<p>&#39;Black&#39; is a ridiculous term.  Not all negroes are black.  Negroes come in various shades</p>

<p>Go online to see how others refer to negroes.  Here&#39;s one below:</p>

<p><strong>&#39; How Are You Supposed To Refer To Black In Hebrew &amp; Yiddish ...
I thought the Hebrew word &quot;cushi&quot; meant African. So a &quot;cushi mamzer&quot;, a common slang term in Israel, means &quot;black bastard.&quot; Now I learn cushi means nigger</strong>.</p>

<p>Caucasians don&#39;t try to alter their scientific description.  Nor do Asians.  Isn&#39;t it time negroes accepted they are negroes?</p>

<p>i disagree (i happen to be Black, so) i think Black people should be allowed to &#39;name&#39; what we are. imo, &quot;Black&quot; is correct; we are <em>all shades</em> (from white to blue-black) but more importantly, <strong>it is a state of mind</strong> (so to speak). also consider how society relates to anyone &#39;of color&#39;. skin color <em>has nothing</em> to do with it. perhaps you are confusing &quot;race&quot; with color?</p>

<p>Black people originate from many countries, not all <em>are from</em> (born) Africa, although their ancestors were. i certainly don&#39;t think it appropriate that anyone not Black should dictate what i chose to call myself.</p>

<p>&#39;the state of mind&#39; of blackness</p>

<p>maybe that isn&#39;t exactly correct, as we are so diverse in our likes/dislikes. have to check myself about that --- i was thinking one thing &amp; typing another. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn’t know acting black was used negatively by negroes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve probably already heard it, but Cosby’s Pound Cake speech (which, incidentally, is the reason for the false accusations of rape against him) is one of the last attacks against the system of behaviors that has been normalized regarding that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I really have to ask you to seriously consider what you’ve heard, and now this is the end of the evening so to speak. I heard a prize fight manager say to his fellow who was losing badly, “David, listen to me. It’s not what’s he’s doing to you. It’s what you’re not doing.”</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, these people set–they opened the doors, they gave us the right, and today, ladies and gentlemen, in our cities and public schools we have 50% drop out. In our own neighborhood, we have men in prison. No longer is a person embarrassed because they’re pregnant without a husband. No longer is a boy considered an embarrassment if he tries to run away from being the father of the unmarried child.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the lower economic and lower middle economic people are not holding their end in this deal. In the neighborhood that most of us grew up in, parenting is not going on. In the old days, you couldn’t hooky school because every drawn shade was an eye. And before your mother got off the bus and to the house, she knew exactly where you had gone, who had gone into the house, and where you got on whatever you had one and where you got it from. Parents don’t know that today.</p>

<p>I’m talking about these people who cry when their son is standing there in an orange suit. Where were you when he was two? Where were you when he was twelve? Where were you when he was eighteen, and how come you don’t know he had a pistol? And where is his father, and why don’t you know where he is? And why doesn’t the father show up to talk to this boy?</p>

<p>The church is only open on Sunday. And you can’t keep asking Jesus to ask doing things for you. You can’t keep asking that God will find a way. God is tired of you. God was there when they won all those cases–fifty in a row. That’s where God was because these people were doing something. And God said, “I’m going to find a way.” I wasn’t there when God said it -- I’m making this up. But it sounds like what God would do. We cannot blame white people. White people–white people don’t live over there. They close up the shop early. The Korean ones still don’t know us as well–they stay open 24 hours.</p>

<p>I’m looking and I see a man named Kenneth Clark, he and his wife Mamie. Kenneth’s still alive. I have to apologize to him for these people because Kenneth said it straight. He said you have to strengthen yourselves, and we’ve got to have that black doll. And everybody said it. Julian Bond said it. Dick Gregory said it. All these lawyers said it. And you wouldn’t know that anybody had done a damned thing. </p>

<p>Fifty percent drop out rate, I’m telling you, and people in jail, and women having children by five, six different men. Under what excuse? I want somebody to love me. And as soon as you have it, you forget to parent. Grandmother, mother, and great grandmother in the same room, raising children, and the child knows nothing about love or respect of any one of the three of them. All this child knows is “gimme, gimme, gimme.” These people want to buy the friendship of a child, and the child couldn’t care less. Those of us sitting out here who have gone on to some college or whatever we’ve done, we still fear our parents. And these people are not parenting. They’re buying things for the kid–$500 sneakers–for what? They won’t spend $250 on Hooked on Phonics.</p>

<p>Kenneth Clark, somewhere in his home in upstate New York–just looking ahead. Thank God he doesn’t know what’s going on. Thank God. But these people–the ones up here in the balcony fought so hard. Looking at the incarcerated, these are not political criminals. These are people going around stealing Coca Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake! Then we all run out and are outraged: “The cops shouldn’t have shot him.” What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand? I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else. And I looked at it and I had no money. And something called parenting said if you get caught with it you’re going to embarrass your mother. Not, “You’re going to get your butt kicked.” No. “You’re going to embarrass your mother.” “You’re going to embarrass your family.” “If you knock that girl up, you’re going to have to run away because it’s going to be too embarrassing for your family.” In the old days, a girl getting pregnant had to go down South, and then her mother would go down to get her. But the mother had the baby. I said the mother had the baby. The girl didn’t have a baby. The mother had the baby in two weeks. We are not parenting.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, listen to these people. They are showing you what’s wrong. People putting their clothes on backwards. Isn’t that a sign of something going on wrong? Are you not paying attention? People with their hat on backwards, pants down around the crack. Isn’t that a sign of something, or are you waiting for Jesus to pull his pants up? Isn’t it a sign of something when she’s got her dress all the way up to the crack–and got all kinds of needles and things going through her body. What part of Africa did this come from? We are not Africans. Those people are not Africans; they don’t know a damned thing about Africa. With names like Shaniqua, Shaligua, Mohammed and all that crap and all of them are in jail. When we give these kinds names to our children, we give them the strength and inspiration in the meaning of those names. What’s the point of giving them strong names if there is not parenting and values backing it up?</p>

<p>Brown v. the Board of Education is no longer the white person’s problem. We’ve got to take the neighborhood back. We’ve got to go in there. Just forget telling your child to go to the Peace Corps. It’s right around the corner. It’s standing on the corner. It can’t speak English. It doesn’t want to speak English. I can’t even talk the way these people talk: “Why you ain’t where you is go ra?” I don’t know who these people are. And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk. Then I heard the father talk. This is all in the house. You used to talk a certain way on the corner and you got into the house and switched to English. Everybody knows it’s important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can’t land a plane with, “Why you ain’t…” You can’t be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth. There is no Bible that has that kind of language. Where did these people get the idea that they’re moving ahead on this? Well, they know they’re not; they’re just hanging out in the same place, five or six generations sitting in the projects when you’re just supposed to stay there long enough to get a job and move out.</p>

<p>Now, look, I’m telling you. It’s not what they’re doing to us. It’s what we’re not doing. 50% drop out. Look, we’re raising our own ingrown immigrants. These people are fighting hard to be ignorant. There’s no English being spoken, and they’re walking and they’re angry. Oh God, they’re angry and they have pistols and they shoot and they do stupid things. And after they kill somebody, they don’t have a plan. Just murder somebody. Boom. Over what? A pizza? And then run to the poor cousin’s house. They sit there and the cousin says, “What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I just killed somebody, man.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I just killed somebody; I’ve got to stay here.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, give me some money, I’ll go….”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“North Carolina.”</p>

<p>Everybody wanted to go to North Carolina. But the police know where you’re going because your cousin has a record.</p>

<p>Five or six different children–same woman, eight, ten different “husbands” or whatever. Pretty soon you’re going to have to have DNA cards so you can tell who you’re making love to. You don’t who this is. It might be your grandmother. I’m telling you, they’re young enough. Hey, you have a baby when you’re twelve. Your baby turns thirteen and has a baby, how old are you? Huh? Grandmother. By the time you’re twelve, you could have sex with your grandmother, you keep those numbers coming. I’m just predicting.</p>

<p>I’m saying Brown v. the Board of Education. We’ve got to hit the streets, ladies and gentlemen. I’m winding up, now–no more applause. I’m saying, look at the black Muslims. There are black Muslims standing on the street corners and they say so forth and so on, and we’re laughing at them because they have bean pies and all that, but you don’t read, “Black Muslim gunned down while chastising drug dealer.” You don’t read that. They don’t shoot down black Muslims. You understand me. Muslims tell you to get out of the neighborhood. When you want to clear your neighborhood out, first thing you do is go get the black Muslims, bean pies and all. And your neighborhood is then clear. The police can’t do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I’m telling you Christians, what’s wrong with you? Why can’t you hit the streets? Why can’t you clean it out yourselves? It’s our time now, ladies and gentlemen. It is our time. And I’ve got good news for you. It’s not about money. It’s about you doing something ordinarily that we do–get in somebody else’s business. It’s time for you to not accept the language that these people are speaking, which will take them nowhere. What the hell good is Brown v. the Board of Education if nobody wants it?</p>

<p>What is it with young girls getting after some girl who wants to still remain a virgin. Who are these sick black people and where did they come from and why haven’t they been parented to shut up? To go up to girls and try to get a club where “you are nobody....” This is a sickness, ladies and gentlemen, and we are not paying attention to these children. These are children. They don’t know anything. They don’t have anything. They’re homeless people. All they know how to do is beg. And you give it to them, trying to win their friendship. And what are they good for? And then they stand there in an orange suit and you drop to your knees: “He didn’t do anything. He didn’t do anything.” Yes, he did do it. And you need to have an orange suit on, too.</p>

<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for the award–and giving me an opportunity to speak because, I mean, this is the future, and all of these people who lined up and done–they’ve got to be wondering what the hell happened. Brown v. Board of Education–these people who marched and were hit in the face with rocks and punched in the face to get an education and we got these knuckleheads walking around who don’t want to learn English. I know that you all know it. I just want to get you as angry that you ought to be. When you walk around the neighborhood and you see this stuff, that stuff’s not funny. These people are not funny anymore. And that‘s not my brother. And that’s not my sister. They’re faking and they’re dragging me way down because the state, the city, and all these people have to pick up the tab on them because they don’t want to accept that they have to study to get an education.</p>

<p>We have to begin to build in the neighborhood, have restaurants, have cleaners, have pharmacies, have real estate, have medical buildings instead of trying to rob them all. And so, ladies and gentlemen, please, Dorothy Height, where ever she’s sitting, she didn’t do all that stuff so that she could hear somebody say, “I can’t stand algebra, I can’t stand…&quot; and, “what you is.” It’s horrible.</p>

<p>Basketball players–multimillionaires can’t write a paragraph. Football players, multimillionaires, can’t read. Yes. Multimillionaires. Well, Brown v. the Board of Education, where are we today? It’s there. They paved the way. What did we do with it? The white man, he’s laughing–got to be laughing. 50% drop out–rest of them in prison.</p>

<p>You got to tell me that if there was parenting–help me–if there was parenting, he wouldn’t have picked up the Coca Cola bottle and walked out with it to get shot in the back of the head. He wouldn’t have. Not if he loved his parents. And not if they were parenting! Not if the father would come home. Not if the boy hadn’t dropped the sperm cell inside of the girl and the girl had said, “No, you have to come back here and be the father of this child.” Not “I don’t have to.”</p>

<p>Therefore, you have the pile up of these sweet beautiful things born by nature–raised by no one. Give them presents. You’re raising pimps. That’s what a pimp is. A pimp will act nasty to you so you have to go out and get them something. And then you bring it back and maybe he or she hugs you. And that’s why pimp is so famous. They’ve got a drink called the “Pimp-something.” You all wonder what that’s about, don’t you? Well, you’re probably going to let Jesus figure it out for you. Well, I’ve got something to tell you about Jesus. When you go to the church, look at the stained glass things of Jesus. Look at them. Is Jesus smiling? Not in one picture. So, tell your friends. Let’s try to do something. Let’s try to make Jesus smile. Let’s start parenting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>one thing youre Faux black self need to understand is that in spanish negr is the part that means black. Negro is masculine and Negra is feminine both words mean black. <strong>no1</strong> is mistaken about that that&#39;s why it was bastardized into negr Ni@@er to even further dehumanize the african people. see you at the next faux black meeting ... blanco fauxneg</p>

<p>how can you properly  judge a peoples moral opinion at certain time when they were told to believe they were &quot;<strong>3/8</strong>&quot;s of a man
of course they wouldn&#39;t protest negro they were foced to abandon their african names too. hey negro or (neegro) sounds miles ahead of that (3/8&#39;s) , whatever the fuck that means (is probably what they were thinking).</p>

<p>Should we start calling white people blancos? hell nah they would protest that shit like it was artifically administered syphilus. because they know in spanish what is.

<p>What the OP doesn&#39;t get, but what you obviously do, is that it doesn&#39;t matter because they were forced to abandon their names anyway. So when it comes to what they were called, quadroon or mulatto would have been used but, when you look at these terms none of the, were meant to be uplifting. Negro, nigger, negras, etc, none of that shit came from leftists. For the OP to say it wasn&#39;t seen as racist is downright laughable. </p>

<p>I say negro was never seen as racist because if you go back to 1960, it would not had been. I assume the issue was something everyone overlooked, the issue of it being demeaning probably crossed no one&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>Yes, in 1967 there was blacks who had a problem with it. Why would Time magazine survey black soldiers their view on the word negro if it wasn&#39;t already controversial?</p>

<p>The first African slaves arrived here in 1619 which was before there was a &quot;leftist&quot; or &quot;rightest&quot;. So why exactly did you chose 1960 as your starting point? You have over 300 years of African American history from the start to the year you referenced yet somehow, in your research, you never encountered...wait. Scratch that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I picked 1960 because at that time it was simply inconceivable that the word negro would not be uttered within ten years. In comparison, it would be like telling someone in 2016 that the word &quot;Asian&quot; would disappear in five years from now: people wouldn&#39;t conceive it as realistic.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t pick 1619 because that is too far into the past: of course the terms for blacks has changed since then, nearly every aspect of our language has. My thread is about a drastic change in language over five years, not the change in language over three hundred years. </p>

<p>For all the criticisms from black activists in the sixties that the word negro was demeaning, keep in mind, whites didn&#39;t use it as an insult: black nationalists did that. My post offered several examples where black critics of liberalism were called negro as an insult by black leftists.</p>

<p>There was three examples in my OP where black nationalists in the sixties used negro AS AM INSULT. L C Wheeler used the term negro as an insult on national tv, in which he compares a negro to an uncle Tom. Stokely Carmichael used it as an insult, saying blacks that were friendly with whites were &quot;negro allies&quot;. Militants on liberal college campuses called Charles Smith a negro AS AN INSULT. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing if black Americans simply protested the use of the word negro, as most history books will say. It is a COMPLETELY OTHER THING for extremists to turn the word into an insult when this word, which millions identified with, was not seen as an insult shortly before.</p>

<p>As to why this thread is in conspiracy, it&#39;s because sinister people have in the past sought to divide the people by changing the meaning of various words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a mod <strong>openly</strong> telling me that it was within the rules for members to call me a cuck. </p>

<p>So why would I report someone for calling me delusional when I know the mods won&#39;t do shit? And then I get a &quot;final warning&quot; for saying someone <em>looks</em> and <em>sounds</em> a certain way? Not that they <em>are</em> that way but that they <em>look</em> that way? And then a final warning? How many warnings does one get? The first warning I had the mod that gave it said he didn&#39;t remember why I gave it. Another mod openly said I shouldn&#39;t have recieved it in the first place. There have been no other warnings. So how do we go from a warning that one can&#39;t remember and another said shouldn&#39;t have even happened to a final warning?</p>

<p>SMH. You and a couple of the other mods have a personal gripe with me, I know what it stems from so we can address it in PM.</p>

<p>I explained this. When the mod gave me my warning the mod warned me under my second reply which was the one where I said I would make him look like an idiot. The reply was not under the one where I said the guy sounded dumb as fuck. This is where the confusion comes in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never told you that and would not approve of another mod telling you that.</p>

<p>Do you remember our convo from 16 days ago? I still have the PMs. I don&#39;t agree with the shit, you say you don&#39;t but I still said I didn&#39;t want any mod to be removed but for you guys to get your shit together. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice spin on what you actually said. You said: &quot;You sound dumb ask fuck.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a spin. The mod gave the warning on the second reply and not the first. I said he sounds dumb as fuck and I said I would make him look like an idiot. Did you ever see me denying those things?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only gripe I have with anyone here is when they refuse to follow our rules. Oh yeah, and when they bitch and whine when they get caught at it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only in my case that isn&#39;t what happened. On my end the mods warning shows up on the second reply, not the first one. </p>

<p>Now here is the link:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gmj8u/to_rconspiracy_be_careful_and_stay_vigilant/dau3x6m/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gmj8u/to_rconspiracy_be_careful_and_stay_vigilant/dau3x6m/</a></p>

<p>So that mod says I broke rule 10, after I told a guy to &quot;fuck off&quot;, even though before I told him to fuck off I <em>politely</em> told him to move on. So that&#39;s a violation according to the mod. But the word cuck? The mods response, &quot;For me calling someone a cuck is an admission that you have no valid argument or even notable intelligence, <strong>still hardly an attack to use buzzword of the week on somebody who&#39;s winning an argument</strong>.&quot; and &quot;<strong>I don&#39;t see cuck as an insult, no</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Now do I get the &quot;spirit&quot; of what the mod was saying? Which was basically don&#39;t trip? Absolutely, but other&#39;s aren&#39;t fortunate enough to be able to hold their own. I can handle myself, it&#39;s others that can&#39;t handle it and especially can&#39;t handle it when I pull off the gloves and insult back.</p>

<p>And if you still have our convo from 16 days ago (PMs) <strong>I said I don&#39;t want anything to happen to the mod and I don&#39;t</strong>. I don&#39;t want anything for you guys except for you guys to be on the same page when it comes to rules and enforcement. This sub is not out of the dangerzone yet, I know that, I see that, but you guys have to come to grips with what is going on, develop a definitive go forward plan and implement it. </p>

<p>I just took a screen shot of the screen because my iPad allows me to back the pages and basically keep them how they are. Like I said, it looked like it was under the second one. And if they are basically saying the same thing, what does it matter? And look at when the two statements were made.

<p>Using who&#39;s comments? I said someone <em>sounded</em> a certain way and that I would make them <em>look</em> a certain way. Not that they <em>were/are</em> that but that they <em>sounded</em> like that or I would make them <em>look</em> like that. Yet <strong>calling someone</strong> delusional or saying someone <strong>is</strong> delusional is within the rules? So should I have just called the guy an idiot or said he was dumb as fuck?

<p>That&#39;s not true. I told the guy who called me a cuck to fuck off after I politely told him to move on. And I politely told him to move on after he called me a cuck. The guy in this thread? Two different scenarios, and I mentioned the cuck incident for a reason.</p>

<p>Huh? Do I need to post the PMs? Do I honestly need to do that? How are you getting shit on by people like me? Again, go back and read the PMs between the two of us from 16 days ago. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the last time: Follow our rules or get banned. Period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, what are the rules? You said, &quot;It&#39;s not possible for all 14 active mods to agree on everything anyway.&quot; so what are the rules the mods agree on? The rules on the side? </p>

<p>Calling someone a cuck? Not against the rules. Calling someone delusional? Not against the rules. Telling someone to fuck off after you have politely told someone to move on? Against the rules. Telling someone they sound one way or that you will make them look like an idiot? Against the rules.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just gonna start using the ignore feature like mad because it&#39;s clear as day what is going on here and I&#39;m glad everyone can see this. </p>

<p>EDIT: But I can&#39;t forget this gem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you haven&#39;t reported a comment calling you delusional then mods probably haven&#39;t seen it. It&#39;s not okay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see the comment, as it is in this thread and right where you gave me my warning, yet it&#39;s still up. </p>

<p>Interesting that your comment here is slightly different from the PM you sent me. Were you hoping I wouldn&#39;t notice the difference?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I explained this. When the mod gave me my warning the mod warned me under my second reply which was the one where I said I would make him look like an idiot. The reply was not under the one where I said the guy sounded dumb as fuck. This is where the confusion comes in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never told you that and would not approve of another mod telling you that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you remember our convo from 16 days ago? I still have the PMs. I don&#39;t agree with the shit, you say you don&#39;t but I still said I didn&#39;t want any mod to be removed but for you guys to get your shit together. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice spin on what you actually said. You said: &quot;You sound dumb ask fuck.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a spin. The mod gave the warning on the second reply and not the first. I said he sounds dumb as fuck and I said I would make him look like an idiot. Did you ever see me denying those things?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only gripe I have with anyone here is when they refuse to follow our rules. Oh yeah, and when they bitch and whine when they get caught at it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only in my case that isn&#39;t what happened. On my end the mods warning shows up on the second reply, not the first one. </p>

<p>Now here is the link:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gmj8u/to_rconspiracy_be_careful_and_stay_vigilant/dau3x6m/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5gmj8u/to_rconspiracy_be_careful_and_stay_vigilant/dau3x6m/</a></p>

<p>So that mod says I broke rule 10, after I told a guy to &quot;fuck off&quot;, even though before I told him to fuck off I <em>politely</em> told him to move on. So that&#39;s a violation according to the mod. But the word cuck? The mods response, &quot;For me calling someone a cuck is an admission that you have no valid argument or even notable intelligence, <strong>still hardly an attack to use buzzword of the week on somebody who&#39;s winning an argument</strong>.&quot; and &quot;<strong>I don&#39;t see cuck as an insult, no</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Now do I get the &quot;spirit&quot; of what the mod was saying? Which was basically don&#39;t trip? Absolutely, but other&#39;s aren&#39;t fortunate enough to be able to hold their own. I can handle myself, it&#39;s others that can&#39;t handle it and especially can&#39;t handle it when I pull off the gloves and insult back.</p>

<p>And if you still have our convo from 16 days ago (PMs) <strong>I said I don&#39;t want anything to happen to the mod and I don&#39;t</strong>. I don&#39;t want anything for you guys except for you guys to be on the same page when it comes to rules and enforcement. This sub is not out of the dangerzone yet, I know that, I see that, but you guys have to come to grips with what is going on, develop a definitive go forward plan and implement it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell a black man in 1965 that negro will be an unaccepted term in five years, he&#39;d think you were crazy. In 1965, blacks and whites used it interchangeably and no one criticized the word up until then.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the survey of Wallace Terry I documented, where most blacks didn&#39;t mind being called negro in 1967.</p>

<p>There&#39;s Charles Smith, a black man, whom triggered liberals by using the term negro. </p>

<p>Pretty sure most blacks didn&#39;t mind negro and it was leftists that turned it into something to be offended over.</p>
