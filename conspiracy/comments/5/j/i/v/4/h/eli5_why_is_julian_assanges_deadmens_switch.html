       Neither r/ELI5 nor r/OOTL accepted this question (as this is a current event and isn't a loop); so, I had to post here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aren't DMSs (in cases like this) supposed to make something (generally, info) violently erupt when the person apparently dies (or is compromised)? If yes, why is this one so obscure?

       Technically it is thought that when the tweet "We have updated the stochastic terminator algorithm" that the dead man was activated. This is the specific release algorithm which handles the automatic dumping of the wikileaks insurance files.
      </p>
      <p>
       However the very same day- was the same day both a raid vehicle was tweeted outside the ecuadorian embassy, as well as a fox news broadcast that julian would be arrested in hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later (like the same 2 hour period) a major ddos attack took place literally bombing out the entirety of the Internets processing power. 
eventually taking wikileaks offline - 
Wikileaks then blamed the attack on julians supporters? Which was a very different context from earlier tweets. Since then they have basically been "begging for supporters to come forward with new leaks" yet even the once casual protective alerts they would typically broadcast were halted. (essentially they would tell you) use vpn, and tor. Don't trust email. Dont put yourself in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they basically say. Hey You can trust us.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should also be noted via google at midnight that night the entire isp changed from one location to another like it was a preplanned attack by a us party. And that this is confirmation wikileaks was compromised. Since that day not a single document has julians pgp signature, and wikileaks insists we should overlook that providing no explaination as to why it is missing to date. Other than Well Guys its not improtant- They also took a Proof of life poll, which they have not delivered on (here 2  months later). While the following day after the alleged raid (that both eyewitnesses reported and ironically live feeds failed) they released an image set that was two months old to 'verify that julian is fine"?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion Julian was forcibly encountered at gun point. He panicked, and reached for a laptop and because they didn't know what he reached for --- Well That wouldn't be cool right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So it is assumed the ddos that took wikileaks offline initially killed the original dms. Now users suspect that wikileaks is being used as a decoy honeypot to bait in the key holders that are in possession of the keys. As a system to identify all potential assets that could release the insurance files.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that julian was an advocate of the blockchain, and when it was discovered that the chain could also store messages infinently that the chain was used to store the actual keys themselves as a safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       As recently as 500am today a group on a channel endchan may have found a conversation between Satoshi and JA, Which went like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       JA:
Hey can I put my shit here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satoshi
Dude were like 74,000 blocks in on genesis. Not really
      </p>
      <p>
       Ja. 
how about just the keys?
      </p>
      <p>
       The interesting part is when that conversation was discovered by the decrypters finding the codes, the endchan users network fell offline...
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that these users are following the work of another two teams now. One that appeared to be from japan that users feel had actually located the actual DMS. So users now can't locate them at all. IMO they are offline exploring the contents.
      </p>
      <p>
       The three teams meet privately on tor from what I understand and because of the potential that team japan found the leaks it may be that they were immedieatly countered by an outside agency. (taken offline permanently) or that they are actively planning a release method offline.
      </p>
      <p>
       They attempted to create a release network on a ps3 network that was quickly taken offline, and from what I have read about the endchan conversations some of their team can't find the rest of their team...
      </p>
      <p>
       It is thought that team 1 had also found the DMS key, and are actively ready to distribute contents as well. Their team (unknown). Are missing in action at this time. but the three teams had made the statement that tomorrow was some sort of release d day. (not sure if japan or team 1). So basically, from what I read there is a key within the blockchain. It has been discovered twice now. But the third team. (team working now) is having a hard time keeping the network together, and they just aren't caught up yet. (let alone they don't know where team 1 or 2 are.
      </p>
      <p>
       So For all we know the files will be launched tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should note these users were talking about seriously getting these files out. On networks globally, and their attempts were very complex. This isn't a "small scale non affair". They are expecting a huge front which will lead to the entirety of the internet going down (to hide the insurance files contents) and from again what I have read. They are even considering offline networks to use in those events (which they named and are credible) as well as physical / manual print distribution...
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also thought now that the x-keyscore is highly active as a bulk of the internet power is lacking and multiple sites are lagging. 
This would mean the nsa is literally scanning the entire net (according again to what I have read at this time). Looking for any sign of the files by a key word algorithm...
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially if a single file hits online It would be found anywhere between a minute to a week. (I mean the net is alot of data)...
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically. there does appear to be a key in the blockchain, if these sources are credible. That means tomorrow through the next xxx amount of time may be a frigging shit show.
      </p>
      <p>
       that is where I am at. Sorry. Great question and I am tired. 
Not really looking forward to the next coming week. Curious yes. 
However, for all we know these could literally spark off ww3 in a hot second. Which makes this whole situation grim in itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly hope they aren't bad enough to kick off ww3. but seriously they may be that shocking. We may not even ever know what happened in general. But what I do "feel" is the key is now wild. 
That may be bad news though... This may be very very bad news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or good? I mean it could just be a HRC / pizzagate thing for all I know and literally help a bunch of people? IDK. These are the most damaging files that wikileaks owned. So... For all we know. 9/11 was a false flag, or aliens exist and have been visiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       what ever it is, I don't feel right about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is team japan is chopping them, and probably selling them on carder markets at this time. As well as making hundreds of backups prints and etc. IDK why. I just see them having beat the system? Call it a gut feeling, and fearful feeling all the same-
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally hope that anything superserious is verified prior to going wild. I specifiacally think some things may be too shocking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I have every thought these are damaging to our nation. So Ya. Totally hope that people don't just launch out doomsday info without at least considering the full implications on the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel wikileaks never wanted to release these. These were the were the blackmail files. And Ya. again. Hopefully they are at least taken with a small level of scrutiny, and tactful consideration. 
Interesting times am I right :/

       Thanks for a great summary and all your research. I believe I read something about the keys being buried under an enourmous amount of suspicious micro-transactions some time after publication/discovery. I might be misremembering, but perhaps you know something about it.

       Title questions answer: NO DMS IN BC.
Smart cunts put a key in a thing called block chain. It isn't a dead man switch.
      </p>
      <p>
       No does not magically spark upon death there was a thingy that was supposed to send out storkes of tidbits but was thwarted by a bunch of little cunt thingies working together? and now the thing is dumb...

       X-Keyscore is a keyword locator (best known for its perversion).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are multiple servers that take snap shops of everything we say and do on the internet. Every key we press, every line we delete; Every email, social network, etc. It has been used on multiple occasions to help investigators discover crimes. Such as the KimDotCom case.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is thought that it can be fired up, and in an active state.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would pull networking speeds to a near halt as the device itself is literally scouring the entire network for snapshots.
      </p>
      <p>
       So essentially because the nsa very well knows the contents of the leaks. They can search the bulk of the internet for any paper that includes the data in a whole. (or so it is thought).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know an awful much more then the user. It does seem practical. It's likely a situation they would use it for, and I couldn't say much more then that about it. My opinion. its likely not a rumor in the context of the events at hand.

       If his dms was just to post info to social media, that could be deleted or stopped very easily. He has to have people in his dms, but can't have them having the information before the dms is activated for their safely. Bitcoin transactions are a deletion proof way to post encrypted info. Dms could send message/key to Assanges people, or  send the key out publicly but able to decrypt somehow.

       They tweet like every day... they could tweet a link to website that had the key on it... they could post it on facebook... they could put it anywhere... and someone would instantly screenshot it... they could e-mail it to 10 people and one of them would come here and post it... they just need to get it out to anyone. The fact that we don't have it means that no one wants us to have it... not that it is super secret hidden somewhere in the matrix.

       step 1. Lock out all media. Tell Twitter, Facebook, etc to change passwords or do whatever to keep them offline. Step 2. Kill him and take over.

       Thats exactly what a deadman's switch is for though... so they can't just kill him... unless that huge DDoS back around election day kept his switch from triggering. It's not like he hid the keys ahead of time assuming his DM wouldnt trigger... cause that would leave it open to someone finding it while he was still alive.

       Can't blame you for not wanting to get too close I guess. Just know that there are people trying hard to get this out. You should look at them yourself if you're savvy enough, I've told you where to find the info.

       But why couldn't they unlock the insurance files offline and then spread bits of it out from there... they can't have xkeyscore configured to find every single file in the hundreds of GBs of insurance files... especially not a screenshot of a file... if there was anything real I think one of these dozen of people that have seen em would have been smart enough to get something out.

       On the one hand you're right, this should be possible if they've previously downloaded the insurance files. On the other hand, how are they going to effectively spread this information without the Internet. Assuming the X key score claims are true and it is identifying and removing anything directly pointing to the key files, we also have to assume that the CIA knows what's in the insurance files as well which means any information from the files that is released on the Internet will be immediately flagged and removed as well. Thus the problem of spreading the information is really a problem of spreading in a way that doesn't trigger x key score hits. Physically spreading the information might be the easist solution but it's impractical in rapidly spreading. The news probably can't be trusted to take the documents seriously. That leaves, in my mind, screen caps or other image based data transfer methods. But again we have hundreds of gigabytes of files so that's going to take a long time to set up. Presumably they want to have all the documents ready to be released before any release happens. And presumably they want to have a method in place for rapid release before the powers that be can catch on and stop it mid way. Just my thoughts on the matter.

       Just a couple of damaging ones made into memes is all it would take... if they can't hide something in a meme then you know it is bullshit. The Xkeyscore shit is scare mongering... or they would have taken down the dozens of topics here detailing exactly how to find the keys. It isn't logical.

       There is a certain logic to it, if they didn't want to draw too much attention. But that conflicts with them being willing to take down most of the Internet. I agree that a strong skepticism ought to be applied to things like this that seem to have merit but aren't easily falsifiable. I'm going to keep following it to see where it leads at least, even if I'm not willing to hedge any bets on its veracity.

       I just don't even see what the point in trying is if they don't have any plans on how to spread the information... if sooooo many people have found the keys... just spread the info inside the files... you just just tell others what you saw. If they believe all this blockchain bullshit then they will also swallow whatever you said you found.

       So it really isn't that badassed then... I feel like if allllll these people had seen what was in the insurance files... they would just ya know... talk about what they saw... not try to teach other how to fucking mine bitcoins or DDoS or whatever is really going on here... the story makes no sense...

       I'm being realistic... if people had seen what was in them... they would describe it... if they were smart enough to hack them open they'd be smart enough to spread the info via screenshots. It just makes no sense... go back to wheresassange if you wanna just play "OMG the blockchain!" without applying a little critical thinking... cause if you were close to having this right... then they would have keyscored you away by now... but nope... yer still here telling the whole story.

       No, Deadmans switch still requires a key to allow for data dump. It aint like Terminator 2 with Dyson short breathing saying guys... im... not sure... how long... i ... can hold this... Wikileaks aint hollywood. if he's dead then well, fuck if he isn't, keep the faith. until you can't.

       I have been following the "blockchain search" and although I can't blame anyone for trying I think it's a dead end and would have been found by now had it activated. People saying that they can't get the keys out, raises red flags to be honest. I mean look at the darknet, there's cp and all other kinds of highly illegal stuff posted on .onion, and they can't get a key out? Come on now... Mail the damn key then.

       or it's also possible those you are speaking to aren't "in the know" therefore would be unable to give you said answers. Has your logic not taken you down that road of questioning? Or do you feel your own system is impervious to missing things?

       There is a compressed pic on the endchan.xyz polak post that has all the links  from the beginning with the info. All of this is very possible. Btc are just as easy to post, actually they're better because they can't be deleted.

       There is a certain logic to it, if they didn't want to draw too much attention. But that conflicts with them being willing to take down most of the Internet. I agree that a strong skepticism ought to be applied to things like this that seem to have merit but aren't easily falsifiable. I'm going to keep following it to see where it leads at least, even if I'm not willing to hedge any bets on its veracity.
