       I've toyed around with conspiracy theories in the past, never really subscribing to a majority of them but still interested enough in them to delve deeper and learn more. Am I the only one who feels like Trump winning the nomination pretty much throws a wet towel over a majority of them, especially the ones that are large in scale? I'm sorry but if something 1/10th as powerful as the Illuminati existed they would have been able to rig the election with ease. What am I missing here?

       You play both sides to appease the people, nothing has changed. The democrats are crying out of shame and to help start a civil war/world war, which would have happened with Clinton anyways.

       imo both are zionist puppets, trump had a meeting with head of mossad like two days ago and said they discussed syrian civil war(which means the whole friends with putin fighting isis narrative likely down the drain), numerous ties to israel most rather explicit, one of main campaign points was iran nuclear deal, general mattis has a hard on for iran as well. i have a more specific theory as to what's going on but this somewhat gets at it minus strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       also may be a little tinfoil but that whole simpsons prediction with the escalator announcement, matt groening is tied to epstein i do believe
      </p>
      <p>
       i think under trump we'll likely fuck up the middle east for the benefit of israel, iran the primary one on the shitlist, and with russia and iran getting friendly, well, should be some crazy shot however it unfolds

       The people with balls and guns all support Trump... if he says we need to war... they will be on board... the people with Paxil and allergies would be the ones supposedly in the streets... and we already know how weak their game is. If the state didn't beat the living fuck out every last one of those guys at Standing Rock they aren't gonna beatdown some ineffective little pussies.

       Isn't that Syria shit just something HRC's cronies whipped up for a cut of the oil? Trump and Russia are best buddies... they aren't gonna fucking nuke each other... Or are you thinking someone else will nuke us aside from Russia? I think NK sees all this horseshit in the rest of the world and just wants to be left alone...

       I think there could be multiple agendas for Syria. I don't think Trump is best buddies with Russia because he is already best buddies with Israel. No, it would be Russia doing the nuking.

      <p>
       We'll have to see how Trump deals with Syria. I agree this is all horeshit and US needs to be left alone rebuild. We should ban all foreign lobbyists.

       but yeah if anything we do get a wall and the likes, infrastructure, etc. reminds me of hitler's rise with the infrastructure/military buildup(not in a bad way, currently reading mein kampf). my theory honestly goes pretty tinfoil, trump being a zionist puppet using hitleresque very effective nationalism and will manifest in destroying islamic countries that benefit israel, trump's good friend netanyahu and the likes were likely behind 9/11 which escalated islamic tensions initially

       I think Mossad had full knowledge 9/11 was going down... and knew not to intervene... cause really why would they want to. I doubt they had a hand in it though.

       yeah pre ww2 he stepped up military production because the versailles treaty thoroughly raped germany and if you look into the history they were on track to winning inn1916 and offered total reset to britain tonpre war conditions, powerful bankers and the likes in germany got america involved(we had zionist media starting in like 1908)if britain would help them with palestine, same people were mainly in attendance at versailles and dictated the terms. therefore the military buildup and infrastructure aren't some anti semitic plot, and i had to say not in a bad way because people like you are fools to the victor's dogma/quick w/ the platitudes

       hitler building up his military and creating jobs via infrastructure wasn't based on hate for jews, it was to revive the economy, to keep it short. i touched on how they ended up losing ww1 via zionists getting america involved in the war, prior to that in 1916 not a foot had tramped on german soil and they would've obviously won, they offered essentially a reset to prewar conditions to britain. the versailles treaty was an utter raping of germany and hitler's role was natural, if they obeyed the rules of the treaty they would've been slowly destroyed via bad economy and no military. i said not in a bad way to say that i'm not trying to demonize the economics of it or else you would assume i'm comparing trump to hitler through the lens of the average person who starts to feel guilty if you even mention anything against the narrative of the nazis solely being a product of some demonic amoral one nutted lunatic screaming in german.

       i had only heard that thru noam chomsky and he's not the most reliable guy on things pertaining to zionism, where can i read about it? i just moreso thought the 80% jews at versailles set it up for his rise rather than direct planting, but thought i ran into dead end on the western intelligence narrative

       i'd say all of europe, not well versed enough with china to say but many have said they're part of it all. by europe not having changed i mean i think this whole "populist uprising" shit will just be hijacked into something and used an example as why not to go against centralization.

       Haha... Russia? Look at Putin's face... he don't wanna nuke us... if he wanted to he's had 100 reasons... he's just waiting for everyone else to get their countries under control. Has anyone ever nuked anyone ever... just the good ol' USA... unless you count testing.

       putin is my favorite but you have to remember he's ex kgb and russia had their own 9/11 and whatnot/from bolshevik and into the 2000s even russia had lots of zionists, it appears he's taking back power nowadays tho

       a big tell will be trump's position towards russia through the proxies in the ME, that meeting with the head of mossad where they discussed the syrian civil war just really  got me going down the rabbit hole of him being a zionist but who knows

       I don't really care what he does concerning Israel... whatever is going on over there has been going on for too long... and I'll side with the Jews just cause I know some IRL... Obama just changed the anti-semitic act to also protect people from statements concerning Zionism and Israel as well... so I'll talk about Israel now before it becomes hate speech.

       ha nor do I if it didn't involve the  US, and zionism isn't restricted to israel, far from that, hence my initial inclination to reference international jewry, i think there is a split somewhere in zionism tho with more global interests vs middle eastern semitic bs that we shouldn't be involved in

       I feel like if there's a conspiracy, it's that Trump was originally meant to be controlled opposition for Clinton and probably was meant to lose. On paper he's someone who she should easily beat, and if he ever picked up steam they would sink him with scandals.
      </p>
      <p>
       But somewhere along the way Trump broke the script and decided he really wanted to win and out-campaigned her, out-rallied her, and somehow became the more likeable candidate and won fair and square. Thus why the MSM all got it so wrong: they were probably assured all the way back from the primary that Clinton had it in the bag, so that was their narrative all year.

       Of course it did. The internet is unlike anything in human history. It allows billions from around the world to communicate anything they want. No one can harness or control that as it exists right now.

       Well, memes are basically ways to harness collective consciousness into a physical form to be shared, so not as stupid as you think.

       Yeah I freaked out when that happened. There's no way that was a coincidence. Look at the history of that account. Inactive for a year and then they post about Fred Trump and Tesla. They were referencing this meme:

       The powers that be don't care if there was a gorilla in the White House. Only if the gorilla causes them trouble do they resort to either a Carter derailment or a Kennedy assassination.

       The 1% already own the majority of the Congressmen and Senators by funding their multi million dollar election campaigns for a job whose salary starts at $174,000 per annum. Democrat or Republican doesn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1% own the Secretaries, the senior Bureaucrats, and military brass by the fact that after retirement they will put THESE RETIRED PUBLIC SERVANTS either on the board of their companies or as an advisor to board earning multimillion $$$ salaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1% own the Fed and therefore  control credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1% now own private companies contracted to NSA, CIA, etc.. whom deal in the surveillance of U.S. citizens (Edward Snowdon worked for one) giving them access to the greatest database in history with the ability to locate and silence anyone, their family, and friends.

       They have already rattled Trump's cage over the electors college and now have Obama digging a hole for him over Russia. Trump has appointed former Rothschild &amp; Co in his cabinet which is an ill wind for the future. Indeed bar his stance against regime change, many of his policies will echo that of Clinton/Bush/Obama. As for free trade Trump never said he was against it just that he would renegotiate.
      </p>
      <p>
       However should Trump cause problems for the PTB and it comes down to the worse scenario, they have Pence ready to move in.

       i'd say all of europe, not well versed enough with china to say but many have said they're part of it all. by europe not having changed i mean i think this whole "populist uprising" shit will just be hijacked into something and used an example as why not to go against centralization.

       but yeah if anything we do get a wall and the likes, infrastructure, etc. reminds me of hitler's rise with the infrastructure/military buildup(not in a bad way, currently reading mein kampf). my theory honestly goes pretty tinfoil, trump being a zionist puppet using hitleresque very effective nationalism and will manifest in destroying islamic countries that benefit israel, trump's good friend netanyahu and the likes were likely behind 9/11 which escalated islamic tensions initially
