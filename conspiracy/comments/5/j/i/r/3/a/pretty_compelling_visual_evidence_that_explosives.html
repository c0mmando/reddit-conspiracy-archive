But I&#39;ve recently looked back at a video I came across about a year ago and I thought it might bring about some thought provoking discussion over the subject. I&#39;ve always known their were too many inconsistencies with the original narrative to believe even the slightest bit of information we were given that day and the years to come. From Silverstein raking in an astounding $4.5 billion insurance settlement, the largest in human history I believe, to the cover up of money laundering and security fraud committed by elitist friends of George H.W. Bush and remaining members of the Vulcans (Cheney, Rice, Wolfowitz) 10 years beforehand (allegedly ending the Cold War by crashing the Russian Ruble with large investments in their oil industry, see Project Hammer) Maybe even a diversion for the $2.3 trillion missing from the pentagon on Sept. 10, 2001. Or just plainly lining the pockets of all the special interest groups of the U.S., U.K., Saudi Arabia and Israel who benefitted off the wars waged in the name of a very fraudulent war on terrorism. Aside from the hard facts and the whopping $600,000 the investigative committee was given to look into the biggest crime of the century, I still manage to find individuals that deny these truths. Evidence that should indefinitely sway any reasonable mind to the &quot;truther&quot; side of the conspiratorial fence. Obviously, in consideration of the dumb amount of &#39;follow the money&#39; evidence I&#39;ve just provided, I&#39;m here with a bias agenda. Just check this video out if you&#39;re one that has always dismissed any opposition to the original story. This is a video of the base of the towers right before they begin to implode. Only for a split second at 9:40 will you be able to see. I think it&#39;s enough to deem compelling though. <a href="https://youtu.be/fknMGEVUvyM">9:40 Flash of nanothermite exploding at base of building </a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t take it serious because it&#39;s the internet. But there&#39;s also the issue of not having anyone to blame. The 9/11 demolitions were likely perpetrated by well connected individuals representing more than one government.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s denial. People don&#39;t want to realize that the military-industrial complex doesn&#39;t have any quarrels with killing 3,000 civilians in order to usher in complete control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even the canadians that received the steel from the towers had to sign NDAs.</p>

<p>Remember how crisis actors are hired? They also have to usually sign NDAs too. I don&#39;t think hired military contractors have to sign NDAs, but it would be their check and future job clearance on the line AFAIK. </p>

<p>I have never ever seen this footage before, and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s coming to the surface. In the real world, all it would take it a meeting with one demented person sent by some guy they employed that has high-level of confidence. I don&#39;t think it was entirely an insurance money grab, as it may be inferred. He was even planning renovations(?) or a new building to replace those. Maybe it was a &quot;two birds with one stone&quot; instance, in which he couldn&#39;t really demo the buildings, someone caught wind of it that also have high-level confidence, and they plotted together and then the rest of the high-level confidence birds conferred. </p>

<p>There has to be some more purpose to the 9/11 Committees(they still exist, right? or is that too a money-grab or seat-warming?), we should take a look into those too as they should&#39;ve been the ones the evidence had came from in the first place. </p>

<p>Ok then, how was it possible for hundreds of demolition workers to work in the three buildings for a few months prior to 9/11, to go completely unnoticed?</p>

<p>How did they manage to hide the 1000&#39;s of meters of detonation cord running from column to column? How did they hide all the intrusive work they did, exposing ceilings, drilling and fixing onto beams and columns, without any of the 1000&#39;s of employees mentioning a single word of it?</p>

<p>Just think about the pluasibility of that scenario first.</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re assuming they used a common explosive we know about... consider it could have easily been a military grade super nano-thermite with properties designed specifically to bring down a building in it&#39;s own footprint.  We know the anthrax came from a military lab.  Isn&#39;t it possible the military developed a newer, thermite that required less, less wiring, less traditional set up?  It is possible.</p>

<p>When you understand how these operations go down, you realize anything is possible. Remember the Israelis who were living on the 90th floor doing an &quot;art project&quot;. They lived in the towers undetected for several weeks. They built a balcony. Could they have been agents working quietly?  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/18/nyregion/balcony-scene-unseen-atop-world-episode-trade-center-assumes-mythic-qualities.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/18/nyregion/balcony-scene-unseen-atop-world-episode-trade-center-assumes-mythic-qualities.html</a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The fires raging weakened the steel supports enough that a collapse began onto already damaged floors. </p></li>
<li><p>These damaged floors were now holding more weight than designed to do so without the help of the support beams. </p></li>
<li><p>Now you have a cascading failure of supports, all the way down leading as well to the rather contained collapse of the towers.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Think this through. As soon as the first set of supports collapsed, the stress would have instantly been removed from all subsequent supports.

    <div class="md"><p>The way I understood was it was a design flaw. Instead of having say a dozen major supports all the way to the top, each floor was reinforced and the supports were placed... not randomly but were in different locations. The floor of each level was the major support and once several floors were damaged, the cascading failure was inevitable. </p>

<p>The supports were damaged, causing an overload of force to come down. A floor that might have been able to contain it was damaged on impact. It now can&#39;t hold it. Cue floor collapse. Now you have floor after floor collapsing under weight it can&#39;t hold, all the way to the bottom. </p>

<p>It makes sense to me, and is the only thing that realistically explains the way the towers fell. </p>

<p>Only way to convince me otherwise is to provide eyewitness evidence of crews of men placing explosives in the building, because the amount needed to bring down two towers would have been noticed easily.</p>

Even if an upper floors collapse on the immediate lower floor (say floors 100-70 collapsing on 69 (hehehe) the point of greatest weakness) then there will still be an visible instant&#39;s delay between when 100-69 collapse on 68, and so on and so on. No way that collapse will be (a) symmetrical, and (b) synchronous at near-freefall speed <em>all the way down.</em> All the supports cannot give way simultaneously in two buildings with two different height impact points. The odds of that are impossibly small. </p>

<p>Also, (1) there were reports of dust coming out of the AC vents in the weeks prior to 9/11. This would be consistent with explosives wiring throughout the building at night. </p>

<p>(2) Three Israeli students did an &quot;art project&quot; that shows them on an upper floor of WTC surrounded by cardboard boxes with what is alleged to be an electronics detonator code written on the outside. There are photos and a coffee table book of said art project. (On mobile, do not have link. Recommend Google.)</p>

<p>(3) Gravitational collapse still cannot account for Building 7. </p>

<p>Also... if all the SEALS who &quot;killed Bin Laden&quot; are now dead, what makes you think the demo teams who wired WTC are alive?</p>

<p>And, you won&#39;t like this but many allege that those teams were MK subjects who would have no memory of their actions anyway. </p>

<p>And first responders, from police to fire to building security all report the sounds of explosions immediately before and during the collapse. </p>

<p>Any explanation you&#39;d put forth must account for all of the above verifiable factors. </p>

It was a poor design and officially, this is a partial reason for collapsing in its own footprint iirc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a cool picture! But I still don&#39;t believe it. Because literally two entire buildings, both inner inner structural supports and outer, non-load bearing steel, would have to shatter like glass for the buildings to collapse so symmetrically, so neatly, and so quickly. Only, steel doesn&#39;t perform like glass. It doesn&#39;t shatter. In fact, at the temperatures of jet fuel it doesn&#39;t even melt. Perhaps it bends, but that&#39;s the most. </p>

<p>And it still doesn&#39;t explain Building 7. </p>

<p>Agreed on 9/11 being Pearl Harbor. It&#39;s worth looking into the history of that, as well. There&#39;s documentation of FDR and his Cabinet provoking Japan into war. Not so we could fight Japan, though, because both the USA and Japan knew that Japan would lose that fight. But because Japan was Germany&#39;s ally, it gave us cause to enter the European theater. Openly, of course. Because we were participating covertly with arms and money long before that. </p>

<p>That clip at the 9:40 mark, where you see flashes, is from an actual planned demolition of some other building. I think this clip was included to compare the sound of a known controlled demo to the sounds on 911.  You can tell by the black wrap around the first couple floors. They do this to keep debris from flying out. Then the video switches to a clip inside the towers with firefighters and you can hear the explosions that are very similar to the explosions from the example video. </p>
