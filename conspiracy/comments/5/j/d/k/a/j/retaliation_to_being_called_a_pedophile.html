        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The trending topics of this subreddit got me thinking. </p>

<p>Claiming someone is a pedophile and blasting it on social media is character assassination and basically ruining someone&#39;s life forever. If you&#39;re the accused, how do you react to that? Is the accusation and slanderous campaign grounds for physical retaliation? Once someone is labeled a child molester, their life is basically over- guilty or not. </p>

<p>I just want to pose the hypothetical question to the community â€“ how would <em>you</em> react if you were ever labeled a pedophile? What would you do? Would you become a recluse, or would you resort to physical violence against the accuser? Would you attempt to clear your name, despite the fact that you can never get away from the label that has been put on you? </p>

<p>All someone has to do is hint at it- and once the seed is planted, social media takes over and you have the label with you forever and cannot escape it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it is a massively harmful label to attach to someone. Arguably the greatest sin in our society. Having said that.....  </p>

<p>There is a point where activity in the public spotlight elevates someone from the level of acceptable private scrutiny to acceptable public scrutiny. Merely being interviewed by the news, for example, should not elevate someone to that &quot;acceptable public scrutiny&quot; level. However actively participating in a political party social event begins to. I feel even visits to the White House should subject one to a certain amount of public scrutiny. As involvement in the public spotlight increases (and the flow of state money likewise increases) the persons level of public scrutiny also increases.</p>

<p>So as we have an increased level of acceptable scrutiny we then also have an increased level of acceptable accusations. It&#39;s abhorrent to call my neighbor a pedophile without proof of conviction and if I do I will get punched in my face. It&#39;s not so abhorrent to call the President a pedophile and expect proof from him he is not one. His public paycheck lends him the obligation to me, the citizen, to provide that proof. There is a spectrum of acceptableness between private citizen (my neighbor) and major public citizen (the president).</p>

<p>Also it should be acceptable to have greater expectations fom public citizens than private ones. I would likely turn a blind eye to my neighbor stealing a chocolate bar, but I would expect impeachment from the President if he did the same. Unfortunately the scale of punishment seems reversed in this case. The private citizen caught involved in pedophilia can expect very long sentances. However the higher up the food chain you go the upholders of the law and constitution can expect les and less consequences or even evade prosecution all together.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming part of your motivation was to consider consequences upon people like Alefantis and Podesta? (Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong) Podesta has been interwoven with DC politics for a very very long time, and his status as an unelected mover and shaker in Washington has grown steadily since Bill Clintons presidency. His status and involvement in public proceedings <em>must</em> subect him to massive public scrutiny, especially because he is not elected. His behavior <em>must</em> be held to a very high standard. It&#39;s unacceptable for someone of his status to display cannibal art or have Spirit Cooking dinners or undergound movie bunkers.</p>

<p>Alefantis should also be held to a similar level of scrutiny. A lot of his money is made from individuals spending public funds. There has been private paties from the DNC, Obama, etc. His public presence earned him a rank on the most powerful people in Washington list. Consequently, this exposure also put him somewhere on the spectrum of &quot;acceptable public scrutiny&quot; where accusations of pedophilia must be responded to.</p>

<p><strong>Tldr;</strong> the more powerful you get the more acceptable the accusations become.</p>

<p>Ps. Expect a few edits because this was written on mobile so spellcheck is my curse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly doubt the mere accusation would ruin your life...<em>unless your friends know you better than you know yourself.</em> Why would that always be hanging above your head? Why would your life be fucked? If you were mad enough to kill...maybe be angry enough to confront and address the accusation like an adult. Pedophilia/Pederasty/Child molestation are rarely one off crimes. However, if you feel like you&#39;ve been wrongly accused and don&#39;t have the mental acuity to deal with it like an adult, just move. Start over.

<p>Only a pathetic weakling would think that. Physical confrontations prove you are serious. If you openly accusedme, a father of two small children, of being a molester, I would break your shit talking jaw. After my 90 days in county jail, I&#39;d find you and do it again. That doesn&#39;t mean I molest kids, it means you called out a man and got put in your place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I carry a firearm in case a psychotic like you decides to behave like a caveman. Your idiocy would cause your children to be orphans. In a stand your ground state, after shooting you dead, I would sleep soundly in my bed that night. A real man doesn&#39;t act like a child when confronted with uncomfortable realities. A real man would contact his lawyers and publicly school the ass of his accuser. The reality is if you attacked your accuser it would scream guilt and people around you would notice...<em>just like your little outburst here makes you a tad bit suspicious.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Pathetic weakling confirmed. By the way sissy boy, you aren&#39;t the only one who carries a firearm, and you aren&#39;t the only one who lives in a stand your ground state. If you accuse me of molesting children in public, and I get angry at you, you are not allowed to use lethal force. You started the confrontation, you need to live with the consequences. It would be better for you if you understood the law... better leave the firearm at home until you know what you can and cannot do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you&#39;re tripping because you didn&#39;t get the response you wanted. People associated with CPP were accused of being pedophiles because they have art/music/jokes/etc about pedophilia. Why the fk would someone put that sort of content out there who is concerned about being called a pedophile. How is their life ruined when all of the people in their circles already know all of that shit anyway. What sort of answers were you honestly expecting here lol. </p>

<p>My account is famous. I&#39;ve whitstood the test of time, against accusation and accusation. I&#39;ve even made my own subreddit dedicated to dealing with shill accusations. </p>

<p>I am invincible. </p>

<hr/>

<p>I think you&#39;re the first to accuse me of being affiliated with law enforcement. I&#39;ve been accused of being all manner of agencies, but not the police. So thanks, i&#39;ll be adding that to the growing list of nonsense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Final warning?&quot; Whatever (eyeroll). Also I have no idea why you would consider anything I said a &quot;personal attack.&quot; </p>

<p>Anyway, I know you love to enforce your precious &quot;rule 10,&quot; but I think what&#39;s more detrimental to this subreddit than &quot;personal attacks&quot; is people who comment in every thread, all day long, with the sole purpose of antagonizing users trying to have a rational discussion. But hey, that&#39;s just me...</p>

<p>I love how you ask a question in here- and a lot of people answer it.  But there is always the same few accounts that get on, deliberately avoid answering the question, and form their comment to reflect their agenda and derail the conversation.  </p>

<p>I would accuse you of doing the same thing.  It&#39;s obvious you have an agenda behind your post because it&#39;s a data collection post, similar to &quot;what is your favortie conspiracy theory?&quot;  ... &quot;which conspiracy theory do you think is true?&quot; ... &quot;why do people deny the holocaust?&quot;</p>

<p>So before you call the kettle black consider that I think you&#39;re the pot...and that&#39;s where <em>I&#39;m</em> coming from.  Because I understand the subtext behind your question.</p>

<p>Everyone knows it would not be nice to have your life ruined by the taint of being called a pedophile, so why you&#39;re even asking the question means you&#39;re not looking for the answer so much as making a statement with a question, ex: &quot;why are you so gay?&quot;  see?  That&#39;s a shit question.  </p>

<p>This stigma might actually disincentivize pedophiles from ever breaking the law.  Which is a good thing.  I feel bad for pedophiles, but just like any mental illness, they need to address it before it&#39;s too late.</p>
