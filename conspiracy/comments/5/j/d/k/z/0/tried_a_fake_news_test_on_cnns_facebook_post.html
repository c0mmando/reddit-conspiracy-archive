    <div class="md"><p>uh - they have whole fucking teams filtering content - along with thousands of AI threads...</p>

<p>I worked with a guy who is a CP filter team member (they search for porn/CP/abuse posts on FB and hand those profiles over to the PD/Feds/authorities)</p>

<p>They go through the sewer of FB (which is basically all of FB) and they actually do a good job of sending evidence to authorities for crap. a job that is DoNotWant.</p>

<p>Now, this doesnt forgive the close ties they have to DC... but they do have these groups within FB and at least they can hopefully skim the surface for the best of <em>some</em>....</p>

<p>The real issue is; why have we been able to get the twitter peds blown up, but we havent seen SHIT from FB on the matter?</p>

<p>They have ~1.2B Dumb Fucks <sup>TM</sup> on the site yet not a single major criminal ring has been busted?????????<sup>?????????</sup></p>

<p>Has FB found its blackmail leverage?</p>

<p>I disagree. Wikileaks may even bring us truth (I&#39;m truly unsure), but ultimately anyone disseminating wikileaks is performing espionage, and now journalists can be enemy combatants. Through social media a citizen can be a journalist.</p>

I deleted my old profile but made a new account months ago, in an effort to try and wake some people up, and honestly to view MSM articles that are being distributed and constantly shared, as well as talked about amongst friends and people I know.

<p>i rarely use mobile messenger but sometimes browse through the app.</p>

<p>most of my convos are through whatsapp or facebook messenger on desktop.</p>

<p>im not arguing for fb just want to know if there is extra reason to be fearful of particular aspects of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simply put, the first amendment applies to your freedom of speech not being infringed upon by the federal government. So, for example, the fed can&#39;t legally stop you from having all the pizzagate protests you want to have.</p>

<p>However, you have no legal right to speech when it comes to your interaction with a private company. If CNN doesn&#39;t want to see your pizzagate posts, they have zero obligation to allow them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure free speech means, if you&#39;re a human, you can say whatever you want and it&#39;s your right to say it... I believe that would be the definition of free speech ... Wether or not you say it to a corporation that&#39;s privately owned or not. They&#39;re supposed to be for the people, reporting for the people. But they&#39;re just spreading lies.... What stops them, nothing, free speech is there to protect them... Along with money and the government cause they&#39;re paid shills. Never in history have CNNs word been more widely disapproved of or not trusted , why ? ... Cause it&#39;s all bullshit. One fake story or staged &quot;terror&quot; attack after another. </p>

<p>I hate to break it to you, but that&#39;s not what it means. Regardless of if that&#39;s what you want it to mean. </p>

<p>You can say whatever you want. You just don&#39;t have the right to do it on other people&#39;s property. You&#39;re more than welcome to invest in creating your own news outlet to pick up where they are doing poorly. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the free speech that the fed cannot restrict.</p>

<p>I remember reading a story about china banning sarcasm/puns etc from social media. in order to hide text, we substitute letters, or add spaces, but in chinese that doesnt work the same, so to get around filters, they use puns, rhyming words, extreme sarcasm, word-play etc.</p>

<p>I thought to myself, damn...that really must suck to live in a society like that...</p>

<p>well, here we are.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty much doing that for every Facebook post. I take printscreens of headlines I want to share and post them like that. If I use links, especially to Breitbart, Daily Caller, Citizen&#39;s Audit and The Gateway Pundit, Facebook complete hides my post.</p>

<p>So I just put it in Canva. It&#39;s free and fast.</p>
