       uh - they have whole fucking teams filtering content - along with thousands of AI threads...
      </p>
      <p>
       I worked with a guy who is a CP filter team member (they search for porn/CP/abuse posts on FB and hand those profiles over to the PD/Feds/authorities)
      </p>
      <p>
       They go through the sewer of FB (which is basically all of FB) and they actually do a good job of sending evidence to authorities for crap. a job that is DoNotWant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this doesnt forgive the close ties they have to DC... but they do have these groups within FB and at least they can hopefully skim the surface for the best of
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       ....
      </p>
      <p>
       The real issue is; why have we been able to get the twitter peds blown up, but we havent seen SHIT from FB on the matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       They have ~1.2B Dumb Fucks
       <sup>

       on the site yet not a single major criminal ring has been busted?????????

       Good report of realtime censoring and triggers.

      <p>
       I think this Merkel's fine for "FAKE NEWS"  is just propaganda to justify more censoring.  Very cohesive players. No wonder we were fooled for so long. Thank God for Wikileaks.

       I disagree. Wikileaks may even bring us truth (I'm truly unsure), but ultimately anyone disseminating wikileaks is performing espionage, and now journalists can be enemy combatants. Through social media a citizen can be a journalist.

       I guess you are using New Speak. Wikileaks have been disseminated and have revealed many shocking and shameful facts written by the hand of the traitors in deed. You remind me of CNN saying people should not read them. How convenient for a treasonous group of players.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks is only publishing what has been leaked. Finding wrongdoing, lying and treason is the very job of journalists. Or was anyway. What you are defending is deliberate covering up of the betrayal by those in highest offices. How can that benefit our country?  Our people?

       Yep. Had the same thing happen to me, as well as the same thing OP had happen to him. I kept getting likes and comments steadily, then at about 40 likes, it stopped completely and something happened to my Facebook app too. It stopped working, shut down and had me resign in.

       I know. I deleted my old profile but made a new account months ago, in an effort to try and wake some people up, and honestly to view MSM articles that are being distributed and constantly shared, as well as talked about amongst friends and people I know. In some ways, I feel like more people are waking up..however, then I see another thread of nothing but inaccuracies and biased opionions, so I don't really know. But, I do keep electrical tape over the cams on all my devices and take other precautions, but you are right, I do need to just get rid of it once and for all.

       whats wrong with the app specifically?
      </p>
      <p>
       apart from facebook massive data collection etc etc, how is it specifically worse than e.g. just browsing from desktop?
      </p>
      <p>
       is it their access to microphone &amp; collecting background noise or something like that?

       but what difference does it make if we use the facebook chat on desktop version vs mobile?
      </p>
      <p>
       i rarely use mobile messenger but sometimes browse through the app.
      </p>
      <p>
       most of my convos are through whatsapp or facebook messenger on desktop.
      </p>
      <p>
       im not arguing for fb just want to know if there is extra reason to be fearful of particular aspects of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       tbh when were at a point where people start noting adverts on fb based on their "encrypted" whatsapp convos...

       funnily enough the only sort of marketing i see on fb is things ive searched ages ago and already purchased.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g. computer accessories, holidays etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       its mostly just a source of nuisance if i see a better deal post mortem.
      </p>
      <p>
       perhaps this is more USA based or should i be seeing same in UK?

       CNN is a private company that pays to have a digital profile on another private company's site (facebook). Two private companies and you're more than free to use neither of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they start censoring YOUR wall posts then you'll have something to complain about, but even then you have no legal standing just a shaky moral one because again PRIVATE COMPANY.

       Again, they are a private organization that is allowed to run their organization however there want. We have very specific laws that deal with all of this. I understand you think they are wrong, but that's not what our legal system has decided.

       Well as of right now, 97 other people seem to agree with this post... You seem to be the only one with a problem. They can't censor real shit and then say it's fake news... That's not freedom of information or speech.... But ya... So far, 97 people and counting agree with me apparently.

       Simply put, the first amendment applies to your freedom of speech not being infringed upon by the federal government. So, for example, the fed can't legally stop you from having all the pizzagate protests you want to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you have no legal right to speech when it comes to your interaction with a private company. If CNN doesn't want to see your pizzagate posts, they have zero obligation to allow them.

       I'm pretty sure free speech means, if you're a human, you can say whatever you want and it's your right to say it... I believe that would be the definition of free speech ... Wether or not you say it to a corporation that's privately owned or not. They're supposed to be for the people, reporting for the people. But they're just spreading lies.... What stops them, nothing, free speech is there to protect them... Along with money and the government cause they're paid shills. Never in history have CNNs word been more widely disapproved of or not trusted , why ? ... Cause it's all bullshit. One fake story or staged "terror" attack after another.

       If you commented with a few different accounts, then maybe the shadowban or censor was more along the lines of IP related. They somehow were able to censor a gateway, not just a profile.

       The Portman Murphy bill passed the house, senate and was a line item in the budget bill weeks ago. The state dept now has its own 160 million dollar federalized CTR. Free speech is compromised. You just met The Ministry of Post-Truth™. In a few days this state sponsored propaganda machine is going to be run out of Trump's Exxon flavored State Department.

       I remember reading a story about china banning sarcasm/puns etc from social media. in order to hide text, we substitute letters, or add spaces, but in chinese that doesnt work the same, so to get around filters, they use puns, rhyming words, extreme sarcasm, word-play etc.

       Everyone needs to start using Canva and post their comments in images.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty much doing that for every Facebook post. I take printscreens of headlines I want to share and post them like that. If I use links, especially to Breitbart, Daily Caller, Citizen's Audit and The Gateway Pundit, Facebook complete hides my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I just put it in Canva. It's free and fast.

       Here is screenshots from my two accounts as PROOF CNN is indeed censoring comments. I posted what I actually said and how it went down in a recent trending CNN write up here on Reddit just a couple hours ago. See it for yourself.
