       <em>
        Here's how it began
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone whose spent more than a day in this sub will be familiar with 1 or more of the numerous conspiracies concerning peadophilia and the global elite. Im not sure what the common consensus is  aside from them being evil, but I'm inclined to believe the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       The peadophile rings serve primarily as blackmail rings- a means for them to keep tabs on each other, similar to M.A.D : everybody is safe because everyone has dirt on everyone else. For those still unsure, but who are aware of the scope of global peadophilia ,the propensity towards sectors of influence won't have escaped you. Induction into the zenith of politics, business, celebrity, elite etc likely comes with the understanding that that's the price you pay to be part of the club. Not to say they don't enjoy it as well, just that it's important to understand one of the integral functions such groups serve...
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Here's where it took me
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       ...With that in mind, when the discussion turns to exposing and removing it, you're really talking about removing the existing establishment structure. Which, as idealistic an idea (and one I fully support) as it is, raises the question of what to do with the vacuum of stability &amp; normalcy that will emerge in such circumstances? An entirely new system of governance, distribution, financial, education etc will have to implemented immediately as we all know the existing ones are wholly corrupt and do not exist to serve the will of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it like this: the elite who wield global power are able to do so by
       <strong>
        creating a system that benefits enough people for the majority to accept it
       </strong>
       . How do we know this? Because they're still in power. Further more, they have the means to
       <strong>
        protect their vision from those who the system doesn't cater to
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider this premise: *
       <em>
        Any successful attempt to usurp the status quo must possess the same qualities or it is doomed to fail. *
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       If we accept that statement to be true, pursue that line of thinking. Further down, you'll arrive at the following realisation:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        More important than exposing the current system, is working to create a better one
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this to encourage and foster the idea of hope and creativity as the vehicles that will bring forth the change that we all crave so desperately; not to dampen spirits. We may not have control of armies or media outlets, but we all have the power to influence others with hope. Being able to articulate a vision will foster more of a positive response in the listener, than awareness of evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't to say to everyone to stop trying to
       <em>
        redpill
       </em>
       "your friends and family. More so,that as it becomes increasingly obvious to growing numbers that something is up, its important to temper the desire to immerse ourselves in the theories behind it, with an equal amount of motivation in picturing &amp; presenting alternatives.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The appropriate path to redpilling someone isn't just trying to prove what exists is bad, but showing the gap between what could be and what is. People act with revulsion and motivation to the feeling of being cheated
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We spend so much time in this sub, mired in the means the elites use to maintain control, it's easy to understand why that would form the meat of conversation here. But a more powerful way to use our collective knowledge of what's really happening, is by showing people who aren't aware, how the conspiracies perpetrated against us, stifle our collective potential and stop us from truly achieving more as a peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        That
       </strong>
       , is the biggest conspiracy going and one that would create a greater incentive for change, than the knowledge a system of control exists.

       I've posted this a few times, but it's appropriate here as well. My thoughts? It's their command &amp; control structure. Here are a bunch of things I've compiled.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pedophiles/satanists can be controlled by blackmail. Get each of your minions on video raping and/or murdering a child, and it ensures that when you give an order, it will be carried out...
         <em>
          OR ELSE.
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As a prerequisite initiation, it ensures your minions have no moral quams about carrying out your orders. Kill a family? No problem. Start a war? You got it, boss.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As an initiation, it ensures that no Good Guys will infiltrate your ranks and expose or disrupt the operation. Even IF you or I or some Good Guys grow some balls and want to infiltrate their ranks and get some dirt on them, if first you have to rape and murder a child... well shit I'm out.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's a major perk for evil pedophile satanists. Just do what you're told, and you can rape, torture, and kill all the kiddies you want with zero repercussions. These sociopaths lust for nothing more than power. What is a greater expression of complete domination of another than rape, torture, and murder... of a child?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's so over-the-top evil that even if it's exposed, nobody in the mainstream will believe it. You might as well try to tell people that zombie dolphins from the planet Zoltar have infiltrated the government.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Kills compassion for their fellow humans. If the rapist/torturer had some spark of goodness that might hold them back from executing tasks that most would consider to be pure evil, these rituals help destroy it. The
         <a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/2016/08/09/cremation-of-care-ceremony-at-the-bohemian-grove/">
          Cremation of Care
         </a>
         ceremony comes to mind.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This sounds pretty out there, but folks such as Max Spiers, David Wilcock, and David Icke talk about interdimensional entities feeding on "loosh" or negative energy during these sessions. edit: I added this because I keep seeing it come up. Maybe complete bullshit disinfo, or maybe the most important item here. I have no direct experience in this area.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is a structure as old as Rome.
         <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2lrdqa/til_the_words_fascist_and_faggot_both_derive_from/">
          Both "faggot" and "fascist" derive from the Latin root Fasces.
         </a>
         (Hang with me here.) Faggot refers to the
         <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fasces&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;biw=1212&amp;amp;bih=553&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch">
          bundle of sticks used as a symbol of fascism
         </a>
         . I posit that when people realized the child abuse inherent in the system, it became a slur for the fascists themselves.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I further posit that child rape was no more acceptable in ancient Rome than it is now. This was not a normal relationship in another culture, as it's presented today. When the fascists were caught raping children, they were burned. Stories of these executions have been replaced by stories of burning non-pedophile homosexuals in order to demonize the practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, the term "faggot" has since been linguistically morphed into a pejorative for non-pedophile homosexuals, in an effort to obfuscate
       <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/12/20/very-very-bad-things/">
        the satanic command/control structure of child rape and torture
       </a>
       that's still in place by the global fascists today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fascists are hiding behind homosexuals just as Khazarians hide behind the Jews -- and yes there's overlap -- using them as human shields to absorb blame and deflect suspicion and as political tools where useful.

       I've started taking Icke more seriously these days but wrongly wrote him off as a loon when I was first exposed to him- need to look into more of his videos. As for the rest, the more esoteric aspects of conspiracy theory are the most taxing to research. Not only is there scant definitive evidence to support them like real conspiracies- there's also no
       <em>
        physical
       </em>
       evidence as most involves intangible effects or concepts - spirits, dimensions etc
      </p>
      <p>
       8- I've never came across in any form but from doing the cursory research I've had the time to do with the links provided, it seems as plausible an assertion as any.

       This isn't to say that exposing the existing system isn't important, which it is, and efforts to do so are yielding success as you see more and more people realise what's really going on ...
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the analysis of me, I'm not sure what you're after but you're happy to continue searching my posts &amp; comments. What you'll find is a guy whose into conspiracies as a means to decipher truth in the world around him. 
In addition to that I've also been reading some question sessions from /pol that have profoundly changed the way I think exposing conspiracies should be used to change minds- what you see in examples of my recent posts is attempts to try and share that with like minded
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What this really means is: even when there is a deep-rooted intention to confuse, mislead or otherwise cause harm with speech or actions, you can still oftentimes find useful gems by looking more closely and being resourceful.  Taking those things, we can still use them, while ignoring the rest
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The tone of your reply suggests that I'm practicing some form of psyops? To perhaps dissuade people from looking into conspiracies? If so that couldn't be further from the truth. My intention was to suggest that using knowledge of conspiracies to show people what
       <em>
        could be
       </em>
       will likely foster greater engagement than them just being aware they exist.

       Now that you have a better idea of my intentions,
Is it fair to say you're assessment of what I've written
Is off?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - I think you and the other guy might be reading way too deep into what I've said, trying to figure out nefarious intentions etc
But I guess that's to be expected, it's a lofty bit of prose and this is r/conspiracy after all

       Don't just delete a failed post and resubmit it in an hour. I downvoted this thread for that very reason.

       I didn't plan on deleting it.. I couldn't amend some errors in the body. 
Edit- if you go back to the link you posted  you'll see my surprise that it deleted rather than allow me to edit .. annoying
