        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorry about posting this yet again, but I&#39;ve finally had the time to comment on my former post where I&#39;ve just pasted the links that lead me to a great conclusion. It&#39;s all common sense. You&#39;ll see, if you are hungry for knowledge enough. Anyway, here it goes: </p>

<p>Now, I wonder, if you would have the time and the inclination , for your thoughts on how does your &#39;shit&#39; ties with my &#39;shit&#39; ? I will post a link to my previous post below, and appologize in advance for it&#39;s too much to ask for (all together ~10h of video) ,</p>

<p>but I&#39;ve come to conclusion that we live in a world wrapped in veils. The first one to make us fear is pedophilia, the second one is occultism , and the third one is ufologia. They are all made to make us run away , from the knowledge of evil, and the science on which the world works.</p>

<p>Fear not! - is the conclusion I came to.</p>

<p>Imagine in the ancient times , if one would see such strange thing as Spanish ships coming to a south american shores, what would the natives think ? It&#39;s been said that they couldn&#39;t even comprehend what they were looking at. The same things about flying chariot with angels ... What were those ? Of course, in ancient times this is the only way someone could depict the flying vehicle with strange creatures in it.</p>

<p>But, all this had lead me to a conclusion of immense superstition and invention (meaningful or not) of blood sacrifice , and that the so called &#39;gods&#39; were actually some kind of (various) aliens. Multiple sources state that they&#39;ve been &#39;here forever&#39;. Some good, some bad, looking at us, like in the zoo, intervening when needed.</p>

<p>We are people of science now, these days. We look for a reasonable explanations of things that bewilder us, don&#39;t we?</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s time for us to wake up, to not fear the unknown, to not hide the truth from ourselves, and to look at the world and try to make it better.</p>

<p>Anyways, my own investigation had lead me aaaalll the way to sacred geometry, origins of universe, and atomic and electromagnetic energy, and to Tesla and Einstein.</p>

<p>Please, look into this links I&#39;ve posted, and tell me what you think?</p>

<p>All fuckin&#39; connected!
All about science ..... there&#39;s no so called &#39;evil&#39; that needs to be fed. There are just EVIL PEOPLE , that wants to keep us in the dark.</p>

<p>.
.</p>

<p>EDIT: Well, I connected the dots from those video I linked , chronologically: Mesopotamia, Egypt -&gt; Greek -&gt; Persia , Roman -&gt; monoteistic religions , holy wars -&gt; modern time, political and techno wars - &gt;</p>

<p>... something strange is going on , something reoccuring stuff. </p>

<p>I freely connected those to electromagnetical and atomic power, Tesla was talking a lot about energy sources, I think he was on to something here, as well as Einstein, on to somethnig that was considered sacred in ancient times. They were steps from scientificly explaining the ancient , so called &#39;miracles&#39; . And I believe Tesla was stopped or limited at his research. And he was a believer in god. Which brings us to &#39;why?&#39;. Who benefits from hiding truth about energy sources?</p>

<p>That being said , Tesla&#39;s discoveries were (somewhat) clean energy,  while Einsteins were somewhat dirty energy. Hence the connection to good vs.evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first time you make a post it&#39;s info sharing. The second time it&#39;s attention seeking.</p>

<p>There was no &#39;battle&#39; between Tesla and Einstein...it was just regular scientific debate. Happens all day, everyday where theorists propose a theory and others question it.</p>

<p>The FBI and CIA are only 2 fish in a huge ocean of intelligence agencies. In fact the NSA dwarfs them in size, let alone the agencies that aren&#39;t common knowledge.</p>

<p>I could go on and on but in truth your post is so wide ranging with no clear purpose that it carries no value. Just a bunch of links that you want to share?</p>

<p>The meaning of everything is 42. I don&#39;t need you to tell me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are nitpicking into some of the statements, comrade Trotsky ... I tried to be as simple as possible. Have no need for attention, at first I tried to post things to remember,  that have some value in them (and a lot of dubious things), later came some explanation. English is not my native language, so it&#39;s hard to express my thoughts, without loosing a thread. Don&#39;t look at it as a separate statements, look at it as a whole, and disregard the bombardment of information in some of these videos. Find the simplest meaning and connect them. I&#39;m still looking for a couple of sentences to try to explain what I&#39;ve learned in this.</p>
