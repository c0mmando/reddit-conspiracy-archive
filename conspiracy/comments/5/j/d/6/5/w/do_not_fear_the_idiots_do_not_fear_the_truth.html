       Sorry about posting this yet again, but I've finally had the time to comment on my former post where I've just pasted the links that lead me to a great conclusion. It's all common sense. You'll see, if you are hungry for knowledge enough. Anyway, here it goes:
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I wonder, if you would have the time and the inclination , for your thoughts on how does your 'shit' ties with my 'shit' ? I will post a link to my previous post below, and appologize in advance for it's too much to ask for (all together ~10h of video) ,
      </p>
      <p>
       but I've come to conclusion that we live in a world wrapped in veils. The first one to make us fear is pedophilia, the second one is occultism , and the third one is ufologia. They are all made to make us run away , from the knowledge of evil, and the science on which the world works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear not! - is the conclusion I came to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine in the ancient times , if one would see such strange thing as Spanish ships coming to a south american shores, what would the natives think ? It's been said that they couldn't even comprehend what they were looking at. The same things about flying chariot with angels ... What were those ? Of course, in ancient times this is the only way someone could depict the flying vehicle with strange creatures in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, all this had lead me to a conclusion of immense superstition and invention (meaningful or not) of blood sacrifice , and that the so called 'gods' were actually some kind of (various) aliens. Multiple sources state that they've been 'here forever'. Some good, some bad, looking at us, like in the zoo, intervening when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are people of science now, these days. We look for a reasonable explanations of things that bewilder us, don't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's time for us to wake up, to not fear the unknown, to not hide the truth from ourselves, and to look at the world and try to make it better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, my own investigation had lead me aaaalll the way to sacred geometry, origins of universe, and atomic and electromagnetic energy, and to Tesla and Einstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, look into this links I've posted, and tell me what you think?

All about science ..... there's no so called 'evil' that needs to be fed. There are just EVIL PEOPLE , that wants to keep us in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Well, I connected the dots from those video I linked , chronologically: Mesopotamia, Egypt -&gt; Greek -&gt; Persia , Roman -&gt; monoteistic religions , holy wars -&gt; modern time, political and techno wars - &gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       ... something strange is going on , something reoccuring stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I freely connected those to electromagnetical and atomic power, Tesla was talking a lot about energy sources, I think he was on to something here, as well as Einstein, on to somethnig that was considered sacred in ancient times. They were steps from scientificly explaining the ancient , so called 'miracles' . And I believe Tesla was stopped or limited at his research. And he was a believer in god. Which brings us to 'why?'. Who benefits from hiding truth about energy sources?
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said , Tesla's discoveries were (somewhat) clean energy,  while Einsteins were somewhat dirty energy. Hence the connection to good vs.evil.

       “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”  ― Frank Herbert

       The first time you make a post it's info sharing. The second time it's attention seeking.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no 'battle' between Tesla and Einstein...it was just regular scientific debate. Happens all day, everyday where theorists propose a theory and others question it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI and CIA are only 2 fish in a huge ocean of intelligence agencies. In fact the NSA dwarfs them in size, let alone the agencies that aren't common knowledge.
      </p>

       I could go on and on but in truth your post is so wide ranging with no clear purpose that it carries no value. Just a bunch of links that you want to share?

       The scientific battle is huge: GR is pushing the theory of an empty, closed-system universe. For over a hundred years, we've been obsessed with this useless model to avoid free energy, spiritual connections, and a greater meaning to life.

       You are nitpicking into some of the statements, comrade Trotsky ... I tried to be as simple as possible. Have no need for attention, at first I tried to post things to remember,  that have some value in them (and a lot of dubious things), later came some explanation. English is not my native language, so it's hard to express my thoughts, without loosing a thread. Don't look at it as a separate statements, look at it as a whole, and disregard the bombardment of information in some of these videos. Find the simplest meaning and connect them. I'm still looking for a couple of sentences to try to explain what I've learned in this.
