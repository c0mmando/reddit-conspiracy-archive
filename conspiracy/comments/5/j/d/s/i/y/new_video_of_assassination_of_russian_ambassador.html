       Because he wasn't a Syrian victim, he was a Turkish police officer from what is basically the SWAT division. He was on forced leave after the coup earlier this year. This seems like a prime asset for foreign intelligence -- whether or not it was CIA I have no idea.

       He was very nervous, as seen in his bodily language. I believe he was just nail biting. Or he was taking a suicide pill. I have no idea if the man is alive or dead so that is just speculation

       They immediately labelled it a terrorist attack (or am I wrong?)... despite the fact that it looks NOTHING like one with the exception of the allahakbar yelling which is so cliche... come on. This has CIA written all over it.

       the kgb was dissolved 1991 ... probably not them. Since 1991 it has been the Слу́жба вне́шней разве́дки or SVR for westerners. Or the closer successor since 1995:  Федеральная служба безопасности Российской Федерации or FSB for us.

       I'll ignore your childish comment. You ask "why is it surprising that a Syrian would assassinate an enemy ambassador". Your statement is inaccurate on its face, as Russia is not an enemy to Syria. Therefore the Russian ambassador cannot be labelled an enemy ambassador to Syria. The particular Syrian (if in fact he is) that carried out the assassination is not representative of the Syrian nation since Syria and Russia are politically allied. What
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       surprising is that a person like that could get so close to that situation. This 'Syrian' is in actuality an enemy to his country.

       He is syrian whether he's for a coup de ta or what doesnt matter. Russia has many syrian enemies although they may support the syrian state.

       Amazing.  Very calm one moment, standing like USSS with hands on navel, then that last 30 seconds twitchy like a kid that needs to pee.
I am going to see if there is a higher resolution vid of this moment, as it would be interesting to watch the killer's face as the moment builds up.

       My condolences to Russia and the family of this Ambassador.

       The way he yelled snackbar snackbar made me chuckle, it was like he wanted us to believe he was a muslim, the whole thing felt forced.

       Israhell is always in mood for a good war, and seeing the increasing support for Russia and decreasing support for us/israhell it would make sense that they want to conduct a false flag at this time trying to force Russia into a conflict.

       He seemed like a professional not a radical.

       I don't know how easy it is to get a job as a security guard for an ambassador but I bet mossad could get you that job, I don't think al snackbar could get you that job.

       Screaming "Don't forget Aleppo" while killing a Russian government employee is to push the western propaganda that Russia is enemies of Syria and the mercenaries trying to overthrow the legitimate government is actually 'the good guys'

       Syria and Russia are friends, this is trying to make a split between them. Divide and Conquer.

       Question though. If Turkey just had a violent coup attempt, and is very very antagonistic towards Russia, then WHERE THE F*CK were the guards for the Ambassador? I mean they (the Turkish guards) apparently "knew" the cop so let him in.(Which is suspicious enough anyway...) But how and why did this Ambassador not have heavy Russian personal security considering recent events?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's Mossad. I think its Russia. That's my gut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially considering another diplomat in Russia was found dead the same day, in his home. (Perhaps retaliatory by some other agency? Who knows...)
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin was "taking care of business" in some way. And killed two birds with one stone. Think geopolitically, how it is to his advantage to further demonize/destabilize Turkey (Turkey is an asshole enough anyway but digress.)

       Its not NSFL no one died.  All those cameras no footage of the russian bear getting shot, no blood, he "dies" immediately with his arms out and never moved a muscle.  Then all of the high res action shots and the guy on the tripod remaining and panning left to reveal the shooter.

       But he was allegedly on suspension resulting from participation in the Fethullah Gulen "coup."  That's a pretty high-level security gig to get, especially for someone who may have been involved in a plan to topple the Turkish government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are the Russians getting sloppy/lazy when doing background checks on security for ambassadors?  Is the story of the gunman being a Gulenist b.s.?  More questions that answers.  When it comes to who the gunman really is, none of this shit makes any sense.  Stinks to high hell.

       As usual the camera looks away from the event as soon as anything starts to happen so we don't see the man that was supposedly shot fall to the floor. As he's an old man, I'm sure it took him a moment to put himself into position.

       Never take your eyes off the ball lol but I always found it crazy how people just dart in a straight fucking line away.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are really shit at shooting. Cops manage like 1 hit a mag, because they all train on stationary targets or rigid movement and use handguns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Training for conflict regions has people moving like a game of dodgeball. You running away in a straight line is as good as you standing still as the shooter can keep their eye and sights moving together. It doesn't work when moving unpredictably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think in WW1 they chose rifles and bayonets when we'd had revolvers for a long time. Rifles lock your eyes and sights by connecting it to your torso with the shoulder stock, and the longer barrel means a truer shot. Take a 4ft straight edge (level or something) and a pop straw and try and point them at something 100 yards away. If you traced the line almost any idiot could get the 4ft within inches of the target, but the straw being 1/32nd of an inch out of line would have a miss by yards.
      </p>
      <p>
       The faster firing the weapon the more spray and pray it is. Weapons like the P90 empty 50 rounds in 3 seconds as they're hip fire full auto. It's a personal defense weapon designed for like a humvee or truck driver if they get ambushed. Spray, pray, and run.
      </p>
      <p>
       So learn to run half spasticated, it could save your life if the world goes to shit like we all half expect.

       I don't know what that guy thinks he knows about shooting. I can shoot. If I start shooting at something with a pistol, in a fifty yard radius, there's about to be something with a whole bunch of holes in it.

       If you are the one that's violent, and everyone else is just an observer, there ain't nothing stopping you. A human body is a big target at seven yards, which is inside just about any room ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know how to shoot, it isn't even a fucken exercise. You don't even have to aim. You just point, and yank the trigger.

       Proclaiming otherwise is dumber than dumb.

       EDIT: that guy was supposedly special forces trained. He had rigid trigger discipline, and clearly was trained, with his squared stance, correct two hand stance, and just business like execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       That trigger discipline...that's gross motor memory. Equals training. That was a fairly dangerous man.

      <p>
       This assassin had pretty good training, with trigger and muzzle discipline like he displayed. I don't think he ever even covered the AP photographer.

       I'm doing my best to stay ahead of a few other things lately, and I have lost some perspective on Syria as of late. I'm not sure yet who could have set this guy in motion.

       His name has Jewish heritage. Photos of his mother and sister show them without any kind of hijab. IMO muslims cherrypick their faith anyway, but very very little about this guy really says "radical islamist" to me. Could be mossad, putin, turkey... I just can't yet even discern motive yet.

       I think they say he was 22 years old. I doubt that. More like thirty.

       that trigger discipline.... I can't stop thinking about that.
 I'm twice his age, and been shooting competitively for twenty years. I was a certified range officer at 11. I have trigger discipline, twenty years of it. I still catch myself, once in a while, with a timer going, riding the trigger when I know I shouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's twenty two years old, kills an ambassador, but has that discipline, in the face of oncoming assailants? My finger would've been all up on that trigger.

       There was a comedy years ago, can't remember which, but the 2 dumb actors thought they were going to get shot so one yelled "serpentine!" And they started running in spastic directions.  The killer didn't kill them simply because he was shocked at the sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think your premise might be right at distance with a sniper.  Versus running away from one, random movements seem possible to increase survivability if there are multiple targets.  But figure a shooter like this guy in a small room and his obvious training would kill whomever he wants.

       lmao fake as fuck. Noone in that room would have a mobile phone camera that shit and if they did - they would not bother to record anything on that camera. As usual the cameras at these fake terrorist scenes are incredibly retro - even at an exclusive event like this. Factoring in this and everything else, like how he managed to fall on the ground face up with arms spread - It's a hoax guys - 100 percent, another manipulation of the masses by the powers that be.

       did you even look at the video?? its moving and swaying and in no way stable that would suggest a tripod. what about that tells you it looks like its on a tripod? It looks more like a phone on a selfie stick being held up, considering the camera runs away with the person holding it...

       The camera from the front that was aimed at the podium, in wide angle mode, where you can see the shooter move back and forth and take up his position at the side and back of the ambassador, was on a tripod. It was zoomed in and out and jostled out of its original position immediately upon shots being fired, but remains steady otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must have seen another video. I saw another video where the camera is zoomed in closer up (head and shoulders) on the ambassador and was apparently handheld.

       yeah and then try to upload it to a video hosting site over shitty cellular and let me know how the quality ends up. Ever heard of compression?
