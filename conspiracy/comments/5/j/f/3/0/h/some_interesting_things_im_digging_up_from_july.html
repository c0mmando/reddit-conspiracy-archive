<p><a href="https://yuki.la/pol/81476689">https://yuki.la/pol/81476689</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Insider Anon is explaining how the elite want to destroy the well of White family (ie upper middle class) because they consider them them the &quot;opposition&quot;. A member asked why they are the opposition and the answer is given below:</li>
</ol>

<p>Independent agents are the only real source of opposition. To develop in this way, you need a high level of education, leisure time to contemplate and grow, capital to protect yourself and spread your message, and so on.</p>

<p>These types of traits can only emerge from a relatively well off economic household.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Basically, a family that is living in relative peace with a great income is considered a threat to the elite because they have time to think, grow, and progress towards a brighter future. White people are targeted specifically because the elite already ruined most of the other ethnicity for the most part financially. </p>

<ol>
<li>The post below says they want to maintain a state of a struggling economy without allowing any room for improvement but sustaining it just enough to keep the world spinning. They can&#39;t totally destroy it because then it can backlash on them. Remember, they have total control of the economy and can improve it drastically at will:</li>
</ol>

<p>We&#39;re headed into another major financial crisis and reordering of global markets as well as a shift in geopolitical strategy of the US. Confidence is the financial system is collapsing and the regime is struggling to hold it together without allowing a sustained period of growth.</p>

<p>Consensus is growing around the idea of a fairly deep global depression with only moderate impact on the US economy. Russia and China are to be weakened significantly and a lot of petro capacity knocked offline in the ME.</p>

<ol>
<li>On Alex Jones:</li>
</ol>

<p>Alex Jones started off as controlled opposition to dumb down alternative media. He&#39;s grown into a person who is aware that the system he was serving is dangerously flawed, but still isn&#39;t allowed to say much worthwhile.</p>

<ol>
<li>The elite control terrorism and use it as a weapon. There is no threat because they maneuver the terrorists as they please so no surprises:</li>
</ol>

<p>radical Islam is very much under control and the terrorist threat is mostly a bogeyman</p>

<p>The idea of terrorism justifies foreign wars for control as well as domestic police state. Both are very important to the methodologies of control currently used. It&#39;s particularly useful in the sense that you can&#39;t defeat a tactic, so the war on terror cannot be won. In this way, it is highly demoralizing to the population.</p>

<ol>
<li>FBI Anon says that the elite don&#39;t have a powerful grasp on America:</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea that they have America by the balls simply isn&#39;t true. They&#39;ve had to kill presidents to keep control and there is a lot of blowback from this. Belief in a conspiracy surrounding JFK&#39;s assassination is almost universal, and these sorts of ideas are very crippling to the illusion of the cattle being free range.</p>

<ol>
<li>On suppressing consciousness:</li>
</ol>

<p>The emergence of consciousness is a very scary thing to many. Life on autopilot has its advantages.</p>

<ol>
<li>Claims of Snowden being CIA and:</li>
</ol>

<p>People started using the NSA as a source of blackmail against others within the regime, so it was knocked down a few notches by Snowden&#39;s operation. Also an opportunity to spread some disinformation along the lines of RSA is secure, all you have to do to defeat the NSA is download tor browser.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A book recommendation : origins of consciousness</p></li>
<li><p>What is our level of consciousness?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Infancy</p>

<ol>
<li> welfare:</li>
</ol>

<p>You need robust economic growth that organically drives a &quot;minimum&quot; wage higher. It should always be more advantageous to work than be on welfare, but that often isn&#39;t the case today and this is intentional. The government wants a dependent class not just as a reliable base of support but as an attacking prong on the middle class.</p>

<ol>
<li>On Bill Gates foundation:</li>
</ol>

<p>Gates foundation is far from benign. One of the more significant functions is to attract innovators and remove them from the public sphere / recruit them into the regime, but you also have significant eugenics projects in terms of R&amp;D and actual population control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree on the economy point. </p>

<p>They dangle the fear of an economic collapse in our face almost everyday, but what would happen if they truly did that?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t control the world of a country, if everyone is fucked. There would be lawlessness and you can&#39;t control that. You need to give people just enough to survive, but not enough to grow. That way they keep their heads down just to make it through. </p>
