      <ol>
       <li>
        Insider Anon is explaining how the elite want to destroy the well of White family (ie upper middle class) because they consider them them the "opposition". A member asked why they are the opposition and the answer is given below:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Independent agents are the only real source of opposition. To develop in this way, you need a high level of education, leisure time to contemplate and grow, capital to protect yourself and spread your message, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       These types of traits can only emerge from a relatively well off economic household.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Basically, a family that is living in relative peace with a great income is considered a threat to the elite because they have time to think, grow, and progress towards a brighter future. White people are targeted specifically because the elite already ruined most of the other ethnicity for the most part financially.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The post below says they want to maintain a state of a struggling economy without allowing any room for improvement but sustaining it just enough to keep the world spinning. They can't totally destroy it because then it can backlash on them. Remember, they have total control of the economy and can improve it drastically at will:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       We're headed into another major financial crisis and reordering of global markets as well as a shift in geopolitical strategy of the US. Confidence is the financial system is collapsing and the regime is struggling to hold it together without allowing a sustained period of growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consensus is growing around the idea of a fairly deep global depression with only moderate impact on the US economy. Russia and China are to be weakened significantly and a lot of petro capacity knocked offline in the ME.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        On Alex Jones:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Alex Jones started off as controlled opposition to dumb down alternative media. He's grown into a person who is aware that the system he was serving is dangerously flawed, but still isn't allowed to say much worthwhile.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The elite control terrorism and use it as a weapon. There is no threat because they maneuver the terrorists as they please so no surprises:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       radical Islam is very much under control and the terrorist threat is mostly a bogeyman
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of terrorism justifies foreign wars for control as well as domestic police state. Both are very important to the methodologies of control currently used. It's particularly useful in the sense that you can't defeat a tactic, so the war on terror cannot be won. In this way, it is highly demoralizing to the population.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        FBI Anon says that the elite don't have a powerful grasp on America:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The idea that they have America by the balls simply isn't true. They've had to kill presidents to keep control and there is a lot of blowback from this. Belief in a conspiracy surrounding JFK's assassination is almost universal, and these sorts of ideas are very crippling to the illusion of the cattle being free range.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        On suppressing consciousness:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The emergence of consciousness is a very scary thing to many. Life on autopilot has its advantages.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Claims of Snowden being CIA and:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       People started using the NSA as a source of blackmail against others within the regime, so it was knocked down a few notches by Snowden's operation. Also an opportunity to spread some disinformation along the lines of RSA is secure, all you have to do to defeat the NSA is download tor browser.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         A book recommendation : origins of consciousness
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What is our level of consciousness?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Infancy
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        welfare:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       You need robust economic growth that organically drives a "minimum" wage higher. It should always be more advantageous to work than be on welfare, but that often isn't the case today and this is intentional. The government wants a dependent class not just as a reliable base of support but as an attacking prong on the middle class.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        On Bill Gates foundation:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Gates foundation is far from benign. One of the more significant functions is to attract innovators and remove them from the public sphere / recruit them into the regime, but you also have significant eugenics projects in terms of R&amp;D and actual population control.

       I realize you're doing this on your own time and greatly appreciate it.  Is there any chance you could analyze what this person said in July that has come to fruition? I think that would help with determining authenticity.

       I completely agree on the economy point.
      </p>
      <p>
       They dangle the fear of an economic collapse in our face almost everyday, but what would happen if they truly did that?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't control the world of a country, if everyone is fucked. There would be lawlessness and you can't control that. You need to give people just enough to survive, but not enough to grow. That way they keep their heads down just to make it through.
