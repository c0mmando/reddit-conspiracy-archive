        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, former President Truman, who created the CIA, later said the following:     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never had any thought that when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations. … I, therefore, would like to see the CIA be restored to its original assignment as the intelligence arm of the president … and that its operational duties be terminated or properly used elsewhere.”    </p>

<p>Now:      </p>

<p>JFK wanted to destroy the CIA. He said he would <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/02/22/in-1974-call-to-abolish-cia-sanders-followed-in-footsteps-of-jfk-truman/">&quot;splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces.&quot;</a>     </p>

<p>JFK was assassinated        </p>

<p>Bernie Sanders <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/02/22/in-1974-call-to-abolish-cia-sanders-followed-in-footsteps-of-jfk-truman/">supported JFK&#39;s goal of destroying the CIA.</a>       </p>

<p>Bernie was the victim of the largest election subversion scheme against a presidential candidate by their own party in US history, being <a href="https://medium.com/@tonybrasunas/the-great-recognition-of-2016-nixon-level-corruption-in-the-dnc-means-its-time-to-build-a-new-29cb9dd83001">compared to the Nixon administrations corruption that ended with his resignation before he could be impeached</a>           </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IwPSv-ALeI">&#39;The CIA and Hillary Clinton&#39;s #1 foreign policy objective was to create and escalate the proxy war with Russia in Syria and remove Assad&#39;</a>          </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IwPSv-ALeI">&quot;The American intelligence communitie&#39;s most valuable instrument is the US media [...] much of which serves hidden intelligence officials&quot;</a>          </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IwPSv-ALeI">&#39;The CIA sided with Hillary Clinton during the election, while the FBI sided with Trump. The CIA viewed Trump as a threat to their agenda and institution&quot;</a>                 </p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/11/the-deep-state-goes-to-war-with-president-elect-using-unverified-claims-as-dems-cheer/">After the election, when the CIA performed a media hatchet job on Trump shortly after his election victory (the intelligence agencies are notorious for doing things like this, it happened numerous times during the Bush Administration).</a> Which then prompted Trump to make <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/01/21/donald-trump-visits-cia-langley-respect-intelligence-community-pompeo-director">the CIA his first stop after the inauguration, to show his belly and let them know he wasn&#39;t a threat to them, saying &quot;there is no one he respects more.&quot;</a>.       </p>

<p>Eisenhowever, when leaving office, said the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y06NSBBRtY">greatest threat to democracy is this military, industrial group of unelected officials who hold increasingly dangerous amounts of power in America.</a>           </p>

<p>Now: <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/04/14/in-undisclosed-cia-investments-social-media-mining-looms-large/">It has been discovered that the CIA failed to disclose that lately they have been investing in Orwellian technology that collects data about you</a> in a similar way to the way China has started their <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2990203/security/aclu-orwellian-citizen-score-chinas-credit-score-system-is-a-warning-for-americans.html">Orwellian program of data collection of every citizen.</a>         </p>
