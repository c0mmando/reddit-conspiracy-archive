       I accidentally started browsing

       and noticed the overall energy and feel to it is completely different than most days.

       It just feels more real than usual. No shill influenced Trump hate that is blatant. It's usually overwhelming. Now the Trump critique seems to be at a normal level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there are joke memes being upvoted that shills would usually never allow on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       . For example, the top post on
       <a href="/r/ImGoingToHellForThis">
        /r/ImGoingToHellForThis
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not flooded with
       <a href="/r/EnoughTrumpSpam">
        /r/EnoughTrumpSpam
       </a>
       or anything similar. It's unreal. It hasn't felt this real in a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has happened before. Every now and then the shills and CTR (or whatever it's called) leave. When that happens it is so obvious they're gone. Now is one of those times.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should all enjoy this moment.

       David Brock and Soros are still doing their thing.. just because it's not blatantly obvious anymore just means they're finally smarting up the the fact that their tactics were not convincing in the first place.

       There is definitely something screwy. Enoughtrumpspam has gone from 10,000+ likes a post to less than 500. I feel happy now. Maybe I won't be forced to confront my Reddit addiction.

       I noticed this (all over the net) after the election didn't go to Clinton. Things went quiet, then they came back like a storm. Something's happening that they didn't expect and they're regrouping, waiting for the new talking points. Or funding ran out again. Give it a day or two and it'll probably be back to being controlled.

       Yes, this has happened before. When CTR and the shills leave it makes it so obvious they exist. That there is a force of paid people or bots that come on Reddit to aggressively push a narrative. Mostly against Trump and the Alt Right. For example, right now there are a healthy number of anti Trump posts. That's normal and healthy. He should be open to critique. However, when the shills come back it's absolutely horrendous how they destroy Reddit. Downvoting everything that triggers them and upvoting insane amounts of anti Trump propaganda. They make it blatantly obvious they exist.

       This is 100% what's going on if they go dark for a brief window. I noticed it happening multiple times during the election when news broke during the day and CTR would be completely silent about it until the next day.

       I'll believe it when I hear it from the FBI/DOJ... hell... I'd even get optimistic if I heard it from the MSM... but only Fox seems to call out Soros and American Bridge on occasion from what I've seen. I'll stay vigilant, but positive.

       I'm not defending him, but that would be on top of everything right now. 10 or 12 subs on the r/all page. It hasn't been this quiet since Hillary Clinton went down on 9/11.

       I first want to post a disclaimer to remind myself that I'm posting this on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       .

       So, Reddit really does look normal right now. It looks like how I remembered it before the election. It looks cleaned up. It looks like CTR/Shareblue evacuated. The conversations I'm reading in the comments, whether pro or anti Trump, seem less inflammatory and look like conversations between real people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I ask myself, what major breaking event is correlating to this right now?
      </p>
      <p>
       The resignation of General Flynn.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then I ask myself, How could General Flynns resignation be related to an online social media campaign halting it's presence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh....my.... god....
      </p>
      <p>
       Flynn not only REALLY IS a Russian Plant.... but the rumors of Russian social media influence campaigns are REAL..... but everyone assumed Russia was shilling for Trump. No.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CTR Anti-Trump agenda that has completely co-opted Reddit for the past 12 months IS FUCKING RUSSIAN. They are fucking GHOSTED now that Flynn is resigning, they think they might be caught and are running for the fucking hills right now.

       Hmm. Possibly.. I mean the only Russians that seem to be shilling for Trump are Putin and the Russian citizens..
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that assuming the entirety of the Russian government is on the same page is like saying the US government agrees on everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin, like Trump, is constantly attacked by the elite in his country. Why? Because the elites are the ones pushing the NWO bullshit. They're both fighting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this could make sense. Putin hates Soros but, that doesn't mean that the Russian agencies hate Soros.

       Well, r/all is now spammed with multiple threads about Michael Flynn resigning and arbitrarily calling for Trump's impeachment. And don't get me wrong, what Flynn did was wrong and Trump is worthy of serious criticism too (even though he's NOT a Russian spy like the shills like to imply), but it's still clear that there's artificial vote manipulation going on and that's not cool.
