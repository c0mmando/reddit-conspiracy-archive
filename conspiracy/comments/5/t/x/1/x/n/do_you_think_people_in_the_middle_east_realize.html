Its too complicated and too difficult to try to figure who the good and bad people are - rest assured, i believe most people worldwide are all very similar; but we are all so disconnected and we have govts and media turning us on one another.  I feel bad for people living in war torn areas or people living under ruthless regimes - i realize I have a sugarcoated view of the world, but there has got to be a way for us to live on this planet without torturing eachother or squabbling over resources; theres clearly enough for everyone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah many people in the states blindly support Zionism. I actually had many discussions about this with friends, even coworkers. They are taught to support Zionist Israel in their churches. I also have Jewish friends that oppose Zionism. Keeping this simple as there is too much to discuss. Middle Easterners are aware that when we discuss Israel&#39;s Zionism we also have to discuss KSA&#39;s Wahhabism. They both share similar ideologies. Its not a coincidence that America&#39;s allies in the Middle East are both Israeli and Saudi. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just like here. Some people are clued in, a couple know a lot, some have no idea at all and most just don&#39;t care and deal with what is right in front of them and enjoy what they can with what and who they can.</p>

<p>I got some hate for being an American, but if you actually try to learn their language, you immediately break the stereotype.</p>

<p>Politics and ideas are one thing. Dealing with a living, breathing, smiling human right in front of you is something entirely different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. I shouldn&#39;t laugh but I get why he was scared. It&#39;s only because in America, when you are Middle Eastern, you sadly have to be skeptical engaging in politics in certain situations. There are informants everywhere. I even know a couple of my own (Middle Eastern) that work for the Feds. I also know a couple of guys that got screwed over by the Feds for speaking truth. It&#39;s all bizarre. </p>

<p>It can be fought against, of course, but one has to do extra mental work to <em>not</em> think what the mind will generally knee jerk toward as per what the MSM constantly blurts out to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh I&#39;m from the middle east, west bank (Palestine) to be precise, I lived there for 23 years and I have traveled around Jordan and working in Saudi arabia for 4 years now. </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t care and just want to live their lives, especially countries around the Persian gulf. Most Saudis for example just care about shopping/iPhones/Cars/traveling around the world. When they know that I&#39;m a Palestinian they will just give me few words of support that means nothing.</p>

<p>West bank is a different story, everyone hates Israel which is the result of years of oppressing and injustice and most Arabs will tell you Israel controls america&#39;s government. </p>

<p>Now for the American people, It depends but even some Palestinians understand that not all Israeli citizens are bad, same with the Americans. Many would actually love to travel to America or Europe and work there. Living in the middle east and in the west bank is not easy, high prices, low pay, too many restrictions, and the fortunate people would travel around the world to find work (Some go to Europe/USA/Canada/Australia/KSA/Dubai etc) Most of my university friends are abroad.</p>

<p>For me personally especially having american friends and going online to many sites like reddit, I have seen many different sides, just one trip to the donald and you will realize how most people are ignorant over there about the middle east, I didn&#39;t realize we are beheading people and hitting our women 24/7. So yea you will keep reading hateful comments all the time which is sadly something I got used to it. </p>
