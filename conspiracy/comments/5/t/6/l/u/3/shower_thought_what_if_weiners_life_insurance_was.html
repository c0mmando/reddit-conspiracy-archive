       The file would contain incriminating evidence against everyone in the "club" on both sides of the aisle. Videos, etc. The file would be expanded with each new initiation. Clinton would be in there, but not as the focus of the file. This file would have nothing to do with HRC's missing emails.

       I like this idea since they were Huma's files not Weiner's. Huma knows everything. So if she saw enough she may have created that folder - Hillary does have a lot of deaths linked to her. Funny how after everything Huma helping Weiner?  A cover for her helping the FBI?

       I suspect Weiner's laptop is what might be leading to a lot of the recent arrests we've seen. Now that he's charged with CP I think they are pulling email addresses and connections from his laptop and that's the leads police are using to break up the rings since last fall.

       Did you read the actual article? It clearly states he hasn't been charged. I believe he will be charged with something and likely earn himself record but it hasn't happened yet. It could happen right now but you are saying things that are not true when you wrote them.

       You doubled down. I asked the question and you responded with some BS. I see this all the time in this sub, something that is not true or held up with flimsy evidence accepted as fact. I guess that's why it's r/conspiracy and not r/fact.

       Your original post said he had been charged, your response was a like to an article saying he had not been charged as a counter point. That my friend is doubling down. Don't let facts get in the way of your little circlepizzajerk.

       I'm assuming you actually read what I wrote when I linked the article right? Like the bit when I said
       <em>
        "but stories from Jan 31 were the only recent ones I found"
       </em>
       .... as in I didn't find anything to confirm?

      <p>
       Or that time I said

        " I may have made a mistake."

       ?

       I think this is a great thought. I mean why else call it insurance but let's go further. What if not only it was insurance on others but it being his laptop he had insurance on all trying to protect (and save grace) for his wife as well?
