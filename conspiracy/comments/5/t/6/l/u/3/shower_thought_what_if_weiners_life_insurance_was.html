    <div class="md"><p>I like this idea since they were Huma&#39;s files not Weiner&#39;s. Huma knows everything. So if she saw enough she may have created that folder - Hillary does have a lot of deaths linked to her. Funny how after everything Huma helping Weiner?  A cover for her helping the FBI?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect Weiner&#39;s laptop is what might be leading to a lot of the recent arrests we&#39;ve seen. Now that he&#39;s charged with CP I think they are pulling email addresses and connections from his laptop and that&#39;s the leads police are using to break up the rings since last fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming you actually read what I wrote when I linked the article right? Like the bit when I said <em>&quot;but stories from Jan 31 were the only recent ones I found&quot;</em>.... as in I didn&#39;t find anything to confirm?</p>

<p>Or that time I said <em>&quot; I may have made a mistake.&quot;</em>?</p>

<p>Or that time I edited the incorrect statement?</p>
