    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you are just naive, but even the most skeptical of us wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Trump will do nothing about the high level pedophilia in government&quot; as if it&#39;s fact, when clearly it&#39;s your opinion, which seems to be based off of a misunderstood connection to Epstein. I would agree with you if that connection was as obviously nefarious as Bill Clinton&#39;s, but it&#39;s widely known that Trump would leave Epstein&#39;s parties early, before the &quot;after party&quot;. Trump is the billionaire businessman who is &quot;friends&quot; with everyone to keep people happy. I always remain skeptical, but it sure seems like Trump is a good guy and on the right side of this mess. That or he is the best con-artist the world has ever known, and I really don&#39;t think he has the mental capability that would require. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s too bad so many have fallen for the narrative of Trumps pedophilia. A handful of stories with no evidence, a (possible) trip to Epstein&#39;s island <em>(he doesn&#39;t appear on any of the available flight logs - but that doesn&#39;t preclude his own plane or boat)</em> and a court case that&#39;s failed 3 times because the claimant keeps backing out and saying it didn&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>People ignore his voluntary testimony on behalf of one of Epsteins victims (an insane act if he is indeed guilty), his barring of Epstein from a club, and the numerous communications where he&#39;s indicated a strong drive against pedophilia (tweets, speeches, cabinet nominations). </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget he also has kids of his own. Any father with children will empathize with victims of abuse, and feel outrage at the perpetrators.  </p>

<p>So many people hate Trump with such a passion that they can&#39;t allow themselves a moment of optimism. A temporary glimmer of hope that maybe.... <em>maybe</em> he might do something about the epidemic. Instead they are so consumed with MSM fueled outrage that they would rather work against the possibility of justice than support what may be one of the most just legal movements since civil rights.  </p>

<p>We would have been fucked under Clinton, and Sanders has shown himself as a total Clinton sell out. Same with Jill Stein (I hope she is spending the $9 million well). Johnson was simply too weak of a candidate to make a 3rd party option viable. We get left with Trump who at least has indicated he gives a fuck.  </p>

<p>So for me, I&#39;m willing to give him a chance. Maybe he will fuck it all up, and maybe I&#39;m going to look like a total fuckin idiot for hoping, but if there is even a 5% chance he might move on all these sick fucks it&#39;s still a better chance than we had with the others. </p>

*internet phones are also controlled assets. Easy to tap sans encryption. Encrypted radio is more secure.<br/>

<p>Yes encryption is a math problem. But so is the rest of reality. Math is the universal language of course encryption is a math problem. </p>

<p>So say you have a large amount of money spread out through hundreds of thousands of accounts mixed in with just as many banks. With this program I will be able to follow the real path of every single bank transaction no matter where </p>

<p>Add this quantum computers....oh that is right our government already has one...</p>

<ul>
<li>And a side note if this program can predict your choices 100% accurately. Do you still have free will? There&#39;s a show on Netflix called frequencies ending of the movie the dude had a program that show the universe as it was happening. This is the concept of the new age of technology </li>

<p>Not necessarily. Note the number of cases where parents willingly let sick fucks engage with their kids or even allow &#39;grooming&#39; in exchange for favour to their own status. I too would love to think that a parents protective instinct would prevent these types of thoughs and actions, but unfortunately many times that just isn&#39;t the case :(</p>

<p>Don&#39;t discount him yet. St least give him 100 days. </p>
