Then using the anger against the Judiciary branch to scrap our judicial system and declare martial law?!! Haha, it&#39;s a bit of liberal fantasy/nightmare, but I can&#39;t dismiss it out of hand. The EO was either totally incompetent how it was written or it was designed to fail.  I think that&#39;s fair to say...</p>

<p>What if the ban was overturned so that Muslims could be rounded up like what happened to the Japanese courtesy of the executive order of 2-19-1942.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Trump has the capacity in any sense of the word to plan a false flag in his first two active weeks. I think the ban was purely a move to pander to his supporters without regard to how impractical and badly designed it was. Only in that sense was it &quot;designed&quot; to be overturned. I can however see the CIA capitalizing on this opportunity because they probably have multiple false flags on the backburner at any given time. 2 cents.</p>

<p>This is why it would work so well if it happened though.  Not saying it would happen, just toying with ideas here.</p>

<p>I mean, did GWB have enough gumption on his own to pull off that false flag in 9 months?  (you know, if 9/11 was indeed a false flag).</p>

<p>It sure did hide the tech bubble burst, though, didn&#39;t it?  We have a lot of bubbles about to burst.</p>

But it forces them to come to the table. If they don&#39;t, he&#39;ll build it and send them the bill. If they don&#39;t pay, he&#39;ll find another way to leverage it.</p>

<p>But as some kind of Republican monument against immigration? Give me a break. Fuck all does a wall have to do with anything? Trump knows this. It&#39;s just his way of telling Mexico he&#39;s going to be bullheaded about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The purpose of the ban is to force the hand of Congressional Democrats.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a knife to their neck to confirm Gorsuch. </p>

<p>If Democrats truly believe that the Travel Ban Executive Order is unconstitutional, then their best interests is to confirm Gorsuch without obstruction, let it play out in court, and hope they win.</p>

<p>The alternative; Obstruction under these conditions is a Trump that is under pressure and a short time frame - Trump will have Congressional Republicans use the nuclear option without hesitation.</p>

<p>If the Democrats obstruct, then Republicans use the nuclear option, nominate Gorsuch, and then the Supreme Court upholds Trumps Executive Order on the immigration ban. Democrats lose on 3 separate fronts simultaneously.</p>

<p>The outcome of this specific Executive Order is moot in Trump&#39;s eyes. If it gets shot down, he writes a new EO explicitly excluding green card holders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals used to have the reputation as being the most overturned Federal Court in America. Based out of San Francisco, they typically have a faaaaar more leftist interpretation of the Constitution than most. </p>

<p>Of the 9th Circuit Courts Rulings that are heard by the Supreme Court, 8 out of 10 (80%) of their rulings are overturned. Not saying that 80% of <strong>ALL</strong> 9th Circuit Rulings are overturned. Just 80% of all that are challenged and heard by Supreme Court. Not a good record of Jurisprudence! The Washington Judge Involved and the 9th Circuit have along history of Judicial Activism (instead of Constitutional Interpretation as they should have).</p>

<p>Based on Title2 of the US Constitution, the President has the authority to ban (either temporarily or permanently) the people from <strong>ANY</strong> country or countries, if he deems it in the best interests of the United States. What the local and 9th Circuits did was UNCONSTITUTIONAL. No person who is not a citizen of the United States has a <em>RIGHT</em>* to enter this country. In 1979, when the Iranian Revolution occurred. President Carter immediately revokes ALL Visas of anybody from Iran (students were told to get out immediately), and stops anybody from Iran entering the United States. </p>

<p>Neither a local nor Circuit Court has the right to review ANY travel ban authorized by the President, for a very good reason: The President has access to classified information the Courts don&#39;t. </p>

<p>EXAMPLE: Imagine, a Libyan Spy plants a bomb on a US Civilian Aircraft. We know that because we have a mole in the Libyan Government that says General Gaddafi personally authorized the bombing, and sends a video of the meeting as evidence. As a response, the President authorizes an Air Strike on a terrorist training camp in Tripoli, Libya. A judge in Washington State gets wind of the attack (say he has a kid in the military that can&#39;t STFU), and brings an injunction to stop the attack.
The Judge in Seattle can&#39;t possibly rule on the attack, because he doesn&#39;t have access to all the information the President has. There are many things that courts have no authority to review. A Travel Ban (either temporary or permanent) is one of those things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, Section 1201 of Title 8 expressly provides that the secretary of State (who is, of course, accountable directly to the president) “may at any time, in his discretion, revoke” any visa already issued.  The statute also provides that <strong>“There shall be no means of judicial review of a revocation”</strong> of visas under the law, “except in the context of a removal proceeding if such revocation provides the sole ground for removal.”  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to understand what you read. If the revocation of a visa provides the SOLE ground for removal. The President has stated that in the interest of National Security would be the reason for revocation. They aren&#39;t just wantonly revoking visas. If done, it would be done for the safety of the citizens of the United States, and again, In the Interest of National Security.</p>

<p>You can blow smoke (and whomever else you want to blow), but you can&#39;t argue with the Constitution. Now, go slam some more tweak.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Even though judicial review means a hearing for each visa revoked, not that the judicial branch isn&#39;t allowed to rule on that law. That should be clearly obvious if you understand separation of powers. Do you really think congress can just declare a law above adjudication?</p>

<p>Second, a law existing does not make it &quot;unconstitutional&quot; for a court to challenge it. That is ridiculous. See how I did that without caps lock?</p>

<p>The rest of the comment you didn&#39;t read. Judicial review means that the executive doesn&#39;t have to take the revokee to court (IE due process.) <strong>It doesn&#39;t mean that the court is not allowed to challenge the law, congress does not have that power.</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, no insults. Its simple. The President is authorized under Section 1182 of Title 8 of the US Code to stop entry into the United States of ANYBODY not a citizen for any reason he/she deems is in the best interests of the United States. </p>

<p>Lower courts don&#39;t have clearance to access much of the Intelligence the President uses to make his decisions in this respect, so it does not make ANY sense for them to be able to review any matters of this nature.</p>

<p>Like I posted previously. President Carter went much farther than Fratboy Trump is doing. He revoked the visas of EVERY Iranian in America. There was a group of college students from Connecticut (I believe) who went to Canada for a field trip. They couldn&#39;t get back across the border.</p>

<p>Also (as I posted previously) this is only preventing the Temporary Part of the travel ban. The full ban doesn&#39;t go into effect for about three months. The reasoning for the current temporary ban is to stop terrorists from bum rushing the border to get in ahead of the permanent restrictions that will go into effect.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has already ruled several times on this type of issue, and EVERY TIME has sided with the White House. All the lower courts are doing is stalling to get in as many people as they can before the real restrictions hit in (about) 90 days. When that happens, all this shit will be moot. IDK, maybe Trump is REALLY doing this to see who in the Justice Dept is not going with his programs, so he can give them all the boot before he starts digging his heels in.</p>

<p>I honestly think the real reason he lost in the Ninth Circuit is the idiot he had arguing the case. Did you hear the guy. He was a stumbling muttering mess. </p>
