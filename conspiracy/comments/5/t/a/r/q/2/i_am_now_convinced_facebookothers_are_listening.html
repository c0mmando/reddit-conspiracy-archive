       Hey, I know a while ago there were articles about this and I just wanted to share my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       -I started my internship at an internet provider 2 weeks ago.
       <br/>
       -The majority of employees are Chinese.
-I use facebook only on my phone
-I don't have the facebook app, only a shortcut in chrome.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's what's been happening:
In the first week, Chinese people started appearing in "People you may know". I don't know any of them and they don't work at the company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Few days ago, there was a chinese ad on my feed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday,  there was a white kid like 14 years old (not in friends list) who appeared on my feed 3 times (On my feed it shows he wrote a chinese ad to 3 people who actually are on my friends list). I have a feeling that those 3 didn't really get his post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, still at work, I was talking with my friend and we mentioned  the word Comptia a few times.  Few hours later, i see a comptia ad  on my feed.
      </p>

       Yes, they most likely are.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is sad is that no one is willing to dump it, or to check out a security and privacy focused solution like what I am offering.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, who is to be blamed? The company that takes all your privacy and datamines everything you give to it knowingly, or the people?

       I struggle with this too. I'm not sure who is actually to blame, but it's probably a little of both.
      </p>
      <p>
       First people, for not knowing all the 'rights' (for lack of better term) they are giving up when they sign their user agreements that allow a given website, company or app to access all the sensors on their device. They are also at fault for not insisting that this is wrong and trying to push for laws against this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the Business, app, website etc. that is taking advantage of user ignorance and basically doing every shady thing possible under the law to make more money by collecting audio, video etc. I personally think it should be illegal for anyone but the user to take a picture, a video, or audio. Location information should be allowed in some instances, but the practice should be highly scrutinized

       I know this won't get me much likes or anything but I want to say that laws don't matter. What matters is whether the app/service/platform exploits user data by taking it and data mining it. Many companies not only do that, but also give NSA direct access to their IT systems. Since that knowledge is public, and people still do not move away, the people are to be blamed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same as all the MSM outlets are screaming "there's a hole here!" and mark out the hole so that it is visible to everyone. If the user still chooses to walk into it, he should not fault the hole for being there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, no one but the user should be able to take images/audio/video etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the users choose to stick to their comfortable platforms and refuse to click on an alternative, or have many doubts and reservations about the alternative even when the current platform is worse. So they can only resign themselves to a life of being surveilled.
      </p>
      <p>
       No big company is going to come along and say "let me help you", because there is no incentive for doing that. They want the data, especially if they give the NSA direct access in exchange for whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cry about online security and privacy every now and then rings absolutely hollow when you know what I have been subjected to in various forums, and in real life.

      <p>
       Just keeping things real.

       I wonder if the NSA offers them money or something in exchange for access to their IT systems.  Personally, I would have a very hard time allowing that to happen.  I hated the Patriot Act and if I created some sort of user based Internet thing, I'd not willingly hand over the keys to the kingdom.

       Taking thing you give them freely is one thing. Listening to everything via your phone and selling that info, not so much. 
They are invading your privacy. There is no way that can be legal. If I'm not logged on to Facebook but have the app on my phone and it is listening to my conversations, that is spying, IMO.

       Pretty sure there's word recognition going on. I'm not so concerned as any full blown listening would obviously rack up loads of mobile data and battery usage and be quite obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I believe happens is Facebook intermittently listens for key words then fires that key word as a search string to their ad server, and returns an appropriate advertisement.

       A friend of mine from the state I lived in previously posted on his Facebook about this instance and it freaked him out.  He's 40-50 and was thinking about a high school girlfriend, didn't say anything out loud, didn't put anything to his phone or computer...merely thought about her.  He went to Facebook a day or two later and she pops on "someone you may know".  It freaked him out.

       If they can, they will.

       A business or a company will do anything and everything within the law to make more money, period. Ethics are pretty much gone these days, if Americans don't like something, we pretty much have to make it a law or else they will keep doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's especially more likely because it's invisible. No one really knows if they are listening or not,   that's why people are not as outraged. Everyone just assumes that a big company would not do something like that because it would be bad for business... Sadly, we all need to assume they ARE doing it and put laws in place to prevent the unauthorized use of any sensor in our phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       One problem is that people will say that u sign your rights away in the user agreement, so your solution is just to not use the app. I disagree... I don't think any company should be allowed to do this. No one reads user agreements, many people don't realize what their pho es are capable of doing. These huge phone companies, websites and apps need to be controlled.

       I need my daily dose of minion memes! No but for serious, if it weren't for Facebook. I would not still be in contact with 99% of the people I know on there. It's really nice to see how other people are doing or keep in communication with them, see their photos. There are alot of benefits to having Facebook. You just need to weigh that against the whole surveillance thing. And I am really surprised that OP doesn't even have the app and he is getting those ads. Another possibility is chrome, chrome is the one who tracks your every move and search term. It's possible chrome is selling data to FB

       That's how I've been for a while. I really do miss out on get togethers and it really does help for hook ups but I just can't stand it right now. With everyone suddenly political "masterminds". It's good to at least got rid of it every now and then just to get a breath of air from local drama. I definitely have felt better about myself this year without it.

       The FOMO... I used to constantly be on facebook. I first started by deleting the app and then disabling notifications and then I logged in maybe once a week.. and then I just deactivated it. I might go and permanently delete it. In reality you really don't mind out on anything. I'm on Skype more often chatting and actually emailing friends and hearing more personalised stories. Downside is that I replaced facebook with more time on reddit lol.

       The only reason I haven't is I use it for networking For my business and advocacy related information for the same reason.  My industry relies heavily on Social media for networking, so I'm kind of tied to it and it's not convenient for it to be gone because carrying around a laptop is a pain.  Messenger on Facebook is how I keep up with dealings with a few of my clients as well.  I would have ditched it already if it wasn't for that.

       This should be more well known. Google is doing this as well, you can log into your account if you have an android phone and listen to what it's recorded. It's data mining for "advertisement purposes". Of course they would never use it for anything else.

       The voice in my google maps navigation changed the way it pronounces "traffic". After hearing my mother say "traffuck" several times when angry at traffic, my phone now says it as well. "It is 15 minutes to your location in light traffuck".

       Facebook sees your account logging in from the same external IP as all the Chinese coworker's Facebook accounts, then correlated them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my take.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus we all know the Facebook mobile app is always listening; using account-specific unique inaudible frequencies, they could easily link with each other that way, too. Sounds like a crazy technique, but it's already used in TV advertising...

       Delete Facebook. Delete Chrome (from your phone anyways). I've found those to be the worst two culprits. I deleted chrome the day I discovered they were keeping a nice tidy map and log of everywhere I go for me. I couldn't keep up with the constant updates that cause you to have to go back through the to reset the millions of settings set to literally reap your personal data with your implicit permission. Fuck that shit.

       This has been happening for a long time. Facebook and Instagram listen and advertise. They even watch. I know that sounds crazy but I did a test where I mentally picked a product I would never buy and never buy anything similar and made a point to never mention the product by name. I bought one and sat it in front of my computer (with a camera) and then I started getting advertisements for it. It was a Siggi's yogurt.

       for those who want better privacy measures on the Web, here are some basic things:
Don't use social media, or if you do just use it anonymously (meaning don't use your real name or add people you know in real life), disable javascript when you can, turn off cookies (only turn them on if you really need to). After every session clear all private data. While you clear everything, there are downsides: can't go back to a page, gotta fill in details again, etc., but it's better because, for example, your searches won't ever be skewed to what you browsed about prior (hate that).

       The voice in my google maps navigation changed the way it pronounces "traffic". After hearing my mother say "traffuck" several times when angry at traffic, my phone now says it as well. "It is 15 minutes to your location in light traffuck".

       I'm beginning to think it is the phones/ carriers that are doing it. 
I quit FB, but now the shit is shot up on my YouTube searches.
