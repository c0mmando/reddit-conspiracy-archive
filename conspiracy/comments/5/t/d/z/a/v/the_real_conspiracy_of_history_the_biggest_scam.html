       This was very well received
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5sgk1p/the_real_conspiracy_of_history_the_biggest_scam/">
        over on r/C_S_T
       </a>
       , so I decided to repost it here to further the discussion.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       As a (French) schoolkid I used to wonder why we were learning so much about kings, queens and princes. I was obliged to recite what seemed like irrelevant factoids about Louis XIV's life ("the sun king"), or Charlemagne, or Richelieu, or dozens more "important historical figures". Their whims, proclamations, crimes and other exploits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wondered about all the other people, contemporaries of those I had to learn about; who were they? What did they think of all this? Were they happy? Did they have imagination or ambitions? What is left of them?
      </p>
      <p>
       History lessons sounded mostly like gossip tabloid stuff, but aimed at the past. And I wondered, "could these events and people we're learning about be the ones that truly had the most impact on the world? What other important stuff must have happened that we don't know about?"
      </p>
      <p>
       School isn't the only setting where this happens. As children we are bombarded with stories about royalty. What is up with that? I told my 7-year old niece recently she should throw away her princess costume because princesses live off looted labor and wealth, and rely on armies to sustain their unproductive selves. No, I'm not mean ;) I'm rescuing her from an extremely dangerous illusion ...
      </p>
      <p>
       As a teenager I expanded my views and realized statist undertakings were systematically being glorified and promoted.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_Bello_Gallico">
        <em>
         Gallic War
        </em>
       </a>
       is the first text you translate from Latin. History presents Alexandre and Napoleon's rampages as noble, visionary enterprises. Geography forces you to learn all the names, borders, capitals and logos ("flags") of artificial/oppressive government constructs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout my education, this was the subliminal message:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Without great Statesmen, those who heretofore built Versailles, erected the cathedrals, and civilized many lands, the noble ones who promoted Michelangelo and gave us the Louvre, these heroes we owe our world and our prosperity to, visionaries who today drive the space program and human progress, we would be nothing. We would be barbarous, grotesque cavemen, unenlightened by reason and civilization.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It took me years to realize this wasn't an organic, random occurrence. It's part of the big lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I gather America is somewhat exempted from that ubiquitous statist paradigm. They use over there another method: schools barely teach history anymore (no offense to Americans). And the little they teach still suffers from the same statist bias (e.g. how Lincoln was such a great president for waging war on his countrymen).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Allow me a quick demonstration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know the name Thomas Newcomen? I didn't either. He invented the atmospheric engine in 1712, which heralded the start of the industrial revolution. Or George Stephenson? He is responsible for the locomotive and thus the historical transcontinental American railway system. These are important historic events, and people, and yet they are barely ever mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans came up with the idea of the shipping container in the 19th century. Before that, goods were handled individually as break bulk cargo; unloaded one at a time from the boat onto the carriage, and vice versa. A standardized transportation box would have been a great idea in Antiquity (they had quite effective manual cranes). They were smart, they did tremendous commerce, and yet they didn't think of it. For many millennia nobody had thought of putting the stuff in a big box.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "container revolution" is
       <a href="http://economics.fiu.edu/events/2013/seminar-daniel-bernhofen/bek_container_feb-3-2013.pdf">
        directly responsible
       </a>
       for an increase in world commerce of 700% in just 20 years. This is much larger than the effects of all so-called "free trade" agreements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever heard of a free trade agreement? Probably. Ever heard of the "container revolution"? Quite unlikely (at least I hadn't until recently).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The point is made. So what is the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Stochastic and distributed innovation is, has always been, and will always be, in aggregate, superior to monolithical, centrally planned undertakings. This is an observable fact of nature: unilateral action, trial and error, and competition are what characterize it. This is why Wikipedia is superior to Britannica, Linux superior to Windows, or crypto-currencies superior to fiat money; this is also why economic freedom is congruent with prosperity, and why freedom of expression is a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The central planners despise this elementary truth, so they inculcate a lie. They fear unilateral action, despise the solitary human mind, deny the creative nature of individuals. We are algae to them, prone to cause
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication">
        eutrophication
       </a>
       if allowed to proliferate.
      </p>
      <p>
       They trust only the organized collective - with themselves atop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguments such as "military research and wars help scientific innovation" are complete and utter bullcrap. They are similar to being amazed at the Soyuz spacecraft and thinking the Soviet Union provided a great setting for the emergence of new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had civilization not built the Sistine chapel, Gothic cathedrals, Loire castles, Versailles, etc. and other stuff we generally find "marvelous", humans would already have understood who they are, and would have already (peacefully) colonized the galaxy.

       sorry to burst your bubble BOB.
       <br/>
       But if u truly went into history u knew kings and so on where there for a reason.
       <br/>
       Yes they leeched of the wealth at the and of the controll they had.
       <br/>
       but be-four they did they they played an important and necessary role.
       <br/>
       The role of the lord protector.
       <br/>
       The keeps where build by the peasants whit peasant wealth to protect them from other kings and raiders ( yeps peasants found sanctuary in castles and keeps )
       <br/>
       Also the tex was used to pay for an army to protect the peasants
