       I see protests for this and that but it's only like a percent of the population at most showing up. The devoted ones might even be paid to be there. I'm wondering what's the straw that breaks the camels back for my fiends here.

       There's an awful lot of libertaryans who hate the idea of people being paid to protest...

       For what it's worth, I reckon they'll break once they truly understand how they've been painted into a corner and that they may have only one chance to stop the future. The problem is it's a trap. Violence was the intended outcome regardless of which muppet won the race. The architects of this  nightmare want violence. They're prepared for violence. Violence is good for business.  They would not have cornered the American public if they didn't think they could utterly crush any violent opposition.

       Non-violence is how we win. We demand a public audit of the Fed. Then the CIA. Then the Pentagon. Either this congress does it, or they're out and the 2018 congress has another tea party tsunami, but for audits.
      </p>
      <p>
       No violence, no nothing. Just show up to your reps' town hall meetings and yell at them. That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the audits happen, the jig is up- the money laundering, the smuggling, all the executions of innocent people in Latin America.

       Well, the audits will show vast criminality. Shell corporations, money laundering, bribery, everything.

       The CIA is far from chill and wouldn't have any problem wiping out billions of people to stay in the position they're in. That's a fact. I'm also for trying to get them to talk too though. Let's all see what happens at the end of Scripture for the fun of it.

       I agree that they wouldn't have any ethical scruples about it, but I think they're smarter than to see that as a real option. I think they'll scatter like cockroaches once there are more dissidents than they can kill without angering the population as a whole. When you've got a secret island and a slush fund waiting for you, you're a lot less likely to go for broke than to just bail.

       That sounds reasonable, but unfortunately it's not true. Someone corners a politician, the news plays the video, then their opponent has an opportunity to take the other side.

       That's exactly the Tea party playbook. And it worked. They dominated the news cycle. We're basically trying to start a chant of "Audit! Audit! Audit!", but throughout different media outlets.

       A coup - either Trump himself or nutzoid antifa. Either way hell would be unleashed in such a scenario and the perpetrators lynched for all to see. I'd partake as well and I live in Canada. I'd be there in a day max and choke the fuckers with my own hands.

       I totally believe in peaceful resistance. But hasnt that already been done before. I mean.... flowers in rifles and congregating in front of political establishment buildings seems to achieve nothing. Anonymous seems to have a good way of locating information and outing the political issues the majority r blind to. But isnt it time for some new form of subversion? I mean i have literally ZERO answers here. I just kinda wanna know why the idea of violence... i dont mean killing people... but why is violence and force feom our side seen as being so massively incorrect? We as free thinking humans have been forced to adopt policy decisions that have caused us illness. Loss of employment. Reduction in our ability to afford to survive. Reduced our connection with friends and family. Erroded our ability to chose what we injest. Minimised our sense of individualism. Destroyed our sense of trust and faith in humanity and humanistic movements. Forced us to question our allies and settle for leaders who only care about 4 or 5 year political terms and not to look for long term solutions to any social concerns. Our welfare systems GLOBALLY have been basically rendered useless... and yet... here we sit. Quietly contembplating how to peacefully advise our leaders that we have a problem with their leaderahip style. All the while we amass our 'proof' and 'evidence' which will have its credibility and sources destroyed and knocked back because we are not status quo. We do not subscribe to the system and perpetuation of this hideous global power system we are FORCED to accept and live with. We sit patiently waiting for change. But we have been doing this for decades.... centuries. We have sat back and seemingly left it for others ro effect some kind of change. Is the fear of violence because you dont 'want to be like them' or os ot because you r actually afraid that violence might breed violence? Or what? What is it? Im not advocating for murderous rage. Im not advocating The Age Of Terror. Im merely saying that peace has served no purpose. At all. It has essentially enabled the elite to walk all over us. And our rights are becoming more and more encroached on... dwindling by the day. And i fear that we r going to have a hard time of affecting change by just sotting back and waoting for evidence... that never comes... its time to actively persue taking our loves back. Saying enough. We dont want this anymore. And NOT dispursing when told to do so. And not complying. And of force is used against us. So too shall force be used to defend ourselves and our rights and freedoms. There simply HAS to be enough of us to significantly overwhelm the measures in place. And hey. I cant see american or australian police firing on a crowd. I cant see every last ome of us being detained... but maybe thats what the fema camps r for... either way... best that we go out in a hail of bullets and blood and sweat than to just whittle away our lives quietly contemplating 'better' individuals and idolising the comscienscous objectors of the past

       I think the biggest problem with "breaking point" theory is that most americans don't have a fucking clue about what's really going on. They never talk about drone strikes, high crime rates, overtly shitty public education, NATO, the UN, Israel, or any of the other thousands of issues that can be and should be changed. Instead they want to talk about their "rights", how "divided" America is (and we are), or rape culture on college campuses. There is never a discussion about root issues and the massive amount of brainwashing and dumbing down that is and has been happening for decades. Porn is rampant, drug use is everywhere among the youth, 20 somethings in America can't name the 3 branches of government, and this is the future... I went to college within the last 5 years and the majority of students don't know how to even write a competent essay or read a book critically.

       I'm so worried for the future of the country and the world it's not even funny. Luckily I'm not of this world and I have eternal life promised to me so I'm straight. But I'm still a pilgrim on this earth at the moment which becomes more apparent with each passing day.
