    <div class="md"><p>It was predominantly prophecy when it was written, and a lot of its claims have in fact come true. Up until the 1960s atheists almost universally believed in an eternal cosmos--only when the evidence for a &quot;big bang&quot; scenario became absolutely overwhelming did secular academics accept the finitude of the world, as it seemed to conflict very strongly with the naturalist model.</p>

<p>Historical evidence for Jesus&#39; resurrection is quite compelling, considering how rapidly and peacefully the gospel spread throughout the Roman Empire and beyond. Contemporary historians, even ones strongly biased <em>against</em> Christ and his &quot;zany cult&quot;, admitted that he was a worker of miracles.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Socratic philosophical tradition (via Plato and Aristotle among others) arrived at an idea of God in perfect harmony with the Judeo-Christian deity through cosmological, teleological, and other arguments that, correctly construed, are still philosophically problematic for those who would deny the creator. </p>

<p>It is one thing to remain unconvinced having reviewed the evidence, but it is another thing altogether to say that there is &quot;no evidence&quot; for Christian belief as do the so-called &quot;new atheists&quot;.</p>

For example, you claim Jesus Christ was a miracle worker when there isn&#39;t even proof he was a real person. The Gospels were written by many men <strong>after</strong> Jesus died. You&#39;d think if he had such an amazing message, they&#39;d write it down during his life or shortly thereafter, not 30 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t it reasonable to believe that the Bible is just a book of parables designed to enhance the mythology of Christ? We talk about things like projects Blue Beam and Firesign, where the essentially the elite create a new messiah to command control over us, well couldn&#39;t the story of Christ just be an early enactment of this same plan? The elite controlling those who believe in their Christ to behave a certain way and give to their churches and back their causes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We often see this portion quoted:</p>

<p><em>Now about the times and seasons, brothers, we do not need to write to you. For you are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 3While people are saying, “Peace and security,” destruction will come upon them suddenly, like labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.</em></p>

<p>What is typically left out is what follows:</p>

<p><em>But you, brothers, are not in the darkness so that this day should overtake you like a thief. For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day; we do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not sleep as the others do, but let us remain awake and sober.</em></p>

<p>The most notable part of the end times is, well..the end. When Christ returns is the grand culmination of all these events. If we could force each preceding event, the return of Christ would have to immediately follow and that we can not foreknow the timing of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely believe the elite will fake prophecy and bring in their own Messiah. The essence of everything they do is a counterfeit of a true thing.

    <div class="md"><p>I think, honestly, they don&#39;t really need our help to be wise to do evil and they will bring His wrath simply by doing what comes naturally to them because, after all, they serve Satan.</p>

<p>Rather than us aiding prophetic fulfillment, i think our place in the end times is to fight the good fight. To stand for what He stands for, be a light in the darkness, kindness where thee is none and a voice for the oppressed. He said this, and i think about it a lot:</p>

<p>&quot;Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</p>

<p>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</p>

<p>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>

<p>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</p>

<p>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</p>

<p>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>

<p>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.&quot; - Matthew 25:34-40</p>
