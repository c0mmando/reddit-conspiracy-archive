        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Sketari.html">Sketari</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After seeing so many posts about the pending financial collapse or the band wagon to get into alternative currencies like bitcoin or gold, it baffles me why anyone would want this considering none of which has any type of intrinsic value. Thinking that it does keeps you there under control in the same system at which we currently suffer from. I can only say don&#39;t fear it, there is hope. However that hope only exists when the community at large makes it so. </p>

<p>What am I getting at? It stemmed from a documentary detailing the financial collapse of <a href="https://youtu.be/Zsqa-YHE36A">Argentina</a>. Over night, a flourishing country went bankrupt, banks froze all counts, put limits on withdraws that also included certain times of the day one could withdraw, and a government that &quot;continues&quot; to work on their financial crisis for the last 20 years. However, during that time a group of people realized their government weren&#39;t or couldn&#39;t do anything they took it upon themselves to find a solution. That solution turned into what&#39;s now known as the Global Barter Network. People sold good or services in exchange for goods and services or their own type of currency which served in place of good and services. </p>

<p>Now stating this, the barter network <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Barter-Networks--Lessons-from-Argentina-for-Greece-20150715-0014.html">collapsed</a> in Argentina with the founders arrested on numerous charges citing the illegal creation of currency, and the hyperinflation of the &quot;currency&quot; that flooded the market a few years after it started. If you roam this sub, we may be thinking the same thing here.... but that&#39;s not a deterrent, more of a lesson to learn from. Figure out how to make a good idea better, flawless even. </p>

<p>So with this my friends, we just need to remember that we outnumber the few in control and need not to adhere to their current financial systems, ideologies, or at the very least the way we <em>have</em> to live our lives in order to be happy. </p>

<p>There&#39;s barter, and then there&#39;s social capital. Barter is ok for a short term exchange or relationship, but what you really want is social capital. Giving away food builds social capital which is a more flexible system than just straight up bartering.</p>

Skills are valuable but unless we&#39;re talking about an apocalypse-like scenario, gold and other precious metals will still hold value. You grow food for yourself, get a surplus, sell it for gold to buy other goods and boom we&#39;re working for an economy again. Be nice to have some of that gold instead of worthless paper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.  I&#39;ve always thought fear of an economic collapse is deliberately spread FUD, the kind that allowed people to get behind Obama bailing out the banks.  </p>

<p>I think people would be surprised how quickly we reorganize and get the power back on. The infrastructure doesn&#39;t just disappear nor do humans instantly become cannibal psychopaths.  </p>

<p>There would be panic of course, I&#39;m not saying it would instantly become some utopia or something, but it wouldn&#39;t be the end of the world either.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how you can say gold doesn&#39;t have intrinsic value. It is a material good with a track record of demand that stretches back millennia and industrial uses as well. I don&#39;t personally own precious metals but it seems a prudent inclusion in a person&#39;s financial strategy, especially a person who may be concerned about major economic disturbances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the sense that you can&#39;t eat gold, build a house with it, grow it, etc. it shows nothing in order to continue life, more of what we place on it that gives it value. Just think, what if power goes out and we basically start from nothing? That is what we need to focus on that will make life continue. Gold can&#39;t do that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but when they&#39;re rare and people aren&#39;t in need of food, but rather a currency to spend on something else, it&#39;ll be precious metals that buy the manuals and tools if they all of a sudden become scarce and you didn&#39;t stock up for an economic collapse. It&#39;s still the idea behind monetary change. The metal in them was/is supposed to equal the attached monetary value of the coin. Paper money basically says you theoretically own that in precious metals. That&#39;s kind of the essence of it. It was easier to carry around than metal. Inflation drops the paper dollar value but won&#39;t as much crash a metal value. Metals, in an economic collapse are what we fall back on. Stock up on manuals and tools and gas all you can before you have to buy them later on in the event of a catastrophic crash. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people are predicting some sort of breakdown, and so it is good to be prepared to some extent. 2008 showed that a global collapse is possible and so we need to be psychologically prepared. My favourite source of wisdom, Lahotar, warns:</p>

<p>&#39;Breakdown will result in whole world becoming 1 large refugee camp.everything will be in short supply.Lucky ones will die,rest will suffer&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;Earth can take no more human inflicted pain n destruction.Its about to strike out in multiple ways all over the planet Only pain awaits now&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;Whenever society goes out of balance.Propotionate disasters restore balance.This time earth n society r out of balance.Means total breakdown&#39;</p>

<p>[<a href="http://www.lahotar.com/">http://www.lahotar.com/</a>]</p>

<p>And so it won&#39;t just be a financial crisis, but also an environmental and social one as well. There will be a lot of turmoil.</p>
