        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">309</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/EnjoyThePebble.html">EnjoyThePebble</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Like, way back in high school I got that first waking up feeling: questioning 9/11, JFK, etc. I brought that on- i researched on my own and stepped away from the narrative. And I knew that I had a personal responsibility to keep researching, because i sure as shit wasn&#39;t gonna see it MSM. I had to research:</p>

<p>1) other past events and </p>

<p>2) every new event. It took time and effort but the the result was worth it. But again, I had stay sharp and learn for myself </p>

<p>There was also a second aspect to this waking up. &quot;You can have complete freedom or complete security, but not both.&quot; And something about the gray area in between. With waking up, I realized I could cuddle up in the warm blanket blissful ignorance, or could experience truth - but I&#39;d have to walk outside on a winter night into freezing rain. I&#39;d have to see the underbelly. </p>

<p>So waking up as I know it - and maybe as all of you know it - required:</p>

<p>1) personal research and </p>

<p>2) embracing the darkness as a price to pay for the truth </p>

<p>The last 8 months have been odd. Yes, an internet army has performed crazy amounts of research on Wikileaks emails, Pizzagate connections, and MSM fuckery. So there is still research being done. But it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s self sustaining now. I no longer have to wait for a leak or a terror attack in order to get a glimpse of the machine because</p>

<p>1) so many people are researching things that used to not be high priority. Even those little things are now getting busted wide open </p>

<p>2) there&#39;s undoubtedly a group of good people (the white hats) on the inside who are facilitating this </p>

<p>So the research requires a lot less effort. Like starting your own company: after 25 years of slaving away you can now just cash the weekly check. And it&#39;s a self accelerating process- revelations shed light on more connections, and cause more people to become curious and take a peak </p>

<p>The second part is feeling. Yes, there&#39;s negative shit. Imagine if 100% of pizzagate satanic rumors are true. But it&#39;s almost like the positivity glowing outwards from an informed populace outweighs the ugliness of the truth. Like it sucks balls having your tonsils out, but its fucking amazing never getting strep throat again. </p>

<p>The third part is sensation. There&#39;s a feeling -light but detectable- that everything&#39;s gonna be alright. The doom and gloom of humanity is finite phase, as hard as it is to swallow that pill because it&#39;s all we&#39;ve ever known (in our lives and looking back in history). We might actually see this thing turn around. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a great sensation. But It&#39;s not solely from personal and/or group research. Or from the good outweighing the bad. Or from seeing more people talking about the truth than ever before. Because that can all be confirmation bias. I&#39;ll go a week at a time completely 100% unplugged from everything, with the exception of checking texts once in the morning and once in the evening. Literally no internet, radio, or TV. Or even talking about current events with people....</p>

<p>..:And it still seems like there&#39;s this positive current in the air. Slowly rising, and you get the feeling this is a planet wide shift. To reiterate: it&#39;s barely detectable and has a seemingly negligible growth rate. But it&#39;s not short lived and it&#39;s not localized. Like, there can be an unusually cold day in august. But it passes and isn&#39;t nationwide. But winter is long and far reaching - but comes on at a very slow rate. That&#39;s what this feels like. And I&#39;m not even a terribly optimistic person. Wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m a pessimist either. There&#39;s no super positive events going on in my life - no cash inheritance or promotion or first born kid or whatever. There&#39;s just a slow.....Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz</p>

<p>I took every biology class in college and also a formidable amount of physics and chemistry. I&#39;m agnostic. That being said, I personally don&#39;t like the idea of crystals or chakras etc (if you do, more power to ya. We&#39;re both clinging to a rock in the void- your guess is as good as mine when it comes to explaining things). I don&#39;t like the idea of vibrations and astrology. And so i won&#39;t entertain those ideas. Just like the Gaea Hypothesis is actually rooted in comparisons to organism and individual cells, maybe there&#39;s an explanation for this that we just don&#39;t know. Maybe it&#39;d take a super intelligent AI to see every connection and feedback systems to explain it. </p>

<p>But there really feels like there&#39;s just a positive hum rising up from the earth. An invisible fluid of positivity, optimism, clarity, and relief, very slowly rising. First a film, then a puddle, then over your shoes, up to your knees, rising over your waist, covering everything but your head, and finally, full immersion. Right now, the ocean of positivity is just a couple inches deep. But it&#39;s there, it&#39;s rising, it&#39;s planet wide, it feels good, and it requires no effort from me </p>

<p>It&#39;s like Earth is a leaf blower of positivity and love. and after pulling the rip cord for millennia, it finally fucking started </p>

<p>Edit: forgot to mention.  Although I&#39;m well versed in the physical and life sciences (enough so to get into both medical and pharmacy school. I say that to reiterate just how much I studied this shit, not to brag. Maybe a little bragging. Fuck you), I don&#39;t write off the spiritual. I&#39;ve been practicing Daily meditation for a decade this year, and once a month or so, the session goes from one of relaxation and stress reduction to a divine connection to the earth. It spits in the face of my education, my agnosticism (and former ardent atheism), and scientific mechanical view of the world. But it was real. I&#39;ll go deep inside of my mind and experience ego death, much like high doses of psilocybin and/or LSD. I come out with huge amounts of empathy, a love of nature, and humbled awe of the infinite eternality we see in the night sky. A very noticeable feeling is the need for tiny actions of love and positivity. Don&#39;t just think &quot;I&#39;m just one person, it won&#39;t do anything.&quot; Picking up some litter, going out of your way to call a depressed friend, helping tutor some freshmen in organic chemistry for free one random afternoon - they all have tiny little ripples. </p>

<p>For instance, my other username <a href="/u/calypsocasino">/u/calypsocasino</a>, I posted loads of MCAT study guides that I made. And I mean took me hundreds of hours to make. I aced the test in the 95th percentile and thought &quot;maybe students who cant afford test material could benefit from these.&quot; That was in 2013- since then, I&#39;ve had <em>hundreds</em> of people message me saying they wouldn&#39;t have been accepted to Med school without my study guides, or test taking tips, etc. so there&#39;s a ton of doctors who will one day practice medicine, each treating thousands of patients over a lifetime. Maybe one of those is a stephen hawking motherfucker or Elon Musk. Long shot assumption? Without a doubt. But when I moved my cursor away from &quot;move to trash&quot; and decided &quot;fuck it why not, I&#39;ll take a couple mins to post these online&quot; I sure as hell didn&#39;t think anyone would get into Med school from me. Let alone hundreds. That ripple effect is real.</p>

<p>And the negative elite have known that forever: assassinate one person (JFK) and we can go into Indochina and slaughter millions. Drop two towers in manhattan and kill 3,000, and we can go to the ME for 16 years, set up a heavy US stronghold in sand land, murder millions, and kick back $6 trillion to contractors. Little more controversial, but: Okinawa and Iwo Jima were really bad, so we can justified nuking cities. Or more recently: &quot;Russia hacked our elections&quot; so let&#39;s move pawns to start world war fucking three. </p>

<p>They know that negative powerful actions can trip a cascade of events resulting in an outcome exponentially larger/more powerful than the initial step. Why can&#39;t the reverse be true? Okay, they have much more power and can perform a 9/11. Yeah no shit that&#39;s a lot more influential than holding the door for someone. But:</p>

<p>1) they can&#39;t do those events every day. They&#39;re carefully planned, choreographed, executed, and then justified or denied. We can do little things everyday with no limit </p>

<p>2) though powerful their negative actions might be, people will always move to a state that reduces the negativity (pain, fear, sorrow). So their actions always dissipate in time. With positivity, it feeds on itself. I&#39;m feeling good so I&#39;m gonna help others, which makes me feel better, and hey wouldn&#39;t ya know, someone just helped me out- I&#39;m gonna help someone else out now </p>

<p>So maybe this current of positivity isn&#39;t new at all - maybe it&#39;s just finally culminating after untold years of small growth, like $5 investment doing nothing for 80 years and then suddenly making millions every month. We&#39;re just at the &quot;leg of the exponential curve&quot; or whatever Kurzweil says </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post is one of the best I&#39;ve read a while.  thanks for sharing!</p>

<p>There are a good number of people like you, agnostic and not very optimistic not gloomy - that over the past 6-12 months have felt an odd call.  For me, it was an odd sense of evil and then a turn around towards positivity and energy.  I am not spiritual in the hippy sense, yet I feel a drive to embrace the positivity and energy.  So I came here trying to make sense of it.  Seems a good number of others in similar veins came to this sub.  I am unsure why this sub works, but it does.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you what we tell each other.  Embrace it and examine it.  Meditate.  Read and research.  I dont know what it is but I like it and I enjoy that others feel it too.</p>

<p>So maybe it is nothing.  Or maybe it is something.  It hurts nothing to open your mind, right?</p>

<p>Thanks again for sharing the great post.  I hope you come around more and bump into other like minded souls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love this post! Thanks OP and thanks EricCarver! I am also one of these people. The &quot;want&quot; to do good because good is comming! I think :P And you are right! It started 9 months ago. I&#39;ve been readon conspiracy for years now, but yeah, 9 months ago something started burning and I&#39;ve been stuck here ever since :) It&#39;s wonderfull. I fell so freaking woke these days. I know EVERYTHING important happening :D I&#39;m calm and keep telling everyone &quot;everything&#39;s gonna be allright&quot; :P But It&#39;s also overwhelming sometimes!</p>

<p>So, loved your point on healthy eating and it&#39;s something that should be stressed more around here these day. All this negativity takes a toll. It&#39;s much easier to handle with good daily routines. So yeah, take a brake, EAT and exercise, AND THEN read more!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks!  Yes, interesting times, interesting chatter, interesting everything.  It is easy to forget to focus on you vs everything happening around us.  Which is weird since the things happening sometimes feel so fake and convoluted.</p>

<p>So if some rumors are true, unsure if I believe them, our diets and minds have been worked on to keep things down and in their control.  So clean up that diet a little each day.  Clean out fluoride out of the intake each day.  Exercise a bit more each day.</p>

<p>Simplify your lives.</p>

<p>Help others randomly.  </p>

<p>and just don&#39;t get involved in the fear everyone around you wants you to be in.  Maybe your calm will help calm someone else.</p>

<p>Peace all, have a great day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love you guys! I&#39;m in the same boat as you, hit a level of &quot;zen&quot; I didn&#39;t know was possible (and I&#39;m guessing is just the beginning) recently and everything has changed, for the better. I&#39;ve noticed that it had a positive effect on my roommates and, in turn, they&#39;re positively affecting me. Can&#39;t wait to see what happens next! </p>

<p>Life is comprised of cycles, the ups and the downs, but we DO have influence on them. So focus on coming into balance with your cycles, and it&#39;ll have a far greater effect than you can possibly imagine. That, I think, is what has been happening over the past year or so to all of us globally. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t take my word for it though - dig deep and you&#39;ll find the truth. If anyone would like some clarity or a direction to research in, please don&#39;t hesitate to reach out and PM me. </p>

<p>Peace and love!</p>

<p>1) you don&#39;t say to fight them or overpower them. No. Just learn to ride them with ease, both depression and happiness. &quot;It&#39;s better to sail than to row&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just taller, but smarter, more talented, more aware.  Yes.  This is correct.  More and more young people (children and very young adults) are coming out with remarkable talents and abilities that simply weren&#39;t seen in as acute a manner in generations past.  This is correct.</p>

<p>However, all that being said, the ship which is this civilization turns <em>very slowly</em>, and things will not improve too greatly for quite some time still (again, at least a couple of generations).</p>

<p>It seems the change will be slow and gradual - just like the Yugic cycles themselves.</p>

<p>And heck, the epoch we&#39;re said to be entering after the Kali Yuga (the worst one) is <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=dvapara+yuga">the Dvapara Yuga</a> - which is significantly more evolved than the Kali Yuga and is the age during which biblical tales took place, but the fact of the matter is that even the Dvapara Yuga itself is fraught with significant issues and problems.</p>

<p>Well, there seems to be a decent amount of evidence indicating that <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=how+old+is+planet+earth?">the planet’s been around for a few billion years so far</a>, so I’m not exactly sure how likely it is that it only has 17 thousand years left to live.</p>

<p>Not saying it’s not possible, of course - maybe it might have a stellar collision of some sort - but I’d personally place my bets on it hanging around for a bit longer than 17K more years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>though some people will live in the constellations of cancer and aquarius</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is growing evidence that humans have established colonies throughout this solar system <em>already</em>, so I wouldn’t doubt that this could happen…and would doubt even less that those constellations are already <em>very</em> inhabited by many life forms.</p>

<p>After all, there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA"><em>no</em> way we’re alone.</a>  None.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Part of that uniting involves raising your level of consciousness as well, however.  In raising your level of consciousness enough to unite, then your way of thinking raises also so that you are more capable of <em>resisting</em> external (and internal) manipulation toward revolting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure you can feel the revolution coming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to make sure and understand what kind of revolution is needed, however.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=violent+riot&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1408&amp;amp;bih=732&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXseq3-4XSAhVP22MKHRjKDhQQ_AUIBigB">This</a> is absolutely, 100% <em>not</em> the kind of “revolution” that’s needed.</p>

<p><a href="http://etquotes.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/martin_luther_king_1965_selma_montgomery_march.jpg">This</a> is, and <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tVE5KHhb0RE/VL5bRYFotJI/AAAAAAAAJy0/wqtDMvsDG6k/s1600/Selma%2Bmarch.JPG">this</a> is, and <a href="https://popularresistance-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2013/10/Gandhi-salt-march-1930-1024x708.jpg">this</a> is and <a href="http://3tgmli1sbjtj2hpytw6t8lw1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/0b4232be-7c82-4bf6-856f-1040424dfc4fimage31-500x364.jpg">this</a> is, however - with the kind of <a href="http://photos.state.gov/galleries/amgov/14900/following_mlk/mlk6.jpg">determination that stares</a> adversity and fear and resistance right in the eyes like <a href="http://projects.seattletimes.com/mlk/assets/gallery2.jpg">this man right here</a>.  Do you think he’s scared of those huge dogs?  You bet your God damn pants he is.  Yet the willingness to walk through the fire in the face of that fear that this picture shows in this moment speaks a thousand words, and it’s that type of conviction that A) <em>everyone</em> in the human species has within them, and B) if we all had it together toward a united cause of helping ourselves and helping this civilization, things would, again, change <em>tomorrow.</em></p>

<p>So yes.  Revolution <em>is</em> coming - but if it comes right and the population does what it can do and needs to do, then, again I say, TPTB will not be able to put that down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The future is not bright and shiny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not dark and dreary either - unless we don’t, again, “man the fuck up”.  It will be dark and dreary if we don’t take the responsibility that we can and should take.</p>

<p>If we <em>do</em> take that responsibility, however, two things will happen:  A) It will be rough and tough and difficult for about half a generation to a generation.  We would need to be ready for that.  However, after that, B) it actually <em>would</em> be bright and shiny.</p>

<p>Either that or we will lose and all be dead.  Either way it’ll be a win win situation because this current civilization, and the “not bright and shiny” future that you’re referring to, is one that’s not worth living in anyway.</p>

<p>Fight for a better future, or die trying.  Period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What hope have us poor slaves got against taking down an international force of super powerful men with vast wealth and technology?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I keep saying over and <em>over</em> again, we have ALL THE HOPE IN THE WORLD if we actually <em>band</em> together.  Again, fight against your feeling of learned helplessness.  It’s been indoctrinated in you from birth <em>by</em> those “international forces of super powerful men with vast wealth and technology”.</p>

<p>They may have all that, but they don’t have to have your soul and your mind.  YOU give that to them of your own free will - even if it’s because you’ve become confused and brainwashed by their tricks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The revolution will be their doing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the civilian population continues to be so stupid and powerless enough as to think there is no other way, then perhaps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They want us to fight against ghosts and patsys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then <em>don’t</em>.  Easy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They want us to fight against each other ad even within ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is correct.</p>

<p>SO THEN <em>DON’T</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a plan laid out against the small and the helpless. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  And the first key is to convince us as a population that this “small and helpless” categorization applies to <em>us</em>…when it in fact doesn’t.</p>

<p>We are massive, 13,000 pound elephants that from birth had our feet tied to huge ropes attached to immovable anvils, and we tried and tried and tried to get free from them and failed over and over again…and after failing so many times as a young baby, we gave up trying.</p>

<p>Now that the bull elephant is all grown and an adult, it no longer even tries or makes the attempt even though it could now easily snap that rope like a small twig if it wanted.</p>

<p>It is convinced that there is no hope because of the failures it met when young - so now all that’s needed to keep it tethered is a small rope from which it could effortlessly free itself if it but tried and made an effort.</p>

<p>Everything has been shut out from its mind.  It has been indoctrinated to believe it is powerless when little else could be further from the actual truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a plan laid out against the small and the helpless. against the poor and the ill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And?  What does that mean?  Does that mean that you’re going to willingly go along with it and follow suit w/what TPTB want you to do?</p>

<p>This is a weak person’s mind, and you can be stronger than that.  Everyone can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A plan laid out we are all following to the letter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Fuck you and fuck your letter” is what you should feel about that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our Great War is a spiritual war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then fight that spiritual war by being as emotionally, psychologically, spiritually, <em>and</em> physically autonomous, intelligent, and helpful to your fellow beings as you can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are steadily marching forward blindly believing we know we&#39;re right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some are not blind, however.  Some are, but some are not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plan is bigger than even the elites have come to understand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s because the “elites” in this society are nothing but “King Rats”.  See what that means in Chapter 25, page 244 of <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">this pdf</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evil drives them and rules them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn’t need to drive and rule you though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plan they don&#39;t realize they are following is gods plan and in the end the meal shall inherit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What’s “the meal”?  Do you mean “the meek”?</p>

<p>I would say that those who will inherent the Earth are the internally powerful; those willing to stand on honor and principle and not be afraid to work toward it regardless of what the external circumstances might otherwise say or show.</p>

<p>Happy cake day, by the way.</p>

<p>You’re seeing just how far behind we as a culture, citizenry, and species currently are from achieving our real and true potential…and this gets really, really discouraging when you stop and take a good look at how much manipulation there is, and how many of us willingly sap that manipulation up without even thinking about it.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> discouraging.  However, there are people that are waking up - just like you.  Just like me.  Many of us are at different stages of it.  We just need to continue it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>things I used to find entertaining are meaningless. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s because many of those things <em>are</em> meaningless.  It’s like when we were little kids and we could sit in front of the tv and watch a certain cartoon over, and over, and OVER again ad nauseam and never get tired of it…but now we could barely watch it once without rolling our eyes, turning it off, and leaving.</p>

<p>Today there are things that we might watch with a certain amount of interest that years from now we might look at and go “Why did I ever think <em>that</em> was cool?”</p>

<p>It’s just a growing and evolving process taking place.</p>

<p>That you find certain things meaningless now that you found entertaining before is not a bad thing at all.  It means you’re growing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people around me want to tell me about their daily life and I only want to talk about the universe and the meaning of life and the expansion of mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha.  You sound like me.  I live in that world too.  Definitely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is a lot of stress for sure to try and act normal when you know everything that is going on around you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, sir.  I don’t really have any friends as a result.  I know and get along well with many people, but actual <em>friends?</em>  I don’t really have any of those for the reason you stated above.</p>

<p>Yep.  Indeed we do.  A genetic anomaly took place in their neonatal development that caused certain areas of their brain to be shut off and, somehow, that apparently triggered other dormant areas to wake up - dormant areas that, as you correctly said, all of us have in us already.</p>

<p>I want to expand my mind and understand how to unlock that potential. I believe it&#39;s possible for everyone to have the same incredible abilities as the greatest musical geniuses and the smartest physicists. Wake me up. We need to wake up now. We are being called upon. It is our time to evolve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don’t want to get too ahead of ourselves, however.</p>

<p>Ultimately, and as far as I’ve been able to asses, it seems like this:  We live on a prison planet where we are generally in a slave state as a species and a population.  We are at the behest of planetary custodians who’ve taken the form of the world’s corporate billionaires and trillionairs, but they themselves are far, far lower in the rung of power and ability than the beings who they answer to and who are not even <em>from</em> here.</p>

<p>Shit gets deeper, but I’ll stop here for now.</p>

<p>Suffice to say that the abilities of the planetary citizenry have been cut vastly short at the behest of the rulers of those corporate monoliths who currently run this planet.</p>

Lots of people seem to be engaged and looking for meaningful change. Somehow though the answer has come up &#39;Republicans&#39; and I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s a good thing(even though I agree with a lot of their stated Philosophy). These are the guys that want to bury you under the prison for marijuana/psychedelics etc. Looking at a map of the country and where we&#39;re seeing actual change at last on that front--it should jump right out at you. </p>

<p>Seems that way.  Wouldn’t disagree with that.</p>

<p>That’s the <em>wrong</em> answer.  Nothing against Republicans anymore than Democrats or any other political affiliation, but it doesn&#39;t seem to me that that’s the way toward any <em>real</em> meaningful change.</p>

Personally I&#39;m all for keeping the pressure on, digging in and getting involved, but I can appreciate the feeling. These are apocalyptic times; in the original sense of uncovering.

Title &quot;Will the CIA torture report cause the masses to wake up to 9/11 truth? We can only hope&quot;
&quot;Remember this, however: 9/11 Truth will eventually be admitted by the mainstream media. It may not happen today or tomorrow. Perhaps the system is not quite ready to admit 9/11 Truth and merge all of these charges to the record of Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld quite yet. But the puzzle has come together for many of us and we are waiting for critical mass awareness to move forward with justice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Many of us believe justice for 9/11 will happen sooner or later. This is the course humanity is on, and today I&#39;m happy to say I believe this CIA torture exposure brings America and humanity as a whole one step closer to accepting and thus acting upon 9/11 Truth.&quot;</p>

Many people, including non-native speakers, may be unfamiliar with this word. <strong>Here is the definition</strong><sup>(In</sup> <sup>beta,</sup> <sup>be</sup> <sup>kind):</sup></p>

<p>Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one&#39;s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses, while giving disproportionately less consideration to alternative possibilities. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for ... [<a href="http://legaliq.com/Definition/Confirmation_Bias">View More</a>]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I wonder if it has to do with the happenings at CERN. Maybe they&#39;ve actually punched a small hole in the inter-dimensional continuum, which has allowed greater influence from higher dimensional beings--or has allowed us in this dimension to pull influence from higher dimensions. I mean, probably not, but that would be cool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been feeling...something.  It&#39;s been both good and bad, I feel like i&#39;m just waiting for SOMETHING to happen.  Like something NEEDS to happen, or, are we really gonna just keep going the way we were before? Just gonna keep trudging along that way and hope for the best? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if i&#39;m waiting for Nibiru, second coming of christ, world war 3, aliens to come down and save humanity, aliens to come from a different dimension and say what&#39;s up, crazy new technology. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what it is, but I just feel like something needs to change.  And if it all ends up being nothing and we continue trudging along the path we&#39;re already on, i&#39;ll be pretty let down and depressed. </p>

There is some bullshit and obfuscation in what he&#39;s saying, but I guarantee you&#39;ll find a lot of it fascinating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. 
Canadian here, who by choice, did not want to pay attention to a lot of the political stuff happening in the last 8 months. It was killing my vibe man. </p>

<p>But from December 2016 to about a week ago, just the start of February 2017, those two months felt like... Hell. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t change anything, my wife felt it to, and I could see the assault on her normally positive and powerful attitude. I could feel this assault on my own outlook and daily routine. Unexplainable, for me really. I have never gone through something like that, so strong. Nor my wife. </p>

<p>But since about Feb. 2, we&#39;ve noticed a slight change in just... Tone. That&#39;s the best way I can describe it. It&#39;s a slight improvement from the last two months, but I don&#39;t feel the assault is over. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a strange time indeed, and it sure feels like it&#39;s not coming from within, but it is affecting the power within.</p>

<p>Fight to stay positive friends, and care for your fellow man and neighbour. </p>

<p>TPTB will never win. </p>

<p>He talks about the Old Story of separation and control, and a New Story that millions of people are starting to live in, including many of us.  Where we start to act out of the feeling that we are all one -- that what we do to others we do to ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is something to the idea of a global connection between people--but not on a mental telepathy or psychic kind of level. I think it has more to do with each of us having what people call a spirit. I think we&#39;re actually attached to each other on some kind of spiritual plane--the entire human race. You could call it quantum entanglement, too, if you&#39;re more comfortable with that. I think it&#39;s the good people in the world finally feeling some hope because darkness is being exposed. I think it&#39;s like plucking a note on an instrument and having it reverberate to everyone tuned in to the same frequency. I&#39;m not doing a very good job of explaining what I think it is, am I!? Haha! But I know what you mean, because I&#39;ve spoken with some of my friends about this, and it feels like a great weight has been lifted from our shoulders. Some of the fear is gone that we didn&#39;t even know we were carrying around with us. I don&#39;t think most people in the world are evil--not like these globalists who think they deserve to rule over everyone. I think most people want the same things. Just to be able to take care of their families and provide for their needs, and to raise their children in peace. But we&#39;re constantly having to deal with the machinations of the evil assholes, too. And that can be a great weight on your psyche. Sometimes it seemed insurmountable, because singly, we just didn&#39;t have the resources to fight these ugly megalomaniacs. But now there are so many more people on the same team, and it&#39;s lightened the heavy load that&#39;s been weighing down the collective psyche of everyone. That&#39;s how I see it, anyway. You kids give me hope for the future...</p>

<p>Like what I&#39;m seeing happen here. There are a lot of good people working very hard to try to bust these criminal traffickers against all odds. And I&#39;m probably one of the older people here, but seeing people do that work--out of the goodness of their hearts--really gives me hope for the future. I&#39;m not so worried about what my kids, future grandchildren, et al will have to face now when I&#39;m no longer here. There are still people who know right from wrong, and who have compassion for the helpless victims in society. For awhile, I wondered if that kind of humanity was disappearing. It didn&#39;t seem like a lot of people cared about others all that much. But I was wrong. And yeah, it does lighten the load, and I do feel more hopeful about the future, because there are still a lot of younger people who are good people, and they really do care. </p>
