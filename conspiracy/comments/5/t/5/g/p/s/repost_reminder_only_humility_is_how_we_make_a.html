       Being rude and aggressive no matter how factual and scientific your argument is will only hurt your cause. Most people understand this on r/conspiracy (I'm still learning myself) but it's still an important reminder.  As the divide and conquer chaos agenda continues to roll out I feel like u/PleiadianBigfoot words are even more important than ever before...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "One of the key elements of research is humility. It's realizing that every piece of information you digest is second hand information. Unless you happen to be there and witness it for yourself, you never have 100% proof it went down the way you see it in the news.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every day I read dozens upon dozens of articles. And every day I try to put the pieces of the puzzle together. I read it all: mainstream, foreign press, alternative, conspiracy, fringe, govt documents, etc. and the more I learn the more questions I have.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've been researching for 30 years. And in thirty years I have never seen society so split on what truth is. Every group is in firm belief the other groups are misinformed sheep.
       </p>
       <p>
        I learned a long time ago not to share information in a declarative fashion. I share what I learn in an inquisitive fashion. Because what I'm sharing may or may not be true.
       </p>
       <p>
        And therein lies the wisdom. We don't know. We may pile up more evidence in one area or another, and start to see a consensus forming, but how much do we really know?
       </p>
       <p>
        My advice to anyone new on the path of studying current events or conspiracy or anything for that matter is to be as objective and detached and as neutral as possible. Never instantly accept what you see, and never instantly reject it either. Cross reference as much as you can. Let it float around your head. Don't turn it into a belief system. Always let the information you digest be malleable, so you can add to it and shape it and let it grow naturally. Allow yourself to go down the rabbit hole without effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        People have a tendency to cherry pick information to bend to a belief system they have already created for themselves. Then they justify their belief system with said information. It's better to just digest the info without any emotional or personal attachment. That's not easy of course. But you see the results everyday on comment sections of how reactionary people can be. Most people do not respond. They react. It's an emotional reaction. They then proceed to tell you what went on where and how such and such went down and suddenly they are all master sociologists who call you names because they don't agree with you.
       </p>
       <p>
        And now it's reached a point where we may actually have our alternative media shut off, according to this latest news of congress passing a bill to censor alternative news.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are on a very slippery slope. Not only is critical thinking and a wise approach to research not being encouraged, it is being legally threatened. We have an establishment which historically controlled what people learned, and then along comes the Internet, with peer to peer knowledge, and an entire new world sprang forth. And this world is a massive threat to the status quo.
       </p>
       <p>
        So please, whether you have researched only a few months, or are a veteran doing it for decades, always keep in mind that research means nothing without humility. Don't bother getting into pissing contests with strangers family or friends over who is right or wrong. Just plant your seeds. They will grow. The paradigm can only shift one person at a time."

       yep.  Humility and curiosity with little to no emotion, searching just for the truth good or bad with as open a mind as you can manage, while being as skeptical as is reasonable.  nice writeup.

       tbh I have moments where I'm convinced everything is so poison that apathy is one of the better allies of truth. Facebook seems to have caught on to that... (poisoning the uninterested)

       Great post OP. It's like a game of operator as a kid. Pass it around in the ear of others and see what you get. It always ends up nothing like what was truly said.

       You are not alone my friend. And the things I do comment on I sometimes (usually) go back and edit them because I feel unsatisfied with the original.
