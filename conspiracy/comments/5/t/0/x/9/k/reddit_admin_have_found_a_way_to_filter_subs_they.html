<p>If you look at the list of &quot;popular&quot; subreddits, it clearly contains <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> but does not include <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>.  </p>

<p>Now we know why there were all these campaigns to tell people that they could filter <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>.  At the time, we weren&#39;t told that user&#39;s choices for filtering would be used for seeding the list of popular subreddits, but now we finally know the real motive behind the filter option.</p>

<p>As far as reddit censoring the popularity of subs, of course they do. Why wouldn&#39;t they? They are marketing a product, and that product&#39;s target demographic isn&#39;t Donald Trump zealots. Whether you like it or not, the reddit brand is damaged by The_Donald. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve implied that being totally neutral is the best for Reddit to market their product to retain existing users and to attract new users. I would disagree with this notion, considering that a very large (I would estimate that the vast majority) of Reddit users do not enjoy viewing T_D posts on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Additionally, it&#39;s likely that the average new user who comes to Reddit for the first time would be turned off by headlines from T_D that mention cuckolds, anti-islam sentiment and far-right opinions.</p>

<p>In other words, Reddit needs to cater to mainstream opinions in order to remain a successful media platform. The mainstream opinion is not a totally neutral, as you have implied. </p>

You going to call out Spez, because you don&#39;t like him? How about you get really bold and write the Conde Nast Board of Directors a rulll mean letter. You should use crayon, and write it on the back of a Denny&#39;s menu, just so they know that you are serious. I bet they will be like, &quot;<a href="/u/mrsnakers">/u/mrsnakers</a> makes an excellent point! We should change our internal policies that will lose value for our shareholders! We&#39;ve all learned a valuable lesson today from <a href="/u/mrsnakers">/u/mrsnakers</a>, and will never again protect our brand!&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using T_D as a means of dismissing or debating someone&#39;s character is so telling of who <em>you</em> are.</p>

<p>Essentially you&#39;re okay with accepting that a diversity of 360,000 users who don&#39;t believe what you believe should &quot;get out&quot; because one echo chamber (r/politics) wasn&#39;t enough safe space for you.</p>

<p>The Donald happened <em>because</em> of people like you. It exists, because of you, because when you shout down people over and over again they eventually create their own place to be, and then you rail against it still. </p>

<p>There&#39;s diversity on T_D, and the sub grows larger each day, many are people that were on your side but can&#39;t stand to stand next to <em>you</em> any longer.</p>

<p>Keep it up. Double down. Talk down to people with your low energy &quot;you post in T_D&quot; as though you can stereotype 360,000 users into one nice little box. Keep needling examples of the vocal minority in T_D as a representation of all 360,000. You just look naive and ignorant.</p>

Discussion of a policy change -- no matter the motivation -- has little to do with the topic at hand (conspiracy). Is there some hidden hand of a shadow government at work here?

<p>Those that run this site have every right to do with their algorithms as they which. Eventually they will turn Reddit into an echo chamber.

<p>big time conspiracy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actions of Reddit, and it&#39;s algorithms, impacts the content on one site: Reddit. It&#39;s not a vast conspiracy to silence the interwebz. Handing over control of DNS could be seen as a conspiracy to control access to DNS, in order to prioritize, and allow access to sites on the internet.</p>

<p>What Reddit is doing is silencing a thread that is problematic for its advertisers. It&#39;s done so in the past to a large sub (coontown), which then moved it&#39;s operation to Voat.</p>

<p>The reason that I see this post as a problem is that it&#39;s Trump-related. Keep that shit on T_D.</p>

I would disagree with this notion, considering that a very large (I would estimate that the vast majority) of Reddit users do not enjoy viewing T_D posts on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Additionally, it&#39;s likely that the average new user who comes to Reddit for the first time would be turned off by headlines from T_D that mention cuckolds, anti-islam sentiment and far-right opinions.</p>

<p>In other words, Reddit needs to cater to mainstream opinions in order to remain a successful media platform. The mainstream opinion is not a totally neutral, as you have implied. </p>
