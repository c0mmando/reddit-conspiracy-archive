<p>On February 4th, 2017, Wikileaks posted a very strange Tweet, and they have continued to release one (with the hashtag #Vault7) daily since then (through today, Feb. 9th, 2017).</p>

<p>First, <a href="https://postimg.org/gallery/2088uhz6q/">here</a> is a gallery containing all of the images.</p>

<p>Now on to each individual post:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/b65ad71655.jpg"><strong>What is #Vault7? -</strong></a> Posted Feb. 4th, 2017. A picture of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen near Longyearbyen in the remote Arctic Svalbard archipelago, about 810 miles from the North Pole.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/b65adeafe5.jpg"><strong>When is #Vault7? -</strong></a> Posted Feb. 5th, 2017. A picture of an F-119 engine. The Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 (company designation PW5000) is an afterburning turbofan engine developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney for the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor advanced tactical fighter.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/b65aebfe9f.jpg"><strong>Where is #Vault7? -</strong></a> Posted Feb. 6th, 2017. A picture of the Merkers salt mine. Merkers-Kieselbach is a former municipality in the Wartburgkreis district of Thuringia, Germany. The Merkers area of the municipality is famous for its salt mine, which is now exploited as the Merkers Adventure Mines visitor attraction. Here large amounts of Nazi gold, and many stolen works of art were discovered by the United States Army in 1945. General Dwight D. Eisenhower himself went into the mine in April 1945 in order to examine the find.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/b65af1b823.jpg"><strong>Who is #Vault7? -</strong></a> Posted Feb. 7th, 2017. A picture of Chelsea/Bradley Manning, Julian Assange, and Edward Snowden. Three extremely famous whistle-blowers.</p>

<p><em>Chelsea Elizabeth Manning</em> (born Bradley Edward Manning, December 17, 1987) is a United States Army soldier who was convicted by court-martial in July 2013, of violations of the Espionage Act and other offenses, after disclosing to WikiLeaks nearly three-quarters of a million classified, or unclassified but sensitive, military and diplomatic documents. Manning was sentenced in August 2013 to 35 years&#39; imprisonment, with the possibility of parole in the eighth year, and to be dishonorably discharged from the Army. On January 17, 2017, President Obama commuted all but four months of Manning&#39;s remaining sentence; she is scheduled to be released on May 17, 2017.</p>

<p><em>Julian Paul Assange</em> (born 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer, publisher and journalist. He is editor-in-chief of the organisation WikiLeaks, which he founded in 2006. He has won numerous accolades for journalism, including the Sam Adams Award and Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism. Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006 but came to global prominence in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks, provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. In November 2010, a request was made for Assange&#39;s extradition to Sweden, where he had been questioned months earlier over allegations of sexual assault and rape. Assange continued to deny the allegations, and expressed concern that he would be extradited from Sweden to the United States due to his perceived role in publishing secret American documents. Assange surrendered himself to UK police on 7 December 2010 and was held for ten days in solitary confinement before being released on bail. Assange sought and was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012. Assange has since remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, and is unable to leave without being arrested for breaching his bail conditions. In 2016, WikiLeaks published the DNC leaks and the Podesta emails during the United States presidential election, 2016.</p>

<p><em>Edward Joseph Snowden</em> (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer professional, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the United States government, who copied and leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 without prior authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance, with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by other publications including Der Spiegel and The New York Times. On June 21, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property. On June 23, he flew to Moscow, Russia, where he remained for over one month. Russian authorities granted him asylum for one year, which was later extended to three years. As of 2016, he was still living in an undisclosed location in Russia while seeking asylum elsewhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgsafe.org/c9039166e3.jpg"><strong>How did #Vault7 make its way to WikiLeaks? -</strong></a> Posted Feb. 9th, 2017. A picture showing Stasi surveillance of mailboxes in Berlin. When mailboxes were being observed by Stasi agents, every person posting a letter was photographed. Some films found in the Stasi archives also show persons dressed in civilian clothing emptying the mailbox after the conclusion of the surveillance action. Mass surveillance in East Germany was a widespread practice throughout the country&#39;s history, involving Soviet, East German, and Western agencies. On 8 February 1950, East Germany saw the establishment of the Ministry for State Security (Ministerium f√ºr Staatssicherheit), commonly known as the Stasi. The Stasi sought to &quot;know everything about everyone&quot;. Its annual budget has been estimated at approximately $1 billion. Out of a population of 16 million, the agency kept files on nearly 6 million of its citizens. The Stasi had 90,000 full-time employees who were assisted by 170,000 full-time unofficial collaborators (Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter); together these made up 1 in 63 (nearly 2%) of the entire East German population. Together with these, a much larger number of occasional informers brought up the total to 1 per 6.5 persons. People in East Germany were subjected to a variety of techniques, including audio and video surveillance of their homes, reading mail, extortion, and bribery.</p>

<p>Has implications which aren&#39;t really backed up by that video.  Did you watch the video through?  He went around with the guy, essentially his caretaker, how does that make him a nazi collaborator?</p>

<p>Obviously I did a google search but couldn&#39;t find anything about him being a &quot;nazi collaborator in his youth&quot;.  I understand people want to demonize him but why not use facts and things he&#39;s actually done instead of exaggerations and hyperbole? </p>

<p>You probably shouldn&#39;t ever scold someone for asking for a source/proof.  Especially shouldn&#39;t when it&#39;s something that isn&#39;t widely known/believed.  Sometimes someone wants to understand why someone believes something so it&#39;s good to get their sources.</p>

<p>&quot;Whether I was there or not, <strong>I was only a spectator</strong>, the property was being taken away.  <strong>I had no role</strong> in taking away the property so I had no sense of guilt&quot;</p>

<p>Do you just wanna timestamp where he says he actively sought out and confiscated jews?  BTW he would have been 14 when you&#39;re claiming he was &quot;confiscating jews&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a part of the problem and I think your view is incredibly stupid.  If you&#39;re going to assert something as fact you should be able to back it up.  Especially on a sub like this that discusses shit that isn&#39;t always easily google-able.  </p>

<p>When I google it and don&#39;t find anything agreeing with you I come back and ask for sources.  I then get told &quot;just google it&quot;.  No skeptical person is going to believe this bullshit if a google search turns nothing up and if no one can source shit.  </p>

<p>You should want people to ask for sources, specifically if the thing being discussed isn&#39;t an accepted fact.  If the objective is to spread truth then you want people asking for sources.  If the objective is for everyone to believe what they&#39;re told and circklejerk then fine, carry on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You tried but you missed my points entirely</p>

<p>Person A makes a claim</p>

<p>Person B searches for evidence of claim but can only find things tangentially related to said claim.  No direct evidence of claim.</p>

<p>Person B asks person A for evidence so person B can understand where A is drawing their conclusions from.</p>

<p>Person A says &quot;fuck off there&#39;s evidence everywhere&quot; (there isn&#39;t)</p>

<p>If person A just gives person B their source for the claim they can then go on to discuss the merits of the claim and whether the source proves the initial claim.  Instead A and B argue over some stupid unrelated shit because A won&#39;t just link the fringe site where they found their theory</p>

<p>Again, as I&#39;ve said before.  It&#39;s one thing if what person B is asking for is something easy to find.  Or if it&#39;s a well accepted fact.  It&#39;s another if you&#39;re discussing something fringe or debatable.  </p>

<p>And if we&#39;re back to the soros stuff, no one has been able to actually source anything proving the stuff they&#39;re claiming.  I&#39;ve been linked to the same damn interview 4 times where he says he was 14 and had no actual role in the shit people are trying to say he was doing.  He was born in fucking 1930 how much profit could he have made off of the holocaust? (The holocaust ended in 1945 (if you believe in the holocaust that is - I have a feeling you don&#39;t)).  You guys come off like a bunch of retards when you make these stupid ass claims, get mad when people call you out, and then continue to believe this shit.  This is what happens when you watch too much infowars.  I&#39;ve watched this stupid fucking interview 5 times now and it doesn&#39;t say what you autists think it says.  I&#39;m guessing you watched the Alex jones (who claims the 14 year old soros made hundreds of millions from the holocaust) version where he added his own unfounded/unverified/unsourced commentary?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you fucking kidding me?  That &quot;article&quot; is pure shit.  It attributes words to soros that he doesn&#39;t say during that interview.  If soros is so terrible why do we have to make so much shit up about him?  Why even link me to the shitty AIDS-infested page?  Why not just link me to the interview?  The interview in which he doesn&#39;t actually say the shit that you retards attribute to him.</p>

<p>SOROS: No, not at all. Not at all, I rather enjoyed it.</p>

<p>KROFT: No feelings of guilt?</p>

<p>SOROS: No, only feelings of absolute power.</p>

<p>^ he doesn&#39;t say that ^</p>

<p>The article also claims he said 1944 was the best year of his life.  I was unable to find anything to back that up for some reason.</p>

<p>Maybe I want your source so I can show you how shitty it is and how you&#39;re buying into the exact bullshit you people claim to be against.  Why be so gullible when it&#39;s something infowars says but suddenly you&#39;re a master skeptic if it&#39;s snopes?  Why not hold everything to these standards instead of only particular sites?  Is it because you want a narrative instead of reality?  I guess reality is less fun and exciting so you have to believe bullshit and not even consider if you&#39;re being fed propaganda/disinfo as long as it comes from your favorite sources.  </p>

<p>Can&#39;t we at least try and be objective and analyze the source material instead of reading some dumbass&#39;s take and misquotes?</p>

<p>And yeah, when you type the way you do you&#39;ll come off unhinged.  You&#39;re creating arguments out of thin air.  Where did I say anything about him profiting from the holocaust?  Which by the way is also insane since he was like 15? when it ended.</p>

<p>&quot;Whether I was there or not, <strong>I was only a spectator</strong>, the property was being taken anyway.  <strong>I had no role</strong> in taking away the property so I had no sense of guilt&quot;</p>

<p>And again, he was 14.  Never said anything whatsoever about profiting from the holocaust.  You&#39;re inserting your own meaning into his words.  You want him so badly to be what you build him up to be that you take every single thing he says out of context.  Unless I missed something in which case I&#39;m sure you can timestamp it for me.</p>

<p>If this dude&#39;s as bad as you say he is you shouldn&#39;t need to exaggerate.  You could even just quote his own words </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I need to continue spoon feeding you? It&#39;s one video, where he admits working for them, &quot;as a spectator following his guardian as he did his job&quot; and admits it help his fortune and he feels no guilt for it.</p>

<p>In other quotes he admits he knew where people lived, as well as third parties who say he knew where jews lived. </p>

<p>So as an apprentice, not a spectator...because what spectator profits? He profited and says &quot;if it wasnt me itd be someone else I pride myself on being the innovator&quot; </p>

<p>Like what are you arguing? He did nothing wrong? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just it though, where are you reading this? I don&#39;t trust MSM any more than you do, but I still want to know where you read this? If you have done the research, then share it! It&#39;s fine if you want to make &quot;new points&quot;, just present them as your own belief and not as researched facts that you cannot back up. I realize it is hard to source conspiracies but you clearly states you saw him in an interview stating this. That makes it a fact if he admitted it, so I want to know where and when he did so. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to do if you really saw it and aren&#39;t just drawing your own conclusions. It isn&#39;t too much to ask for facts to be represented by facts and not theories. It&#39;s our job as a free thinkers to be skeptical of all information presented to us weather it&#39;s from you or the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPmKmfULrGI&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">The source is an interview where these people take all of his words and twist them</a>.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away. I had no role in taking away the property so I had no sense of guilt&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had already found that interview but it doesn&#39;t back up the shit these people are claiming.  So I assumed they must have some other shit on him.  To call him a &quot;nazi collaborator&quot; from that interview is fucking ridiculous.  And then I found Alex Jones&#39;s take on that interview in which he claims soros profited hundreds of millions from the holocaust&quot;.  He was 14 when the holocaust ended.  I&#39;m not some Soros defender, I&#39;m extremely neutral towards him, but if this is the best they got how can I be sure they aren&#39;t exaggerating all of the other shit they say about him?</p>

<p>I&#39;m very open to having my mind changed, but when you have to twist shit and exaggerate you lose credibility.  Not to mention the incredibly shitty sites that were linked as evidence (which straight up attributed quotes to soros that he objectively didn&#39;t say).</p>

<p>I know that people here like to exaggerate and make something out of nothing.  That&#39;s why I like to ask for their source so I can go through and show them why they&#39;re being a dumbass and misinterpreting things.  The things they think are solid evidence are alarmingly weak.  Plus they get upvoted meaning others aren&#39;t actually checking the sources.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done with this sub though.  Absolute skepticism when it comes to government narratives.  No skepticism toward shitty sites, random youtube videos, alex jones, etc.  They&#39;re probably easier to manipulate than the people they call sheeple.  And I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that certain (baseless) narratives are being pushed so hard.  </p>

<p>Who = who was it given to them by? (whistle blowers - world changing ones at that)</p>

<p>Why = why did they whistle blow? (because the story we were told was a &#39;fabrication&#39;)</p>

That date is the last day of the world UFO conference. Here is a link to the FBI Vault 7 UFO file (its a long one mentioning crystal winged craft created for one way atomic bombing missions, a one world government run by the Ancient Three (&quot;who were, who are, and who will be&quot;) and a base in Antarctica - this is from the late 1940&#39;s. <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/UFO/UFO%20Part%207%20of%2016/view#document/p5">https://vault.fbi.gov/UFO/UFO%20Part%207%20of%2016/view#document/p5</a>  </p>
