       You say something in reddit news and some shill checks your posting history, and see that you post in /conspiracy a lot and thought to himself," This shilling job is too easy when you can just say someone is crazy and everybody else jump on the crazy bandwagon and dismisses the poster simply because they've been conditioned to believe conspiracy do not exist and if you think it does it makes you cray cray.

       I generally like reading conspiracies but when people think the Earth is flat, and then you are associated with those people.... Makes it hard to take someone seriously.  So basically, yeah, that's why I'd say people use it as a bad thing.

       Here's the thing. The original flat earthers were non-believers and they had government sponsored resources to develop convincing materials. There is nothing wrong with you, it is that the material is well designed to be convincing. We are on what I believe the 3rd or 4th iteration of believers though. The first is psyop. The second are pure moonbats. By the 3rd and 4th you are getting people that are as convinced by everyone else's conviction as anything else to take a harder accepting look at the carefully crafted material.

       This is the mental firewall. When this happens, I've found the only way through is to thoroughly insult the intelligence of the person.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can trigger an emotional response, it will provide an opening to discuss specific facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Act quickly, for the effect is short lived.

       This only works on people who are actually intelligent, in my opinion.

       The latest trend from the "Harvard crowd" is to write a FB post about how they are really interested in reaching out to Trump supporters to heal, then a barrage of replies saying that anything they do to enhance the bubble they live in being "with her" is totally justified because politically disagreement is so abhorrent.

       I'm sorry this happened to you. People can be real ass holes without even realizing it sometimes. However, they did teach you a valuable lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
       This illustrates a phenomenon I call self-policing. Where enough members of society are trained to think a certain way, and harshly criticize anyone who does not think that way. It's a mechanism used to promote group think and keep individualist thinkers in line. It's the same thing that got Socrates killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a tip I've found useful. When I am going to mention something
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       related (especially IRL), I will preface it by saying "Let me put on my tin-foil hat for a moment.." This basically pre-empts the attack that you are crazy by acknowledging ahead of time that what you are going to say might sound a little crazy, and that you know it's just a theory and aren't presenting it as fact. Works wonders.

       Because people are born with the insanity of being self assured that the information they were given by their parents and trusted figures during their upbringing is unquestionably correct.

       You either break the ceiling of this mental prison at some point or you wallow in its depths your entire life. It is possible to peek outside and return to the cage as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that being religious discludes you from having broken through but that if one has never questioned and doesn't continue to question daily all that one knows, then you are still in the cage.
