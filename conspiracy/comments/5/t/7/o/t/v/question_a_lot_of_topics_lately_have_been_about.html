       I have come to realize that the elites most powerful weapon of control  is the laughter of the ignorant..  
 
Branding people  conspiracy theorists  marginalizes and smothers  different opinions...  CIA and others fueling conspiracy with false information and false flags. All to keep their secret that like the Wizard in Oz their power is an illusion.  
Recently many conspiracies are blowing up… is this all a coincidence or are we in an information war?

       I would argue that they are twisting and manipulating peoples perception of the TERM "conspiracy theorists" rather than branding people with the term itself.   I believe it is the duty of each individual to investigate happenings and come to their own determination regarding what is going on.  Many people call themselves conspiracy theorists and I am sure MORE people would, if it weren't for a negative connotation with the term.

       here's my explanation... When any human tries to describe something using language, a lie has to happen between the senses and the tongue.  The senses interpret a stimulus perfectly (effectively).  But to get that interpretation to another persons ears, it must be translated to human language.  The translation is inaccurate.  It's a lie and all language is a lie.  If you don't believe in demons etc that's good because it was probably another human who told you about demons etc.  However, at this point it's probably safe to say that all our senses are telling us that something fucked up is going on.  All you really have to say is "I feel it".  All of us are feeling the same thing too.  I don't know what "it" is, and I would have to lie to you to try to describe "it".  Be prepared for epic strangeness in any event...

       Just because there is zero reason to believe in Satan or the occult doesn't mean the elites don't have some weird religion based on those concepts. Think of them just like fundies from any religion, complete nutters.

       Remember this maxim: If I can make you believe in absurdity I can make you commit atrocity?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe that you are possess during a ceremony and you commit an atrocity. You are not responsible for the act anymore. Therefore it's easy to manipulate someone to do the unforgivable. And then through cooptation make them do what ever you want!

       Easy answer: You're wrong. Lucifer is real and the fallen angels and demons spoken of in religious texts are real. The space program and other things are faked in order to lead mankind away from the notion of a creator. Everything is meant to make you believe we are nothing but stardust, helplessly floating through a seemingly lifeless universe. It's all bullshit. It's all fake. It's all for you.

       But this term is an intentional misuse. It comes from the Latin Vulgate, meaning Morning Star. The Bible does not actually call Satan Lucifer, it's based on a misreading of Isaiah 14, which refers to a human king.
      </p>
      <p>
       The misuse is intentional, because many occult religions worship Lucifer.

       Quote me where I said my only source is the mainstream KJV Bible. Otherwise this point of yours is irrelevant. Lucifer, Iblis, Yaldabaoth, whatever name you want to use, this entity is in most major religions and is not just a passing reference. Check out the Gnostic gospels and Nag Hammadi library as a whole.

      <p>
       It's quite directly relevant. Satan is not the Morning Star, or the Light Bringer. That mistranslation comes from Jerome, who was probably a mystery school initiate himself. It's a Latin term, not in the Greek or Hebrew.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible never says that Satan (the accuser) is also the Morning Star. That term is only applied to Jesus. But mystery school adherents tried to trick everyone into thinking Satan was the Morning Star, therefore Jesus is Satan/Lucifer, and that YHWH is Satan.

       I'm aware of these, and I don't necessarily have a problem with esoteric Christianity, so long as they are not spreading intentional misinformation. I'm thinking of people like Jordan Peterson.

       The gospel of Thomas is pseudepigrapha written around 160AD for the purpose of pushing the con I showed you above. The rest are even later than this.
      </p>

       Jesuits (mystery school adherents) invented the lie that the Gnostic gospels were suppressed because they were true. It's quite obvious that the Gnostic gospels are late fakes, and the canonical gospels are the ones written within the 1st century.

       The writings of the early church. They discuss which books they are using extensively. We have no copies of the Gospel of Thomas until much later than the canonical gospels.

       Necessary, but not sufficient. If the book is written in 160 AD, it could not have been written by Thomas. If it was written around 70 AD, it could have been written by John.

       There is a story in the Nag Hammadi called Untitled Text, On the Origin of The World that retells the story of Genesis; it has Yaldabaoth, but Yaldabaoth is God, only he is a blind and jealous god. He creates man. He forbids mankind from eating of the Tree of Knowledge because he knows that immortal man with combined with wisdom will become god(s), and he is afraid and jealous. There is no Satan in this story; there is the Wisest of all Beasts, called the instructor or the teacher; he is not evil in this version and is a different character than Satan.

      <p>
       In moral and ethical reasoning, there is a difference between failing to condemn a thing and condoning it. The Bible explicitly forbids maiming your slaves. This is not approval of slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       The historical context is important, too. In a society like that,  voluntary indentured servitude was a last resort to avoid starving. It's ugly, but that's how things were.

        However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way. (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)
       </p>
       <p>
        If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years.  Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom.  If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year.  But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.’  If he does this, his master must present him before God.  Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl.  After that, the slave will belong to his master forever. (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)
       </p>
       <p>
        When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl’s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.  If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment. (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished.  If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property. (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ. (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)

       Tell me again how it doesn't endorse slavery.

       I could go on the rest of your points but that right there disproves your claim that the Bible is a moral book. Right there it condones slavery, tells you how to do it, and how you can beat your slaves.

       Oh, and here's a quote by Jesus himself:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he refused to do it.  “But people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly.  Much is required from those to whom much is given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is given.” (Luke 12:47-48 NLT)

       Is a law decriminalizing marijuana endorsing the smoking of marijuana, or merely tolerating it?
      </p>

       And again, you have to look at the context of what slavery meant then. This was indentured servitude, not intergenerational racial slavery like the South.

       So why doesn't the bible say "Hey, remember that slavery thing we condoned? Yeah we don't like that anymore?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Because,  as Christians claim, it's the immutable (see unchanging) word of God. It's amazing that being gay will get you sent to hell, but owning and beating your slaves will not.

       It's valid here. You literally don't know the basics of what you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've reiterated multiple times that the Bible should be interpreted without reference to context, "because it's the Word of God."
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally no one believes that. No one. At all.

       Not Evangelicals. Not Catholics. Not The Unitarian Universalists. Not Jews. Not Muslims. Not Agnostics. Not Atheists. Not Discordians. Literally no one believes that, and you have quadrupled down on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are illiterate about the matters you're discussing, your arguments have been demolished multiple times, and you THINK you're really smart because you can troll your internet atheism around.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're in severe danger of losing your mortal soul. These are not laughing matters, but you treat this with less seriousness than I pick candy at the movie theater.

       It's amazing that you can accept and attempt to justify. that the Bible condones slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government told you how to get weed, how to use it, how not to get in trouble with it, they're condoning it. The Bible does the same with slavery.

       You completely missed the point of what I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slavery used to be moral. Now it's not. That shows that there is no objective good or evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Murder used to be ok when justified. It's ok in scientology under certain conditions. It's not evil to them; therefore, by definition, murder is not objectively evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Objective means "not influenced by
       <strong>
        personal feelings or opinions
       </strong>
       in considering and representing facts."
      </p>
      <p>
       Your morality is directly influenced by the society around you. It's not innate. If it was, the idea of what is and isn't moral would not change over the course of human history

       No, what I'm saying is regardless of what society feels is moral, there is an objective truth to this universe. There is an objective moral good. There is an objective moral evil. Humans have a hard time discerning what's what and justify evil with religion or mental gymnastics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get what you're saying, I really do. I've had this conversation many a times baby. Just because times change and people hold different views of what's good and what's not doesn't change the fact that slavery or rape or whatever is evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are dumb man, we can goes hundreds of years thinking we know everything, just to have one realization that changes the way we think forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say my morality is determined by the society i grew up in. The society I grew up in claims to be on the moral high ground all the time, but time and time again prove that they have no idea what they are talking about. My society has failed me. And you, I don't care if you're US or not. Our societies have proved they don't care about personal and spiritual growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say morality would not change if there was a moral good. I'd like to see you expand on that, I don't feel like you got all your points across.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you can't see right now it doesn't mean it's nonexistent :)

       Also, by you claiming society has no clue what they're talking about in terms of morality, and keep changing what they view as moral, is exactly my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slavery used to be moral. Burning people at the stake used to be moral. In some places the middle east, it's moral to stone people to death. If there were objective morality, people would not do these things.

       Didn't downvote you dummy.  To put it in terms of a dogma that might be more familiar with think of the devil as dark matter.  Basically a term for something that human understanding cannot comprehend.  Measured in much the same way by observing the effects it has than direct observation.

       Carl Jung did a comprehensive study across the world and found such things as evil spirits universal across cultures.  These archetypes are a way for the mind to picture things that it cannot quite understand yet also manifest in the physical world often times.  If you really seek a scientific understanding of such things I suggest starting with Jung's seminal works.  The question isn't whether or not Satan exists but what is the ultimate reality of it's existence.

       That's still picking a side, pick A or B, good/evil, God or the Devil! Just follow the programming language (yes, exactly like a computer) like a good little character. Like playing world of Warcraft, pick horde or alliance, pick a role, play your role, join a group, join a bigger group! You are both enemies, but you also have common enemies, but you aren't allowed to team up! Oh and also fight each other constantly at the same time. Grind away to earn money, complete tasks to get stuff. Soon as you max out, the next best thing is out, gotta get back on your grind! Money can't buy everything either, gotta work together to get the best things in the game! Don't worry about yourself, you are insignificant alone and need to play your roll and do your job!

       All you gotta do to keep people playing is to change up the visuals and type in bigger numbers to fool the person into thinking they are getting stronger, advancing, when in reality you stay pretty much the same relative to where you started.

       Think of it as what THEY believe. It doesn't have to be true for them to be motivated by it. Consider a radical Islamic suicide bomber, clearly motivated to take real actions by an arbitrary religious belief that they clearly truly believe in. The controlling elite are no different except that they believe in different madness and take different actions.
