       You need to understand that the entire idiotic heliocentric model as it stands today is a whole series of fabricated bullshit events that supposedly happened.

       The big bang. 
Nothing exploded and created everything. (Please use the scientific method and repeat this in a lab to prove it). Post link here:

      <p>
       Gravity 
Show me an object in nature that attracts other objects by virtue of it's mass alone. Repeat and test using the scientific model. Post results here:
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution 
So some inert matter magically transformed itself into a living organism. So this not only happened once, it had to happen twice in the same place to create a male and a female of said organism. Your odds on this are already incalculably small, and yet this had to happen hundreds of thousands of times more. Really? Again show me where this has been recreated in a lab. Turn some sand into a fish me for please, feel free to use as much lightning as you need.
      </p>
      <p>
       (By the way your big bang and evolution stories are starting to sound A LOT like a religious creation story don't you think?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Outer space. 
Planets. Aliens. Asteroids and meteors These things all form part of the big bang idea, show me proof of aliens, show me video of a predicted meteorite or asteroid hitting the earth. Nasas "planets are all just CGI bullshit, the stars looks A LOT different when not being filmed by NASA.

       Most of what we have been taught is wrong. That you have nuclear weapons on that list makes the whole thing seems bunk though. Have seen the theories for all the other ones and many have reason to consider them possible at the least, but no nuclear weapons? So what happened in Hiroshima then exactly?

       That makes that whole list seem like a troll post.

       Hiroshima did in fact get bombed but it wasn't a nuke , the film footage you see of Hiroshima was actually a propaganda film to show the US enemies that the US had nukes but the US actually didn't. (Maybe) When I find the source for this I will pass the info on to you it's been years since I stumbled upon that theory , op is a troll though and this is a troll post with expectation of karma and gold

       But think about it... Hiroshima and Nagasaki are well populated areas. What about nuclear fallout and "uninhabitable for thousands of years"? Also the Japanese surrendered 4 or 5 days after the bombings. Check out the US nuclear test videos, they look staged AF.

       The concept of a spherical earth is very old, it dates around the 6th century BCE. The first practical demonstration was done by the Portugese explorer Ferdinand Magellan during his first circumnavigation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The realization that the figure of the Earth is more accurately described as an ellipsoid dates to the 17th century, as described by Isaac Newton in Principia.

       I don't know about that. The first circumnavigation was from 1519 until 1522, so I don't think so. What is your source for that date? Maybe he was inspired by those globes?

       we can take pictures of the earth from space and its round. That is the proof, though as was said magellan proved it when he sailed all the way around the earth.   It was ballsy and scary at the time because people though he would sail off the edge, but when he made it back safe he proved the earth was round.

       Flat earth is real but wrong at the same time. We technically perceive it as flat (or, we should) with our eyes but the reality is our universe is holographic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres huge truth with flat earth. It is the ultimate red pill. Learn the truth about your physical reality/boundries, and youll be able to control any and every paradigm youre exposed to.

       yeah I think people get hung up on the terminology. it's our world of duality - either it's a globe or flat. even though it's neither. All our observations tell us it's flat, but still no one really knows. at least not the general population.

       why would anyone claim the earth is round if it is in fact flat, if the earth was truly flat why would anyone dispute that? Whats the cover up? Why would anyone want to hide the fact the earth is flat?  What  purpose does it serve to claim the earth is round if was in fact flat , what could possibly be gained ? And who is doing all this lying about earth being round and why

       Since you're not very bright, I'll try and lay it out for you. But you will just reply with some other idiotic comeback or question without submitting any proof of your own ridiculous model. So, get ready, rub those two remaining brain cells together and lets get this party started.

       You need to understand that the entire idiotic heliocentric model as it stands today is a whole series of fabricated bullshit events that supposedly happened.

         <em>
          The big bang.
         </em>
         Nothing exploded and created everything. 
(Please use the scientific method and repeat this in a lab to prove it). 
Post link here:

       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          Gravity

         Show me an object in nature that attracts other objects by virtue of it's mass alone. Repeat and test using the scientific model. Post results here:

        <p>
         <em>
          Evolution
         </em>
         So some
         <em>
          inert matter
         </em>
         magically transformed itself into a living organism. So this not only happened once, it had to happen twice in the same place to create a male and a female of said organism. Your odds on this are already incalculably small, and yet this had to happen hundreds of thousands of times more. 
Really? Again show me where this has been recreated in a lab. Turn some sand into a fish me for please, feel free to use as much lightning as you need.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

         <em>

         </em>
         These things all form part of the big bang idea, show me proof of aliens, show me video of a predicted meteorite  or asteroid hitting the earth. Nasas "planets are all just CGI bullshit, the stars looks A LOT different when not being filmed by NASA.

       Here are some questions to ask yourselves in regards to FE:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         When you look through a telescope at any of the other planets for long enough, why are you able to see them and their moons clearly as round, with a shadow cast as a ball has a shadow, right in front of your eyes?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>

      <p>
       IF we can all at least agree that the OTHER planets and moons we look at are round, (since each of you can look at them yourselves and clearly see that they are with your own eyes), is it more likely or less likely that Earth would be an exception among all of them, and be the only planet that behaves differently?
      </p>
      <ol>

         Or does FE claim that Earth is not a planet, but something else entirely???

         If the earth is flat, why is it that Euclidean Geometry does not work to obtain the shortest path over long distances (such as those traveled by airplanes)?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       9a. To further that question, how can it be that a parabola actually produces the shorter route, if the surface is not curved? Why does only non-Euclidean geometry work for determining shortest travel distances over long paths? Are you claiming such is not the case?

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Are you then claiming that we can launch ourselves into space by flying perpendicular to the "earth's upward acceleration?" merely by flying off over this ice wall?

        <p>
         Also then describe how it's possible that so many photos could be so SEVERELY distorted by a regular lens so as to make a flat object look round, with parts of it fully behind other parts of it and not exposed to the camera, while objects adjacent to it are hardly distorted at all.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

        <p>
         If you're willing to accept even one photo of anything ever at all (that you didn't take yourself), why are photos of the round earth excluded?

       <li>

         If we're not accepting photographs, please at least explain the most likely reason why there have been NONE of a flat earth, EVER, and ONLY photos of a round one.

         If the earth is not round, and planets not round, then why have we had to use spherical/orbital calculations in order to successfully land rovers on other planets? Are you claiming that we have not done such?

         If the earth is not round and gravity does not exist, then what keeps us from losing our atmosphere and ocean?

         Since the atmosphere would surely be above such ice wall, what prevents it from spilling off over the sides of the earth, into space, as the earth accelerates up toward the atmosphere?

         If the earth is flat, then how is it that if I fly in any direction along a straight line from any point and don't stop, I will eventually return to exactly where I started from? Do you claim that this will not occur?

         Astronauts have been to space and claimed to have looked at an unmistakably round earth. If you reject their photographic evidence, do you also claim they are lying or delusional about what they have seen??

      <p>
       There is no measurable curvature of the earth, and every notable scientific experiment proves the earth is motionless.

       Remember we are talking about the heliocentric and geocentric models.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire heliocentric model (from the big bang through to modern man), rests upon the shoulders of the theory of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything that forms part of that model gets disqualified if there is no proof of curvature, or the motion of earth or gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you realize how much curvature there is supposed to be on earth, is when things start getting interesting.
