<strong>THIS IS WHY FLAT EARTH IS THE MOST HEAVILY DEBATED ARGUMENT ON THE NET. IT&#39;S THE BIG KAHUNA, AND IT WILL BRING THE ENTIRE HOUSE OF CARDS DOWN.</strong></p>

<p>You need to understand that the entire idiotic heliocentric model as it stands today is a whole series of fabricated bullshit events that supposedly happened.</p>

<p>The big bang. 
Nothing exploded and created everything. (Please use the scientific method and repeat this in a lab to prove it). Post link here:</p>

<p>Gravity 
Show me an object in nature that attracts other objects by virtue of it&#39;s mass alone. Repeat and test using the scientific model. Post results here:</p>

<p>Evolution 
So some inert matter magically transformed itself into a living organism. So this not only happened once, it had to happen twice in the same place to create a male and a female of said organism. Your odds on this are already incalculably small, and yet this had to happen hundreds of thousands of times more. Really? Again show me where this has been recreated in a lab. Turn some sand into a fish me for please, feel free to use as much lightning as you need.</p>

<p>(By the way your big bang and evolution stories are starting to sound A LOT like a religious creation story don&#39;t you think?)</p>

<p>Outer space. 
Planets. Aliens. Asteroids and meteors These things all form part of the big bang idea, show me proof of aliens, show me video of a predicted meteorite or asteroid hitting the earth. Nasas &quot;planets are all just CGI bullshit, the stars looks A LOT different when not being filmed by NASA. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp1TxJhHpZQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp1TxJhHpZQ</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/q6q4_7cIYWY?t=57">https://youtu.be/q6q4_7cIYWY?t=57</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=flat+earth+stars+p900">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=flat+earth+stars+p900</a></p>

<p>Dinosaurs 
Show me a t-rex skull that you dug up. Here&#39;s a 101 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dinosaur+hoax">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dinosaur+hoax</a></p>

<p>Let me guess you also believe that crude oil is a &quot;fossil fuel&quot; (rotten dinosaurs). Show me in a lab how a a carcass rots away and turns into crude oil. What a joke.</p>

<p>Stephen Hawking 
<a href="https://youtu.be/ETufPiw5oOQ">https://youtu.be/ETufPiw5oOQ</a> S
tephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stephen-hawking-als/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stephen-hawking-als/</a>

    <div class="md"><p>Hiroshima did in fact get bombed but it wasn&#39;t a nuke , the film footage you see of Hiroshima was actually a propaganda film to show the US enemies that the US had nukes but the US actually didn&#39;t.

<p>But think about it... Hiroshima and Nagasaki are well populated areas. What about nuclear fallout and &quot;uninhabitable for thousands of years&quot;? Also the Japanese surrendered 4 or 5 days after the bombings. Check out the US nuclear test videos, they look staged AF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why would anyone claim the earth is round if it is in fact flat, if the earth was truly flat why would anyone dispute that? Whats the cover up? Why would anyone want to hide the fact the earth is flat?  What  purpose does it serve to claim the earth is round if was in fact flat , what could possibly be gained ? And who is doing all this lying about earth being round and why </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you&#39;re not very bright, I&#39;ll try and lay it out for you. But you will just reply with some other idiotic comeback or question without submitting any proof of your own ridiculous model. So, get ready, rub those two remaining brain cells together and lets get this party started.</p>

<p>You need to understand that the entire idiotic heliocentric model as it stands today is a whole series of fabricated bullshit events that supposedly happened.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>The big bang.</em>
Nothing exploded and created everything. 
(Please use the scientific method and repeat this in a lab to prove it). 
Post link here: </p></li>
<li><p><em>Gravity</em>
Show me an object in nature that attracts other objects by virtue of it&#39;s mass alone. Repeat and test using the scientific model. Post results here:</p></li>
<li><p><em>Evolution</em>
So some <em>inert matter</em> magically transformed itself into a living organism. So this not only happened once, it had to happen twice in the same place to create a male and a female of said organism. Your odds on this are already incalculably small, and yet this had to happen hundreds of thousands of times more. 
Really? Again show me where this has been recreated in a lab. Turn some sand into a fish me for please, feel free to use as much lightning as you need.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(By the way your big bang and evolution stories are starting to sound A LOT like a religious creation story don&#39;t you think?)</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Outer space. Planets. Aliens. Asteroids and meteors</em>
These things all form part of the big bang idea, show me proof of aliens, show me video of a predicted meteorite  or asteroid hitting the earth. Nasas &quot;planets are all just CGI bullshit, the stars looks A LOT different when not being filmed by NASA.

<p>Let me guess you also believe that crude oil is a &quot;fossil fuel&quot; (rotten dinosaurs). Show me in a lab how a a carcass rots away and turns into crude oil. What a joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some questions to ask yourselves in regards to FE:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When you look through a telescope at any of the other planets for long enough, why are you able to see them and their moons clearly as round, with a shadow cast as a ball has a shadow, right in front of your eyes?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you able to see their moons orbit them if they are not round?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you able to see Saturn&#39;s rings encircle its globe if it&#39;s not round?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you able to see their poles change angle toward you in three dimensions if not round?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you able to see the large planets like Jupiter and Saturn clearly spin about their axes if not round?</p></li>
<li><p>How are you able to see them pass behind the Sun if not orbiting it?</p></li>
<li><p>These are all things that you, personally, can go and look at plainly through common telescopes. So:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>IF we can all at least agree that the OTHER planets and moons we look at are round, (since each of you can look at them yourselves and clearly see that they are with your own eyes), is it more likely or less likely that Earth would be an exception among all of them, and be the only planet that behaves differently?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Or does FE claim that Earth is not a planet, but something else entirely???</p></li>
<li><p>If the earth is flat, why is it that Euclidean Geometry does not work to obtain the shortest path over long distances (such as those traveled by airplanes)?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>9a. To further that question, how can it be that a parabola actually produces the shorter route, if the surface is not curved? Why does only non-Euclidean geometry work for determining shortest travel distances over long paths? Are you claiming such is not the case?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why must GPS satellites calculate positions based on a sphere in order to perform accurately?</p></li>
<li><p>What is Sunset on a flat earth? How could it occur geometrically and still explain how half of the earth is night and half day?</p></li>
<li><p>Please describe the ice wall that you&#39;re saying exists instead of the south pole. How high is it? Can one fly over it? When one does fly over it, does one fly off into space?</p></li>
<li><p>Are you then claiming that we can launch ourselves into space by flying perpendicular to the &quot;earth&#39;s upward acceleration?&quot; merely by flying off over this ice wall?</p></li>
<li><p>How far does the ice wall extend? Has anyone ever walked upon it? Is there evidence of that walk?</p></li>
<li><p>Has the FE ice wall ever been documented as observed in any way? Anything? Even one photo or report from the field somehow?</p></li>
<li><p>Please describe your competence in what lens distortion is and how it works, especially to varying degrees of severity.</p></li>
<li><p>Also then describe how it&#39;s possible that so many photos could be so SEVERELY distorted by a regular lens so as to make a flat object look round, with parts of it fully behind other parts of it and not exposed to the camera, while objects adjacent to it are hardly distorted at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you saying that literally ALL photographs ever taken of the earth have been faked or subject to extreme lens distortion?</p></li>
<li><p>If we are not accepting photographic evidence of RE, do you believe ANY photos of ANYthing whatsoever? Ever?</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re willing to accept even one photo of anything ever at all (that you didn&#39;t take yourself), why are photos of the round earth excluded?</p></li>
<li><p>If we&#39;re not accepting photographs, please at least explain the most likely reason why there have been NONE of a flat earth, EVER, and ONLY photos of a round one.</p></li>
<li><p>How do seasons occur if we are not on a ball, axially tilted toward a central light and heat source?</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the phases of the moon, and what causes them, if not orbit and rotation.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the tides, and what causes them, if not gravity and orbit.</p></li>
<li><p>If the earth is not round, and planets not round, then why is it that we must use calculations based on orbits of round objects in order to place satellites into space adequately?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is it that we can see those satellites orbit us with a common telescope, and how do they lose direct line of sight if not dropping behind the curve of a round earth?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is it that we must calculate based on those orbits and related signal loss to make our phones work?</p></li>
<li><p>If the earth is not round, and planets not round, then why have we had to use spherical/orbital calculations in order to successfully land rovers on other planets? Are you claiming that we have not done such?</p></li>
<li><p>If the earth is not round and gravity does not exist, then what keeps us from losing our atmosphere and ocean?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the seas supposedly contained by this ice wall?</p></li>
<li><p>Since the atmosphere would surely be above such ice wall, what prevents it from spilling off over the sides of the earth, into space, as the earth accelerates up toward the atmosphere? </p></li>
<li><p>If the earth is flat, then how is it that if I fly in any direction along a straight line from any point and don&#39;t stop, I will eventually return to exactly where I started from? Do you claim that this will not occur?</p></li>
<li><p>Astronauts have been to space and claimed to have looked at an unmistakably round earth. If you reject their photographic evidence, do you also claim they are lying or delusional about what they have seen??</p></li>

<p>There is no measurable curvature of the earth, and every notable scientific experiment proves the earth is motionless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember we are talking about the heliocentric and geocentric models.</p>

<p>The entire heliocentric model (from the big bang through to modern man), rests upon the shoulders of the theory of gravity.</p>

<p>Everything that forms part of that model gets disqualified if there is no proof of curvature, or the motion of earth or gravity.</p>

<p>When you realize how much curvature there is supposed to be on earth, is when things start getting interesting.</p>
