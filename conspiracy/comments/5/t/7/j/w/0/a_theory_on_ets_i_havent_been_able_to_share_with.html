       First, please excuse my rambling.  I've had a theory regarding Aliens, advanced tech, etc.  Please hear me out and then feel free to poke holes in everything.  I apologize in advance if this has been discussed already.
      </p>
      <p>
       1st lets discuss simple light reflection.  As we know what we see everyday is just reflection of light.  Theoretically if I could walk faster that the speed of light I could turn around and see myself walking to "catch up".
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on that, isn't it possible that Alien life is nothing more than an advanced human race capable of traveling faster than the speed of light?  And we essentially past forms of them possibly thousands of years in the future?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it also possible that since Aliens are perceived to have no designated sex that our current changes in society might support that (the normalization of transgenderism, homosexuality, etc)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it also possible that since Aliens are perceived to have telepathic communication that our current advancement in technology leads us down this path where we stop communicating verbally (smart devices, inserts, etc) that evolution at some point would take over?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible they are visiting more frequently (most likely traveled once and now stay close by) because we are on the verge of self destruction and they will at some point intervene to ensure their survival?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for listening to my rambling.

       There are theories that aliens are just future humans trying to "fix" their reality by changing the timeline here/now. It's a good explanation for why aliens seem very interested in our nuclear weapons, and seem to discourage their use. It's also a good explanation for why there are abductions that seem to be researching reproduction.

       No. That's not how that works. If you suddenly went the speed of light You'd just get longer, not make a copy of yourself. As you get closer to the speed of light, things lengthen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there's time dilation to deal with. If I'm here standing still, and you suddenly went relativistic next to me, then according to you there's only been a minuet of time, but to me that could be years or decades depending on how close you were to the speed of light (the closer you go, the more time passes for me).
      </p>
      <p>
       So it does not seem plausible that aliens can both move faster than the speed of light and talk to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of methods to cheat the system to go faster than the speed of light, though.

      <p>
       There's no real good theories on how to go into the past that I am aware of. For the aliens to be future versions of us, simply traveling fast won't do it for some of them to be here now.

       Evolution takes too long for us to really predict what effect tech will take on us. Humans tend to adapt their environment to them, not the other way around.

       Maybe they aren't coming more frequently, but we're just getting more aware / better at recording things?

       I just read (a month or so ago) that science has proven that time only goes one way therefore there is no possible way to visit the past or whatnot. In other words, if they were somehow the future of humanity, they wouldn't be able to interact with us (who would technically be in the past according to your theory)
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a scientist or anything, but I don't think traveling faster than light you would be able to see yourself if you turn around. Your physical being is still traveling as fast as you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are visiting more often I assume it's because we're extremely self destructive.
      </p>
      <p>
       My 2 cents.

       Go to r/holofractal and look at the unification of quantum physics stickied. Also, research tesla and his work. You can go faster than the speed of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       First though, watch James allen's documentary called Zero Point: The story of Mark McCandlish and the Fluxliner. There's a part where they go into detail on how extremely high voltage electromagnetism is utilized to make antigravity and faster than the speed of light travel is possible. Study the fundamental forces of physics: electromagnetism, strong force, gravity and see how they relate.

       This is great! I've always had a similiar theory; one  my old high school science teach wasn't entertained by. If you think about what we'd look like in a million years, or our capabilities,  it's hard not to conceive.

        Is it possible they are visiting more frequently (most likely traveled once and now stay close by) because we are on the verge of self destruction and they will at some point intervene to ensure their survival?

       This part doesnt make any sense. If they exist, then we are not on the verge of self destruction, because well they wouldn't exist. Unless of course the mistakenly came back and made some changes that are threatening their future existence.

       good point...thank you.  I haven't dug into the details, and I know there would be a lot to decipher but wanted to get a feel for the generalities of it.

       You are fundamentally misunderstanding the theory of relativity. The point is that
       <em>
        Time
       </em>
       is relative at high speeds - you never see yourself "catch up" - because of time dilation.

       From what I've seen on the grey aliens, and that they have no discernable sex: they appear to be organic robots. Which would make sense if they were sent here to act like robots or probes, a bit like a more sophisticated version of the rovers that NASA sent to Mars. Also bear in mind that our current scientists are developing working mechanical devices that are made from organic matter, neural networks etc. So a group with more advanced technology than ours could plausibly build them.
