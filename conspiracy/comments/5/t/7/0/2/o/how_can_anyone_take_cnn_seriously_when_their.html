       Memes are just a modern and more democratic version of a slogan/soundbite idea.

      <p>
       It is not like we have not been fed
       <a href="https://vimeo.com/40612032">
        carefully researched soundbites
       </a>
       for decades through mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Taxation is theft"
"Death tax"
      </p>
      <p>
       We had slogans like that researched by the likes of Heritage foundation (BTW, did you know that our beloved David Brock was a fellow at The Heritage Foundation?) to push a specific agenda, basically ideological advertising campaigns funded by the richest people in US for a very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I believe the best way to counter a slogan/soundbite is with another slogan/soundbite that highlights the problem with the soundbite you disagree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with the internet and meme culture I believe we are seeing a real pushback against that kind of ideological advertisement.

       Whats scary is when someone like TheFederalist.com lists out everyone ELSE's fake news/misreported news without addressing any other websites of the same ilk.   They spun it as though the media is always constantly, purposely lying, yet in every single instance, the media org came back and issued a correction.  Granted, they made a good point of people not seeing the correction, but I'm SURE there are a million examples on the other side of the aisle as well.

       You're a pile of shit and a massive douchebag.

      <p>
       <em>
        Correction: it has come to light that you're probably actually a pretty chill dude, no harm or offense intended.
       </em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Corrections don't matter. First impressions matter. Presenting whatever thing Trump did today—no matter how mundane—as reprehensibly evil causes a strong kneejerk reaction in readers/viewers, who have been conditioned to
       <em>
        expect
       </em>
       this sort of coverage about literally every single little thing Trump does. They get outraged and/or scared as a result, and subconsciously tie these emotions to Trump's name and face in their minds permanently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people don't read past the headline to begin with, and only a fraction of those who do will see the correction appended a day or two later.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole "make inflammatory headline but then retract it a few days later after the damage is already done" bullshit is really getting bad lately, and few people seem to care about the greater effects that such irresponsible sensationalism are having on society.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Please don't report this post for rule-breaking; the inflammatory language at the top is there to make a point about how words can make you feel strong, impulsive emotions, and how "correcting" such inflammatory statements after the fact does nothing to quell that immediate rush of emotion.)

       I agree with you.  Corrections don't really matter, unless you're trying to link the story after the fact to prove a point, and it clearly states the correction at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, to counter argue, corrections DO matter, because it shows, at the very least, a willingness to admit when you're wrong, and fix it, which is something a certain President does NOT do.  And, when the President of the US is tweeting an article showing that his voting group trusts his word over the media, is even further frightening because there is NEVER a correction on his part.  Which, to me, shows a president not willing to admit when he's wrong, and who's willing to publish anything he wants to say without any truth behind it, and never suffer the repercussions of his bullshit.  And I don't spend much time at right-wing websites, but this particular article made no mention of anything Pro-Trump, which is more my point, in that it's a tactic to propel themselves "Up".  They say everyone else is wrong, never mentioning their buddies, and by default, people assume these other Media channels (breitbart, federalist, Fox) never publish anything BUT the truth, which is false as fuck.

       It's called: keeping up with, and picking the important things out of, Trump's chaotic daily shitstorms.  Which is definitely Bannon and Trump's media strategy.  As a Sanders voter, I hate to say it, but CNN is fucking

       So because Trump is literally Hitler, you don't mind that they attack him even though they attacked your candidate of choice who was not nearly as corrupt or vile as Hillary? I mean, I hate both of them, but I think it's pretty clear Bernie is at least less corrupt than Hillary, right? But hell, as long as they're flinging shit at Hitler that's what matters, right? Hell yeah Jake Tapper! Not that they're scandalous liars who border on the psychopathic to maintain their grip on power. They lie in just about every segment, they give false impressions, incorrect facts, they omit, lie, leave out and filibuster even the smallest hints of truth that reach the air. These people are some of the most detestable human beings I can even think of. The lying media whose job it is to confuse you and to sew chaos on behalf of those who run this country. But yeah, dude! Tapper is really laying it on Trump! DAE small hands LUL! DRUMPF

       Why are you even on this sub if you can't see past the presidential ruse? What is Trump doing that you are so afraid of that any other presidential candidate wouldn't have done? You do understand that the President doesn't even do that much anymore, right? They're more of a figurehead position now as anything of any real importance is taken care of by the deep state or the intelligence agencies. You don't really think Donald J. Trump is running the show, do you?

       The executive branch has more power every president. It's been a consistent trend, with the only pullback being the judicial and legislative branches. With a republican majority in all branches and trump seemingly actively trying to completely discredit the two pillars that can stand up to the executive, (the media and the judicial branch), while escalating seemingly unfounded claims to cause fear, (which will likely result in more executive power), is certainly concerning.
      </p>

       The president is putting himself in a situation may very well

       I love this narrative that it's not watched. I think you're maybe basing that on US ratings figures. In reality, global ratings are orders of magnitude larger than the top domestic news agency.

       Because this is how the people have been conditioned to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Top 10, 5 things, etc are now a common way for our society to become informed from companies, media, and other outlets. It's quick, it's easy, there's not a lot of substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't think critically anymore, we read all 5 points and take them at face value to be 100% accurate and true, they would never lie would they?
      </p>
      <p>
       We'd rather news and others tell us how to "feel" rather than reading or listening to something un-biased and drawing our own conclusions..
      </p>
      <p>
       I think "Conspiracy Theorists" in a nut shell have been able to break that mould just by being skeptics. Skepticism means that you have to think critically and question what you read, hear, or see.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a fine balance between the two that we must strive for, but listening to other people around me has been a big wake-up call for myself, I've seen that so many people in the world don't ask the simple questions: Why? How?
      </p>
      <p>
       In an age where information is at our finger tips, on our phones, our TV, our radio, our computers, it's more important, now than ever, to question the validity of things, to ask those big picture questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until then, those 5 things we need to know today from CNN is our news. It's how millions of people learn and digest information. And, it's pretty dystopian.

       They're just appealing to the lower common denominator by giving the biggest headlines of the day in an easy to read, simplistic format. Don't forget CNN is competing with BuzzFeed (ridiculous) and Facebook news (utter bullshit).

       While I'm sure some will see the 5 and think they are done for the day, I see this more as a starting point for most people. While I'm not crazy about CNN, getting news from Facebook is much worse in my opinion.

       News places have done this for awhile. Years ago when I still used the AP app they had a daily roundup of the 10 things you should know know today that happened yesterday and it was fairly good on events. I imagine it's become 9 things Trump did that's horrible and 1 actual event now though.

       CNN thinks Buzzfeed lists of 5 , 10 things, is the way to go. Can't make that shit up if you wanted to.

       Why bother wasting thoughts on CNN. I mean how many people in your day to day RL affairs talk 'substance' about what they watched on cable pop MSM?

       Most people in this subreddit get their news from facebook and blogs, an youtube videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Here's five things to know" is a common thing I've seen on a few sites. NYT has something like "What you should know this morning" and then it's just a list of news stories that are happening.
