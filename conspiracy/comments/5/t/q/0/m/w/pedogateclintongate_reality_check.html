<p>If this is what we think it is, it&#39;s the crime if the century. Hillary/Bill Clinton and Co. are accused of everything from money laundering and child trafficking, to selling arms to warlords and toppling governments for financial gain. </p>

<h1>The motherload on all things Clinton/corruption George Webb&#39;s series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/georgwebb/videos?view=0&amp;sort=da&amp;flow=grid">https://www.youtube.com/user/georgwebb/videos?view=0&amp;sort=da&amp;flow=grid</a></h1>

<p>As you can see these are big accusations to be throwing around with even bigger implications. So right off the bat we have to understand that bringing that kind of corruption to justice is going to take a lot of time and a lot of serious intervention and action on the part of the FBI, DOJ, and the House oversight committee among others. The fact that the Clintons and their crew have been running the political game for going on 30 years has made it impossible for any of those agencies to be effective in delivering justice.  examples : </p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3933">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3933</a> <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/justice-department-pledges-quick-work-on-renewed-clinton-email-probe-230552">http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/justice-department-pledges-quick-work-on-renewed-clinton-email-probe-230552</a></p>

<p>(These are just a few examples of their relationships with key people, I mean Bill was President/Governor and Hillary was FLOTUS, Senator, and Sec of State. Doesn&#39;t get much more in power than that)</p>

<p>When the people in charge of handling these situations are implicated themselves nothing will happen. Not to mention being wary of the effect it will have on the relationship between the people and government.</p>

<p>But now that there is a new administration and the accused have lost control over the DOJ, the avenues for the investigation have opened up. We are only a few days into the new Attorney Generals DOJ and it would take in my opinion, a couple weeks at least to get organized and familiarized with the details of an investigation of this scale. This goes for the house oversight committee as well. They both need time to go over everything and make their reports/conclusions. This, however, also requires that they have all the pertinent information available to them. This means they need the 650,000 emails from the FBI. They were supposed to turn in all evidence on the Clinton Investigation that had been stored on their Datto Inc. Cloud storage drive by last Friday. <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-27-JEC-to-Comey-FBI-Datto-Emails-due-2-10.pdf">https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2017-01-27-JEC-to-Comey-FBI-Datto-Emails-due-2-10.pdf</a></p>

<p>So if they (FBI) did do this, the Committee now has the 650,000 emails and has to go through them all. Half a million documents that need to be heavily scrutinized as they could pertain to national security or a number of on going investigations. The FBI themselves said they needed 5 years to go through them (which I don&#39;t believe frankly). The point is it&#39;s going to take time.</p>

<p>Assuming the DOJ gets its new legs and starts going through the emails (if they have them) around the same time that the House Oversight Committee gets going on their investigation (sometime this week) then I think it&#39;s healthy to not expect anything to come out of the US gov/Justice system about this for at least a couple of months. The sheer amount of data to process is one factor that makes me think this but there are other big moving parts to this that have made me come to this conclusion. </p>

<p>There is an ongoing investigation into Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company. It has been revealed that they were so deeply involved with corruption and bribery of international governments that they had a department devoted to it within their company.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/odebrecht-to-pay-2-6-billion-to-settle-bribery-claims-1482325309">https://www.wsj.com/articles/odebrecht-to-pay-2-6-billion-to-settle-bribery-claims-1482325309</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/odebrecht-and-braskem-plead-guilty-and-agree-pay-least-35-billion-global-penalties-resolve">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/odebrecht-and-braskem-plead-guilty-and-agree-pay-least-35-billion-global-penalties-resolve</a></p>

<p>From the DOJ release:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Odebrecht and Braskem used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unit—a ‘Department of Bribery,’ so to speak—that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Suh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under their respective plea agreements, Odebrecht and Braskem are required to continue their cooperation with law enforcement, including in connection with the investigations and prosecutions of individuals responsible for the criminal conduct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you read the whole release it details how the company was part of a massive bribery scheme where they gave out nearly a billion dollars in bribes to foreign politicians and businesses to obtain contracts. </p>

<p>We at least know that Odebrecht donated to the Clinton Foundation as they appear here on the $50,000-$100,000 donor category <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%2450%2C001%20to%20%24100%2C000&amp;page=6">https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%2450%2C001%20to%20%24100%2C000&amp;page=6</a></p>

<p>A little bit on the problem the Clinton Foundation causes when Hillary became Sec of State <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/29/clinton-foundation-allows-two-way-bribery/">http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/29/clinton-foundation-allows-two-way-bribery/</a></p>

<p>A little bit on the Clintons and pay to play <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/11/clinton_pay_for_play.html">http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/11/clinton_pay_for_play.html</a></p>

<p>Then we have Odebrects contracts and projects in America 
<a href="http://www.odebrechtusa.com/projects">http://www.odebrechtusa.com/projects</a> </p>

<p>Quite a few </p>

<p>and then their projects in Libya 
<a href="http://www.odebrecht.com/en/marcelo-odebrecht-visits-odebrecht-projects-libya">http://www.odebrecht.com/en/marcelo-odebrecht-visits-odebrecht-projects-libya</a> 
<a href="http://www.odebrecht.com/en/libya-airport">http://www.odebrecht.com/en/libya-airport</a> 
<a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=odebrecht+libya">https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=odebrecht+libya</a></p>

<p>And then we have this email exchange between Clintons lawyer Cheryl Mills, and Thomas Shannon, US ambassador to Brazil
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/12907">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/12907</a></p>

<p>In the emails there is concern raised by Mills about Brazils government not finding it necessary at the present time to recognize the newly formed Libyan Transitional National Council as a legitimate government. Thomas Shannon writes back and in his reply he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What surprises me about this public standoffishness by Brazil is that its companies have big contracts at stake, and these
companies, <em>Odebrecht</em> in particular, brokered the initial contacts between the GOB and the TNC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will work back through these companies to urge them to
reach out to Patriota.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is clear concern for the status of the contracts in Libya, particularly for Odebrecht.</p>

<p>So to sum that up we have a Brazilian company busted for having a department dedicated to bribing foreign politicians and businesses to the tune of nearly a billion dollars. That company has given money to at least one facet of the Clinton organization (between $50,000-$100,000) but as the DOJ stated they had a very sophisticated system to hide the payments. And we know Clinton has engaged in pay to play schemes. We then have this company receiving many contracts in the USA, Libya and other areas of Clinton influence. Followed up by Clintons top people, such as her lawyers, handling issues that would be a problem for this companies contracts by using access to ambassadors and foreign ministers. </p>

<p>Because of all this I believe that the Clinton&#39;s will also be implicated in the Odebrecht bribery investigation and the DOJ House Oversight Committee and FBI will all have to coordinate with this international investigation. Further complicating and slowing things down. </p>

<p>The bottom line of all of this is that this is a massive investigation that has implications that will rock the entire world. Nobody is nor should they be trying to rush through this. It has to be done right. We will probably start seeing the effects on the lower levels in waves continually over the next few months in relation to the various rackets (trafficking drugs kids etc). It&#39;s important to remember that PizzaGate is not just about child porn or child abuse, it&#39;s about an international trafficking ring. Podesta and Alefantis may very well be caught up in it but there are 10 layers of scum to get through first. This will take time. Be patient and expect nothing but disappointment as it will most likely not go down as as expect it to. Manage expectations because all we can do right now is continue to dig and wait. </p>

<p>Edit: I should add that I wouldn&#39;t get high hopes for the human trafficking investigations as long as Feinberg is in the White House. Clinton and crew will likely take the fall for it in one way or another and Dyncorp will try and weasel out. </p>

Clintons situation is truly dire for a number of reasons and these &quot;rich guys&quot; you talks about are going to set up her up as the scape goat for the heat. You best believe it. This has nothing to do with Trump and Sessions won&#39;t even be involved I expect he will have recuse himself due to conflict of interest. There is far more in play here than you seem to be aware of. There will be a fallout to all of this. Will it be a spectacular flaming blitzkrieg of justice ripping through the ranks of the deep state and corrupt/criminal politicians? Not a chance. Will some very notable people be in a lot of trouble for some very notable events? Most likely. </p>

<p>And people are dreaming if they think they are going to get anything about 9/11 out of trump. Please don&#39;t try and throw all that stuff in and Group me in with that crowd based off of your assumptions. Try arguing my actual points. Like Odebrecht investigation. </p>

<p>You realize that there is massive investigations going on and people are being held responsible for corruption? And you&#39;re wrong to think this is up to Trump or Sessions at all. I get what you&#39;re saying about Rep. and Dem. being just as equally involved but you don&#39;t seem to realize that it&#39;s reached a critical tipping point. SOMEONE has to go down for what&#39;s in the 650,000 emails because they are coming out regardless of the actions of the justice dept. I&#39;m not some moron sitting here waiting for them to &quot;bust all those damn lefties&quot; I&#39;m someone who&#39;s paying attention to what&#39;s going on. And you really haven&#39;t done your research and it showing pretty obviously. You just cling to your idea that you&#39;ve got it all figured out and because it&#39;s a bipartisan issue nothing will happen. Call me names if you want and still ignore my arguments. You didn&#39;t refute anything you just trumpeted your opinion. Koch brothers are also low on totem pole</p>

<p>Those guys are examples of real players. As long as Feinberg is in the White House Dyncorp will never go down for anything but someone has to and you best believe they will set someone up for the fall. </p>

The fact we were pulled from the brink does have serious, long term unattended injustices that have become unbearable to tolerate. But, daily executive orders and newly appointed do need a couple of days. I guess we just want to know that HC is not cozily planning a run for NY mayor Bec she knows this will be overlooked. </p>
