    <div class="md"><p>There was a story on NPR last night about social movements. Guy brought up the Tea Party at one point--(context was kinda about pictures used demonstrating just how many people are showing up)At first a fair bit were showing up--and pics were used to show how it was a real grassroots movement..But eventually people burned out and they stopped using pics bcus instead of them showing a real grassroots movement--all they were really eventually showing was a bunch of empty grass lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s fair enough to believe. I was just going back and looking at a yt vid of a Tea Party rally in my town in 2010. A couple of my best friends are even in it. But in a town of roughly 15-16k and prob. easily 3x if you don&#39;t contain it to the strict city limits--there were maybe 50 people at the big rally. I forget what the paper reported at the time but it was a small number. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something people often misunderstand: spiritual awakening isn&#39;t an event which occurs overnight, in regards to both the individual or global populace. It&#39;s a slower event which occurs as individuals pick up tidbits of information here and there and piece things together themselves, and as that happens to more and more people globally then naturally consciousness slides into its next state. It&#39;s a lateral transition, not a vertical jump. Becoming what you already know as opposed to jumping into the unknown. In the same way that the young &quot;you&quot; was thinking &quot;oh I&#39;ll never be x or y when I&#39;m older&quot;, and then one thing leads to another and the next thing you know you&#39;re where you thought you&#39;d never be... But it feels natural. And you&#39;re still &quot;you&quot;. Like you know what you&#39;re doing in this position. And that&#39;s because you do, because to get from a to b you didn&#39;t jump there, you transitioned slowly and organically. That&#39;s just how natural change occurs. On the rare occasions in which grand change does occur overnight (a la 9/11) you can take it with good confidence that this was not a naturally occurring thing. This type of change was engineered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of things. I&#39;ve been looking into this for the past decade and I always hated new agers, so up their own asses with the way things should be. </p>

<p>If you know of the great cycle 26,000 years, Mayan calendar. We&#39;ll we&#39;re going into the age of Aquarius out of Pisces. 13,000 years ago was the last major ice age directly across the zodiacal calender from us. Imagine it like a pendulum swinging and we&#39;re just finishing swinging out of the masculine side and now entering the feminine side. This changes the polarities of how our minds work. We have two hemispheres in the brain. The masculine logical, mathematical side and the feminine intuitive, creative side. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more to this that involves potentially aliens, archons, secret cults, gods and much more. </p>

<p>I&#39;m more than happy to share more thoughts on this if you want to PM me as there is a lot of information and I doubt I do it any justice in one reply. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it&#39;s a tough one. A lot of people are polarized by religion. Think of how many comments on videos about conspiracies are full of people saying &quot;Jesus Christ is the Savior and the only way&quot; and while I&#39;m not against the idea of Christ or the lessons he taught you have just as many people saying the church is brainwashing you all. </p>

<p>I grew up going to a very small Christian church that I felt was a lot more about building community than pushing an agenda. I feel a lot more people need to view everything with objective view and see what truth they can find in whatever teachings, science, religion, conspiracies, art. Never be afraid to ask questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s got me wondering is why now, why us, and is it <em>only</em> happening to conspirators? Or more specifically, only frequenters of this sub? Are we the only ones with opened enough minds to handle it? Is it from an outside force? If so, good or evil or neither? Might it actually be some sort of conspiracy? Or is it the natural next step following the depression of &quot;waking up,&quot; like a sort of acceptance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not just this place, there are many &quot;awake&quot; subs, some much more than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. And outside of Reddit, people have been waking up for decades so it has nothing to do with this website. In fact I would say imageboards have done more for the awakening than any other places on the internet and reddit has mostly hindered people, especially lately with all the censorship and narrative building. </p>

<p>As for our minds, I don&#39;t know about you guys but I know mine is different from others and I do not integrate well into society. I feel like a literal space alien around my peers, and isolation has left me with a lot of time to explore topics most people are too busy to even think about. My friends, family and acquaintances do not function mentally the same way I do and I&#39;m sure its probably the same for a lot of people here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve considered that I have been being led to something by an unseen force, and I can&#39;t disregard that possibility. Could be a really smart group of people, could be a literal demon, who knows. I&#39;m not sure I believe in good an evil tbh, most things seem to be both or neither. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the next step is, but consider the depression we all faced a long time ago when we first discovered our reality was a lie, and remember that the rest of the world will have to go through this phase too. We have to be there to help them when the veil is finally lifted (if it ever is).</p>

<p>Some folks on 4chan seem to have turned a sad frog named Pepe into a powerful sigil to an ancient deity. </p>

<p>It&#39;s insane that if you look into the ancient Egyptian god Kek you can see that it some fits so perfectly to what has been done. He&#39;s a frog god of chaos that has an obsession with numerology.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, someone asked me if I really think happiness is the right word. Well I think it&#39;s a kind of victory dance happiness, a good turn in the war that brings a sense of satisfaction and maybe even hope. From my point of view, humans aren&#39;t used to this feeling. It is a new thing, comparable to a world war only, but the enemy isn&#39;t another nation or a natural catastrophe... The enemy is a part of what it means being human itself, and any win against it is also like a vision of what we could become. </p>

<p>The supra-elite are probably just people with a damaged brain (functional psychopaths) that learned how to domesticate and control other types of human identities and states of consciousness.  We see things like that, evil but genius, all the time.  Well, no surprise something cold and organized can emerge from the anthropic ecosystem.</p>

<p>Our only way to oppose this intra-species predator is to wage a mythopoetic war against suffering while employing a realistic strategy aimed at gradual increases in the quality of all life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can all be cyborgs or aliens or enhanced clones, whatever we want, that&#39;s fine. What&#39;s important is that people get to make these decisions for themselves and not be persecuted if they deviate in some way. Fundamentally it&#39;s no different from &quot;race&quot; relations.</p>

<p>What&#39;s been wrong for easily 500 years is that someone lied. They said, &quot;You&#39;re better than them.&quot; People listened and kept listening, because it made them &quot;special.&quot; Snowballing in a genuinely insidious way. </p>

<p>The bright side is we already have lots of great fixes for these problems. Those in power undermine solutions as they form. It&#39;s happened time and time again. These solutions are able to be undermined because they try appealing to the middle man, as if he has power, instead of his boss.</p>

<p>Indeed parasites exist.</p>

<p>Realistically it&#39;s going to take &quot;someone,&quot; some &quot;people,&quot; on the inside to turn and sabotage. Exposing the lie in it&#39;s modern form and revealing the cracks. Combined with an initial critical mass with the courage to refuse to play along until everyone gets what &quot;they&quot; have. Without that, we&#39;re just hoping, not knowing what to hope for.</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; can&#39;t do it with out us, not yet, but that will soon change. </p>

Sure the oppression/inequality/injustice is showing now more than it ever has done, and none of the &quot;camps&quot; seem to be happy, but on an individual level I&#39;ve been able to see past that camp mentality. It only serves to further divide the people. Fundementally, human values don&#39;t change. What do we want? Food, water, shelter, love. Basically that&#39;s it. Everything else isn&#39;t necessary, but it&#39;s a decent bonus. But don&#39;t let the camp mentality, and crony advertising make you think that without all these extra material possessions or without having your way be the way the world works will result in your unhappiness. They&#39;re filling your head with that. That&#39;s not you. To break free from those mental chains and begin to find happiness you must first change your outlook on life rather than your circumstance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Innocent people do die unfortunately. Proportionally we see more of it these days due to the media, but proportionally the numbers of innocent people being killed and enslaved are down. In the western world though enslavement starts on the mind. If you truly believe that you need what the system is &quot;providing&quot; for you then you are going to end up unhappy and unfulfilled, constantly grasping for that next thing the elites say &quot;you can have this and it will make your life better! Just work a bit more and one day you can afford it!&quot; Break free of that mindset and you&#39;ve made the first step to real freedom.<br/>
As for those getting killed by bombs and dictators in &quot;3rd world&quot; countries and such, it&#39;s unfortunate and pretty sad because as individuals (assuming you&#39;re just an average Joe like me) there&#39;s not much we can do. We can turn the TV off and imagine it&#39;s not happening (out of sight out of mind - lol), we can keep the TV on and see it and donate to the &quot;charities&quot; that are &quot;helping&quot; those people (oh yeah, even though only about 0.02% of the money actual goes to those in need) Or we can keep it in mind, but since there&#39;s nothing we can immediately do to help, just put it to the side and direct the majority of your attention to what you can immediately effect and make better. Thankfully with the Internet an individuals sphere of influence is rather much larger than it would be 20-30 years ago. We can tackle the root causes of suffering (corporate globalist companies) instead of the symptoms (people dying in a middle eastern country) by boycotting those companies (nestle, Unilever, etc) and spread information of what we&#39;re doing and why over the Internet to spread that. We can also just treat the people we come into contact with on a regular basis better, reduce the judging thoughts we have about others, giving people more compliments on a daily basis, and encouraging that kind of right mindfulness in others over social media or what platform you feel comfortable doing so from. Those small, positive interactions we share have a butterfly effect on society. Slowly but surely. This isn&#39;t the quick fix to end suffering because there is no quick fix in nature. This is the slow, steady, yet long term solution to end suffering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before we move on to the other ideas emerging here. My main question for you is: What is making you feel the happiest you&#39;ve felt in years?</p>

<p>Assuming from your thoughts above that you practice grass roots philanthropy in some way. Do you see that making some headway from a material standpoint? Or is it just ideological progress — people becoming &quot;informed&quot; — from everyone seeing things get worse and worse materially? Do you feel people are finally building the courage for &quot;The Revolution?&quot; While I feel that is on the rise. We need more at this point. We need action. Not just courage to think about action that leads to revolution. While the internet does allow for great communication, it&#39;s not going to be revolutionary unless we actually start acting on the information. The internet can create a great deal of false accomplishment.</p>

<p>People can boycott all they want. Since governments are still signing billion dollar contracts with nestle and the like, the effect of boycotts aren&#39;t enough. The corporations just get money through taxes. The marriage of corporate and state must end. This requires breaking laws in many cases.</p>

<p>We&#39;re on an ecological time crunch. We can&#39;t just wait for everyone to be &#39;educated,&#39; and talk nice in the meantime. That&#39;s not enough. Nature does have a quick fix. Extinction. The health of life in general is taking massive blows due to human activity. Even if we had a quick fix, other than extinction, things will still get much worse before they even have a chance at getting better.</p>

<p>Change requires ongoing persistant action. Hope simply requires creativity.</p>

<p>Nothing about all this is sure, all that&#39;s certain is that any meaningful progress has been slow, and can easily be reversed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s personally made me happy is how I&#39;ve changed the way I act in my own life. After getting myself relatively well read in Buddhism and Hinduism and metaphysics (I was already a big &quot;mainstream&quot; physics nerd), learning lucid dreaming and astral projection, and having a psychedelic experience or two I came to the realisation &quot;this temporary reality is not all there is. This is relatively nothing.&quot; so I changed the way I view the exteral world and how I react/respond to it. I used to get so angry and often depressed about politics and conspiracies and shit the mainstream media blasted out. But I realised there&#39;s no point. Whatever happens after I die, none of this &quot;reality&quot; will matter. I need to focus on learning about myself and practicing how to be the best me that I can be. I came up with this philosophy (which I&#39;d later find out is almost identical to something the Buddha said - not trying to big myself up lol, just pointing out it must be a significant realisation) if there&#39;s a problem and I can change it for the better then do that. If I can&#39;t immediately change it, but can get someone else to do something regarding it to make it better, then do that. If there&#39;s nothing in my power that i can possibly do to make it any better then leave it be. Accept it and take it for as it is right now. Worrying about it now provides no use, need, nor help.<br/>
After that fundemental philosophical change in my mind things just started to fall into place after bit by bit. I decided to stop being a dick to my family when I got annoyed at them, and mended those relationships add best I could (once again - no need for it. I only want to spread positivity now on that personal level). I also decided to not lie anymore. I&#39;d observed too often the downward spiral that happens when someone white lies to cover a white lie to cover another for someone&#39;s &quot;protection&quot; and it&#39;s a thing or of soap operas. It&#39;s ridiculous. That can be avoided by not lying in the first place. Sure it might hurt them a bit in the moment, but at least they&#39;re now in the know and you&#39;re not gonna end up a week from now trying to cover your ass despite it being impossible as they&#39;re uncovering all the lies you told them for no good reason.<br/>
I try and practice sustainable mental living, I&#39;m making the change in my life to minimalism and getting rid of needless junk, I&#39;m spending more time filling the ol brain box with information as opposed to filling my room with junk, and yeah I&#39;m keeping an eye on the state of the world but where possible I do my part to help make it a better place. Whether it&#39;s online or in person. Sign a petition here, share a link there, attend a protest here, give a homeless guy a scarf there. Little things, you know?<br/>
I&#39;m just not worried about time running out anymore. Death isn&#39;t the end. And &quot;life&quot; (at least this &quot;physical&quot;, 70-100 year thing we can life) isn&#39;t all there is to existence. The mind is not a product of chemical reactions in the brain, it exists beyond our physical constraints, but the brain and all its chemical reactions is just a method for our physical form to process the mind. Like the brain is the cpu, and the mind is the code. I dunno, I feel like I&#39;m rambling now. Did I answer your question? I hope so. If not then ask me again haha. Sorry if there&#39;s any spelling mistakes I&#39;m writing this off my phone. Have a nice one, friend :)</p>

<p>True happiness comes from within. Absolutely. This life we get to live is not all there is. Absolutely. Personally all these things you&#39;re talking about resonate.</p>

<p>There is something in your power, everyone&#39;s power, happiness is just the beginning. We can change everything to make it better. Deep down we all know it.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to just accept &quot;it.&quot; We can demand peace and more. We don&#39;t need to shoot for crumbs when we can shoot for the stars.</p>

<p>With great power comes great responsibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the background of what is happening, mostly just brutal causality from mishandled 20th Century technosocial shifts.

    <div class="md"><p>I can see the silent war opening on new fronts and I feel happy that humanity will probably go down fighting, not just as a blob of junk food and cheap electronics. I am even starting to have small hope that we will maybe manage to keep life on the planet going beyond the collapse in some form.</p>

<p>So I feel happy to be alive (for the first time after a long while), because this is the time I&#39;ve been waiting for for 20 years... At last I can talk to everyday people about this stuff without being ostracized and attacked. The system is crumbling and we have a chance to be a part of our destiny (even if the ecological horror on the horizon is still there, our approach to it has a different quality now).</p>

We blindly accepted the world as we were told and now with all that is coming out, we are forced to ask more questions.

And once we ask one question and do not get an answer, we ask another question.  If you start asking enough questions you really start to get an idea of how perverted our reality has become.  You get an idea of the illusion of choice....what free will really means.  You start to understand we handed over our free will to false idol politicians and our reality does not need to be shaped in this current state.  We are ready to move on from our government and politicians and they know it.  We will see where this ends up.  Keep asking questions.  Turn off your TV.  Do not listen to your government.

    <div class="md"><p>There are several possible explanations to your  increased experience of synchronicity. I will however start with saying that I have fallen through the veil into the exact same rabbithole as you. However anectodal evidence suvh as this is not and should not be used to confirm anything since self-selection of information is the driving force. Or to state it bluntly, curiosity is what leads one to chase white rabbits.</p>

<p>But if we include some other tidbits of information such as the now wildly dynamic political landscape, the massmedia&#39;s narrative brake down and the economy, we can clearly see that something larger is happening. So, let us examine a bit further.</p>

<p>First. The rise of the internet.
This is probably the most important aspect and one if the primary drivers of change. Free access to information allows us to form our own world-view mush easier than before. All subjects that were previously hidden due to their obscure, revolutionary or otherwise suppressed nature now freely roams the webb. Pornography used to be difficult to find. When I was a young boy we used to find dirty rags in the woods. Literally. Now I can find videos of more perverted nature than I&#39;m comfortable to imagine by happenstance. And the same goes for everything else. Conspiracy theories, occultism, actual economic analysis, political critiques, corruption scandals, everything. </p>

<p>So we have an enormous advantage over previous generations when it comes to sharing and participation in public discourse. With this has come the break-down of predefined truth. Realizing that mainstream discourse is full of it&#39;s own bias we trust it as much as Alex Jones, and the break-down of public trust in the authorities immidiatly follows. So we are left to find our own truths. We can no longer rely on the &quot;word of God&quot; of public authority, which pushes us out if our comfort zones and into the unknown. Behind the veil.</p>

<p>So far I have limited myself to the individual effects, but if we aggregate this we not only get a vastly more chaotic mental model if reality, but also a more comprehensive one. We then collectivly try to re-construct a mental model of reality that we feel &quot;works&quot;. This in turn pushes us into things such as holofractal universe, sacred geometry and other occult science. And given our venues of exploration as well as the view next video functionality if youtube, we all end up here. In an echo-chamber if conspiracy theories, alternative history, pythagoréan magic and occultism.</p>

<p>The total effect is that we as a society have a lot if weirder shadiws falling onto our cave wall. So weird, that we start to realize that this is in fact a cave, not the world. </p>

<p>To conclude in a few words, as well as point you in a direction. we all come back to Plato and neo-platonism because we realize that materialism doesn&#39;t actually work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is coming to light. We awake and we awake as one. They knew this would occur a long time ago. Why do you think there has been so much effort to stop this? </p>

<p>They thought they could, that is actually hilarious. The army of love has already won. The dense reality we know is dissolving away. Everything comes to light, truth reigns... let all built from hate crumble down. &quot;Like a feather, bringing kingdoms to their knees.&quot; Love is all. Love already won. Eternal Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Earth&#39;s frequency is rising, due to us waking up as a whole. Things are going to continue this way. Feelings of something big happening, feeling weird emotionally, spiritually and physically. Just a whole lot of changes in general</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is anybody actually feeling anything though? As in, physical or mental sensations they haven&#39;t felt before? I&#39;ve felt nothing along the lines of a shift into another dimensional reality. I know a lot of the info, been researching for 5 years, but I&#39;ve also been warned of the New Age farce during this period of awakening. That being kept in mind, I contemplate a lot, but don&#39;t feel a lot of effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing big is happening. It&#39;s all just rolling out quickly and your brain is overwelmed with data. We are programming to look for patterns. Recognizing patters promotes chances of survival. Reading wayy into it and obsessing will almost guarantee a bout of insanity. Hold it together cuz next week will be the same. And next month and next year and that big thing you thought was going to happen doesn&#39;t. </p>
