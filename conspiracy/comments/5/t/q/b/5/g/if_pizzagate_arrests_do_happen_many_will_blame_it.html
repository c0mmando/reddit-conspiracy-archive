    <div class="md"><p>I do not think it is an accident Trump has been called a fascist and has had ant-fascist (and many other) protests run against him, even after being elected.  The first thing CNN is going to do after these arrests is scrutinize them, and the rumors surrounding the allegations that have been spread on the internet and who has spread them are the first thing they will criticize.</p>

<p>Remember that it will be a while before the evidence is seen in court, and there is plenty of time for media to run attacks on Trump and the DOJ for making these arrests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  We have seen plenty of Trump-Hitler comparisons from his opponents.  We know he has been attacking media for lying for a long time.  There is clearly a propaganda war going on that is at a much heightened level when compared to other Republican to Democrat presidential transitions, and I feel that it is connected to pizzagate.</p>

<p>I&#39;d look for treason, corruption, RICCO, sorts of actual charges, the PG stuff will be released as part of the investigation and shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was reading an interesting hypothesis today. One guy thinks that the 119 plane thing is the European  way of writing 9/11 so it&#39;s 11/9 and that Assange is pressuring the FBI to release vault 7 or he;s gonna blow the lid off 9/11. I also know that some time ago Putin alluded to having information that would prove 9/11 was a cuck up. So there must be something about it floating out there.</p>

<p>Not sure what&#39;s in vault 7 but my guess is it&#39;s the nail in Hillary&#39;s coffin. I&#39;m sure the gov. will not release entire KP or even any KP but paper trails, perhaps redacted photos...of adults. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also this</p>

<p><a href="http://yournewswire.com/netanyahu-evidence-washington-pedophile-ring/">http://yournewswire.com/netanyahu-evidence-washington-pedophile-ring/</a></p>

<p>and there&#39;s a whole other theory on that..being Mossad was where Epstein was uploading direct camera feeds from the plane and the Island. OOPS. Bibi alluded to having complete control of the US government in a hidden camera video during the time of the Oslo Accords. There was also a woman Tzipi Manzur on twitter threatening to release a lot of data. Israeli cryptographer. I got the feeling it was a threat, do something about Trump or else. I knew there was no way Trump was going to be 100% on board with Bibi, I also knew Trump wouldn&#39;t get elected without playing 9D chess with him...so </p>

<p>This is a very deep rabbit hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit that is deep. But also reminds me of a theory I had. FBI Anon said the info was so terrible, they had to tread lightly. If they charged her it would open up dozens of other cases and expose the whole gov and he felt the entire gov was guilty of treason. Considering how the MSM and masses looked past her blatant treason the only thing I could think of that would lead to civil unrest (as he said it would) would be direct evidence 9/11 was in fact an inside job (like we know it was) but fucking rock solid evidence nobody could deny. That would send the country spiraling and would be terrible, but I sadly think something of that magnitude is the only thing that would unite the citizens as one and fight for a gov of the people, for the people and drain the swamp. </p>

<p>You all know you can&#39;t say ANYTHING on this topic. Its so fucking perfect prearranged. I bet 100% that this whole thing coming out was pre selected and its part of their agenda. There will be just one law in the &quot;golden age&quot; and its theirs. they want the people to become acquainted with this. (fucking symbolism everywhere representing the same thing over and over)</p>

<p>There are not many options. Either they were very intelligent and hated on by society and therefore worked hard back then. Or its their fucking families who build this system, who own the fucking world and who try to accomplish prophecy because of their religion
 I think it may be both. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk why are white people so overly represented?</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t it simply be that Jews practise a culture of cultivating success and higher education, leading to better paying jobs? Asians and Japanese are similarly stereotyped. In some cultures education is important to family values, as opposed to some American families that see higher education as the younger generation being &quot;brainwashed by liberal universities&quot; and &quot;teaching the controversy&quot; instead of focusing on innovation and competitiveness. The effect of education also stacks over time: parents with good jobs are more likely to have kids with degrees and good jobs also, while for impoverished peoples the window of opportunity becomes narrower. I think it has more to do with assimiliation, income inequality and the lack of quality public education than any real conspiracy to put Jews (or any other demographic) on top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as this subreddit loves to toss around the idea that the media is literally evil and wants to kill pizzagate, pizzagate-related news (when/if the conspiracy is cracked &quot;wide open&quot;) is not going to suddenly take some awkward narrative unless it&#39;s based on some actual evidence. This is actually the reason why news organizations aren&#39;t picking up on this fiasco in the first place: there is a distinct lack of direct evidence linking these high-standing figures to the kind of wrongdoing that is being suggested.</p>

<p>Yes, I know, I have read Wikileaks and I know about Comet Ping Pong. There are some really convincing pieces of information that have been gathered. The evidence is not insurmountable, however, and that is what it needs to be in order for this entire controversy to mature out of the conspiracy it currently is. Until then, pizzagate will be seen as a typical conspiracy theory and not much light will be shed on its findings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is some good news - the alleged pizzagate perps are clearly running scared.  They are making a massive amount of mistakes regarding the execution of the disinformation campaign.  I am just a regular redditor and discovered this bullshit a month ago.  I can&#39;t even imagine what kind of files the good guys in intelligence have on these people.  They seem to not realize that if the Russian narrative is their go-to defense, the people behind spreading the disinfo will just be dragged into court and asked a lot of questions.</p>

<p>I have looked into the backgrounds (and joined some of their chats) of many of the David Brock shills and most of them are young leftists without jobs that are doing this for the money.  They don&#39;t realize what kind of mistake they are making being on the wrong end of this disinfo campaign.</p>

<p>The propaganda artists believe in their head that they have a lot more power than they really do.  They certainly failed miserably during the election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m hoping people are prepared for this. This will effectively end the abuse/trafficking (at least until another perve gets up and running) but it&#39;s good too because they started with the users/dealers/and now they&#39;re heading for suppliers. They&#39;re going to just release the PG evidence. This is the best plan. (((pats self on back))). </p>

<p>No need to hide all that if they&#39;re not going to be charged with it :) I think that might satisfy the hungry pedo hunters!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was reading an interesting hypothesis today. One guy thinks that the 119 plane thing is the European  way of writing 9/11 so it&#39;s 11/9 and that Assange is pressuring the FBI to release vault 7 or he;s gonna blow the lid off 9/11. I also know that some time ago Putin alluded to having information that would prove 9/11 was a cuck up. So there must be something about it floating out there.</p>

<p>Not sure what&#39;s in vault 7 but my guess is it&#39;s the nail in Hillary&#39;s coffin. I&#39;m sure the gov. will not release entire KP or even any KP but paper trails, perhaps redacted photos...of adults. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also this</p>

<p><a href="http://yournewswire.com/netanyahu-evidence-washington-pedophile-ring/">http://yournewswire.com/netanyahu-evidence-washington-pedophile-ring/</a></p>

<p>and there&#39;s a whole other theory on that..being Mossad was where Epstein was uploading direct camera feeds from the plane and the Island. OOPS. Bibi alluded to having complete control of the US government in a hidden camera video during the time of the Oslo Accords. There was also a woman Tzipi Manzur on twitter threatening to release a lot of data. Israeli cryptographer. I got the feeling it was a threat, do something about Trump or else. I knew there was no way Trump was going to be 100% on board with Bibi, I also knew Trump wouldn&#39;t get elected without playing 9D chess with him...so </p>

<p>This is a very deep rabbit hole.</p>
