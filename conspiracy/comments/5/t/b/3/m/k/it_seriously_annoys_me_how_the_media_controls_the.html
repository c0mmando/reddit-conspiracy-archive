For me personally, whatever I read on the news isn&#39;t going to actually impact my life so it doesn&#39;t matter whether or not I believe what I read. &quot;A local kid gets stuck in a well&quot; might be something I could skim over and go about my day with but I certainly never come back to it and assert that it&#39;s false and therefore the story has me in its hold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media has the power to manipulate the behaviour and beliefs of the general public. For example we are told we are going to war to &quot;protect our freedom&quot; to fight &quot;terrorists&quot; I guess they forgot to tell us that we are going to drain the Middle East of all their fucking resources. The media literally have the power to alienate a race, religion or public figure if they want to because the majority of the public will never dare to question the truth of what they are being told.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just the media. It&#39;s been the social structure for the last 3000 years or so, when polytheism was overrun by single diety cultures. Jewish influence, then Christian/Islam, than basically the UK &amp; RCC fought colony wars. The Far East had it&#39;s own empires. The masses were lied to anytime they grew organized. The reason so many are &quot;awakening&quot; now is there&#39;s more public education and access to information. A hundred years ago, there were American public schools with compulsory elementary attendance, but a good 25% didn&#39;t attend at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it all comes down to what we believe as individuals. The example I&#39;ll use is the death of gaddaffi. We were told he was a terrorist, an evil emperor trying to destroy the west. However, after looking into this I found that gaddaffi had plans to change his countries currency to trade in gold. This would have been a big blow to the U.S. that is just a very brief description that you&#39;d be better looking into if you want to know more. But like i said it comes down to what we believe. </p>
