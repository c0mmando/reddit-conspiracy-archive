       The power of the ego is immense. We build walls based on our biases and beliefs we accumulate our entire lives. As soon as those beliefs are challenged we clam up. We shut our ears and hum until it goes away. The ego is what we must break. Chipping away small chips is better than taking a sledgehammer to the ego. It takes years with some.

       How does the media "control" the masses? For me personally, whatever I read on the news isn't going to actually impact my life so it doesn't matter whether or not I believe what I read. "A local kid gets stuck in a well" might be something I could skim over and go about my day with but I certainly never come back to it and assert that it's false and therefore the story has me in its hold.

       The media has the power to manipulate the behaviour and beliefs of the general public. For example we are told we are going to war to "protect our freedom" to fight "terrorists" I guess they forgot to tell us that we are going to drain the Middle East of all their fucking resources. The media literally have the power to alienate a race, religion or public figure if they want to because the majority of the public will never dare to question the truth of what they are being told.

       I would say that the media (specific to the "protect our freedom") reports based on what the government talks about. That entire perspective is given all the way up to the White House.
       <strong>
        In this specific case

       it's really not the media that is the ones manipulating folks.

       The very fact that we have a political spectrum goes to show that people form their own views. There's no denying that some people will actually deny some news reports (of varying degrees of authenticity) based solely on their own views.

       It's not just the media. It's been the social structure for the last 3000 years or so, when polytheism was overrun by single diety cultures. Jewish influence, then Christian/Islam, than basically the UK &amp; RCC fought colony wars. The Far East had it's own empires. The masses were lied to anytime they grew organized. The reason so many are "awakening" now is there's more public education and access to information. A hundred years ago, there were American public schools with compulsory elementary attendance, but a good 25% didn't attend at all.

       Well it all comes down to what we believe as individuals. The example I'll use is the death of gaddaffi. We were told he was a terrorist, an evil emperor trying to destroy the west. However, after looking into this I found that gaddaffi had plans to change his countries currency to trade in gold. This would have been a big blow to the U.S. that is just a very brief description that you'd be better looking into if you want to know more. But like i said it comes down to what we believe.

        It seriously annoys me how the media controls the masses. The majority hear something on the news and

       I find it pretty infuriating myself. People I care about are so absorbed in the hatred, fearmongering, and otherwise negative energies tptb thrive off of in the first place.

       "The Media" doesn't exist. Individual news sources exist. There is no one mass conspiracy of "The media." Pushing that narrative is asinine to the nth degree.
