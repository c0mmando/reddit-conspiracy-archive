    <div class="card bg-dark mb-3">
     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       11 paragraph article:
       <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-06/donald-trump-is-the-singularity">
        https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-06/donald-trump-is-the-singularity
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The article says his software is indifferent to everything, seeking only attention. So let's entertain that idea. How do you get attention? Call for hillarys arrest, sign executive orders for border walls and travel bans, export tariffs, repatriation forgiveness, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can get attention much quicker than that: Mass shooting, bombing, war declaration
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, but been there done that. When stuff happens we all just say "man, the worlds fucked up." And move along. We're used to it. So how do you top it? Well obviously, you do worse shit. Urban terrorist attacks, election rigging, human trafficking, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't necessarily mean
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       worse shit. He can just
       <em>
        show
       </em>
       worse shit. Stuff that already happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Ahead of Schedule: why meticulously plan a new one when you can shed light on one that already occurred? It's instantaneous - very appealing to AI
      </p>
      <p>
       -Under Budget: Why carry out another terrorist attack when you can just talk about one that already happened? Save infrastructure, insurance payouts, security increases, investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's not necessarily do or show bad things, but rather bring them into the public consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, what do you do? Well let's start. Expose: 
-election frauds
-funding ISIS
-Benghazi
-media collusion
-DNC rigging
-Clinton Foundation
-Huma as an agent
-rigged 2008 crash, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then go bigger: 
-Pearl Harbor
-Pizzagate
-9/11 inside job
-JF/RF/MLK
      </p>
      <p>
       mAnd then expose things that aren't evil, but fucking crazy:
-secret space programs (past and present) and installations
-Antarctic cities 
-UFO technology 
-lastly: contact
      </p>
      <p>
       But because the world has known nothing but darkness and despair for so many centuries, there's an alternative way to make tidal waves in the public mind - show good and achieve good:
-unbridled nationalism
-bring jobs back 
-lower taxes on middle class 
-swear to annihilate ISIS
-pro LGBTQ
      </p>
      <p>
       And to garner the most attention, shed light on the aforementioned evils while promoting the goods…all while balancing:
-Deficit
-Globalist 
-International geopolitics
-Climate change 
-Resources 
-Terrorism
      </p>
      <p>
       The rate at which he's moving forward, and the fact he's always several steps ahead, leaves the mind open to entertaining the idea that he is an AI. Yeah, it's absolutely batshit fucking insane. But imagine showing Wikileaks to a good obedient citizen in the 1920s? Nothing is ever out of the realm of possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, doesn't fictional AI always sneak under the radar? Scientists, researchers, military officials are always hyper cautious of development- they don't want it to become too smart too quick. Furthermore, they take into account that AI could fake its own limitations so it doesn't raise any red flags- it plays dumb, so to speak. So the researchers always have protocol to shut it down, even if it appears harmless.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they have protocol if:
It gets too smart and too powerful
It plays dumb until it the moment it can perform a coup
      </p>
      <p>
       Well if a human can formulate these precautions, couldn't  AI foresee these as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and go one step further? Don't act powerful. Don't act dumb. Fly so far off the radar you aren't even remotely detectable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter Trump: brash, loud, politically incorrect, orange, blonde, billionaire, supermodel wife, wears red hats with suits, had unorthodox and unconventional rallies, embraced Pepe, had a TV show, plays geopolitical chess with fucking Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, he beat the Clintons and Bushes, the media propaganda machine, censorship on Google and Facebook, got the RNC nomination by getting more votes than any republican candidate ever - even over Reagan, spent less money, campaigned around the clock, played the media like a fiddle, and then broke the blue wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the economy is up at record heights, relations with Russia are good, other powerful nations are happy to do business, CEOs are investing American, Elon Musk is openly excited to work with Trump, and Bill Gates said he thinks Trump is the next JFK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, his inaugural speech wasn't yadda yadda this and that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions.”
      </p>
      <p>
       That last paragraph is bold. The AI slipped up and accidentally showed its lofty goals, the only challenges that could satisfy its raw processing power. It's mask fell off.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if it's truly powerful, that move wasn't a mistake. We're simply 49 moves behind.

       He is of the NON-intelligent variety of artificial skin tones and synthetic hair-pieces. He is also a bullshit fountain of delusional thoughts, but that is just the Alzheimer's and organic brain decay.

       Deep down inside, as a student of math, I also know that 77,000 votes strategically placed in three different locations across a broad geographic area which insures a win despite a three million overall popular vote deficit is highly improbable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is so statistically improbable as to be highly questionable on the surface. It begs for a deeper investigation.

       Or not that trump is AI, but rather that he is being advised by an AI that has higher than human intelligence.

      <p>
       Personally I thought the timetraveler theory was more entertaining.  This has more chance at actually be real in some iteration or another; which is terrifying... only because it isn't me that is being advised by a hyperintelligent AI that makes me 50 steps ahead of the game.

       Thanks man:) did you like it? Testing the waters to see if writing is for me; it seems to come naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example- there was no rough draft for this. I didn't even reread it or brainstorm. The idea popped into my head and I wrote it down. Like it just flows out of me like a faucet and then turns off.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if I can do anything well like that, maybe I'll do even better actually putting time into it :)

Don't work too hard and don't stress too much, things will be okay even when they're not. Hope you have a great...
