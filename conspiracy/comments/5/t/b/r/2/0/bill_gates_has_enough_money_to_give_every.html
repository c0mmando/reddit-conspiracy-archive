       I'm interested in hearing your opinions, conspiracies, regarding Bill Gates or his foundation. I'm pretty sure there is a lot of dirt on him; if I recall correctly he has various connections to many corrupt organizations, as well people.
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading an article about how he was on track to become "the world's first trillionare" I thought it'd be good to try starting a discussion about the man.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the number I arrived to; I simply devided 1 trillion dollars with the American population. I then rounded the number down by 400 dollars to account for what his current wealth may be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit; to clarify, I am not saying Bill Gates should give his entire fortune to the American people. I was using that statement as an example.

       That is how well the MSM and others have brainwashed us. We don't question that Gates has more than he needs, or that his father was a eugenicist, or that the Gates Foundation makes ITNs (pyrethroid-soaked sleeping nets that keep out mosquitoes but kill babies and old people). We just parrot what a nice guy he is. Nice guys don't finish first in the real world: ask Ralph Nader.

       I wasn't suggesting he give out his entire wealth, it was merely a way to display just how much wealth he actually holds on to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, now I think of it... He could give away half of his wealth and still be incredibly well off; leaving every American $1,500 richer.

       Most people are in the financial trouble they're in because of their behavior, not because of the lack of money.  This wouldn't actually solve any problems, albeit you didn't claim it would, either.
