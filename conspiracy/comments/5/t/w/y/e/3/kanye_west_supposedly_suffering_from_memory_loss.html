        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So there&#39;s this new story about Kanye West suffering from memory loss from his &quot;mental breakdown&quot; back in November 2016..</p>

<p>Now, that whole entire newstory of Kanye West being hospitalized for mental health issues was clearly just bullshit to cover up probably some fucked up shit that they did with him, but this now adds to the bafoonery. </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, if this is some type of way to cover up that Kanye was most likely 1.) cloned or 2.) They wiped his memory and mkultra&#39;d his ass. I know I&#39;m missing a lot to all of this, I cba to type up another long thread pointing out all the evidence of how suspicious the Kanye West stories have been, but this definitely is a key to those theories.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? Any other plausible theories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea where this &quot;cloning&quot; thing came from. I don&#39;t think you folks understand how hard it is to grow a fully functioning macrocellular organism. Let alone one that could be considered a &quot;clone&quot;.</p>

<p>MKULTRA I&#39;ll buy. But the cloning thing has to stop. If we could clone shit like that, we&#39;d have more condors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, b.o.b (rapper) &quot;leaked&quot; some information about supposed cloning happening and how it&#39;s very real, blahblahblah. Whether or not he was bullshitting, I dunno. He hasn&#39;t been around much so who knows if he got shut up, forcibly. </p>

<p>But nawh I see what you mean. There&#39;s also been conspiracies of how the entire obama family was cloned and etc, and Donald Trump isn&#39;t the actual Donald Trump that we&#39;ve seen from years ago. I&#39;m not saying I believe these, but there&#39;s definitely a large group of people that believe cloning on the human scale is possible and is taking place.</p>

<p>My opinion would be, if they&#39;ve found a way to do it, they&#39;ll do it. Would we know? Of course not. It would only be available to the rich and higher-ups. Just like most advancements in technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cloning centers 100% real, Kanye definitely goes. Research Donald Marshal. Bob is legit.</p>

<p>Why you think Bernie Mac died? They fade him his TV show, but once he started getting invited to the centers, he was horrified and wanted to say something. Bernie was taken from us, as he could not sell his soul and was murdered before he started going around telling everybody.</p>

<p>Kanye is very likely appearing in public as a clone right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not so much Kanye West I&#39;m concerned about, it&#39;s what&#39;s happening to him and others we don&#39;t know about. He isn&#39;t the only one that&#39;s suspected to be &quot;tampered&quot; with.</p>

<p>Kid cudi, lady Gaga, Katy Perry, etc. There&#39;s more to this than just Kanye and his ego. If anything, kanye&#39;s ego is what&#39;s helping people keeping from paying too much of their mind to this. They figure Kanye has been a bother anyway and turn a blind eye. Or don&#39;t even bother to dive into what&#39;s been going on. I dunno. Shady shit is going on and not enough people are aware of it.</p>
