<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5twnll/a_man_attending_this_museum_heard_children/?st=IZ4RVMMH&amp;sh=98b461bb">Original Post</a></p>

<p>Voat <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1639009">Link</a></p>

<p>I listened to the whole thing. Essentially, Ole received a plea for help in investigating a first account: a man was visiting the museum at the Droopp Mountain national park, when he clearly heard children screaming out for help from underneath the museum. Two guards came over to him, and he said you could hear the children clear as day, yet the guards said there are absolutely no children in the area, and walked the man to his car, and watched him leave. The man went straight to local police, who he said seemed to have been tipped off ahead of time that he&#39;d be coming. They were not interested in exploring his claims. The only thing he knew to do was alert Ole, who is now calling on the wider community for help.</p>

<p>He notes that for over a hundred years children have gone missing form national parks, and that this one is connected by a civil war era tunnel system to DC, and is not very far from Comet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know anything about that but underground tunnels are kind of crazy.  I&#39;ve been through the tunnels nearby Odessa and I&#39;m tall so it kind of sucks to be bending over walking with my head sideways.  Those things can be deep and twisty as fuck to the point that this one guy was able to just hide out down there during WWII and a farm had a tiny hole in which they supplied him with water and food.  They knew that he was down there but just couldn&#39;t find him.  Point is that there can be a whole world down there like Drow elves with camouflage spells and shit and we wouldn&#39;t know.  As far as I&#39;m concerned pedophile vampires moving kids through DC is well within the realm of possibilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I agree 100%. Combine that with all the music lyrics insinuating they are hiding underground.</p>

<p>Eminem and Green day come into my head but I know &quot;the underground&quot; is called that for a reason. You&#39;re part of the underground. Means 2 different things based on the person, random hood people probably think eminem came from &quot;the underground&quot; when really he came from literally underground.</p>

<p>No one can blame you
For walking away.
Too much rejection.
No love injection.</p>

<p>Life can&#39;t be easy.
It&#39;s not always swell.
Don&#39;t tell me truth hurts, little girl,
&#39;Cause it hurts like hell,</p>

<p>But down in the underground
You&#39;ll find someone true.
Down in the underground;
A land serene;
A crystal moon.
Ah..</p>

<p>It&#39;s only forever.
Not long at all.
Lost and lonely.
That&#39;s underground.
Underground.</p>

<p>Daddy, daddy, get me out of here.
Heard about a place today.
I, I&#39;m underground.
Nothing ever hurts again.
Heard about a place today.
Daddy, get me out of here

I, I&#39;m underground.

    <div class="md"><p>The Resident Evil games have been trying to tell Americans (not sure about up north..) that something horrible was going to happen in the US and no wonder the heroes end up in underground tunnels so often with cable cars and places where people work already and have supplies for a decade sitting. Even the dates of the chronology...replace everything you learn in that game from B.O.W&#39;s to terrorists and the American government using secret ultra powerful thermobaric weapon to destroy &quot;Raccoon City&quot;, replace all the files one can grab and read in the games, especially the ones with the classic or augmented classic view (RE: Code Veronica). Replace 1998 (which is where the stuff that could have led to the apocalypse so often revealed themselves) with 2001 and you got something quite similar.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if anyone here remembers but this easy to find on youtube video saying Al-Queda/Taliban had multiple huge underground complexes in the Tora Bora mountains, where when you see the videos, the British are the most blunt, there&#39;s very short caves, some being weapon and ammo supplies but that&#39;s it, an attack on nothing, the few people worth capturing were brought to Pakistan through the &quot;Airlift of Evil&quot;, this even is actually on Wikipedia. Mullah Omar died tranquil in Quetta, Pakistan, when there was a practically fake 10 million or such bounty on his head. Anyway, when Rumsfeld replies to the news guy showing one of them famous Dubya administration cartoons, Rumsfeld was admitting THEY had such facilities all over the US, and especially deep inside the Rockies. Knowing Rumsfeld he was likely taking the piss and finding it really funny to convince Bin Laden was in a huge underground complex with internet, phones, doors that lets cars and even tanks in...dear god, I want to go back to 2001 and disturb the space-time continuum. </p>

<p>One Resident Evil game is VERY scary in its promise about teenagers being kidnapped from all over the world to some island &quot;near the UK&quot;, developed, so it&#39;s something like Guernsey or Isle of Man, they call it Sheena Island, but they kidnap teenagers to extract a chemical that is too difficult to produce artificially, you see nothing of that, but the bad guy in the game is major Eugenicist (the game is Resident Evil: Survivor, back on the old Playstation 1, it is canon but plays like Doom), you get to read how they extract a fictional chemical but it&#39;s practically like adrenochrome in Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas. Because they need the brain to produce the maximum norepinephrine (noradrenalin) in the pineal gland, they torture the kids for a month, give them drugs, randomly in their food and when their time comes, their cranium is split open (like the Japanese did to the Chinese, think Unit 731) without anaesthesia because the more noradrenalin, the more the N-alpha-nonserotonin they can extract from the pineal gland.</p>

<p>Satanists apparently do this to take adrenochrome, it&#39;s from such people Duke&#39;s Lawyer got the liquid &quot;it had to come from a living being&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; really prepared us for something in the year 2000, but all that happened then was some doofus trying to drive through the Canadian border into the US in South Surrey (a suburb of Vancouver), the guy who wanted...allegedly to bomb the LAX, they obviously caught him. It was like a joke on new year&#39;s eve.</p>

<p>I kept telling people, we&#39;re still in the 20th century btw, which one of my optional classes in college (History of Western Civilization from 1760 to the early 20th when alliances and everything was being setup for WW1 to happen, no matter who caused it, it was going to happen.</p>

<p>I gotta say though that the people who focus so much on the babies traits in the pictures of those you-know-whos Instagram (lol, never saw any utility to Instagram, never used it, but turns out it&#39;s a good way to profile enemies) about coloboma and a couple other eye defects and even going as far as some have nose defects in how it is placed in the face and how Georges Soros has women kidnapped worldwide with his sperm put in them, or even pay women to have his children without actual sex...nobody would have sex with Soros, that I can believe. It&#39;s ridiculous though, not all of them have any defect, except looking tired sometimes or just strange, the now legendary duct tape girl pic with a guy standing in the distance like he&#39;s humping her, of course the picture was taken so it looked that way. But still it&#39;s not the Simpsons joke where a nurse tells somebody that they have only the best of the best in the state (which is North Kentucky according to that season 11 season finale, the kind that would have been 100% better had Phil Hartman not been killed by his coke crazed wife...I hear people from Ohio calling Cincinnati and southern Ohio as feeling like somewhere else and lots of people call it North Kentucky....but I digress massively).  After the person leaves, the nurse has Barney Gumble, the alcoholic guy giving his sperm in droves and happy parents leave with babies burping extremely loudly like Barney and then you see Springfield from above and there&#39;s echoes of Barney burps all over town, which is hilarious. But I&#39;m not sure, is this Soros thinking he&#39;ll reincarnate inside some of the frozen sperm he supposedly gives (no proof of that anywhere).</p>

<p>Alright, I&#39;m tired, I jumped around a bit but to those who got it all, cheers. Just saying that not only 9/11 was leaked in the 90&#39;s and even before in so many imagery and concepts in art of the cinematic or even video clip land, I really wonder if the guy who approached Sick Of It All to make a video for their song District back in 2000 was a dual citizen of the US and Israel.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve also leaked to us in little bits about how there&#39;s underground high speed trains, cable cars, and, I don&#39;t have the numbers because anyone claiming to know the numbers are spewing bullshit, of these facilities and the huge tunnel complexes all under the US ground, especially in the original colonies + Colorado. Everyone always knew about human trafficking, some considering it a lesser issue, but trafficking is kind of a vague word which doesn&#39;t say much, doesn&#39;t say it turns adults into slaves to people who think they are part of an Elite...the real people part of an Elite are the moderately small group of men who warned AFP on September 10, 2001 of what was going to happen the next day, not specifically what would be attacked, but it said something about the largest landmarks in the US. Also one has to read about the Russian Economist who in a big convention a year or so after  2 years after Putin came into power the first time to stop the rape of their country and how to get a viable economy working (seems like they did it). Let&#39;s say Russians now are very much believers in Orthodox Catholicism, and how the figure equal to the pope in Orthodox Catholicism has not much say, he&#39;s the enumecurial something, but anyway, just to say that this russian economist Tatyana Koryagina, who won&#39;t name her sources, was off by just 2 weeks, this woman is very intelligent. No wonder the Russia bullshit right now, Russia is now the country with the moral high ground, not the US or NATO anymore. When NATO cut all ties with Russia over the Crimean people wishing to rejoin Russian, which they had been part of for 250 years or so, only was given to calm the very pro-nazi &quot;ukrainians...ukraine is not a country, look for Ukraine in World War 1....no such thing, it&#39;s in with the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, ukraine means borderlands, borderlanders between that Empire and the Russian empire sent a delegation to the Germans who introduced themselves, I guess that old country that doesn&#39;t exist anymore, Silesia is a part of Ukraine now, they presented themselves to the German Generals as Ukrainians and they were like wtf is an Ukrainian? And when they explained that it was a group of people who spoke a language 90% the same as Russian who were poor in advance and they can&#39;t blame the Soviet Union for that then, it was a backwater borderland for the Austro-Hungarian empire too, where the mainland Rothschilds showed up a lot first, the Austro-Hungarian Empire lost a lot more due to Warburg and such financing both that and Russia. </p>

<p>What Russia did when it removed from sex ed that homosexuality is only 10% of people, not every guy who has a shrill voice and feminine tendencies want to be butchered into a woman, this is not info I had back in 1998-1999-2000 when we would have twice a month drug or sex ed, they didn&#39;t mention homosexuality at all, the big emphasis was that there was other ways to express your love than full on coitus and I gotta say that was brillant, not many girls who graduated same year as me, 2000, at that particular high school had a baby before being stable in their life, where they don&#39;t have to give to what we were always warned were places almost just owned by pedophiles, foster care, parents would use this as a fake threat when they had enough of me and my brother being at each other&#39;s throat. When you realize that, say the &quot;Angel of Love&quot; adoption agency was liking all of Alefantis&#39; pictures on Instagram and when pizzagate came out, they unliked all the pictures, same as some fed lawyer, Aaron Rau right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy as hell when people all working in compartmentalized </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Social libertarianism calls to ask where you have been? Of course, almost all stripes of libertarianism would reduce the budget of the military and military research (DARPA) and everything else related to 1970&#39;s levels, they&#39;re already 30 years in advance secretly, so, who cares, also cutting all aid to all foreign countries (which all countries should do for themselves to take care of their sick people and their homeless and to hell with strategic plans, why is there now, after 160 countries, a US Army (I think it&#39;s joined with the Canadian Army) base right about 300 km north Alberta, or 250km southwest of Edmonton if my memory serves right...only Alberta , our Texas, would permit this travesty...guess they forgot we dont have nukes but since they try to have a plan for every scenario...the US or my country...we&#39;re like Iran wants to be, have nuclear power and use the least amount of fuel from their huge reserves of oil and gas and sell it elsewhere...we shouldn&#39;t have sold Petro-Canada to a public group that made it a non-national corporation, we pump away so much gas for the US, and they sell it back to us more expensive. </p>

<p>I&#39;m an anarchist who understands what it means, very small institutions that can&#39;t proceed if the majority don&#39;t want to and vice verca. A small fastly rotating council, which is smart and campaign donations are to be inexistant, just let people where you stand for real, that will cost a single tv commercial.</p>

<p>Here in Canada ( I think also northern US), it&#39;s female natives that keep disappearing....the government after Idle No More in 2012-2013-2014 which got them to actually talk with the person they have to talk about their territory, not the prime minister, but the Queen&#39;s Representative, the Lieutenant-Governor of Canada. But when they realized it would mean that parts of in the north of all of western and central provinces to become native territory, women started disappearing...making it harder for them to reproduce and have fully 100% native people....it reminds me of that sickening thing that happened to that poor extremely smart but bipolar black woman who was a psychology intern, had her BSc or BA, I forget if they get something related to science in Psychology. Anyway, what happened to Mitrice Richardson is the strangest thing I got aware of through some podcast not long ago, how that tiny in the middle of nowhere police station with 4 cells tops..how the cops claimed there was no video of them letting her leave when it was known her mother was coming to get her....and that mural...all pretense of art are gone when they discovered it the leftover paint and paint accessories wasn&#39;t dry still and they had taken a shit directly in the middle of the mural, which could only be seen from someone walking. Anyway, how she turned the wrong way when being released outside in the back entrance where the cop cars are parked....that was weird, apparently she was afraid of the dark big time, so why she didn&#39;t take the road back out in a nowhere but an lit street at least was there for her to take and leave through the front by using the cop car&#39;s driveway, but nah, she goes straight into the darkness and 3 minutes later a cop goes outside in her same direction and leaves, she&#39;s found momified by the swamp she was found in (that&#39;s a real thing), 2/3 to 3/4 of he rbody anyway. If they can do this to a woman who&#39;s black and smart, and likely picked because they didn&#39;t like the idea of a black smart woman becoming a psychiatrist, again, when the person pushing most to find her was her own boss...they can do many things, not many are pretty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listened to the video and heard him talk about the screaming and the person being escorted out but didn&#39;t hear about going to the police. It was a long video so I stopped listening a few minutes after they got off that topic. Is there another source, or did they return to the topic later?</p>
