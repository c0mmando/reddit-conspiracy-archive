       David Seaman made a post about his source feeding him info about mass arrests and if it is wrong, then his source is compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what I think happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Master manipulator and infamous pedophile David Brock used an old trick called "flushing out the rat." Brock doesn't know who all the whistleblowers are but he does know how to flush one out. What he does is feed false info to a suspected whistleblower. If that false info errupts in media, Brock will have evidence that his suspect is the rat and he will find out who he works for. In this case David Seaman announced it so Brock wins and Seaman loses his source.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as today came, David Brock began spamming everything under the sun through his ctr slaves with one message:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Do not trust David Seaman."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Brock's strategy but he is going against a sub who's members can sniff this stuff out easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want us to divide from David Seaman so they can isolate him and snuff out his voice. Seaman worked for huffington post and got fired for being an honest journalist but he didn't give up. He continues on through YouTube and the elite pedo club is pissed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want us to cut him off. They think we are as gullible as that Hillary sub or politics sub.

       Interesting and plausible.  Of all the threads about Seaman today, there was one positive one about 8 hours ago.  They recommended we stand by Seaman by buying his Amazon book and consider sending bitcoin.  Seemed weird, but then it was wave after wave of anti-Seaman.  Good post OP.  Could be wrong, but it's the best guess so far.

       He become semi-well known around these parts a week or two ago when he began a twitter rant about pizza the illuminati and aliens, then deleted most of the tweets and then his 50,000 twitter followers mysteriously disappeared for the course of the day before reappearing that night, saw it myself. His account may have also been deleted somewhere in there. That said and the shady twitter stuff aside, dude posts monetized youtube content multiple times a day and it is in his interest to generate hype. His behavior is also so far fringe that he does the majority of us a disservice in ever having serious discussions about these topics with normies..
      </p>
      <p>
       The campaign to keep his name relevant here today though has been mind blowing.

       And that's not true. He's been well known for months around here for his investigating into Pizzagate. Just type his name in the search bar of this sub and you can see your wrong.

       I also trust him. He was originally fired from a major MSM paper for questioning the narrative on Hillary's health, which I consider a very brave move on his part. Brock's shills certainly have a motive to go after him.

       David Seaman makes a very good living posting videos on the internet. Why didn't he didn't he keep quiet to see if his "source" was telling the truth? If he had been patient, and said nothing, and his source ended up telling the truth, David would finally have a legitimate source for inside information; something he currently doesn't have. He then could have received a bunch more of the "insider" info from his source; knowing that everything he was being spoon-fed would come true, and it would make David look like a real, investigative reporter. David is either not as bright as he claims to be, or his followers are not too bright, and he is picking their pockets.

       Seaman makes a living on journalism. Why are you attacking him for doing his job. Journalists have to be passionate and that's what he's doing when he gets emotional. How else should he pay for his rent after being fired from huffington post? The man has bills so there is profit motive but a profit motive doesn't mean he doesn't love his job which is exposing high level pedophiles and making the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even that other dude selling Pizzagate Tshirts was doing the right thing. People are swamped in bills. The bills have to be paid.

       For the most part this is correct. However, he does spend too much time talking about himself. Not that I don't understand his position, but I always shut his videos down after he's done talking about actual information. He transits into youtube views, money, his popularity....everyone has flaws, that's his.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the sauce David. Just the sauce. He'd get more views and gain greater respect. Which I believe is his overall goal.

       Money is the problem. If people weren't under such massive financial pressures, they would actually perform their work more accurately. When rent is coming up and there $100 in the bank, people look for creative ways to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one thing to profit from child sex slaves but it's a little understandable when people, who are mostly desperately trying to scrounge up cash, to do things like exaggerate the effectiveness of the products they sell.
      </p>
      <p>
       People try to do the right thing but look at mexico. Absolutely no economic productivity has lead to many cartel members. My point is that maybe we should be a bit understanding that Seaman is making money. It's better to cry and entertain for hits while getting the Pizzagate message out than be out in the street.

       I hear you, but I'm just being honest. I do like that he digs and gets the sauce, but he talks about himself too much. That's not really reporter stuff..lol well it shouldn't be. We have infotainers now that we've gotten used to..But sort of imagine Walter Cronkite deliver a 3 minute blurb on Vietnam, then start talking about how big his audience is.

       If David could transition just a bit into a more Ben Swann type delivery, he'd do SO much better overall.

       David Seaman sunk his own ship. His twittorama today was pathetic. He should never have posted the arrest timeframe to begin with. And so when that didn't happen he went all in. He made himself look like a fool throwing a hissy fit. 
IMO, this didn't have anything to do with Brock.

       I'm cut and pasting this quote into every David Seaman post I see.
People need to know this guy is running a scam inserting himself on the crest of a wave of internet outrage and profiting from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       From his media manipulation guide "Dirty Little Secrets of Buzz".
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The media (and the public) love celebrities, so the easiest way to get attention is to be a celebrity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dirty Little Secrets of Buzz will teach you how to do just that, and for little or no cost. For example, Secret #2: Be outrageous or die. There’s a benefit to angering the public. “It’s often better to piss someone off than to leave them ambivalent.” It doesn’t matter whether they like you, only whether they remember you. This goes against the traditional advice – mind your manners—but it certainly makes sense. Who’s going to buy your product if they don’t remember it exists?

       brock is certainly manipulative but in this case it is seaman's own clumsy attempts to 'polarize' the audience to capitalize on the 'buzz' of pizzagate. he literally wrote a book about this but his execution seems clumsy.

      <p>
       this video from 10 years ago explains his technique 'polarizing' the audience for benefit. the fact we are all talking about him is success based on his book:

       Sorry dude but you are likely wrong. Seaman is a partisan hack, content thief, lazy and most importantly a self promoting whore...... that is at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       At worst he is actually a disinformation agent and might be working on his greatest piece yet.  How one man convinced the Alt Right a pedo ring was run out of a pizza parlor.
      </p>
      <p>
       My conspiracy side believes seaman is a attention whore and once his schtick is up he will lie and said he did all this to expose the Alt right.  I don't think he was smart enough to plan this upfront but do believe he is the type to be shamed and instead of taking his lumps will switch teams and act like a genius.
