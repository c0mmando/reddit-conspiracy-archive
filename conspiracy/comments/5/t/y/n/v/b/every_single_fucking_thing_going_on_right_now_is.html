    <div class="md"><p>I understand your frustration but we don&#39;t live in a time like the French revolution. To conduct any violence against the state is not only suicidal it is counter productive. The state represents ultimate evil and sin. You can&#39;t defeat sin with sin or evil with evil.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what John Lennon had to say about dealing with the state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When it gets down to having to use violence, then you are playing the system’s game. The establishment will irritate you – pull your beard, flick your face – to make you fight. Because once they’ve got you violent, then they know how to handle you. The only thing they don’t know how to handle is non-violence and humor.” ~John Lennon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizens will take as much as they can handle before they come to a revolution in the mind. We need to free our mind before we free our chains. This means you must take away these evil fucks power.  What is that you ask? Well, it&#39;s greed. They want more for themselves and less for everyone else. They own the money supply and all the privileges it comes with it. Until we stop playing their game and play our own game of caring and taking care of one another they will own us. They will enslave us all until Humans see each other as brothers and sisters in need of helping each other to grow to our full potential.</p>

<p>Does that sound like too much feel good mumble jumbo? Then welcome to the world of plunder! Where a group of men living together in society create for themselves a legal system that authorizes greed and a moral code that glorifies it. </p>

<p>Actually I think the state handles non-violence and humor very well. That is an ideal habitat for the state.</p>

<p>The state derives its power from having an exclusive ability to use violence.</p>

I just want to tell you that no matter what happens to the government, or the American people, or the world, your spiritual life matters as much. What I mean is, even if you don&#39;t get what you wish for, and the whole thing either goes down in flames or continues to be plagued by evil and sin, that you made the choice for <em>the good</em>, is enough.

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to belabor this point, but I think it&#39;s important.</p>

<p>The system absolutely knows how to handle non-violence and humor. This is why we get shows like Saturday Night Live and John Oliver and Jimmy Fallon. They&#39;re all state mouthpieces that actively promote humor and non-aggression.</p>

<p>Just my own opinion, but I think John Lennon himself was somehow a CIA asset used to promulgate the &quot;peace and love&quot; mindset among a generation that had previously been set on toppling the US government.</p>

<p>I mean look at this. MLK assassinated in 1968. The Kent State Massacre in May of 1970. Then when does the song &quot;Imagine&quot; come out? October 1971.</p>

<p>The counter-culture revolution was about the gut TPTB because the previous non-violence was being met with deadly and <em>effective</em> force. And then all of a sudden, a world famous singer starts telling these infuriated young people to chill out and believe that love not guns will change everything.</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s 40+ years later, and we&#39;re still singing that stupid song, but has anything changed? We&#39;re in a perpetual state of war. Wage slavery is worse than ever, and the middle class is on its last legs.  And last time I checked blacks are still incarcerated at a higher rate than any other ethnic group.</p>

<p>How about we stop &quot;imagining&quot; a world at peace and actually <em>make it happen</em>? Now that&#39;s going to take some work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>May I add that we are all being poisoned. Before you laugh, like I would have recently, think about Flint. If TPTB are willing to do that, they&#39;ll poison all of us. </p>

<p>You think they don&#39;t just take a pill in the morning?</p>

<p>I have just stumbled upon a huge conspiracy by a major manufacturer to intentionally poison millions of people. I have evidence that they know. This isn&#39;t an accident. </p>

<p>It got me thinking about metal fillings, metals in vaccinations, metals in water, in our food, our air (yes, chemtrails), all the medicines they give us, our building supplies.</p>

<p>We really are being poisoned. Fuck.</p>
