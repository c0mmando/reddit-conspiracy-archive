    <div class="md"><p>it just isn&#39;t how it works.  The one exception to that is the Homan bldg in Chicago which acts like a CIA black site - and that is where they take people for delayed processing.  But by delayed, we are talking 12-24 hours.  If I was in OPs place, I&#39;d be asking for a phone call or help with each officer I saw, each time they bring food, each time they come by for prisoner check.  No way this happened and if it did, he would be looking at a serious little law suit with lawyers begging to represent him for free.</p>
