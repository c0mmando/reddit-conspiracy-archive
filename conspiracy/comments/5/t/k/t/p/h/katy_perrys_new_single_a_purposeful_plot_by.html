       What are you guys take on this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Heard this on the radio the other day, and the lyrics of her new song 'chained to the rhythm' are full of references to 'dance to the distortion' 'we think we're free' 'living in a bubble' and her twitter posts are hinting at being "awakened"
      </p>
      <p>
       normally, when celebrities get out of line and start spilling the beans on what goes on in the industry or use their platform for unscripted reasons, they're shut down pretty quickly, but this song and its message are seemingly being promoted, and if this was out of line, would have been stopped by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       do you think US "artists" are going to start propagandising full force, as if were having some false 'awakening' or 'self realisation' as a political move?

       Yeah could be. Just like every good cause the Cabal twists into a tool of divisiveness... they're trying to use the global awakening against the awakened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some impressionable young people will embrace the counterculture-revolutionary aspects without understanding the bigger picture, or the tools of manipulation being used against them. The message of the song is basically correct but it can easily be taken out of context... We are learning more every day about mind-control techniques, how frequency and repetitive phrasing is used in music, and generally divisive tactics used against us in our entertainment and elsewhere. It's good to keep aware of these things.

       I'm not saying they don't look similar but that little girl was born in 1990 and Katy Perry was born almost 6 years prior. They are not the same.

       Hey, there's people that say Alex Jones is Bill Hicks, stupid knows no bounds. I should know, I'm plenty stupid myself, I've learned to swim in the sea of conspiracy, surf it's eddies, troll it's dummies, learn a little. It's a strange life indeed, it's hard to maintain one's integrity with the burden of knowledge. So better to distract oneself, lest he disturbs demons best not disturbed.

       I'm a sucker for a good conspiracy. In fact there are a lot of conspiracies I believe are completely untrue. Doesn't make it any less awesome. Jon Benet Ramsey being Katy Perry is super far fetched but still super awesome. So I let people be themselves because it's more fun for me!

       I guess that's the tricky part, you never really know, the kicker I suppose is whether such a fact really has much influence in your life. Like we know about MK-Ultra, and we know it has to do with some celebrities. But how does that affect your every day life, you know? It's like another media gossip distraction, but with an edgy paranoid slant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like take the Earth being round or flat, chances are in your experience you will never be able to verify either, so does it really matter which one you believe? Maybe the whole flat earth thing is a psyop to get you to stop thinking about space, to make you ignore the possibility of leaving this rock. Maybe the world really is flat, maybe it really is round, what does it matter, you're not going to Antarctica without a chaperone anyway, so you're stuck in the continents.

       Millions show up to protest against women's right being taken away when women's right weren't being taken away. The next week people's rights are actually taken away and a few thousand show up to airports scattered around the country. Sounds like that show of organizational power was just a big wank to me.

       Totally agree.  I remember,  i think it was after the election,  she tweeted "the revolution is coming" thought that was kinda weird coming from a pop star.  What does she have to revolt about?

       Such a stupid revolution! I'm so sick of celebrities that know nothing about politics but think they can tell us how to feel or even vote. They don't have the problems we do. They can send their kids to privet school. They don't need to worry about healthcare or money day to day. They live in gated communities so they don't care about refugees when we can't even take care of our vets or American people who lose jobs to those coming in. These celebrities that say start a revolution will sit back and do nothing if they do start one in their gated home. Come on celebrities. Enough already. You are making half of America hate you and then you will worry about money, schools and being low or middle class.

       The revolution occurred during the election. By clinging to this ruined ideology, and political party, they are only hurting whatever cause they believe they are fighting for. If we werent all idiots, we'd all use this momentum to end this flawed 2-party system.

       Not here to talk about illuminati conspiracies or MK ultra or anything, or even specifically Katy perry. what I was getting at was I think the entertainment industry is going to start using its celebrities to instigate some sort of "pseudo self awareness" and cause manipulate a social revolt. i just wanted others opinions

       Well all I know is that the popular music business (as in what they play on the radio) is rigged. Musicians aren't being judged on skill or originality but on their marketability.
