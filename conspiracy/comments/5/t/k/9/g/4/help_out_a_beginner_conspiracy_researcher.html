<p>What are the most shocking theories that you confidently believe to be true? </p>

<p>Personally, the pizzagate evidence is pretty unarguable from what I&#39;ve seen. </p>

<p>I appreciate any help you can give me! </p>

<p>MK Ultra is another that is pretty shocking and relevant today.</p>

<p>An extremely interesting one, imo, are the Montauk Project. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are a good start.  For me, I&#39;ve noticed there&#39;s a lot of financial reason behind chaos, which is sad.  Just the financial profit potential of just 9/11 is amazing.  From there, that led to the wars in the Middle East which was very profitable.  Those wars led to the installation of some certain types of banks, which was very profitable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you need to learn to keep it to yourself, sadly.  occasionally you&#39;ll find someone that drops a hint they are into talks of this nature, and you can share.  But until then, you have to investigate just for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting enough, my college hoops coach is a huge conspiracy guy and he&#39;s the one dude I&#39;ve been able to talk with. He was actually told by his PR person to not be public with any of his thoughts, which I thought was interesting (I was also told to not tweet about conspiracy after I tweeted a link about pizza gate). If you follow hoops at all you&#39;d know who he is and be very very surprised </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I know, college hoops has gotten a lot better from what it was in the past. Trust me, sometimes I feel like the refs are against us. This is probably more than I should say, but there&#39;s a certain guy in my conference that has kicked/tripped people multiple times and only got a 1 game suspension.

Instead of the CIA/mainstream definition, something like &quot;a &#39;non-official&#39; idea that only a minority of the population thinks about&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is overwhelming at times. I am going with some of the less disturbing ones lately like remote viewing and holofractal universe. There is a great awakening taking place on a spiritual level. People are capable are far far more than we are lead to believe. Things that may be hard to imagine even. Never stop trying to improve your mind, learn everything, question everything. I really like mysterious conspiracy theories like stuff about the moon or ufos or neburu.

IMF, BIS, World Bank</p>

<p>Rothschilds, Rockefellers</p>

<p>Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg Group, Council on Foreign Relations</p>

<p>Freemasons, NWO, de-population</p>

<p>Monsanto, chemtrails, GMOs</p>

<p>Suppression of technology (alternative fuels, alternative medicine, etc)
assassinations of journalists, scientists, revolutionaries</p>

<p>false flags (9/11, gulf of tonkin, etc)</p>

<p>Coup d&#39;etats (Iran 1950s, Guatemala, Congo, Vietnam, Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Haiti, Libya, Ukraine, and many many more)</p>

<p>JFK, many &quot;lone gunman&quot; attacks</p>

<p>Yeah dude, it can be crazy uncovering all this and sometimes feel like the reality we are told is so opposite to what is actually true. It can be tough finding people to openly talk to about it because some ppl just don&#39;t even want to consider these things, but I find the truth to be empowering and enlightening regardless of what you do with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey and welcome!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been heavily into ETs and UFOs for quite some years now so if you&#39;re interested in that, I&#39;d be happy to help. To start out I&#39;d suggest The Citizen Hearing on Disclosure. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWUCDHofEho">Here&#39;s</a> a starter video, the remaining should be available on youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly anything with CIA is usually pretty eye-opening.  If you start following CIA you&#39;re going to get your mind blow. NOT LITERALLY...unless you&#39;re flying too close to important people...you&#39;ll see their heart-attack gun then start seeing the suspicious deaths. It&#39;s not all CIA..but CIA is hollywood for D.C. &amp; why not believe some to be hit-men? </p>

<p>Looking into 9/11 is like the starter drug of conspiracy, as well as CIA with Bin Laden&amp;Al-Queda. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re into pizzagate conspiracy, look at the finders.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to try to start to research 1 thing and lose focus because of all the forks it takes.</p>

<p>Also, if you feel strange about government and the origins, and the agenda, check out Denver International Airport. </p>
