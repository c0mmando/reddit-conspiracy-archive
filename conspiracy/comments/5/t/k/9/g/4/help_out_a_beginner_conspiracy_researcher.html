       So I'm really only a few days into my conspiracy searching, and it sure doesn't take long to find some shocking shit. It would really help if I could get some questions answered by some more experienced people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the most shocking theories that you confidently believe to be true?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, the pizzagate evidence is pretty unarguable from what I've seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate any help you can give me!

       9/11 is at the top for many. There is a massive amount of evidence that it was an inside job, or at least not what it seems, for a multitude of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       MK Ultra is another that is pretty shocking and relevant today.
      </p>
      <p>
       An extremely interesting one, imo, are the Montauk Project.

       conspiracies don't seem to work that way.  You find one that shocks you but you find flaws to it, which lead to another, and another - until you wonder what is real and what isn't.  To rush this, will get your defenses up so it has to be done right.
      </p>

       Where are you in your new conspiracy path?  Just pizzagate so far?

       Those are a good start.  For me, I've noticed there's a lot of financial reason behind chaos, which is sad.  Just the financial profit potential of just 9/11 is amazing.  From there, that led to the wars in the Middle East which was very profitable.  Those wars led to the installation of some certain types of banks, which was very profitable.

       Yeah, you need to learn to keep it to yourself, sadly.  occasionally you'll find someone that drops a hint they are into talks of this nature, and you can share.  But until then, you have to investigate just for yourself.

       As for your sanity, you'll be fine.  Take it in little doses.  Come in here when you want a quick dose of truth, then go back to your regular life.

       Someday maybe the truth about 9/11 or Pgate will be open, and then you'll be able to talk freely.  Until then, zip it. :)

       Interesting enough, my college hoops coach is a huge conspiracy guy and he's the one dude I've been able to talk with. He was actually told by his PR person to not be public with any of his thoughts, which I thought was interesting (I was also told to not tweet about conspiracy after I tweeted a link about pizza gate). If you follow hoops at all you'd know who he is and be very very surprised

       Yeah, the more public you are, the more you have to keep that side hidden. It is a shame, and good you have that avenue to talk to someone.  As more people wake, hopefully more people will be able to network and it won't be such a negative to be a CT.

       From what I know, college hoops has gotten a lot better from what it was in the past. Trust me, sometimes I feel like the refs are against us. This is probably more than I should say, but there's a certain guy in my conference that has kicked/tripped people multiple times and only got a 1 game suspension. You may have no idea what im talking about, but just wanted to give you an idea

       Don't put words in my mouth lol. Plenty of people are serial trippers. And technically I don't "play" lmao. But yes, I will say Grayson deserved to be punished by the NCAA, not just his damn coach. Talking about it fucking infuriates me.

       MLK and JFK assassinations.  9/11 is an inside job.  Islamic terrorism events are orchestrated by Israeli and American governments.  Some mass shootings are staged with crisis actors.  I'm actually still neutral on pizzagate.

       The conspiracy that we are all slaves to a debt system that is never meant to be paid off with money. As long as we go along with the program our rights and liberties will continually erode in the same of "security".

       Technically the debt-based money system is a conspiracy in its original definition, something like "a group of people secretly or covertly carrying out some plan"
       <br/>
       Instead of the CIA/mainstream definition, something like "a 'non-official' idea that only a minority of the population thinks about"
      </p>
      <p>
       But either way it is definitely very close to the root of which most other theories stem from. NWO or control of the masses with one of the major tools being financial slavery which eliminates the personal self-sufficiency of the individual

       Absolutely mostly I just meant that that one isn't really a secret. I mean it's hiding in plain sight. I wish I could cut ties to the fed and live off grid but I need my money and my faulty job and it is not an easy transition. Sad to know the world I'm raising my kids in is not on their side.

       Pretty much every major event in the world you hear about on the news is a half-truth at best. Quarter truths, further dilutions of truth and straightup lies are pretty much the norm for msm. Research everything. You'll find the masses are being lied to about literally everything

       The Zeitgeist series on Netflix is a good quick fix, and is great education on the monetary system. I love the similarities between Christianity and early pagans it shows in the beginning, seeing Christianity disproved would give me a lot of joy.

       It is overwhelming at times. I am going with some of the less disturbing ones lately like remote viewing and holofractal universe. There is a great awakening taking place on a spiritual level. People are capable are far far more than we are lead to believe. Things that may be hard to imagine even. Never stop trying to improve your mind, learn everything, question everything. I really like mysterious conspiracy theories like stuff about the moon or ufos or neburu. Try not to let anything bring you down always try to stay positive no matter what you find out.

       Yeah dude, it can be crazy uncovering all this and sometimes feel like the reality we are told is so opposite to what is actually true. It can be tough finding people to openly talk to about it because some ppl just don't even want to consider these things, but I find the truth to be empowering and enlightening regardless of what you do with it.

       Honestly anything with CIA is usually pretty eye-opening.  If you start following CIA you're going to get your mind blow. NOT LITERALLY...unless you're flying too close to important people...you'll see their heart-attack gun then start seeing the suspicious deaths. It's not all CIA..but CIA is hollywood for D.C. &amp; why not believe some to be hit-men?

       Looking into 9/11 is like the starter drug of conspiracy, as well as CIA with Bin Laden&amp;Al-Queda.

       If you're into pizzagate conspiracy, look at the finders.

       It's pretty easy to try to start to research 1 thing and lose focus because of all the forks it takes.

       Also, if you feel strange about government and the origins, and the agenda, check out Denver International Airport.

       Wikileaks drops are where I started. It helped that I listened to a lot of old art Bell he had a radio show (it's run by someone else now but the old shit is where it's at on YouTube) he talked about everything from MK Ultra to demons to aliens and Bigfoot
