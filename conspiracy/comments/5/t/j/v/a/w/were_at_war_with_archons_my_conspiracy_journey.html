        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think a gift we all have here in this sub is the ability to ask: why? Regardless of popular opinion things have to make sense. My first conspiracy theory was 9 11. I remember way back asking &quot;why invade Afghanistan and Iraq?&quot; And then &quot;god damn bin laden can sure hide in those caves well&quot;.  It just didn&#39;t add up. </p>

<p>Fast forward to today. I&#39;ve been in almost a circle of beliefs. First it was Jesus then I thought Jesus was man made. Then I thought evolution was correct. Then i circled back to divine creation but not from the Bible. Now I&#39;m currently exploring this whole other world of the metaphysical.</p>

<p>It messes a person up. I do believe currently in a divine intelligent universe. I think it&#39;s the ultimate conspiracy. Where we came from. </p>

<p>Anyway having a hard time keeping my head on straight with so many viewpoints to juggle. Hopefully some of you can share yours and your thoughts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have to gravitate towards what &#39;resonates&#39; with you, meaning what calms your curiosity and what satisfies your intellectual/spiritual hunger.</p>

<p>For myself, it was a series of materials that put my religious upbringing into a different perspective, and was really positive for my mindset. I shed nearly all fear of death and got past some anxiety and other issues largely due to me finding what worked as an &#39;answer&#39; for myself (I can&#39;t claim to know if its true or not).</p>

<p>So keep searching until you find the thing that makes you not want to search anymore. What I found through my own path was that the point is not in &#39;knowing&#39; what is going on or who&#39;s fighting with whom... the point is to occupy your own space as who you are and pay attention to what your purpose is here on earth. There are so many distractions, and we should allow ourselves that to an extent, but remember that life is very simple if you just live with an open heart and try to catch what the universe throws at you. I agree with you on the divine intelligent universe. I think the point of this incarnation is to polarize towards &#39;good&#39; or &#39;evil&#39; (service to others or service to self), and I think Jesus was the example to follow to polarize towards service to others. With that said, what is most important is for you to be yourself. We&#39;ve had a Jesus already - we need to keep just creating experiences and explore the novelty of it all. I really think that is the point of all of this - we&#39;re just collecting experiences into a greater whole. </p>

<p>As for archons/fallen angels - all that jazz - there may very well be powerful spiritual forces that are in play and affecting us. I don&#39;t know. What I do know is that outside of whatever power you think you have, you&#39;re probably not going to affect them much if they do exist. Again, I think it&#39;s something where you need to keep you eye on the ball - keep doing the little things. If you&#39;re focusing every day on being the best version of yourself, you will be doing your part. I think we do not understand how powerful we are when we are purely ourselves in our best state. All the best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are eternal spiritual beings having a brief physical experience.</p>

<p>It might be helpeful to separate the &#39;God&#39; that is the Universe - the Oneness of all, from the &#39;gods&#39; of religion that are personified. You have to bring ancient ET interaction into the equation to fully understand the &#39;creation&#39; (bio-engineering) of our physical bodies came after a long period of evolution. </p>

<p>As we are not truly identified with our bodies on a higher level, we are divine beings (soul incarnations) experiencing trauma on these lower planes. You are absolutely right about Archons and multi-dimension being an enemy, using our temporary forgetfulness to manipulate us. They are parasites, IDs (inter-dimensional beings) and our suffering is an energy source to them.</p>

<p>Trauma and fear can be spread from perpetrator to victim. That is why victims often (not always) become perpetrators. The trauma on our multi-dimensional bodies become conduits of transmission for these Archons.</p>

<p>&#39;Satan&#39; is a red herring, but satanism is the culture of the Archons, as is luciferianism. Lucifer coordinates the Archons, as a kind of AI-based plasma being... Jesus and the Gnostics had knowledge of all of these things, which was later co-opted into false teachings. They used much different language to explain certain scientific concepts that we are just now beginning to understand again. We are waking, and the &#39;knowing&#39; (the gnosis), is returning to the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ill help you out. We are one concsoiusness experiencing itself subjectivly. But in order for that to happen. The one must split into two. This is the reason for binary and dualism features in our reality. Between these two poles, is a vibration. Its what mystics call the great snake. All life and matter is an expression of this. That being said. We as humans occupy one side, and our balancing opposite occuys the other. The tension between these two is what has got us to where we are now. Man only grows in turmoil. But what is our opposite?</p>

<p>We inhabit the material, naturally our opposition must then inhabit the immaterial. What is the immaterial? Well, it can only be understood by what its not. That being everything not material. So the being(s) that balance us is non-physical. Think left brain vs right brain since that the embodiment of inner duality.</p>

<p>Now, we are mammals correct? Whats a mammals biggest predator? Ill let you dwell on it. </p>

<p>So, what our brains do, amongst many other things, is take in and filter information. This information is then synthesized into a holographic illusion. Giving you the perception of reality. When ones synthetic hologram is reading and decoding different data from others, we call that schizophrenia. Its also why certain drugs make you hallucinate and why people can share hallucinations. What you see is real, your brains usually just filter the information out do to social conditioning of what is necessary to perceive in your current state of reality.</p>

<p>Lets say our opposition was able to make themselves material. They would have to appear in this hologram somehow? There are two ways. One is by inhabiting the body of someone receptive of their influence. The myths of exorcisms can be attributed to this. There are many ways to make ones body receptive of the signal so to speak. Some people have genetic traits that allow this to happen more easily, others are made vessels by ritualism.</p>

<p>The second way they could appear is by directly inserting themselves into your brains data stream. As your brain deciphers the raw information into an experience, it would read this information about an immaterial being and have to make a judgement as to what it could be. Lets run through the criteria.</p>

<p>Its not friendly
Its predatory in some way (ill explain why it would have to be soon)
It means us harm</p>

<p>Now, your brain relies on instinct to render the hologram, so if this being was to make itself known, it would look like something thats naturally our biggest predator. Did you guess what it is yet? What do you feed rats to?</p>

<p>Bingo. They make a little sense now right?</p>

<p>So how can they be alive if they exist only in the immaterial. Well they need what you and me need. Energy. We get ours from food, vitamins, sex, dopamine, art, music, all material things or things that require materials to express. We have many ways to rejuvenate our minds and body. But if you dont have a physical presence, how do you gain sustenance? Through other living things of course. Vamprism. Well, what are your methods.</p>

<p>If we look at the heart as a battery, since it produces and ships the vital essence of our body, all batteries have a possitive and negative charge. This charge creates a magnetic field. Now to oversimplify this for the sake of understanding, If you live in a state of love(I hate that word but its the only one that works) your energy is being projected internally, to your spirit. If you live in fear (again, terrible word for it but it makes sense this way) your energy is projected outwards. Thats why we feel exhausted from worry and stress. What these beings do, is consume the energy that is emitted from fear. Its why ritual torture is needed when summoning demons.
They use our fears and insecurities against us to always keep up in a state thats capable of being syphoned from. Its why war and politics are a thing. Its why civilization appeared out of the blue. Its why religion is so oppressive. One must be maintained in that state to be consumed. Now what if you got a whole nation like this, or a whole planet or galaxy even. You could essentially parasite off the living to live forever in an untouchable state of being.</p>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceburg and if you want to really understand this, it&#39;s imperative that you read david ickes work. Don&#39;t watch his videos. Read his books. They contain better information. You can get them at your library.  </p>

<p>Also a good read is The Illuminatus by Robert Anton Wilson. Its satire mainly but brings forth a lot of good ideas and tricks to reclaim your reality.</p>

<p>Unable to find a man hiding in caves for years but we&#39;re able to land a satalite on a moving asteroid? Doesn&#39;t add up. We find him and kill him but no body? Doesn&#39;t add up. </p>
