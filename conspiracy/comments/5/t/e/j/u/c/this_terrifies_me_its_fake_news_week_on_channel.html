<p>Just look at that. Everything that&#39;s being said about pedogate  is just being parroted from the news. I don&#39;t know anyone who even cares at all in real life.</p>

<p>Please tell me other people can see how scary this shit actually is? It&#39;s like their plan is coming to fruition and I cannot see us winning this battle. The people are too far gone, they are at the point of brain washing each other.</p>

<p>It just makes me sick. People have been talking about this since before any of us were even a twinkle in our fathers eye yet it&#39;s called a joke. </p>

<p>If we do finally expose these elite pieces of filth I&#39;m going to remember each and every one of these threads and I&#39;m going to take such pleasure in going to each user and shoving it in their face. But of course if this ever did happen everyone would suddenly believe the theories and never doubted them because people are cowards.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant it just makes me sick to see my country pass the point of no return.</p>

<p>Edit: also do not forget this is a no participation link. Do not give them ammo. Don&#39;t vote don&#39;t comment. We don&#39;t need the trouble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went and looked at Huffington Post today, like an idiot.  There is an article on deportations of illegals.  Over 5,000 reader comments.  Surprisingly a number in favor of deportation (WOOHOO!). But others are whining over who will pick peaches.  I mean what the heck!!!  Racist, elitist much?  It makes me sick.  If it costs $10 to produce a tomato, farm to table, at a living wage, I WILL PAY $10.  These people are crazy and elitist and sick.  They are fighting for the oppressed but want cheap tomatoes.  Then I hear that we are reproducing at a great enough rate.  NO SHIT!  The middle class is being taxed to death to pay for the illegals,refugees, and rich, and we have no money left to support chasing children.  It is more important to me to keep ONE child out of the ghetto where there is no chance at a good life, than to have four children and live in Appalachia where the only chance at joy is doing heavy drugs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it&#39;s all upper class folks. I&#39;m not into the whole class war thing but those are the voices your hear from the UK. There is a reason why the working class have a rep for being racist and it&#39;s because they funnel all the immigrants into low income areas and we have to deal with the problems it causes. If I filmed myself walking through glodick it would prove everything I&#39;m saying. I&#39;d be beaten and mugged so fast, I&#39;ve been spat at by children, I&#39;ve had shops full of people stop and stare at me because the shop is in a Muslim area. It&#39;s the sort of thing you can&#39;t tell people because nobody would believe it. They rioted in Oldham at one point and I mean full on police on fire, shops burning down yet according to the news it was a race riot on both sides. I&#39;ve been mugged more time then I can count and I&#39;ve been threatened and chased multiple times. I could go on but it&#39;s gets to the realms of insane shit that sounds made up to push a racist agenda. And all the while I keep thinking it&#39;s being done on purpose so we fight amongst ourselves and not against the government.</p>
