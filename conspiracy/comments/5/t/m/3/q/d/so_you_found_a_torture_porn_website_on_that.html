       Oh but I'm sure it's just performance art, and you can't prove that the voice is John Podesta...

       How can some of you not see the obvious cover-up attempt here? We may not know for certain how deep it all goes, but there is
       <em>
        clearly
       </em>
       something to this Pizzagate stuff. It's a conspiracy being handed to us on a silver platter, and yet a subreddit dedicated entirely to conspiracies is trying to dismiss it as bullshit? We started looking into 9/11 based on flimsier evidence than this.

       This seems to be every comment from anyone who's watched it. Normally I'd bite the bullet but this shit has affected me in a way I didn't know was possible so I just can't bring myself to watch as much as I want to compare voices. I've seen beheadings and all that shit but this is just a whole other level of fucked.

       It's different when it's a child involved. They're innocent little things that haven't done anything to anyone. They still have that hope and wonder about the world and you see this sick fuck breaking down their world.
      </p>
      <p>
       As fucked up as the beheading videos are, the resigned look in those peoples faces, its easier to accept because their torture is over. It's a quick brutal end. But with this video, who fucking knows what happened to that kid. I can say for certainty that it's not good.

       If you are a human being and do not know intrinsically that the fear you heard is genuine, you are emotionally dead already. This is visceral and self-evident. This is evil manifest. That was sheer fucking terror. Oh my god, man. Please, POTUS, rid the Earth of this scum. In tears right now. Fast and fair trials. Televised. Fast track all appeals. Lay all evidence out clearly. Live stream the executions.

       Thanks for doing this. I spent a a little time comparing the voices and, it certainly sounds like it COULD be him. I'd really like to hear him say "father" a couple times. The video is horrendous. I couldn't imagine it being performance art. Those kid's screams don't sound staged to me at all.

       Nonetheless, the child in the video is clearly being tormented, by someone.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <em>
        Edit:
       </em>
       In the following the video, you can hear the child (or another child) being tormented further, by the same individual:
       <a href="http://www.worldcorpo.net/content/video/each.mp4">
        http://www.worldcorpo.net/content/video/each.mp4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As with
       <a href="http://www.worldcorpo.net/content/video/fatherhood.webm">
        the first video
       </a>
       , the child appears to be held against his will, in a shower or bath.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following video shows what appears to be fecal matter on another (or the same) bathtub (possibly the aftermath of the other videos):
       <a href="http://www.worldcorpo.net/content/video/stop.webm">
        http://www.worldcorpo.net/content/video/stop.webm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       While the other videos from that site appear to be little more than a lame albeit marginally creepy attempt at an art project, or perhaps a joke or satire of some form, the three above appear to show something darker, some sick shit any way you look at it.

       In the following the video, you can hear the child (or another child) being tormented further, by the same individual:

       , the child appears to be held against his will, in a shower or bath.

       The following video shows what appears to be fecal matter on another (or the same) bathtub (possibly the aftermath of the other videos):

       While the other videos from that site appear to be little more than a lame albeit marginally creepy attempt at an art project, or perhaps a joke or satire of some form, the three above appear to show something darker, some sick shit any way you look at it.

       I wouldn't rush to assume this is John Podesta either, though I suppose it could be, hypothetically.

      <p>
       God's fury will be unleashed on this scum. To fundamentally pervert something so fundamentally pure is the true definition of evil. This is like a fucking spiritual awakening for me dude. Evil confirmed? Good confirmed? Good=god=god confirmed. ??????? whatever the case is, This shit has to go. PLEASE DO IT TRUMP. FUCKING ARREST ALEFANTIS! ARREST PODESTA! NO BAIL! My outrage is growing. This is about all I gotta see to break out the long forgotten righteous rage and spiritual fury. wheat and tare. gotta separate it.

       You can only see shadows as there is colored, frosted glass in front of the camera. There are strobe lights flashing, a child is screaming. Someone in a creepy as fuck voice is torturing the child. It's some seriously sick shit.

       That is well beyond someone working at a haunted house or along those lines. That is sustained fear. A haunted house or fright fest event has some nervous laughter at some point, or a mocking laugh from someone who anticipated that specific frighting moment.

       It goes on for too long and doesn't seem scripted. The voice is obviously a child. I don't believe for a second this is just acting.

       Just to follow up on this for anyone trying to decide whether or not to watch - it's mental torture. It's horrifying and the child sounds anguished but it's done without laying a finger on him or her.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sincerely hope that kid is just the best child actor ever. If it's real, it seems very elaborate and I'm scared of what the end goal would be.

       Fair enough, it's hard to see so I can't say for sure. I just wanted to clarify you don't literally see physical torture. It's still hard to watch but different people have different thresholds.

       It's extremely hard to watch. There are parts in the first video where the screaming seems to intensify. That leads me to believe there is physical contact. I'm probably going to have nightmares tonight.

       Agreed. It's truly awful. If it's real that reaction is all I needed to hear. Doesn't really matter to me if he laid a hand on them or not, he's the worst kind of monster.

       The current theory is they try to scare the child as much as possible to get certain chemicles pumping in their blood stream then consume the blood one way or another. This video would reinforce that theory.

       I have entertained that theory but I think the more likely scenario is abuse being a form of mind control. If a child is kidnapped and put in these horrifying scenarios they will submit to the individual (why he kept asking the kid to call him father and dad). It's an act of submission and the abuse makes you susceptible to fear and being controlled by the abuser. It would likely go on for years until the mind control is "successful."

       I'm confused - there was a video in 2015 that had already "discovered" these videos... want to know how they discovered them? On a creepy pasta account on YouTube.

       This strikes me as someone taking old recycled creepy-vids and trying to repurpose them for this investigation. It's creepy shit for sure, but the old worldcorpo YouTube page (still up by the way) is evidence that contradicts the narrative of this being some super secret thing that got cracked... it wasn't cracked, the videos were public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I missing something here?
      </p>
      <p>
       And how are these videos or worldcorp related to the whole PG thing? This feels like disinformation.

       nope, you are dead on.  It is not recent info and some have theorized it is creepypasta.  I am unsure why some people have grabbed onto it here.  It sounds and looks bad but isn't a smoking gun.

       Speculation: it's a troll - this originated at 4chan after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy Speculation: it's disinformation. Find easily debunked creepy videos. Get the entire PG story to stake its credibility on flimsy pieces of "evidence" like this. Then come out and publicly debunk it in a master piece on a platform like Rollingstone, Wired or The New Yorker. Rub all of the investigator's noses in it for falling for this weak ass evidence, then gracefully sidestep the actual damning stuff.

       This is political PR 101 stuff. "Answer the question that you
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to answer, not the one they
       <em>
        asked
       </em>
       you".
      </p>
      <p>
       By inserting disinformation, not only would (((they))) guide the investigation away from the real trails, they also discredit anything meaningful by focusing all attention in on stuff that is just manufactured nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, why would a website post these videos on the clearnet in the first place (on a non-password protected page no less) and then AGAIN on YouTube? A whistleblower/leaker would try to make waves if that was their motivation, but whoever did this was content to post the videos and let them chill. An actual insider/pedo would post them to the darknet or, at the very least, password protect them. Pretty much anyone posting anything damning would do so on a webhost that doesn't prohibit this kind of stuff in their terms of service (the host of this content strictly prohibits illegal content).
      </p>
      <p>
       It just doesn't make sense - it doesn't pass any sort of sniff test that anyone who gave a shit about the truth would accept as evidence... the only people promoting this story are doing so without any sort of scrutiny and who are jumping to the most obvious conclusions possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes a lot more sense is that whoever made these videos was into some sort of creepy pasta subculture and was just doing it for kicks. I know I made my fair share of dumb edgy photo editing when I was a kid... this feels like that. Or at least it feels
       <em>
        more like that
       </em>
       than evidence of a global pedophilia ring that's operated for hundreds of years
       <em>
        leaving a smoking gun on fucking YouTube
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to debunk this story on the merits that this pedo stuff isn't going on - IT IS going on - and that's my point... if anyone actually cares enough to want this shit to end, they should be doing so in a responsible way that tosses these sorts of bullshit stories in the garbage... or at the very least give them the scrutiny they deserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this rate I'm just waiting for someone to start posting up screencaps from The Ring and Blair Witch Project and attributing them to a "secret Clinton/Podesta camping trip"... on a site that's jam packed with ads and JS trackers of course.

       I wouldn't feel comfortable blaming that video on John Podesta; but it was definitely creepy as shit and didn't sound staged to me - I listened to it while i was mildly high, and it struck me on a deep emotional level when I was listening to it that acting doesn't usually do - I know that doesn't mean anything to anybody else or in the court of law, but its like a weird sixth sense thing where everything (sound, visual, flavor ect) break down to a color

       I was, but that doesn't mean the feelings are fake - I am remarkably better at reading peoples emotions when I am high and guiding them to where I would like them to go - like if my gf comes home in a bad mood and im high, i am pretty quickly to able to identify if she is feeling stress or anger or sadness ect, i can almost understand what caused her to get that way, and i know instinctively how to guide her to better spirits so she isnt pissy at me.   That type of thing is natural for some people, but not for me.  Im usually just 'i gotta get out of here'

       Yea, i get those bad vibes too sometimes - people say smoking weed gives them anxiety; i think it gives them worse than anxiety, but they dont like to talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find that weed makes me extremely empathetic, in a good and bad way.  If you have a significant other, and you look them in the eyes, you can like feel the love (assuming they actually love you; if they dont, you'll probably pick that up if youre paying attention).  The bad side is, if you think of bad stuff like a murderer, you can inherit their perspective a bit.  You still have your morals, so its not like you do anything; but you almost realize "holy fuck- so thats what he's thinking".
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't worry about the honey pot thing - the real people in danger are people who are in power/have power; so if a celebrity saw that and started tweeting it, they might have 'an accident'.  Also - fear and pain are just frequencies - you pick them up the same way your eyes pick up visible light frequencies or your ears pick up sonic frequencies - if you look inside, you can block them, the same way you can close your eyes or cover your ears

       It's almost exactly how I pictured one of those mk ultra things, disorientating strobe lighting in a cage and some guy shouting stuff. When I seen it it definitely didn't come off as fake tbh it made my skin crawl, if it is fake it's some pretty good acting for a couple of edgy art students.

       Its not that simple - it messes with your senses.  Things that are normally very noticeable get pushed to the back and subtle things come forward and are more obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be as simple as the reverberations from his voice in the room he was in that may not be noticeable to you, but when I listened it was more prominent to my ears and it created a sense or space, position and energy

       Or maybe you just looked at it a different way and made connections that you couldnt make when you were sober.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good example is I was watching Starship Troopers - I knew it was a movie about fascism and it was loaded with propaganda.  I've seen it a million times - i know the movie like the back of my hand.  But when I was high, I realized something: the attack that happened on south america that prompted them to go to war with the bugs, I believe it was a false flag.  I think the news report about it lied saying the bugs directed an asteroid, but i dont think that really made sense.  I think their whole objective was to just get the brain bug.  And the scene where Rico and Doogie Howser were playing that card game near the beginning of the movie and Rico couldnt predict the cards was symbolic of how he was deceived because he lacked that sixth sense

       Well the same people who are constantly dismissing pizzagate are the same people sarcastically mocking turmp and alike.
      </p>
      <p>
       If only they realized pizzagate is not just a one party thing, it effects all of government. Why not find proof of it being bullshit as opposed to just saying 'nah its bullshit'.

       I used to lurk this place a lot and enjoy the discussion and people researching, but now it's just people coming in saying it's bullshit without evidence, leaving the thread and having their comment upvoted.

       "Pizzagate" is a distraction. Even if it is real, the hype phenomoneon has cause any involved to totally close ranks. A truly damaging conspiracy? The democratic primary.

       Eh, they appear to be working on it.  I've seen several prominent members saying that they have to own what was done to Senator Sanders.   Acknowledging that what happened was wrong.  I didn't hear anything how super delegates, however, but maybe in time?

       The corrupt conspiracies between the DNC and related PACs (federally illegal, I might add) to deliberate foment violence, game the Republican primary to favor extremists, and manipulate the media.  That's what I'm talking about.  Addressing what happened to Sanders looks nice and might attract a few voters back to the fold, but does nothing to address the deep rot.

       The problem is that there's no hard evidence.  As soon as there is, I'll be right there with you with my pitchfork.  I have to be skeptical as it isn't just the "Liberal Media" that is a biased and "fake" issue.  Conservative media is just as bad if not worse and I cannot put it past them to help push this narrative as I've seen it before.

        Honest question for you - Do you question the media that you consume?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       All of it.  I don't watch TV because it never gives me a chance to evaluate and question.  Radio is marginally better.  Most of my news is print, and I question pretty much everything about as much as I question (for example) Alex Jones.  At this point, I figure that whatever the truth is, it is pretty much guaranteed NOT to show up in the media, mainstream or alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only media I consider trustworthy is extended interview segments that are long enough for me to understand full context.  However, I keep in mind that the only trustworthiness is that I am getting some perspective (truthful or otherwise) from the individual speaking.

       Do you really think that internal corruption of Democrats or too cozy relations with Israel is
       <em>
        more insidious
       </em>
       ? That is kind of stuff could come out (and it has to a certain extent) without major damage to anyone involved. Sure, some politicians might have to be fired, but that wouldn't anything they couldn't manage
       <br/>
       <em>
        If
       </em>
       PG is true it would be the end of whoever took part in it. Even if it isn't, enough  public traction could cause irredeemable damage to their reputations. There's no way it's an attempt by the DNC to muddy the waters.
       <br/>
       However, I'm sure there is organizations and governments that benefit from this theory, so don't take this as a proof of PG being real.

       I think it's hard for people to find "proof it's bullshit" because the more you dig into it the less likely it seems to be bullshit, at least in one way or the other. It's entirely possible that people are connecting the wrong dots and whatever but the
       <em>
        actual true accounts
       </em>
       of any case of child abuse or pedophilia are disturbing enough- it feels almost worse when it's a common household name that you can never see the same.

       The reason it seems less likely to be bullshit once you've dug into it is because you are able to cross reference data and create context, something a random user typing "bullshit" likely hasn't done, thus deeming their opinion non-credible.

       Frankly there's enough of us who have done the research ourselves and are getting sick of people demanding sources. I know you're politely asking rather than demanding. But it still stands. And I'm not even saying pizzagate is true to the fullest extent, although it sure seems like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is true at the very least, is that there is a human trafficking/pedophelia pandemic that has for most of my life, somehow gone unmentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       That fact alone(which again has become quite obviously fact to those of us that have done the research) makes it more likely that the full implications are true. I don't see how it could have gotten to this point without some very powerful people facilitating it, and at the very least allowing it.

       amen to this. If you aren't reading original sourcing on EVERY news story you read, especially MSM, let alone pizzagate, you're not informed whatsoever. If you don't know how to look for an original source then us selling you on pizzagate is the least of your worries and you won't make a good force for the cause anyhow- disinfo is a virus and OG sources are the only antidote. This is how to live a real life 101 folks. Anything else is mere consumption-ism.

       So, in other to fight disinfo you'll just disparage those asking for you to cite sources backing your claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of us don't have the time to look into every single story. I don't accept any claim outright, regardless of where it's coming from. More than half the posts about pizza gate here don't cite anything. This post is exactly that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you cared so much about it why not spend the time writing up an article with all the relevant quotes and sources? Seems like all that research is a waste if you don't.

       We can't all be investigative journalists. If I even tried to dig down the how rabbit hole without a guide I'd have to put off all the other stuff I do in my spare time.

      <p>
       We cannot all be investigative journalists. If you've done the research and actually care about the spread of misinformation maybe you should share those results instead of shouting down those who are curious and don't know where to start?

       You spent more time writing this than it would take to pull up any of the MANY WELL CITED posts about pizzagate. If you don't have time to verify what you read you really don't have time to read and you'll be worse off for the disinfo. In case you've been living under a rock there aren't any investigative journalists anymore. Go to voat or the archived r/pizzagate sub. no i am not going to provide you the links you lazy ass.

       Calling bullshit is the easiest way to dodge the reality for people whom are so afraid to crash their perception-bubble. This is the same with so-called scientists who dismiss phenomenas they can't explain, and most of it.

       Scientists only pursue phenomena that yield results which give them research grants. If they pursue something that might not yield any results they would not be motivated to research it and thus it's easier to just dismiss it. An example is trying to research double slit theory.

       I can understand not pursing something because of lack of financial support, but dismissing it is completely unnecessary. I think most scientist would say "It's a shame but I'm going to have to leave this subject alone as it's not financially viable" rather than "If I can't pursue it then I'll dismiss it".

       As u/OptionalZebra pointed out, not investigating because lack of financial support is very different from dismissing. Even then, lots of scientists pursue projects on their own time and dime. And then some experiments are just too expensive to fund out of pocket.

       Do you mean the double slit experiment? There is plenty of research done on it and the theory and consequences behind it.

       It's the assumption that if you didn't like option A, that you
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       like option B that is ignorant.  No, I wish that Trump hadn't won the presidency.  NOR do I wish that Clinton won.  Only having two choices does not mean that you have to prefer one over the other.

       It simply shows how deeply the system has driven their wedge between the two halves of America.  There's no way to unify and organize ourselves against the government/elite/whatever if we're too busy fighting among ourselves.  The liberals aren't the enemy.  The conservatives aren't the enemy.  The people who've hijacked this country are the enemy.

       This may be a silly question,  as I'm not American,  but why did you only have two options? What would have happened if the majority voted for Jill Stein? Even if some people don't agree with all of her positions, she was far better than a NWO poster child or a war criminal.

       It's not going to happen, just a useless hypothetical. People are controlled by their cultural institutions, mainly the news. If the news doesn't legitimize a candidate they have no chance. That's not unique to the U.S. either, it's just to a more obvious degree.

       Electoral College.  The US is a republic.  Meaning each state is represented in our government.  Essentially a candidate has to get 270 electoral votes to become president.  A state has a certain amount of electoral votes and, with the exception of Nebraska and Maine, are winner takes all.  Basically our system is set up to really only allow two parties.  If another party(s) starts to take states there won't be enough electoral votes for a candidate to get to 270.  A third party candidate not only has to all the sudden be extremely popular, but they have to compete against entrenched Democrats and Republicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem is that we don't hear about third party politicians that often outside of our presidential election cycle.  There are reasons for this, but essentially we don't see them until election time.  That isn't great for getting people to vote for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even if a majority voted for Jill she likely wouldn't have become president as she wouldn't have been able to get enough electoral votes.  Then it would be up to congress to decide who would be president in the event no one gets 270.  We would likely have the same president we have now.

       According to Epsteins brother.
I have read this was the time Trump was with his family hitching a ride back to NYC.  But is this flight listed in the flightlogs from Epsteins plane?  I couldn't find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So at the most it was once with his family?  Barbara Walters and other famous people also flew on Epsteins plane.  That means nothing.

       I believe in pizzagate. I think the (circumstancial) evidence is enough to say that something is probably going on within the DNC camp a la Podesta, Alefantis etc. But one could deny pizzagate while at the same time believing in a greater global pedophilia/trafficking ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is probably rampant pedophilia within the GOP too. After all, they are one and the same.

       Stop acting like I owe you my belief.  I've looked at the evidence and I just don't believe it.

      <p>
       I do think there are systems of abuse by high ranking officials.  Actually this is not up for debate as there is plenty of evidence and plenty of officials who have been implicated and even gone to jail from long before this pizza gate overhyped bullshit.  So for the love of god, stop acting like you people who jumped on the bandwagon only after hearing hype about pizzagate have discovered some groundbreaking secret information about trafficking in circles of power.  Those of us who have been here have known about this shit for  tens of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically I do not believe the podesta e-mail code words from 4chan nor do I believe all the bs about pizza restaurant being some center of trafficking, torture, and other abuse. And that is what pizzagate is.  It is not anything other than those two defining categories.  Podesta e-mails and the pizza place.  Pizzagate is not every example of abuse by someone in a position of power and influence, so stop it.

       9/11 was shady as fuck from day 1 and got worse over the years as it became blatantly obvious the attack was done to gather support (and weak support at that) for wars in the middle east.  The PNAC documents fully verified the conspiracy theories and we didn't have to do madlib word substitution to prove it.  Do not ever in your fucking life act like the evidence was flimsier than some dumb fuck e-mail 4chan madlibs about hot dogs.  You are an insult to the conspiracy community with your ignorance and with how you believe this shit.

       I agree with you doug. I believe the majority of the story is true. But I also believe that a large portion of the pizza parlor details and other keywords have been injected into the conversation in order to discredit the whole scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that there are teams creating honeypots, rabbit holes and whole websites in order to derail serious investigation and discussion.

       Thank you. I am so tired of nutbags trying to say you must support child abuse if you call bullshit on this whole Podesta/Pizza gate fairy tale. Yes there are terrible, awful people in this world who do terrible things to other humans, even children. I would even agree there is more of it going on with the rich and powerful because they feel they can get away with it. Hell, maybe Podesta is a weirdo. But all the "evidence" people keep spewing here is insulting to people's intelligence. I've seen these videos. I have seen the instagram pics. I have read the emails. It is bullshit.

       Chartering a private plane to Columbia?  Ms. Palmieri decided it was an idea with merit, especially if John's evil alter-ego "Skippy" would come along:

       And that's why it shouldn't be taken at face value. It's being used against democrats instead of our entire economic system that allows people to get into positions where things like this become possible.

       Trump has connections with both epstein and the clintons, the greasy real estate mogul who lived in a gilded tower in NYC and also ran a modeling agency isn't also a suspect? That's what is crazy to me.

       Ok fine, trump is a suspect to. Even if anything linking him is extremely weak. This isnt about picking a political side, if trump is involved then we will get him too. There's just not much linking him to it all.

       It smells of the FBI insiders releasing info on 4chan to show the general public that they are working.
      </p>
      <p>
       This noise they are generating also gives President Trump and AG Sessions reason to probe the individuals who own these things. I don't know what the FBI has to do to investigate something that the NSA finds, but I do know that they like using parallel construction to pretend that they located it on their own. This allows them to pretend that some random internet user found this website.

       I only watched 5 seconds, so it's hard for me to say, but if the rest of it is the same, torture porn or art, that will fuck those kids up for life. And if someone is into that kind of art... They have deep rooted issues.

       I agree. IMO there is no way that was fake. EVEN if it was an art project, you cant make a child cry like THAT. That child was truly terrified of whoever "John" was.

       The video everyone is claiming to be Podesta is just very dark, blurry footage of a kid in a pool shower (the kid is in shorts and you can see refracted light from a large body of water on the walls) getting yelled at by an older man.  The older man is hitting the glass door of the shower with a push broom and the kid is screaming.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is another video of the same scenario where the guy is making the kid sing a song.  Again, lots of screaming and banging on the glass door.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few other videos depict similar situations.  One of them shows large splatters of blood on a bathtub while an adult male off-screen moans and cries out something about "my family".  Another one shows a dog licking vomit off the floor while a drugged-up looking guy in church clothes rolls around on the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty clear this is part of an ARG or some kind of edgy art project.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of the videos are clearly comedy-oriented. One of them is a video-dating profile for a guy who says he's going to die in 24 hours and just wants to suck some dick.  His email address is "
       <a href="mailto:dyingdad69xoxo@hotmail.com">
        dyingdad69xoxo@hotmail.com
       </a>
       "  Another one is just a shot of a desk with somebody off screen yelling "JEWS" over and over again.  Most of them are poorly recorded original rap songs or short video-art vignettes.

       This is obviously a publicity stunt probably backed by some money. just because theres comedy oriented stuff dosnt mean we should write off the abuse videos. Theres a good chance this is just the continuation of the pizzagate psy op. Worldcorp sounds like some satanic NWO shit

       I wish I hadn't.  I watched the one titled insubordination.... ten or eleven year old kid in a shower?  freezing, shaking uncontrollably and covered in shit, literally wiping it all over themsevles while they cower and shake and someone is taping them. You do not see the kids face, I do not know if if is a girl or a boy.

       whatever the hell that is.  point is that these videos have been part of creepypasta/ 4chan/ memeification for a while.  Saying that they were dug up on the CPP website is bullshit.  It's an obvious fraud.

       Wtf, I went on it and after few seconds it somehow opened up Discord and tried to invite me to a Discord server, but I rejected... Like it somehow detected that I have Discord running and opened the link. That was some actual scary shit.

       After looking through the videos i'm getting the feeling that all these videos and the contents of the website might be from the iPhone that Podesta is reported to have lost in a NYC cab.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or am i speculating too much?

       K, so. I went on their creepy Discord chat and apparantely this thing is some edgy-ARG or idk some sort of other creepy shit. It is confusing as noone can give exact answer to what this is , but some guy named @ceo in that chat admitted that he filmed those videos.. I won't give out his Discord tag in public as it would be a dox, but if someone wants to know more contact me.

       Honestly I don't even know if I want to watch more of them.  That shit was chilling and it's just more circumstantial evidence proving that the pedo rings are a hundred percent real.  The fact that people are still denying the problem even exist despite mountains of historical evidence proving it to be true leads me to believe that this sub is infested with shells or full of really naive gullible people that trust their government far too much.

       I didn't even vote for Trump btw but you all are so delusional. You guys are in for a serious reality check when these people actually start getting busted which is only a matter of time. The evidence is plentiful and speaks for itself. You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to see it. All across this country and the world over the last few weeks many pedo rings are getting busted. Everyone in govts all over the world know it to be true. If you are speaking out against pizzagate you either are a pedo yourself or you are ignorant and haven't even looked at all the evidence for yourself. My advice to you is to pay better attention of the world around you, educate yourself and maybe one day you will actually be able to bring something to the table instead of just being a narcissist that only pretends to care in order to feel good about yourself and to look good on social media. Now would be a perfect time for you all to reevaluate your lives. If you really do care about the world pull your head out of your own ass and spend a little more time looking into things instead of just reading and repeating headlines you saw on Facebook. If you libs/dems/whatever you people are want to be taken seriously you are going to have to put your big boy pants on, k?

       Can it be proven the file was taken from Podesta's site? My Google-fu is only getting a single YouTube video with a few screenshots showing the passworded section, and the zip file. I've been trying to find untouched .zip files to try and examine the metadata but from what I'm seeing I can't find the originals. It's very suspicious and very easy to fake.

       It's mainly Democrats who will deny Pizzagate to no end because they think the pedos are only Democrats when in reality theres some republicans too. Democrats are willing to ignore clear evidence of child abuse just so their party doesn't get attacked. Sick sick people

       At the BARE MINIMUM James Alfeantis is GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY. He is so obviously a pedophile that even his friends call him their favorite pedo. He makes remarks about pedophilia on Instagram. His Instagram picture is some Roman Boy Lover. I mean ATLEAST they have to admit he's a pedo, right? And then once you are able to admit he's you have to ask yourself why all these other politicians hang out with him considering he's a pedo. And then you have to wonder why Podestas go to "Concerts" at the pizza shop that discuss pedophilia.......oh fuck it I have no clue how someone could not see whats going on here. Start with the pizza shop and move to podesta and it there's just too much there to ignore

       My vote is that it should be investigated. At the very least it seems have to uncovered that Podesta and his bros are a bunch of pedos. The evidence doesn't as of yet prove to me that they are running a child trafficking ring themselves, I think they are more likely clients, but of course it should still be explored more.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I don't think this subreddit should be obsessed with only pizzagate. It is distracting from some of the other obvious conspiracies. People talk about pizzagate more than the fact that Rothschild employees are directly running the government,  and that Trump is the now the poster child for the NWO. All the end time 1984 style dystopian fears are coming true, and many idiots here who should be most skeptical are welcoming it with open arms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if people are really worried about kids,  go after the churches. Most of the child sexual abuse in the world still lies with the Catholic Church, and it's like people have forgotten that.

       Please. Tell me one time 4chan has ever been right about any conspiracy theory. The problem I have with Pizzagate is that it's based on abstract, made-up information sussed out by Internet "sleuths" and wannabe, two-bit hackers. So far all of the evidence implicating John Podesta has been a stretch. None of it has been substantiated.
      </p>
      <p>
       4chan is a hotbed for white supremacy. It's the abode of retards, prove me wrong. Everyday some troll anon poses as a whistleblower from the FBI with some outlandish prediction or clandestine information that NEVER comes true. It gets worse than that, it's also the same website that gave birth to Anonymous. Yes, Anonymous. Do you know who the real Anonymous were? They were reckless, mischievous kids that did nothing to TPTB (it's not like they could anyway). Nothing disseminating from that website has ever been credible.

       Virtually everything that fbianon posted came true, so idk what you're talking about.  Just because most of the 4chan posters are white supremacist shitlords doesn't mean that people don't occasionally post real nuggets of truth in there to get lost in the white noise and claim plausible deniability.

        Age-old knowledge, and extremely vague. If you think that some person on 4chan was the first to say this then you are naive.
3.People knew about the Clinton Foundation years before any FBIanon said that, so that's any conspiracy theorists' guess.

        If it's nothing new then why are you using it as a point? Thousands of people have been talking about this forever.

        This was common knowledge amongst the conspiracy theory realm, prove me wrong.

       3, 4, and 7 never came into existence in the mainstream media continuity which creates reality for those outside the conspiracy theory realm. 7 is any conspiracy theorists' guess as well. My point was that the FBIanon has never broke out any news that became true, not necessarily that they have been wrong about everything. These things have been circulated here and in the conspiracy theory realm for years. If they don't have clandestine or recondite knowledge then they are not real agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see a single thing that an FBIanon broke out that hasn't been stated or known before.

       I didn't say he was the first guy to reveal any of this, that was an assumption you made all by yourself.  He revealed specific information that only an insider would know about as to the inner workings of the FBI case against Clinton and the divided nature of the intelligence agencies during the election.  I said that those points he made turned out to be true, which is correct.  And not for nothing but Hillary Clinton herself said that she would pursue warfare against Russia either directly or by cyber warfare, right in the debates themselves.  Half of your points were personal anecdotes and guesses themselves.  But that was a nice attempt at moving goalposts 😉

       So the fuck what? Every conspiracy theorist has made those points before him, so I guess they were insiders as well? Clinton never said she would pursue warfare against Russia, show me when and where she said this. Those weren't my points, those were YOUR points, which you're doing a shit awful job at defending. Based off of your logic, I could have posed as an FBIanon and then said that  some college members wouldn't vote for Trump despite him winning the most electoral votes, and be considered an elite, secretive, FBI insider. Laughable.

       locking up a toddler behind glass with strobe lights while you curse at them and scream at them is child abuse to me. It didn't look fake it didn't look acted. If you act out shit like that you need an ass whopping regardless. The other videos look 100% bullshit to me. I have never said that there's concrete proof its actually Podesta.

       100 Percent agree. If you take yourself out of the media stream and look at this based on factual things that we know, there are some strange things that are facts that have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emails
The instagram pictures
The instagram comments which are very strange(hotard ect)
The artwork
The bands that play their and the things surrounding them

       I just think based on facts alone it has to be worth a more serious look.

       What's with the rap? In mid life crisis under the music page he sings about never leaving his basement. Now I'm not assuming he's rapping his real life or anything but how does this bizarre soundcloud fit into it unless it's some internet slueth trying to get attention to his funky murder rap?

       My whole, very big issue with PG is the satanic bit, I don't doubt for a moment that there are pedos in high places nor do I doubt there are pedos who exchange goods and services amongst themselves. But the satanic part just screams bullshit, historically when this is brought up invariably it turns out to be some sensationalist crap drummed up by religious fanatics. And that one or two times it is someone actually worshipping 'satan' it's some lone sociopath who's corralled a handful of others to do his/her bidding and satan has very little to do with it the main focus of this operations which is kid fucking and sex. Sociopaths know that religion is a tool to control people and it works. If the satanic aspect of PG was there or if it was just a tiny bit of it I would probably be on board with it a lot more but to tell me that a bunch of high powered, educated people are worshipping satan is beyond believable.

       Sometimes when something is truly dark is is so horrendous and so unthinkable that peoples mids dismiss it because they cannot believe such cruelty can exist. People have been conditioned to believe the government is for them through social engineering. It is not to be dismissed and if the police do not do anything about it well somebody better call Batman or some shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF the truth is brought to light and the powers that be dismiss it you will be left with 1 of 2 options to go about your life accepting the fact that it is what it is and there is nothing you as an individual can do about it or decide to put yourself on the line in whatever capacity suits your skills to help bring it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the evidence I have looked over makes me feel like this is real but before I as an individual took action on any level I would need to know not speculative but atual incriminating evidence was brought before the police FBI CIA and dismissed before I advocated for vigilante justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only once I know for sure that that has happened would I feel compelled to do something myself.

       23 seconds Podesta raises his voice a little
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Eoi_Ar2KDwoYouTube">
        https://youtu.be/Eoi_Ar2KDwoYouTube
       </a>
       . In this video, Podesta's voice cracks like the man in Fatherhood at the 23 second mark:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/YZnstAiN3Vg">
        https://youtu.be/YZnstAiN3Vg
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I could see that being him in Fatherhood, "John," and Fatherhood is the same guy as the Each video. Plus the stuttering. Podesta stutters.

       Something else.....One of the Chan posts has this image pulled from one of the vids:

       Now, in the post they ask to check hidden text at the top, and the timer. I think the text reads "jod does not forgive you" but I can't make out what the very last part is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The date. 6/6/15. There was a Wikileaks dump of John Podesta's emails that day. The juiciest one referenced "wet works" just before Scalia's death, and that was some wet shit in that pic:

       To me it seems like a ARG made by someone that's really fucked up. The whole idea of these things are to make them seem as real as possible. And in one of the videos i saw talking about this they showed that the creator is credited in another ARG that happened a while ago.

       There's a normal video of Podesta speaking. Totally different accents imo, in the abuse vid the guy sounds like he's from Boston.

       the thing ive noticed the whole design language that they are using is def very alternative, for example how shitty their website is, its resembling some punkish/post modern/indie alternative groups, only example i have is the comedy group Milliondollarextreme's website.
      </p>
      <p>
       but beyond that, all their pictures have a certain look and design, it very much resembles the whole new vaporwave music that popped up not too long ago. the styles look extremely similar.

       Apparantely most of people who are in the Discord chat are there for chilling out and noone really knows what it is and they say that if someone knew they wouldn't tell it anyways. I have that CEO guys Discord ID backed up just in case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday he told that he filmed the video, one where Podesta voice can be heard and the screaming child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also apparantely it has some hiearchy and someone said that we cannot see those, but Admin and Staff or lower. So maybe there are higher ranks in that Discord server who cannot be seen by default members.
      </p>
      <p>
       My initial theory was that it may be a ARG game for real, but those who solve the most complex clues may get lead to like a deeper network of something that may involve more P3d0Gaate stuff...
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know if this is simply a edgy ARG community with edited videos or something for real. I'll try to keep you updated.

       After doing a bit of research it seems that the person that made those videos, did so as an art rot to create and ARG. The Worldcorp videos were originally uploaded to YouTube. When YouTube took them down, they were reup load with the disruption "if you take these down again I will hang myself and the rest of Worldcorp". When they removed them the second time, the Worldcorp website popped up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This behavior leads me to believe that this isn't the work of some elites but instead some fucked up nobody's.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you YouTube "Worldcorp ARG" you'll find a few videos doing a good job debunking its validity as well as revealing that when you do get to the end of the ARG it's pretty much just an elaborate attempt to troll.

       Well, if it's both impossible to disprove, and it's impossible to prove, given the information we have, then we don't really have a provable idea in the first place and need to make a more specific claim.

       So the fuck what? Every conspiracy theorist has made those points before him, so I guess they were insiders as well? Clinton never said she would pursue warfare against Russia, show me when and where she said this. Those weren't my points, those were YOUR points, which you're doing a shit awful job at defending. Based off of your logic, I could have posed as an FBIanon and then said that  some college members wouldn't vote for Trump despite him winning the most electoral votes, and be considered an elite, secretive, FBI insider. Laughable.

        Trump rode on Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane
        <strong>
         <em>
          at least once
         </em>
        </strong>
        , according to the deposition of Mark Epstein, Jeffrey’s brother. That number pales, however, to Bill’s 26 trips on the “Lolita Express.”

       According to Epsteins brother.
I have read this was the time Trump was with his family hitching a ride back to NYC.  But is this flight listed in the flightlogs from Epsteins plane?  I couldn't find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So at the most it was once with his family?  Barbara Walters and other famous people also flew on Epsteins plane.  That means nothing.
