       I beleive many old folks care places are feeder places for hospitals coowned by the same people. I beleive the hospital makes far more from an elederly person being in intensive care for a fewdays before they die than they do in months of elder care. Therefore i beleive the eldercare places put in policies which will result in the elderly eventually being tranferred to hospital intensive care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Policies could include high sugar foods and wieght gain etc to cause kidney failure .
      </p>
      <p>
       You would be amazed at the amounts of high sugar jello etc given to elderly who should never have so much sugar especially since most have blood sugar issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I beleive most elderly careplaces make it very difficult for family members to track their parents weight gain etc. Many forbid scales etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course all policies would have a level of neglect that would be plausibly deniable.

       We couldn't give them fresh organics from the garden, which l grew for them.

       The facilities are horseshoe in shape and they go in low care at one end and come out from palliative care at the other, in a box.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the meantime they were fed loads of shit food and often treated like shit by the so called carers/staff.

       Fucken depressing environment to spend the last years of ones life.

       I actually work in the Dietary department at a old-folks nursing home. I can tell you without a doubt that corporate shirks our budget in order to maintain profits, and as a result we work with very poor quality food items for these people. I am often ashamed to be even serving some of these items, but our cooks are doing the best they can with what they've got.
      </p>
      <p>
       The REAL problem in these nursing homes is drugs. Some of these residents are so addicted to opiate pain killers and the like, and the nurses hand them out like candy. I've recently put in my two weeks after many years of working here because I'm just sick of the toxic environment. The funniest part is when corporate employees come to give us speeches about how our job is to care about the residents when at the end of the day these residents are treated like livestock. Fed, drugged up and kept in their rooms all day.

       I worked in a nursing home for a couple years. My mother has worked in nursing homes for decades. A lot of nursing homes run on pretty much a skeleton crew, just enough workers (who aren't paid well)to get the job done just good enough to meet regulations and laws. There are people who work in them who genuinely care for the residents but you are spread thin and have to make the best of it.
