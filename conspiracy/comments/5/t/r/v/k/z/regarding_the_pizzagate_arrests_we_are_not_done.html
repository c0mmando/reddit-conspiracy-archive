        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just want to really quickly point out a few things regarding the supposed &quot;arrests&quot; that are related to Pizzagate, and the child trafficking evidence we have been dissecting and looking at. </p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking that there will probably not be any BIG name arrests. You&#39;re not going to see Hillary Clinton and the Podesta&#39;s in handcuffs tomorrow, the smaller fish are the ones who are being netted in this operation. This is largely speculative, however, allow me to remind you that many of us here are under the impression that law enforcement and the FBI are compromised, and are likely going to shield these people from prosecution. </p>

<p>Not only that, but considering the nature of these crimes (child trafficking, child rape, murder, cannibalism, satanic worship, ect.), even if they WERE arrested, the media would refuse to expose just how truly evil and deep these crimes go. The main reason this stuff is so violently silenced, slandered, covered up, and brushed off, is because it is so dark and deviant. The system knows that the average person is not going to be able to cope with the reality that their politicians and leaders consist of pedophiles and occultists. <strong>A mass awareness of this particular facet of the New World Order (pedophilia and satanism) would incite immediate dissent from the masses!</strong>.</p>

<p>Seriously, imagine if everyone in this country (USA) knew what WE knew about these people. It would be game over. The subject is so disgusting and terrifying, and world leaders are partaking in it, THATS an immediate redpill, your trust for authority goes right out the window just like that, and you begin to wonder, &quot;what else have I been lied to about?&quot;.</p>

<p>So, just keep in mind, Even when/if these arrests are made, We shouldn&#39;t be satisfied until these people are completely and entirely exposed. It&#39;s not as much about wanting these people to pay for their crimes (which, believe me, I do), but when this is all over, <strong>I want the masses to be aware of what they did. I want the people to know that a group of people who  believed in this dark religion were able to infiltrate positions of power and influence our lives for their own selfish desires.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, who the hell said trump was our &quot;knight in shining armor&quot;?</p>

<p>Most of us here are skeptical of Jeff Sessions and Trumps billionaire cabinet of Goldman Sachs buddies. I don&#39;t, for one second, think he has any interest in pursuing these people criminally because he probably conducts business with tons of these people! He would have NEVER gotten to where he is now, if he was truly an outsider. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, you should calm down.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a very long-time conspiracy watcher, and one of the things you learn early on is that while there is <em>some</em> truth here, there are a lot of untrue things too.  If you start freaking out like that over every claim, you&#39;re going to burn out really really fast.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following Pizzagate since its inception, and you guys have yet to present any evidence that isn&#39;t circumstantial.  That&#39;s a bad sign.  I don&#39;t think what you&#39;re proposing is impossible - but as you present more and more evidence, it becomes more far-fetched.</p>

<p>The underlying idea, that high-ranking Democrats are all pederasts who communicate about child abuse through Twitter - it seems hard to swallow.</p>

<p>Most humans, even otherwise evil humans, find pederasty disgusting beyond anything else.  How, exactly, would they recruit <em>all</em> the senior Democrats?  Surely quite a few of them would freak out and tell the world?</p>

<p>I mean, we know that pederasts gravitate to jobs where they get time alone with children.  So why, exactly, would they enter politics - a field where you are <em>never</em> alone with children?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong.  Perhaps what you are saying is true.  Perhaps.  But when you freak out like that over something which is really just rumors (I mean, you can&#39;t even name one victim of this, hmm?) I can&#39;t help but feel that statistically, you are bound for disappointment.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because more and more of the evidence is just plain wrong. For example, the pedophile &quot;code&quot; where pasta = boy, pizza = girl, walnut = dark skinned etc. This entire code was put together in a 4 chan thread and was 100% speculation, but somebody screenshotted it next to a picture of the FBI release on paedophilia symbols and all of a sudden it&#39;s being treated as if it were long established fact.</p>

<p>Hype seems to be more important than facts to most people &quot;investigating&quot;.</p>

<p>Because of the cut-throat nature of the job, many people who succeed in politics are psychopaths. This part isn&#39;t too far fetched IMO. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been following this closely since day 1. I&#39;m absolutely convinced people are onto something with pizzagate. Unfortunately there is so much hype, misinformation and misinterpreted information out there to sift through that it&#39;s becoming close to impossible to find the truth. </p>

<p>Sure, that&#39;s well-known.  But you&#39;re talking about pederasty - not psychopathy.  Most pederasts aren&#39;t psychopaths;  most psychopaths aren&#39;t pederasts.</p>

<p>If I wanted to diddle children, I&#39;d get a job as a teacher;  a scoutmaster;  a priest;  a gym instructor;  a doctor.  But why would I get a job where every time I was around kids, it was in public?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jerry Sandusky&#39;s son was just arrested on pedophilia charges today.  He&#39;s definitely not a nobody, and his father was tied to the Franklin scandals.  Ever since Trump has taken office there have been over 1,000 arrests from trafficking already, a huge fucking number considering it&#39;s been less than a month.  I really don&#39;t know what people are expecting here.  People like the Clintons, Bushes, etc. will do everything in their power to avoid a public spectacle of guilt, these people have obscene levels of influence and power around the world and won&#39;t just go down without a fight.  There won&#39;t be like an HBO special where we trot everybody out in a perp walk and vote on executions lol... that&#39;s not going to happen, and you&#39;d be stupid to expect it.  If he legitimately wants to be the guy to end this, Trump needs to move incredibly delicately and have iron-clad evidence... we&#39;re talking about possibly 30% or more of the political establishment being involved in some way, and I highly expect any major political arrests to come with the accusations from media that Trump is locking up the opposition because <strong><em>Literally Hitler gaiz!!</em></strong>  It&#39;s probably going to be happen slowly and methodically with occasional big arrests here and there, if it all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for being a rational voice in this mess of a conspiracy. I agree, there is absolute potential that a pedo ring can exist within the U.S gov. If it existed in the U.K or in the Catholic Church, then it is an absolute possibility one can exist here. However, as you said, there is absolutely no solid proof indicating that this exists, only coincidences and interpretations. </p>

<p>The thing that rubs me the wrong way most about this whole thing is the timing that it came out (election) and the alleged parties (Hillary.) It felt very much as if this was just a move to further make Hillary and her crew out to be villains. Why did this sub not freak out with the (imo more concrete) allegation of Trump being involved in a pedo ring? </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not saying this isn&#39;t happening, and I hated how the MSM did not give this more than a glance. However, as someone else said, it&#39;s a really difficult subject to talk about, and the idea of accusing someone of pedophilia and sex trafficking without evidence is pretty fucking awful.   </p>

<p>Most humans, even otherwise evil humans, find pederasty disgusting beyond anything else. How, exactly, would they recruit all the senior Democrats? Surely quite a few of them would freak out and tell the world?</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the movie Filth? Before his chaotic downfall, notice how sociopathic, narcissistic characters like the protagonist actually have the MOST success by far at any career with some kind of an organizational structure. They take advantage of things that others won&#39;t and divide and conquer their competitors to help their own rise. </p>

<p>At some point, these figures are always separated into the &quot;good and bad&quot; just like at secret societies by putting them in a moral situation and judging their reaction. If they refuse, they are only shown the path of good and the dark underside is covered from them completely. If they participate, they agree to secrecy under punishment of death and receive personal benefits as long as they follow the orders of the others above them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s known as Brownstone operations. It&#39;s Democrats AND Republicans, any Neo-liberal or Neo-con is probably caught in this scheme in one way or another. The blackmail ring is VERY intentional so that absolute power can be gained by playing their cards right. </p>

<p>Anyways, the links to Comet Ping Pong by itself are such a large web that it is astonishing. From Mr. Potato Head in Hawaii to Saudi Arabian owners giving Comet Ping Pong their property, from Alefantis&#39; connections to pig farms and his &quot;Pegasus Museum&quot; overlooking a kids park, from Haitian child trafficking through shell/front shipping &amp; transportation companies, there is a massive web of financial evidence and links connecting Alefantis to hundreds of clear connections with child abuse.</p>

<p>The man thinks of himself as Pan, after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I will not be surprised if no one gets arrested. This is the government, after all. Kissinger, Cheney, Bush not only aren&#39;t in prison, they&#39;re commemorated. I&#39;ll look in the mirror if evidence to the contrary emerges, however. Charges brought would be a slam dunk and is needed for many people to actually delve into all this and stop ignoring it or writing it off as that damn fake news. I suppose I could have left out the first sentence in my initial comment. I&#39;ve had no problem telling the jokers who try to mock this stuff what&#39;s what, and they eat their words every time because they aren&#39;t equipped to talk in detail about it. They regurgitate the WaPo headline they saw or just write it off as crazy without even looking into it. Ask them a few questions or what they think about such and such and they&#39;ve got nothing. <strong>No reasonable person can read through the full dossier and conclude that it isn&#39;t ominous and most definitely deserving of investigation.</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is going on and it already is out IMO. The evidence and connections only continue to get deeper and darker. A lot of people seem to be looking for that &quot;smoking gun&quot; slam dunk video piece of evidence. And it&#39;ll probably come, but it&#39;s already a slam dunk for me. I&#39;m not afraid to draw my own inferences after researching and examining things on my own. It&#39;s usually the only option nowadays imo. There is no one source...there&#39;s all kinds of misinfo and fuckery. A lot of people want that one definitive source or headline from their favorite website but I think that logic is flawed in most cases.</p>

<p>This is different and is not going to get swept under the rug. We&#39;re seeing the power of crowdsourced investigative journalism and it keeps snowballing. It&#39;s certainly plausible that no charges are brought, considering it&#39;s an alleged 30% of them implicated in this and we&#39;re talking about the gov and the feds and very powerful entities here...But that has no bearing on whether or not what&#39;s going on here is indeed <em>true</em>. </p>

<p>We haven&#39;t been played. All this stuff that keeps trickling out. I honestly don&#39;t even know where to begin. There&#39;s so much circumstantial evidence and clear red flags/ominous activity. Then you take a look at these fuckers, who they hang with, history of other similar and verified operations (Conspiracy of Silence...shit, the Church has been diddling kids for decades and it&#39;s like a comedy punchline somehow). Put everything together and throw the media reaction and suppression to all this? Sprinkle the George Webb DynCorp research in there and as a topper TAKE A LOOK INTO THESE MONSTER&#39;S EMPTY SOULS AND BODY LANGUAGE. If we&#39;re being played and all this shit is coincidental I&#39;ll tip the hat and proceed to have a brain aneurysm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what happens if the opposite is true.  That pizzagate was just a fiction created by political partisans to distract from and discredit their opponents?  That the guy who owns Comet Ping Pong is just a supporter of the Democrats with a poor taste in art?  That mountains of circumstantial are just that, circumstantial?  If now that the election is over, those same political partisans are uninterested in pursuing the fiction further?  What will you do then?</p>

<p>Honestly, you might be right. While highly unlikely, it is possible that the Clintons are running an international child trafficking ring.  If there is any merit in the theory, it should be investigated.  The election is over so I have no stake in the outcome.  However, what will you do if it turns out to be bullshit?  Is it possible to convince you otherwise or will you keep doubling down on a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no doubt that high profile trafficking takes place in this world. There&#39;s no doubt that it reaches into politics and entertainment. But, I have serious doubts that the Clinton empire knowingly takes parts in that. However, Epstien pleaded the 5th on both Trump and Clinton ties in court. So, it&#39;s interesting to say the least. But, I&#39;ve yet to see PG provide anything more than circumstantial evidence, which is only just somewhat interesting at best. I think a lot of people went after this because of confirmation bias.

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t include the McMartins in that list.  They were later exhorated.  In fact, most of accusations of satanic ritual abuse were found to be baseless.  </p>

<p>Prior to the late 80s, child abuse was rarely reported.  I think the Satanic panic  was a knee jerk reaction to the push to get people to report it.  It is much easier to blame the Devil than to recognize evil in a more mundane form like Saville and Sandusky.  </p>

<p>Does child abuse still happen?  Absolutely!  We don&#39;t have to look much further than Jared to see that.  Some of those who commit child abuse are probably going to be politians.  Open child abuse like the kind was perpetrated by Saville is pretty rare now.  People are much more likely to report it than in the past. Ritualistic child abuse, however, has always been bullshit.  </p>

<p>Also, most international child sex trafficking is under taken by criminal networks.  Even when it was under reported, this was true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What were the recent arrests and how were they related to pizzagate? Just curious because there were a few threads where people posted evidence of pizzagate being real but all it was along the lines of, &quot;BBC had pedophile found out post humoursly! see pedophilia happens at the top Pizzagate is definitely real!&quot;</p>

<p>Like are these arrests actually related to pizzagate or are they routine arrests? because pedophile rings get busted all the time.</p>

<p>. The system knows that the average person is not going to be able to cope with the reality that their politicians and leaders consist of pedophiles and occultists. A mass awareness of this particular facet of the New World Order (pedophilia and satanism) would incite immediate dissent from the masses!.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about this.  We would see normalization of that type of behavior, and mass denial.   </p>
