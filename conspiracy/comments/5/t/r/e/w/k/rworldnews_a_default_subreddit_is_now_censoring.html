       I've been pretty controversial on r/worldnews over the past 5 years. I've bashed israel over the 2014 gaza conflict, called out idf for their propaganda on the subreddit, and more recently defended assad and argued against an american government that clearly wanted to ruin that country long before the "civil war" broke out.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, to my surprise, I never once had a comment deleted in all these years. Until today when I made the comment "WTF i love hezbollah now...". As you can see in my user history the comment is right there at the top, and when you permalink it nothing comes up because it was deleted. This style of commenting was popularized on the trump subreddit and is a well known indicator of a trump supporter to people who obsess  over that stuff. Ironically, I am a Sanders supporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at r/uncensorednews the big story all week has been unwarranted
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=week">
        censorship
       </a>
       in r/worldnews. The accusations largely stem from the systematic removal of any mention of refugees (but only if it paints the refugees negatively; if the refugees are being victimized the story is allowed to stay) including r/worldnews moderator replies indicating that the moderators have chosen to approve only one side of the discussion on the north african/middle eastern refugee crisis in europe and north america.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was at this point--having my comment deleted for the first time--that I decided to look to see if there was any recent activity that may explain why this subreddit had clearly become openly biased in its moderation. Just a quick and random look at some of the moderators added recently shows them modding/commenting in subreddits like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         White_Fragility
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         presidentbannon
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the_donald_circlejerk
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         fuckthealtright
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Alt_Right (a subreddit dedicated towards exposing trump's nazi past)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And most have comments within the first page of their comment history of things like "this is what it's like arguing with a trump supporter" and wild conspiracy theories such as 'kkk supporters planning to prevent blacks from voting in the recent election.'
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that this is a default subreddit, whose majority of moderators are openly biased against trump, and whose moderation proves that they are incapable of leaving out their political biases/ideology when moderating. The reddit admin argument is that people are allowed to create subreddits where they censor opinions they dislike, but my counterargument is that they shouldn't be allowed to be a default subreddit if they do that. It is pretty clear that after many years of being a neutral subreddit--at least when it came to censorship--r/worldnews has been compromised and become another r/politics.

       Nothing to do with pride. I was highlighting the fact of how much karma is in a large community with high visibility. You can nitpick me all you want, or you can go get some karma. This is obviously a two week old alternate account I'm on, where the karma doesn't matter for shit. I'm stating facts.

       This is the problem with plebbit. There are so many shills and circle jerks in respective subreddit echo chambers that it dilutes the value of the website as a whole. Caring about how many upvotes you get is lame and no one besides you cares.

       I understand your point.  From what I understand, you believe that the moderator eliminating posts that do not subscribe to a particular worldview.  You believe that this is censorship.  I honestly do not know if your claims are accurate, so I will just assume that your beliefs are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I don't know if you have much grounds on which to complain.  From what I understand, the subreddits do not have to be democratic.  The moderators have the power to decide what is and is not on topic.  Since the number of subreddits is limitless, denying you a platform on one subreddit does not deny you the ability to say what you would like.  No one is entitled to the platform of their choice nor is anyone required to take your message seriously.

       I am completely non partisan. However, this shows that the New World Order is now officially using the large liberal base and its support as a vehicle, to carry out its agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, these people want open immigration. Am I buying Trump's whole wall thing? Not for a second. The globalists want to destabilize countries by allowing these refugees in. It's also just a great issue that creates tension between the right and the left. They think you are a negligent prick if you don't take in refugees.

       It's a generalization.  They aren't all grouped up in secret meetings.  They just all have similar mindsets.  Every corporate elite knows they stand to make more money by pushing for globalist policies.  So they all push for the same changes.

       See that's the thing though I'm a liberal and I don't think it's our liberal peers doing this...I think it's a propaganda operation either at the state or MNC level. I remember a few years ago MSNBC showed their computer lab on tv and it was just a bunch of interns browsing reddit twitter and facebook. That's where they are: here.

       Something interesting to note, after a quick search of my user history, it seems that r/worldnews has deleted all of my comments questioning validity of the "13,000 hanged by assad" that made headlines there
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5si7zo/syria_conflict_thousands_hanged_at_saydnaya/ddffdu1/">
        last week
       </a>
       . Curious to hear what all of you think about the legitimacy of the story in the context of videos like
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfyZTM5OiUY">
        this
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how all of the comments on the r/worldnews are extremely emotional and basically jump the gun wherein they are incapable of questioning the legitimacy of the information that is being presented to them. All these "holy shit this is awful, I'm crying" comments...well what if what you're crying over isn't even real. I get a similar vibe from this to the iraq warmongering days where we would see those 3d renderings of saddams chemical labs and all the sob stories. Remember how people felt about that without questioning? According to the video I linked amnesty international was behind the 3d renderings for both stories--assad and saddam.

       The problem is we should all move to voat. Until largest part will stay on reddit, moving to voat will not happen

      <p>
       I think we need some new place to talk, new kind of forum. Maybe 8/4chan. There are lower censorship. Also there are no up/downvotes so people reply to what they don't like and more discussion happen. (Not just downvote what they disagree)

       Voat is cancer. That is not the place to jump ship. Actually Voat isn't and Cancer and neither is reddit. I'll tell you what is though, upvotes,  downvotes and likes. That's the problem.

      </p>
      <p>
       the reason alot of these "justice warriors" as you call them are "welcoming refugees in with "open arms" because they feel the guilt of blowing them up with "military arms," not that they're not being used as useful idiots to counter the other useful idiots but at least their position is moral albeit more than a bit underinformed.

       Uh huh. Interesting. So because of all of this, we must let Muslims into our countries? Um, no thanks. Muslims are here because leftists let them come here. Simple as that.

       Worldnews has been an anti Muslim circlejerk for years thanks to the predominantly white, mid 20s, male, American demographic that makes up most of reddit.

       I always remembered it as a struggle where real users occasionally won--at least to the point where you could get both sides of a story if you stuck around long enough. I remember when the israeli brigading would get so bad, and then you'd get a thread where all people would do is talk about how they were surprised the brigade hadn't gotten there yet and laugh how maybe they were sleeping.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now that I know the moderators are intentionally pushing their sjw refugee nonsense it really suggests that there's no hope left. Because it's destined to become like bestof, pics, technology, science, news where the posts are specifically crafted to make a specific homogeneous political statement every time they hit r/all.

       It is hilarious when you see people talk logically and provoke a decent point of view that get downvoted to oblivion. That says it all. The most upvoted comments are filled with vitriolic hate and show the intellect of a 5yr old. Even when generating discussion that is neutral and promotes free thinking, it is often ridiculed and again heavily downvoted. The trick is make a decent comment that is true and honest and wear your downvotes with pride. I believe that we will look back at these days (soon I hope) as a case study in mass brain washing and hysteria all generated by the MSM and the echo chambers on social media. It's actually an interesting phenomenon and in time those heavily downvoted comments that I mentioned will be looked at with dismay.

       Vitriolic, hateful comments, you say? You should take a quick gander at OP's post history - not only is it odious and pretty damn racist, but they also almost exclusively post in alt-right leaning subreddits.

       Their post here is not poorly written, and their point is certainly true to an extent (world news is definitely an echo chamber for the left), but please. Dig a little deeper.

       Nope, improper application of my logic. I merely advocated "digging deeper," especially on a subreddit like r/conspiracy - due to the fact that there are indeed a high concentration of (often newer) posters who have a fairly obvious agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, there are some posters that strictly link known fake news articles to the amount of dozens a week, that get voted into the thousands with some regularity. So yeah, I certainly do advocate doing a quick check of a poster's comment history before accepting their angle. I'm sure you would agree!

       i got banned from there a little 6 months ago for saying "I don't want Europe to become a refugee camp". Got banned from r/europe around 3 months ago for saying basically the same thing. The narrative is blatant. European heritage and culture = bad, muslims and sharia = good.

       I get that people don't like Trump, but the level of hate being festered is so inorganic and forced it's quite sickening. The most frightening part is how their propaganda is so easily influencing the masses. It's got to the point where CTR/MMFA now has the people doing their work for them.

       No, I totally get why people like Trump, despite him being probably a massive nutter. People had enough of PC stuff, lies and calling bad things good and good things bad. There was nobody else but Trump. In desperation people take the next best thing. This should teach extreme lefties a lesson [listen to what the majority of people want, explain to them without lying, don't take the piss out of the people you are there to serve], but like usually they still haven't learned to listen. And that's is how people like Trump, Hitler and others come to power. Desperation.

       I always saw voting in Trump as anti establishment and not actually believing in Trump. Trump should go down with the rest of them he's pretty shit and his views on veterans, handicapped and most people is disgusting. I'm happy he got voted in because now there's a president without celebrities, media and the party 100% on his side like all the previous ones, the fire that people have wanted to hold under politicians feet should be raging under Trump instead of letting him do what he wants just because he won. Any politician should be treated the same but Obama got a pass because of all that stupid Hope crap.

       As much as we all love Reddit, it is not and never will be a bastion of free speech. In fact it’s more the opposite, it’s designed to be an echo chamber where users with similar beliefs can gather and share those beliefs, it’s very easy for those users to then silence or ignore dissenting opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think it would be great to get unbiased info on Reddit, but I don’t think it has ever actually been that way, or ever will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the only way to oppose this is to create your own subreddits in opposition to those you disagree with.

       Have you been to Voat? That's a forum essentially dedicated to the idea of absolute free speech and lack of censorship. It's also a horribly vile cesspool of extreme racism and alt-reich rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, allowing total free speech on the internet, coupled with anonymity, leads to really unpleasant communities. I'm fine with Reddit curating content to a degree. If you want verbal lawlessness, you have Voat.

       I'm thinking that the reason is because Trump is seen as a cancer throughout a majority of the world, and just like the majority of the world doesn't want fascist populism to spread, either does /worldnews.  The US should focus more on white supremacist terrorists these days, since they've been a far bigger problem.  If they weren't an uncomfortably high percentage of Trump's base, that is.

       It's set up as Trump (the government) vs. the MSM, with everyone forced to choose one side. If we think they're both full of shit we're squeezed out of the conversation.

       Glad for that, looking at The_donald after the quebec incident and their stupid "couture law" and how they all created uncensorednews after worldnews nuked away all the racists and seeing uncensorednews become nothing but a hate news site good. The Muslim obsession some people have online is too much, I'm fine with discussing bad people who happen to be Muslim but the witch hunting is unacceptable.

       holy war? Well I hope both sides lose then. Meh go shore up your soldiers are r/uncensorednews or 4chan I don't see the "muslim" part as much as a problem and the constant finger pointing just brings about the worst people. Screw the over zealous religious people of any culture, there's still backwoods people in north america and europe who have child brides and they are christian or catholic. Fuck their anti homosexual, anti abortion, anti contraception stance. Go help out a Jesus camp they're militarizing children if you care so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion this is more of a class war against us then a holy war. They get to bring in these refugees who they hope will keep voting them in, an excuse to throw more big charity events and drinking champagne behind their gated houses while lambasting the rest of us for not wanting to live among uneducated people and using our tax dollars to help them. They probably take a little bit of the refugee money as kickbacks because hey they are doing a good thing. It seems more to me like these pro refugee politicians are so disconnected from the rest of us they think we should be taking care of the rest of the world because its not like our middle and lower class already have problems. Making this a Muslim/brown person thing is just unnecessary and I don't see any angle why our own politicians would want us to be more Muslim. I see if more as letting in more refugees to just benefit their egos and pockets while eroding the lower and middle classes.

      <p>
       I'm don't think Reddit should censor but there is a lot of pro Trump propaganda out there that advances a racist agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a good example of Anti Muslim and anti immigrant propaganda:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5trbad/georgetown_islamic_studies_professor_slavery_ok/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5trbad/georgetown_islamic_studies_professor_slavery_ok/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti Muslim propaganda is very effective at getting the U.S. to engage in perpetual war the last 20 years or so.

       I always remembered it as a struggle where real users occasionally won--at least to the point where you could get both sides of a story if you stuck around long enough. I remember when the israeli brigading would get so bad, and then you'd get a thread where all people would do is talk about how they were surprised the brigade hadn't gotten there yet and laugh how maybe they were sleeping.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now that I know the moderators are intentionally pushing their sjw refugee nonsense it really suggests that there's no hope left. Because it's destined to become like bestof, pics, technology, science, news where the posts are specifically crafted to make a specific homogeneous political statement every time they hit r/all.
