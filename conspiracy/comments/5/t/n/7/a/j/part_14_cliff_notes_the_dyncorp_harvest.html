          Columbia did the first pediatric heart transplant, this is getting close to home (he likely graduated from Columbia, being he was wearing the sweatshirt)
         </li>
         <li>
          1985-6 OKC sets up the only heart transplant center that's not connected to the University Hospital.  So someone can come in and start a program with no seniority or tenue to hold you back.  Dr. Nazih Zuhdi an expert heart surgeon who died 2 days ago was put into that clinic.
         </li>
         <li>
          Speculation: the little daycare center at the bottom of OKC building where 20-40 kids were at the bottom.  Timothy McVeigh parked right underneath that, and I was wondering if that was the holding pen of the OKC building for those hearts.  I wonder if that was the human farming ring

          Don't know why it took me so long to be surprised at the organ harvesting thing.  Of course they would wnat to provide spare parts for the elites--not just elites but power elites--military, politicians as well as the rockefellers

          Don't know why I have a problem with the idea of the Hamiltons--you could sire 5-6 kids and if nothing goes wrong with you and you don't need those organs, those kids could go on and have happy lives and you could send them money like sponsoring a kid in a third world country.

          School up north called Tabar and it's a school for [physically] handicapped kids--I wonder if it's psychological comfort, sending them to Mirabailais for harvest ['euthanasia'--to end their suffering].  The Nazis had this, before the Jewish harvest, and it fed directly into the medical program [Lebensborn].

          According to Pizzagate Researchers, Madeleine Mccann -- an English child abducted in Portugal--has a unique eye defect, Coloboma or Renal Coloboma; also Papillorenal Syndrome.. Mutation of Pax2 gene, Joest-Degen Bodies.  A lot of these kids are turning up with this eye defect. The chances are 3-5 in 100,000.  George believes the mutation is from a virus
         </li>
         <li>
          Ernst Joest for whom Joes-Degen bodies are named, studied at Univeristy of Dresden, University of Leipzig; he  of Malta, and the Pope and got [illegal] passports and [Nazi doctors were smuggled] all over the world  to Argentina.  And they set up these weird colonies where there's a lot of girls and one priest, and one priest impregnates all the girls.  It's a kind of genetic experiment.

          The Nazi drug trials--they tried everything. These drug companies (IGFarben) worked directly with the Rockefeller foundation.  Kaiser Wilhem instutute in Berlin--which was the center for eugenic thinking--was part built by at least half by the Rockefellers and also the Rothschilds
         </li>
         <li>
          They were infecting people with viruses to see new strains of viruses and test the vaccines.  Although these drug trials were horrible, they were a for-profit motive [and a national security motive]

         </li>
         <li>
          I am wondering if the eye defect is a type of Nazi marker that can go on for generations.  You can tell that grandchildren are yours by their defect.

          Eugenics, ghoulish nighmare, dystopian vision of the world, that if they ever came out of the colonies they'd be able to identify all their children.
         </li>
         <li>
          To add to intrigue here, supposedly at the centers, [children were] fathered by Hitler's inner circle.  Kindergardens at Auchewitz, Dachau, Buchenwald and Ravensbrook, they weren't random servants they were girlfriends of Nazi high command, like Karl Brandt--Hitler's physician.  This kind of colony approach to the death camps.
         </li>
         <li>
          There are folks in the pizzagate world saying "what's this all about?" That's where the Hillary connection comes in with John Podesta.  They use the Catholic Church
          <em>
           to 'diaspora'
          </em>
          (spread genetics far and wide) these folks around the world.  So they needed a way of keeping track of them.  And (I think) Podesta was one of those find-it men.
         </li>
         <li>
          I realize this is an extreme topic.  But the reason why these kids are valuable now is that their hearts and kidneys, their organs are a perfect genetic match going back to the father.  This is the idea of Charles Lindberg having the 7 kids and so forth.  I know it's a stretch.  I know it's an outside possibility, but I wanted to give this to Pizzagate folks and have them drill down on what kind of experiments Mengele did with this virus that's called BVD Bornavirus Disease

         </li>
         <li>
          If Wall Street put all that money into those joint ventures for a better and higher use--for petroleum basically--then why would they throw it all away at the end of the war?
         </li>
         <li>
          Then it makes perfect sense why
          <em>
           Operation Paperclip
          </em>
          happened and why the CIA created Dyncorp. Because bioweapons and human testing was morally reprehensible so they needed a 3rd party to do that.  It's the same reason that sex trafficking and organ harvesting are run through DynCorp.
         </li>
         <li>
          If you look at the Rockefeller banks and hospitals you have this repeating pattern, using the Pinkertons to clear the land---and once you get the land, then you do the human trafficking, the drug trafficking, now the opiods.  It's a repeating pattern over and over.
         </li>
         <li>
          Then placing secret armies with weapons caches in all these different countries--the Gladio program--is this other repeating pattern.  Sibel Edmonds talks about this [Gladio II].

         <li>

          Program.  Reminds me of how they compromised the Catholic priests in order to stow children at the orphanages at the Catholic Church
         </li>
         <li>
          Again I ask the question: if the CIA is reallY DynCorp and DynCorp is really the old Wall St.-Pinkertons-Rockefeller program, would they do 191 countries around the world and then just forget about the United States, and just say well we'll that one alone?  Doesn't seem like that would be the case.

That's espionage act.  That's death sentence.

          Again, our enemies have more information than what's going on in our government than we do as citizens.  This is further exemplified by the 650k emails

          We know these went to Israel Russia and China; but if the three brothers talk at all--all in the same house I assume they would, that means the intelligence is going to the Muslim Brotherhood.  This is recent as in a couple of days ago.
         </li>
         <li>
          The Muslim Brotherhood of those 32 countries now has that intelligence, so we need to know now more than ever those 650k emails.  Families could be travelling, on business trips in these other countries and need to make informed decisions.
         </li>

          Not releasing this information is several felony violations of Federal Records Act "CTC, D&amp;D"

          According to McCabe, it's going to take the FBI 5 yrs to process the 650k emails, but it's ok to let three treasonous Muslims take all the date from the 3 top Intelligence Agencies to the Muslim Brotherhood in 32 countries

          Trafficking networks are being exposed in a limited way, because if you don't expose in a limited way it goes all the way to the top, to Pug Winokur and that would totally stop it.
         </li>
         <li>
          They get these guys in a room and they say, "It's going to be 30 yrs if you squawk about the trafficking ring and how many people are involved, or it's going to be a year and a half of weekend jail if you don't.  And if you keep persisting then you end up being thrown off a bridge or you die in a helicopter crash."  These guys play rough, it's Dyncorp for a reason.
         </li>
         <li>
          The viruses they can always say, "well you can't really prove that", but trafficking and harvesting have very provable rings and all you need are 1-2 witnesses
         </li>
         <li>
          For instance the coverup of the operation underground railroad that Beck took care of in Haiti.  It's basically a red team from kissingers old red team days.  Very thinly veiled with this social justice cover.  It's a setup for DHS to do stings on unsuspecting guys trying to get them to go for younger and  younger girls over time. It's an asset forfeiture ring.
         </li>
         <li>
          Beck said 33 saved and 12 arrested at Kaliko beach club--he didnt mention anythign about a woman being shot in the head in front of other women?  Was that because the woman was shot as a message to other women not to talk about the johns going over to Mirabalais for harvesting / processing?
         </li>
         <li>
          Once the women get the men on film, that's all they need with the Nepalese police force at Mirabalais in order to say, "ok, you can harvest him" -- to the catfood factory he goes
         </li>
         <li>
          Some people are saying, "Man you're accusing the Clintons of some really weird stuff!"
         </li>
         <li>
          This is Dr. Guy Theodore, Hospital Bienfaisance (charity in french) in Pignon Haiti -- he got set up there by the Clintons.  Here he is at little Rock air force base at 1983.  Why do I say Clintons may be involved in organ harvesting, they were very involved in blood mining.  If you know this investigative reporter Kelly Duda, he wrote a documentary called Factor 8--he's from ARkansas.  This is what caused the HIV/Red Cross blood crisis of the mid-1980s, using all these patients' blood from the Arkansas prison system, HepC and HIV
         </li>
         <li>
          When Hillary is first lady in 1998 she goes down to Haiti with George Soros after one of the storms (Haiti Bienfaisance)--she was shadow secretary of state--she also goes to various other central and s. american countries on that same trip.  This is a swing through of all of the franchises.  The best I can compare this to is a baseball league.  Epstein is going to be major leagues, the AAA clubs the AA clubs and it's going to be all these things.
         </li>
         <li>
          Haiti Bienfaisance is an orphanage and a hospital where you're going to have a weeding system in place (filtering); you'll see this in all orphanage/hospital combos. Maybe it started out mining the bone marrow from the dead bodies, but the problem with harvesting is that [the profit motive causes] you to make earlier calls on end-of-life.  I started out having angels of death showing up in your order release because it is a valuable product.  People start dying around when people need transplants.  It's a slippery slope.  As bodies become more valuable, then this activity provides a bad incentive for health.
         </li>
         <li>
          Dr. Robert Ashton just jumped off the George Washington Bridge.  He was married to this Jennifer Ashton, the medical correspondent on ABC News.  He was involved in the Bronx transplant (organ transportation) center.  The Bronx is where they are getting the hearts--he's a cardiac surgeon.  If you want to target someone like this, you first break up their marriage. He goes to a conference, you send in the girl, you take the pictures, you get the pictures to the wife, she wants a divorce, now your life is ruined, and now he jumps off the GW bridge.
         </li>
         <li>
          The other way to get rid of a doctor: get a witness against him.   Take this case of the helicopter crash 5 yrs ago.  This is the Mayo clininc in jacksonville Fla.  What they do is take these three guys, profusion specialist, cardiac surgeon, ex old navy seal guy and say 'there's a heart down in Gainsville.  Just reading 3rd party news stories I see that this lands in the woods that the helicopter would have gone if it had gone straight, but instead it lands in the woods, way off track.  When these networks come to light, these are different ways you can suppress the witness, kill the witness.  {{I think George is saying that Ashton had those 3 guys killed because one was a witness with blackmail leverage against him for illegal heart dealings.  Not entirely sure}}

          If we are going to give access to three muslim brothers the Awan brothers in the muslim brothers, three 22 yr old living in the same house in DC, give them access to all this information AND MORE, then why wouldn't the American people have a right to that information?  Release the 650,000 emails!

          The Awan brother I spoke about this morning -- they may have been the ones that tipped off ISIS in Yemen and that may have caused the death of the Navy Seal, so it's very good that at least we found this leak early rather than having to wait.

          I wanted to talk more about what I call the "Dyncorp Sheriff" -- this new phenom from these wars in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, Afg., Haiti, there are these Dyncorp sheriffs being created from these mercenaries that were overseas training these police forces, and it's taking a militaristic turn.
         </li>
         <li>
          Kathryn Bolkovac was a police officer in Dyncorp in Kosovo ("the Whistleblower") made many accusations about the prostitution and sex trafficking by Dyncorp staff
         </li>
         <li>
          Flint Chambers Orders 15 Yr Old Lap Dances at DynCorp -- Hillary Clinton seemed to be very interested in that particular email
         </li>
         <li>
          Several articles have been written about Dyncorp getting in trouble around the world in this area
         </li>
         <li>
          Article title: "Prisoner says warren county jailers raped her, nurses refused to give her epilepsy medication" -- she claims she was raped by 2 deputies at the insistence of a 3rd deputy on the floor on top of a garbage bag.  Again, it would seem the deputies were forced into raping the girl.

          Film: Trafficked / Lots of movies being made about this 'pattern'
         </li>
         <li>
          Bob Mosier -- Faquier county (double-entendre of 'f*ck here', though George puts it more nicely) -- a rural county just west of DC.  A lot of folks take their kids to Fuquier county to go to the roller rink or the farm day sort of thing.  Lots of weird messages in far of those social media, lots of things to 'touch', boy scouts day.  Check out the roller rink that's closing--those attractions tend to close when these investigations start.
         </li>
         <li>
          I noticed on his resume that he's still working for DOD, worked for Dept of State, International Justice Mission where they save children, and then finally was a law enforcement technical advisor for DynCorp from 2001-2007, then there's an interesting insertion in this gap -- from 1996-1997 was in Bosnia -- the gap was 1997-2001 I wonder what he was doing in these 4 yrs.  He was the culpepper county sheriff but lists it from 1998-2015. So was he sheriff while he was overseas, which is interesting because Culpepper county is in Virginia, not Libya; maybe it's a lend-lease program where they come and go
         </li>
         <li>
          George discusses post yugoslavian countries,
         </li>
         <li>
          And then notes that "the Whistleblower" was about where this sheriff was stationed--George asks the question: does DynCorp Sheriff Bob Mosier know Kathryn Bolkovac? {the plot thickents}
         </li>
         <li>
          In the news the [Oroville] dam burst yesterday in the county just south of Sheriff Lopey's Siskiyou County, so I'm sure he's helping with Oroville, which I thank him very much for.  But he also did these Weed wars.  He's an ex-Dyncorp employee, but he does have this habit of doing these very militaristic raids.   I just wondered if Sheriff Lopey knows Bob Mosier.  That's my question for the day.
         </li>
         <li>
          To follow up on another story, Glenn Beck went down to Haiti with a 3rd party NGO called Operation Underground Railroad to investigate human trafficking--turns out it's a bunch of Navy Seals led by Tim Ballard and they had a bust where they busted people at Kaliko Beach Club.
         </li>

         <li>
          Timothy Alefantis has a virus/vaccine company called Vitalprobe that we'll get to
         </li>
         <li>
          There was a drug arrest made between Colombia and Haiti so that's obviously a drug route
         </li>
         <li>
          Big news is Joe Clancy has stepped down from the Secret Service
         </li>
         <li>
          In previous episodes Clancy and McCabe had this agreement where the Secret Service were used in nighttime intrusion teams called "prowler teams".  And now we've got 2-3 prowler teams that are talking and feeding information to Trump, the sneakernet thing with the screens and blind interviews.  It will be interesting to see how Sessions deals with this.
         </li>
         <li>
          If you're going to spy on someone like General Flynn then dont' use your own resources, use the Secret Service as an espionage shield {McCabe sneakiness}, they also have extensive cyber hacking capabilities.  They also have a means to inhibit tracking of secret service personnel who are moonlighting on these teams.  Trump is going to clean that up I'm sure, depending on who he names as the new SS guy.
         </li>
         <li>
          Letter that Chaffetz sent on Jan 27 to the FBI that says, "I want the 650k emails by Feb 10th" -- that has come and gone and wasn't answered.  That's another thwarting of the executive there.  At least they could have produced the metadata.  If there is a response, it would be nice to get Chaffetz to just respond by saying "metadata"--that could not possibly be state secrets
         </li>
         <li>
          Trump is against the wall now.  They just took out Flynn.  McCabe's illegal surveillance took out Flynn, so it's now or never.
         </li>
         <li>
          Decameron Hotels in Haiti which I said was the funnel where Hillary's putting USAID money and the money from sex, drug, trafficking ops are going into these hotels.  I specifically mentioned SEMEX.
         </li>
         <li>
          Turns out Decameron started out in Bogota as a money funnel for the drug business in Colombia through 44 hotels 12k employees.
         </li>
         <li>
          The Decameron hotel group ceo died oddly enough during a heart transplant operation (2015)
