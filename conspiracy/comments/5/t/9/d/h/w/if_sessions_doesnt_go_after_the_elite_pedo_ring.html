       I'm very interested in the donnies take on this.  It's show time for Sessions and the donnies have labeled him and Trump the pedo ring slayers.  So I'm wondering what mental gymnastics the donnies will have to perform if Sessions and Trump doesn't go after PG.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either PG is fake
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions and Trump are part of the conspiracy to cover it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any insight is appreciated so we can get ahead of the next conspiracy before it starts.

       I too shall assume the position of sneering at those that believe in something after researching it. It's the best of both worlds. I reap the benefits if everyone's correct while getting the satisfaction of being a smug asshole in the meantime. PG8'ers are suckers.

       Lol. It's weird because the PG investigators want it to be true which is kinda sad. I think it's likely there is an elite DC pedo ring but I sure as Fuxk hope I'm wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The PG investigators have gotten to the point of no return. They need this to be true because they want to say told you so while justifying their behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a weird dynamic. When it comes to pedo shit or racist shit I think everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt and shouldn't be accused of such until there is legit hard evidence.

       It will take some time.  Once the cabinet heads can clean house of all the Obama hold overs working under them, then they can get down to business.  On the Obama hold overs, they have already had instances of them subverting the POTUS admin. or leaking info to the press.  Getting them out and setting up with his people has to be the first priority or nothing can be accomplished.

       I assume you are kidding.  He has been in office for less than a month.  He probably hasn't even taken a shit in every WH toilet yet.  Exactly how long do you think it takes to bring down an international not just nationwide pedo ring?  Obama's admin. has zero groundwork to turn over.  Shit takes time.  If you rush in unprepared people start getting acquitted.

       You're so wonderfully biased from start to finish. It hasn't even been a month. You think taking down a supposed international human trafficking ring can be done in a few days? If people say give it more time then it's immediately just an excuse? Man you must be one miserable individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Trump supporter, I'll be pissed if nothing happens. I won't assume Trump and Sessions are involved. I won't automatically blame Obama either. I'll be suspicious as hell. If the Clinton Foundation and Hillary aren't thoroughly investigated I'll be suspicious as hell and pissed. No preconceived thoughts or blame.

       Let me ask you a few questions in response;
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Do you believe there are politicians in Washington DC who like child pornography, or practice pedophilia? - please see
       <a href="https://youtu.be/o6W8H5Z0XAc">
        this video before answering
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Do you believe pedophilia is a crime?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Do you believe any pedophiles in Washington DC currently accepting taxpayer money as payment for services should be held accountable equally under the law as other citizens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please answer those questions for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       In return, my answer to you is that if Sessions does not direct authorities to pursue and prosecute child molesters, or assist State level authorities to do the same,  it will be a signal that the Trump cabinet as a whole is completely compromised and worth double the examination the DNC is currently receiving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is a real thing. It is not about a pizza parlor anymore or about a single individual, but instead has become shorthand for the trade and abuse of children for sexual gratification withing the ruling class.

       This. I hope people pick up on this. I think the important thing at this point is to be able to differentiate that this is not about Comet Ping Pong or any single pizza parlour anymore. The whole thing started there, but we have since moved on from that.

       I'm glad people are starting to come of JA and CPP because it made the investigations and behavior of online witch hunters look redic.  I do believe there is a elite pedo ring in DC.  I just want to know what the donnies will think and or say if trump and sessions doesn't persue.

       Then you should stop calling it pizzagate then, unless your goal is to continue to undermine John DeCamp's work.

       What should we call it? I agree that it needs a revamped name, but not sure how we are going to be able to do that. Requires everyone to get onboard. Hard, but not impossible, by this point in time.

       I think you may be reading something in his comment that's not there.
"if Sessions does not....it will be a signal that the Trump cabinet as a whole is completely compromised" 
 Trump picked the cabinet so this is clearly an indictment of Him and his team.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, how do you come up with "...must be the other teams fault..."?
      </p>
      <p>
       I like Trump, but it could all be a show. Until we find out it is a show, I support him.
I think human trafficking and blackmailing crooked politicians is a much bigger problem than the vast majority of people know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll probably keep faith through the end of the year. After that the Trump admin is just part of the system.

       I was apprehensive about replying to your post because your question seemed phrased to push an agenda. Your reply of
       <em>
        "What you say next is what I assumed the answer would be."
       </em>
       pretty much confirmed that, and the preconceived opinions your brought to the thread. So I'm not going to bother debating the issue with you as u/Tybalt734 pretty much hit the nail on the head with your misinterpretation of my comment.

       If nothing came from this and it was actually a true cover-up, I would wonder if the current administration would use this as a Trump card (pun intended)  to try to control the Establishment.

       Now that is a solid theory. One I can understand and is in line with a conspiracy sub..  That being said i have to ask, is it worth controlling the establishment if it means allowing a pedo ring to survive and or go unpunished ?

       In principle, I'm not endorsing ignoring something so horrible as a massive pedo-ring.  But think of it this way, what if the current administration uses its Intel to round up the smaller players and saves a significant number of trafficking victims.   Removing the smaller players tightens the noose on the involved elites.  Now you have 2 choices with a whole spectrum of possible outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2 choice are either to tighten the noose to TRY to take out the involved elites or you use the noose as a leash.  Although most of us want the Adminstration to tighten the noose on anyone that would be involved, even if the Administration was 100% certain that they could successfully convict what may be some of the most influential players in our political and intelligence systems, you have no idea what the consequences will be.  What will these elites reveal to save their neck?  Will the powers that be release the hounds to obstruct or discredit the administration further?  Can they be certain everyone within the Adminstration is clean?  If you can't make anything stick (or even worse members of the judicial branch are involved with the  pedo-activity and protect their own) and "they" are able to slip out of the noose.  Or worse case scenario, the US public discovers that there is a massive cult of power that has abused countless children and the country has a 2nd violent revolution, that the government has a pieces in place to handle.
      </p>
      <p>
       So pretty much you face a scenerio with endless nightmares as real possibilities or you use the leash to hopefully maintain enough leverage to do the best that you can without ending up like a Kennedy.

       It's still early in the life of this post but so far the answer to my question is it's Obamas Fault. His people will have held up the investigation....

       So basically this is a 100% free roll for the donnies. Regardless what transpires Trump will be a god or ot will be because Obama.

       I think PG is real, at least to the extent that Comet Ping Pong is up to evil doings and the Podesta Bros. are at least peripherally involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also hold the possibility it's all a huge psy-op to blow up in our faces and help make the indisputable global pedophile ring look likewise false.
      </p>
      <p>
       The international network of satanic pedophiles is undoubted in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions doesn't have to go after PG specifically. But if I don't see some notable names get taken down--guys on Hastert's level, on Polanski and Woody Allen's level, not saying those specific guys--then I'm going to think we got totally played, yeah.

       If Trump and Sessions do nothing (and I'm giving them more time than a couple weeks), there is no way in hell that means PizzaGate isn't real. I was a Trump supporter during the election, and even then (along with other supporters who jumped down the PG rabbit hole) I knew to keep my eye on him as well. I knew, and still know, that if nothing happens then he, Sessions, the whole lot of them are implicated. I personally feels that it's going the direction where all of these elite pedophile rings will come to a stop...but if they don't I would be the first to admit I was wrong and would continue to seek justice.
