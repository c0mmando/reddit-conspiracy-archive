It&#39;s show time for Sessions and the donnies have labeled him and Trump the pedo ring slayers.  So I&#39;m wondering what mental gymnastics the donnies will have to perform if Sessions and Trump doesn&#39;t go after PG.</p>

<p>Either PG is fake</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>Sessions and Trump are part of the conspiracy to cover it up. </p>

<p>Any insight is appreciated so we can get ahead of the next conspiracy before it starts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. It&#39;s weird because the PG investigators want it to be true which is kinda sad. I think it&#39;s likely there is an elite DC pedo ring but I sure as Fuxk hope I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>The PG investigators have gotten to the point of no return. They need this to be true because they want to say told you so while justifying their behavior.</p>

<p>Just a weird dynamic. When it comes to pedo shit or racist shit I think everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt and shouldn&#39;t be accused of such until there is legit hard evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re so wonderfully biased from start to finish. It hasn&#39;t even been a month. You think taking down a supposed international human trafficking ring can be done in a few days? If people say give it more time then it&#39;s immediately just an excuse? Man you must be one miserable individual. </p>

<p>As a Trump supporter, I&#39;ll be pissed if nothing happens. I won&#39;t assume Trump and Sessions are involved. I won&#39;t automatically blame Obama either. I&#39;ll be suspicious as hell. If the Clinton Foundation and Hillary aren&#39;t thoroughly investigated I&#39;ll be suspicious as hell and pissed. No preconceived thoughts or blame. </p>

<p>Why even post if you&#39;re not willing to accept anyone&#39;s answer and only want to fuel your own confirmation bias? Oh wait... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me ask you a few questions in response;</p>

<p>1) Do you believe there are politicians in Washington DC who like child pornography, or practice pedophilia? - please see <a href="https://youtu.be/o6W8H5Z0XAc">this video before answering</a>  </p>

<p>2) Do you believe pedophilia is a crime?  </p>

<p>3) Do you believe any pedophiles in Washington DC currently accepting taxpayer money as payment for services should be held accountable equally under the law as other citizens?  </p>

<p>Please answer those questions for me.  </p>

<p>In return, my answer to you is that if Sessions does not direct authorities to pursue and prosecute child molesters, or assist State level authorities to do the same,  it will be a signal that the Trump cabinet as a whole is completely compromised and worth double the examination the DNC is currently receiving.  </p>

<p>Pizzagate is a real thing. It is not about a pizza parlor anymore or about a single individual, but instead has become shorthand for the trade and abuse of children for sexual gratification withing the ruling class. </p>

I do believe there is a elite pedo ring in DC.  I just want to know what the donnies will think and or say if trump and sessions doesn&#39;t persue.</p>

&quot;if Sessions does not....it will be a signal that the Trump cabinet as a whole is completely compromised&quot; 
 Trump picked the cabinet so this is clearly an indictment of Him and his team.</p>

<p>That said, how do you come up with &quot;...must be the other teams fault...&quot;?</p>

<p>I like Trump, but it could all be a show. Until we find out it is a show, I support him.
I think human trafficking and blackmailing crooked politicians is a much bigger problem than the vast majority of people know.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably keep faith through the end of the year. After that the Trump admin is just part of the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was apprehensive about replying to your post because your question seemed phrased to push an agenda. Your reply of <em>&quot;What you say next is what I assumed the answer would be.&quot;</em> pretty much confirmed that, and the preconceived opinions your brought to the thread.

    <div class="md"><p>In principle, I&#39;m not endorsing ignoring something so horrible as a massive pedo-ring.  But think of it this way, what if the current administration uses its Intel to round up the smaller players and saves a significant number of trafficking victims.   Removing the smaller players tightens the noose on the involved elites.  Now you have 2 choices with a whole spectrum of possible outcomes.</p>

<p>The 2 choice are either to tighten the noose to TRY to take out the involved elites or you use the noose as a leash.  Although most of us want the Adminstration to tighten the noose on anyone that would be involved, even if the Administration was 100% certain that they could successfully convict what may be some of the most influential players in our political and intelligence systems, you have no idea what the consequences will be.  What will these elites reveal to save their neck?  Will the powers that be release the hounds to obstruct or discredit the administration further?  Can they be certain everyone within the Adminstration is clean?  If you can&#39;t make anything stick (or even worse members of the judicial branch are involved with the  pedo-activity and protect their own) and &quot;they&quot; are able to slip out of the noose.  Or worse case scenario, the US public discovers that there is a massive cult of power that has abused countless children and the country has a 2nd violent revolution, that the government has a pieces in place to handle.  </p>

<p>So pretty much you face a scenerio with endless nightmares as real possibilities or you use the leash to hopefully maintain enough leverage to do the best that you can without ending up like a Kennedy. </p>

<p>The international network of satanic pedophiles is undoubted in my mind. </p>

<p>Sessions doesn&#39;t have to go after PG specifically. But if I don&#39;t see some notable names get taken down--guys on Hastert&#39;s level, on Polanski and Woody Allen&#39;s level, not saying those specific guys--then I&#39;m going to think we got totally played, yeah.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Trump and Sessions do nothing (and I&#39;m giving them more time than a couple weeks), there is no way in hell that means PizzaGate isn&#39;t real. I was a Trump supporter during the election, and even then (along with other supporters who jumped down the PG rabbit hole) I knew to keep my eye on him as well. I knew, and still know, that if nothing happens then he, Sessions, the whole lot of them are implicated. I personally feels that it&#39;s going the direction where all of these elite pedophile rings will come to a stop...but if they don&#39;t I would be the first to admit I was wrong and would continue to seek justice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In principle, I&#39;m not endorsing ignoring something so horrible as a massive pedo-ring.  But think of it this way, what if the current administration uses its Intel to round up the smaller players and saves a significant number of trafficking victims.   Removing the smaller players tightens the noose on the involved elites.  Now you have 2 choices with a whole spectrum of possible outcomes.</p>

<p>The 2 choice are either to tighten the noose to TRY to take out the involved elites or you use the noose as a leash.  Although most of us want the Adminstration to tighten the noose on anyone that would be involved, even if the Administration was 100% certain that they could successfully convict what may be some of the most influential players in our political and intelligence systems, you have no idea what the consequences will be.  What will these elites reveal to save their neck?  Will the powers that be release the hounds to obstruct or discredit the administration further?  Can they be certain everyone within the Adminstration is clean?  If you can&#39;t make anything stick (or even worse members of the judicial branch are involved with the  pedo-activity and protect their own) and &quot;they&quot; are able to slip out of the noose.  Or worse case scenario, the US public discovers that there is a massive cult of power that has abused countless children and the country has a 2nd violent revolution, that the government has a pieces in place to handle.  </p>

<p>So pretty much you face a scenerio with endless nightmares as real possibilities or you use the leash to hopefully maintain enough leverage to do the best that you can without ending up like a Kennedy. </p>
