<p>Issue is that this is part of Reptilian theory and basically perfectly confirms this, particularly how it is related to genetic defects with reptilian-shaped eyes (coloboma). Plus the ritual sacrificing + eating part. Plus the satanism, bloodlines, and adrenochrome. It&#39;s got a lot of baggage that points to reptilians unfortunately.. Read up on Sirians, Marduk, Anu, Enki/Enlil and Pindar and there really is a very historically consistent Reptilian theory that would match with this. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You people do realize that Satanism has nothing to do with Satan and is an atheistic religion? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no, Satanism is geared towards service to self which is a negative polarity position. It doesn&#39;t tell you to do anything terrible, but it tempts with great power that comes at a terrible cost and hence many people make decisions perhaps they may regret later. </p>

<p>But yes, I am very aware of things like the Lucifer-Sophia connections etc. that have been alleged. However anything &quot;occult&quot; can be read 666 different ways back to Sunday school, hence it is pretty hard to separate worshipers intent with the occult authors actual meaning. </p>

<p>Aleister Crowley did put the power back in man&#39;s hands instead of &quot;God&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a good guy. He has a very mixed history. He did communicate with Lam who he was quite convinced was the &quot;Lucifer consciousness&quot;. That is hard to debate that there is no attachment to Satan. Lucifer led the rebellion (EA? Anu?) but Satan was the master (Marduk/Pindar?). </p>

<p>But that&#39;s just one literal interpretation. Some just say that Satan is a psychological archetype entity that exists in all of us and pushes us towards negative thoughts. Some say he&#39;s a real dude. Some say it&#39;s interdimensional. Some say it&#39;s a alien that left. Some say it&#39;s an alien that stayed. Some say he&#39;s in hollow earth. I definitely know he&#39;s in the Halls of Amenti, but who knows what that actually corresponds to. </p>

<p>But yeah, some people really do worship Satan very earnestly and are directly addicted to &quot;Service to self&quot; and &quot;Power for me at all costs&quot; which usually leads to them being a narcissistic pawn who makes stupid fucking selfish decisions because they think they&#39;re a god, ending up with them getting played by an Archon. </p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m rambling but I hope you get my point about how Satanism is an umbrella and has both casual worshippers and VERY evil worshippers. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Listen, nothing is that cut-and-dry here. Whether the entities Lucifer and Satan even <em>exist at all</em> is questionable, since each mystery school tells it a different way.</p>

<p>But I am aware of the Lucifer-Sophia connection due to how Sophia rebelled and wanted to create life for herself to challenge the creator, or at least mimick him, within the Gnostic sphere. Lucifer is also connected to Prometheus obviously, which is a benevolent figure in some ways. </p>

<p>But others say that Lucifer was given a challenge to corrupt humanity, and is not our saviour. He thinks so little of us that he seeks to prove that we are easily manipulated and tend towards Service-to-Self, hence he gave us a great gift but only because he thought he could profit off of it.</p>

<p>Then you read other stories connecting Lucifer to Enki, Satan to Marduk/Anu, and those make sense too. No connection to Sophia at all. Then you read some who say Satan isn&#39;t a real entity, and only a &quot;negative ideal&quot; that people sacrifice themselves and others towards in the pursuit of power. </p>

<p>Then you read that Crowley says Lam = Lucifer, and that Lam = Greys, which is really hard to explain (considering Greys are basically disposable meat-bots). </p>

<p>I guess the only thing I&#39;m sure of is that Lucifer is a group-consciousness, while Satan is a singular entity of some kind. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You people do realize that Satanism has nothing to do with Satan and is an atheistic religion? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no, Satanism is geared towards service to self which is a negative polarity position. It doesn&#39;t tell you to do anything terrible, but it tempts with great power that comes at a terrible cost and hence many people make decisions perhaps they may regret later. </p>

<p>But yes, I am very aware of things like the Lucifer-Sophia connections etc. that have been alleged. However anything &quot;occult&quot; can be read 666 different ways back to Sunday school, hence it is pretty hard to separate worshipers intent with the occult authors actual meaning. </p>

<p>Aleister Crowley did put the power back in man&#39;s hands instead of &quot;God&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a good guy. He has a very mixed history. He did communicate with Lam who he was quite convinced was the &quot;Lucifer consciousness&quot;. That is hard to debate that there is no attachment to Satan. Lucifer led the rebellion (EA? Anu?) but Satan was the master (Marduk/Pindar?). </p>

<p>But that&#39;s just one literal interpretation. Some just say that Satan is a psychological archetype entity that exists in all of us and pushes us towards negative thoughts. Some say he&#39;s a real dude. Some say it&#39;s interdimensional. Some say it&#39;s a alien that left. Some say it&#39;s an alien that stayed. Some say he&#39;s in hollow earth. I definitely know he&#39;s in the Halls of Amenti, but who knows what that actually corresponds to. </p>

<p>But yeah, some people really do worship Satan very earnestly and are directly addicted to &quot;Service to self&quot; and &quot;Power for me at all costs&quot; which usually leads to them being a narcissistic pawn who makes stupid fucking selfish decisions because they think they&#39;re a god, ending up with them getting played by an Archon. </p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m rambling but I hope you get my point about how Satanism is an umbrella and has both casual worshippers and VERY evil worshippers. </p>
