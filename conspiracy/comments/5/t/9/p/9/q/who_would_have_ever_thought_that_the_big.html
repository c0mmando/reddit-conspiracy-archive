       Issue is that this is part of Reptilian theory and basically perfectly confirms this, particularly how it is related to genetic defects with reptilian-shaped eyes (coloboma). Plus the ritual sacrificing + eating part. Plus the satanism, bloodlines, and adrenochrome. It's got a lot of baggage that points to reptilians unfortunately.. Read up on Sirians, Marduk, Anu, Enki/Enlil and Pindar and there really is a very historically consistent Reptilian theory that would match with this.

       Totally debatable what the difference is as it is all thoroughly in the realm of connecting the dots/speculation/guessing, no way anyone is getting hard verifiable proof of what exactly it means to be a member of an ancient bloodline.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'd put it at "foreign consciousnesses" in human bodies rather than shape shifting, with ancient families that were specifically designed to be the best for hosting/receiving an external consciousness.

       I get it but my point is that human greed and depravity is already well known and doesn't really need a supernatural causation. Historical inhumanity  after all. My mind is still open to any possibility though.

       You people do realize that Satanism has nothing to do with Satan and is an atheistic religion? As an occultist who is into conspiracy, it sickens me to see the amount of ignorance about "the occult" that people are constantly pointing fingers at.

      <p>
       Yes and no, Satanism is geared towards service to self which is a negative polarity position. It doesn't tell you to do anything terrible, but it tempts with great power that comes at a terrible cost and hence many people make decisions perhaps they may regret later.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, I am very aware of things like the Lucifer-Sophia connections etc. that have been alleged. However anything "occult" can be read 666 different ways back to Sunday school, hence it is pretty hard to separate worshipers intent with the occult authors actual meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aleister Crowley did put the power back in man's hands instead of "God", but that doesn't mean he's a good guy. He has a very mixed history. He did communicate with Lam who he was quite convinced was the "Lucifer consciousness". That is hard to debate that there is no attachment to Satan. Lucifer led the rebellion (EA? Anu?) but Satan was the master (Marduk/Pindar?).
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's just one literal interpretation. Some just say that Satan is a psychological archetype entity that exists in all of us and pushes us towards negative thoughts. Some say he's a real dude. Some say it's interdimensional. Some say it's a alien that left. Some say it's an alien that stayed. Some say he's in hollow earth. I definitely know he's in the Halls of Amenti, but who knows what that actually corresponds to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, some people really do worship Satan very earnestly and are directly addicted to "Service to self" and "Power for me at all costs" which usually leads to them being a narcissistic pawn who makes stupid fucking selfish decisions because they think they're a god, ending up with them getting played by an Archon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I'm rambling but I hope you get my point about how Satanism is an umbrella and has both casual worshippers and VERY evil worshippers.

       If you still think Lucifer is the same entity as Satan then you still have a lot of reading to do. I was able to discern even at about age 10 that lumping them together was a preposterous interpretation that makes absolutely no sense.

      <p>
       Listen, nothing is that cut-and-dry here. Whether the entities Lucifer and Satan even
       <em>
        exist at all
       </em>
       is questionable, since each mystery school tells it a different way.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I am aware of the Lucifer-Sophia connection due to how Sophia rebelled and wanted to create life for herself to challenge the creator, or at least mimick him, within the Gnostic sphere. Lucifer is also connected to Prometheus obviously, which is a benevolent figure in some ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       But others say that Lucifer was given a challenge to corrupt humanity, and is not our saviour. He thinks so little of us that he seeks to prove that we are easily manipulated and tend towards Service-to-Self, hence he gave us a great gift but only because he thought he could profit off of it.
      </p>

       Then you read other stories connecting Lucifer to Enki, Satan to Marduk/Anu, and those make sense too. No connection to Sophia at all. Then you read some who say Satan isn't a real entity, and only a "negative ideal" that people sacrifice themselves and others towards in the pursuit of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you read that Crowley says Lam = Lucifer, and that Lam = Greys, which is really hard to explain (considering Greys are basically disposable meat-bots).
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the only thing I'm sure of is that Lucifer is a group-consciousness, while Satan is a singular entity of some kind.

       You are probably in the minority.  Thats not bad, mind you.  But the majority of the people just want things to stay the same: comfortable and easy.  They are perfectly willing to believe lies if it means they get to stay plugged into the matrix.  Very few want to leave the matrix because it means pain, struggle and hardship.

       Man. Please read into consciousness and meditation. Depression is a long formed habit that hijacks your neural responses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meditation gives you back control and shows you what love feels like for yourself again.  It takes time, but it's worth the battle, unlike depression.

       You're absolutely right.
People don't care about anything unless it effects them, as much as they would like to believe that they are outraged enough to spur action.

       But truly , how many people here who would disagree with you, would be willing to right now partake in the "go"? And raising awareness doesn't count, as deep down you know from experience that it don't matter how many people know, it just matters who did it. It has always been this way.

       Pretty much everybody who's ever looked into it?  Oh and you're not taking it down, that's not how this game works.  You're being led by controlled opposition to think you're doing something, when in all reality they're just shifting the chairs around.  Sure some low level scum is being taken off the street, but you won't reach the Rothschild's or the house of Saudi.  Concessions must be made to keep the sheep in line.

       Imo that's the only way any of us can directly turn the wheels of fate and even then they likely have replacements in she wings. I hope people more courageous than I put my ideas to the test.

       This circlejerk is getting bad.  The law enforcement community is using the term "Human Trafficking" to appeal to the low information MAGA heads.  None of the "news" you've seen has anything to do with a "network".  They're busting johns and prostitutes on backpage and craigslist.

       Nazis, terrorists and pedos = "bad guys"  If you say "we're goin after the bad guys", all you have to do is associate the enemy with one of those.  You should all be very concerned about what direction this ridiculous rhetoric is heading...

       My issue is primarily with the prostitutes getting arrested and the fact there's so much corruption around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       pimps are often protection for the prostitutes- which sometimes maybe they need.  and they usually aren't the ones getting arrested, when they often should be.

       Reaching a bit with that first statement. You sincerely believe these minor characters are the illuminated ones? Even if the conspiracy reached all the way to Clinton, it would still just be a player on the field, not the whole team. I'd also advise not to get ahead of yourself thinking anything is being taken down. This is a war of attrition and will take time.

       I agree and understand what you are saying. Clinton is not the top of the "people in charge" of the world-wide control. Just a player on the field, like you said.

       I agree that it will take time to bring the whole thing down. But I have faith that good will win over evil in the end.

        You people do realize that Satanism has nothing to do with Satan and is an atheistic religion?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes and no, Satanism is geared towards service to self which is a negative polarity position. It doesn't tell you to do anything terrible, but it tempts with great power that comes at a terrible cost and hence many people make decisions perhaps they may regret later.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, I am very aware of things like the Lucifer-Sophia connections etc. that have been alleged. However anything "occult" can be read 666 different ways back to Sunday school, hence it is pretty hard to separate worshipers intent with the occult authors actual meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aleister Crowley did put the power back in man's hands instead of "God", but that doesn't mean he's a good guy. He has a very mixed history. He did communicate with Lam who he was quite convinced was the "Lucifer consciousness". That is hard to debate that there is no attachment to Satan. Lucifer led the rebellion (EA? Anu?) but Satan was the master (Marduk/Pindar?).
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's just one literal interpretation. Some just say that Satan is a psychological archetype entity that exists in all of us and pushes us towards negative thoughts. Some say he's a real dude. Some say it's interdimensional. Some say it's a alien that left. Some say it's an alien that stayed. Some say he's in hollow earth. I definitely know he's in the Halls of Amenti, but who knows what that actually corresponds to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, some people really do worship Satan very earnestly and are directly addicted to "Service to self" and "Power for me at all costs" which usually leads to them being a narcissistic pawn who makes stupid fucking selfish decisions because they think they're a god, ending up with them getting played by an Archon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I'm rambling but I hope you get my point about how Satanism is an umbrella and has both casual worshippers and VERY evil worshippers.
