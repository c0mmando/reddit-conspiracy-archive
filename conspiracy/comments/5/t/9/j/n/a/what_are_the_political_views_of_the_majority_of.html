       Sorry that was aggressive lol, I'm just sick of all the stupid name calling. That won't help anyone.

       I'm just wondering if there's a large majority on this sub that lean one way on the political spectrum. I'm pretty new here and still feeling everything out.

       Anarchy is absolute freedom and puts the ultimate trust in the average man instead of any silly "leaders".  We don't need leaders or governments, we can rule ourselves.

       I am what is called a "Young Outsider"...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This relatively young, largely independent group holds a mix of conservative and liberal views. And while more lean toward the Republican Party than the Democratic Party, Young Outsiders express unfavorable opinions of both major parties. They are skeptical of activist government; a substantial majority views government as wasteful and inefficient. Yet they diverge from the two conservative typology groups – Steadfast Conservatives and Business Conservatives – in their strong support for the environment and many liberal social policies."

       i got liberal democrat , super far to the left, but i think the questions were too generalized, not that i disagree with the result, but it still felt like one of those facebook tests on what character you are from a certain t.v show. i think people from both sides of the political spectrum can recognize that our government isnt perfect and could use an overhaul. plus the whole political parties deal just feels like red vs blue. i think alot of it is definietly to keep us suspicious of each other and seperate, i also dislike identity politics, even if it is an issue, i dont think its our most pressing issue, and theres more important things to be rallying for. i think the corruption and money in politics is our biggest issue.

       My political party is Ayn Rand... like conspiracy theorists Ayn Rand fans are demonized as well. If I had to choose a party it would have to be Republican, but other than that I have never identified with either party. The republicans were too religious. But I may have to rethink that considering how biblical everything seems to be getting all of a sudden.

       Also, both sides are equally controlled by the elites IMO.

       Government only produces power for themselves and  a more sociopathic society through their example of excessive greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       All power positions are manned by sociopaths without conscience. who are in it for themselves. That's who always seeks power to control others.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need  to have a world population that promotes consciousness and conscience so we can progress out of our dog eat dog warrior mentality. Governments will not do or even tolerate this. They are an impedance to the  progress of mankind.

       I would guess that the primary ideological leanings of the sub are towards non-authoritatianism: so mostly libertarians and anarchists. I personally see myself as a left-libertarian. I have voted Democrat in every election except this past one, where I voted third party whenever and wherever that was an option. If it wasn't an option, I voted against whoever was currently in office. I will never again vote Democrat for federal office until every dirty corporate globalist is purged AND punished for their treasonous crimes against humanity. I also will never vote Republican, because I don't agree with them on most social issues, and I strongly disagree with their views on economics.

       I tend to vote against the party that has  the most power at any given time. the last political compass poll put me about 2 ticks right of center, and more than 3/4s down on libertarian. Until a year ago, I would have called myself a Libertarian, but they are to ideological for my tastes. I prefer Pragmatism.

       Hard to describe. I believe that it is important that we take care of our sick and needy and downtrodden, but stuff like anarcho-capitalism makes a ton of sense to me. In theory it can cover those who need help that would normally get it from the government through private companies in a free-market.

       Some days I find myself inclining to the doctrine of the psychopaths in control of the US. The philosophy that a majority of us are just savage animals in cloths, knowingly destroying our planet and ourselves by refusing to accept reality, refusing to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposedly they justify this with Darwin's "survival of the fittest". If the masses continue to not care about the consequences of their actions, and I mean driving cars, buying plastics and other useless rubbish from factories that spurn out pollution etc, including such seemingly simple things such as water and electricity usage, they threaten the survival of the elites, who perhaps do believe that they are intelligent, but are also just coked out rich savage animals in clothes. We buy instead of knit, consume instead of create, indulge in our desires instead of our needs to truly survive without any of the things we use in our daily lives. So it is not hard to see why the elites hate us, as we are tacky, poor animals aiding in the destruction of our habitats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the elites really are worse in every way, don't get me wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lies are spread about free energy and high technology that they hide to keep us miserable and poor, but they are just that. Lies to give the skeptics in us some hope that maybe it will turn out good.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then other days I think that we could live, all 7 billion and more, in harmony, if education and health were better. I'm convinced that people can live in peace together but we have suffered for thousands of years under the control of religion/bad governments.
