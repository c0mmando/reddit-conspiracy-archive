        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">310</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-02-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/edgarallenbro.html">edgarallenbro</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A couple weeks back, I did as much research I could on &quot;Camp Nose&quot;, as mentioned in this email <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42145">https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42145</a></p>

<p>We know that Camp Nose is important in tying everything together, since Hastert is a confirmed pedo and Camp Nose ties John Podesta and the rest of the cabal to Hastert.</p>

<p>One thing I learned that you need to know about japan is the historic practice of <strong>wakashudo</strong>, literally meaning &quot;the way of the youth&quot;.</p>

<p>A wool has been pulled over the eyes of the west. Every time we historically examine this concept, we are pointed towards Greek Pederasty where there was a master-apprentice relationship where the master would have pedo sex with his young apprentice.</p>

<p><strong>Wakashudo is no different from Greek pederasty</strong> except for the important fact that it was openly practiced <strong>up until the end of the 19th century.</strong> It was most popular amongst Samurai.</p>

<p>This is one of Japan&#39;s dark secrets that they have tried to cover up as they became more and more westernized. The truth is, pedophilia is as Japanese as racism towards blacks is American. It may no longer be the norm, but to deny that there are surviving pockets would just be foolish, especially reaching back 50 years to when &quot;Camp Nose&quot; happened.</p>

<p>As far as the specifics of Camp Nose:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nose is an area located northwest of Osaka</p></li>
<li><p>It is a secluded mountainous, wooded area with many potential camp sites</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, I noted in looking for prior cases of child abuse arrests that the area around Osaka had an alarming number of missing children, only really being rivaled by densely populated areas like Tokyo and Kyoto.</p>

<p>That was roughly the extent of what was conclusive from my research before this latest bust happened.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4207686/Japan-arrests-six-child-porn.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4207686/Japan-arrests-six-child-porn.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the detained was a tour company employee whose job involved being at <strong>camps for children</strong>, the Asahi Shimbun daily and other media reported.</p>

<p>The man, from <strong>Osaka</strong> prefecture in western Japan, allegedly touched and undressed children at those events when making pornographic photos and videos.</p>

<p>He also brought three <strong>college students</strong> who he met online as volunteers to the camps where they engaged in the alleged molestation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More information:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201702090064.html">http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201702090064.html</a></p>

<p>Proof that this is a trend, not a couple of isolated incidents:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The camp counselors and the tutor formed a group to trade child pornography among themselves, while a current and former teacher created a similar alliance</strong>. The two groups mainly acted separately, but police suspect they shared videos of their molestation acts with each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One group could be a fluke. Two groups demonstrates a pattern.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The camp counselors group consisted of: Tetsuya Kaihotsu, 35, unemployed, from Higashi-Osaka, Osaka Prefecture; Tatsuya Suzuki, 23, unemployed, from Iruma, Saitama Prefecture; Kohei Suzuki, 22, a university student from Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture; and a 20-year-old university student from Tokyo&#39;s Komae who was a minor at the time of the incidents.</p>

<p>The four are accused in molestation incidents against boys ranging in age from 7 to 12 years old.</p>

<p>The incidents mainly occurred between 2014 and 2016 on camping trips hosted b<strong>y a travel agency that organizes outdoor outings for children</strong>, police said.</p>

<p>Kaihotsu was employed by the travel agency at the time, and he invited Kohei Suzuki and the 20-year-old student to work as volunteer counselors for the trips. The three had met online.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we can guess that 50 years ago, on an exchange trip to Japan, this is exactly the kind of situation that Podesta and Hastert got involved in. They met Horie Masahiko, who as part of their education on Japanese culture, taught them about the not-so-ancient VAMPIRIC practice of Wakashudo. Podesta, Hastert, Masahiko, Jan Ettelt, and Andy Dolan formed an alliance. They went to children&#39;s camps, most likely as volunteer counselers, and molested children. Their circle swore lifelong secrecy.</p>

<p>This was likely the defining moment for Podesta and Hastert. From this point on, they were hooked. They had morally justified pedophilia in their minds, and there would be no turning back.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I forgot to mention that the current age of consent in Japan is <strong>13</strong>.</p>

<p>This means that anyone who wants to could legally partake in what would be considered pedophilia in the US.</p>

<p>Hastert and Podesta may not have even had to have molested children to have had a sort of &quot;eye opening&quot; experience. They could have had sexual experiences with children as young as 13 and done so 100% legally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great write up and very interesting.  Quick counter: do they really consider this a deep dark secret?  Isn&#39;t it a thing there to have young attract the old?  I dont mean to show my ignorance, but the girls selling their panties to men and using them as sugar daddies - isn&#39;t that sort of atleast an occasional thing?</p>

<p>The boys with their Samurai masters thing I did not know, but is there a cultural thing where this is normal there?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>At 13, Japan&#39;s base age of consent is the lowest of any developed country. However, many prefectures also have local &quot;corruption of minors&quot; or &quot;obscenity statutes&quot; (淫行条例) which raise the de-facto age of consent to 16-18, unless they are in a &quot;sincere romantic relationship&quot;, usually determined by parental consent. For example, the effective age of consent in Tokyo by local statute is 18. The age of marriage is 16 for girls and 18 for boys with parental permission, and 20 otherwise (as stated in &quot; ﾅｽ邃｢窶慊ｶ窶｢ﾅｸﾅｽﾆ停?邸&quot;, the Child Welfare Act of Japan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Piece together&quot; = &quot;complete speculation&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying because there were arrests in 2017 for child molestation, that <em>must</em> have been what was going on 50 years ago because ... it&#39;s the same country?</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t there arrests for molestation in a lot of countries?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, we can guess</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you got that right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... that 50 years ago, on an exchange trip to Japan, this is exactly the kind of situation that Podesta and Hastert got involved in.</p>

<p>Uh, yeah, exactly the same ... huh?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They met Horie Masahiko, who as part of their education on Japanese culture, taught them about the not-so-ancient VAMPIRIC practice of Wakashudo. <strong>SPECULATION</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, Horie Masahiko is a samurai? Child molestation is &quot;VAMPIRIC&quot;? Did you leave out some part about samurai drinking blood or only coming out at night or turning into a bat?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Podesta, Hastert, Masahiko, Jan Ettelt, and Andy Dolan formed an alliance. <strong>SPECULATION</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did you pick these people? There were 18 Americans and 18 Japanese in the group.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They went to children&#39;s camps, <strong>SPECULATION</strong><br/>
most likely as volunteer counselers  <strong>SPECULATION</strong><br/>
and molested children. <strong>SPECULATION</strong><br/>
Their circle swore lifelong secrecy.  <strong>SPECULATION</strong></p>

<p>This was likely the defining moment for Podesta and Hastert.   <strong>SPECULATION</strong><br/>
From this point on, they were hooked.   <strong>SPECULATION</strong><br/>
They had morally justified pedophilia in their minds  <strong>SPECULATION</strong>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t sure how to put it into words until I started writing it... As I started writing, it started coming to me lol... I totally understood what you were trying to say and your comment is what spurred my thought on it.</p>

<p>This sub is interesting in that way. If we think about it, a shill in r/conspiracy has a tough job. They can&#39;t just claim that because there is no hard evidence, therefore it&#39;s bogus... This sub is based on, and encourages creative theories that may have very little evidence. Many users on r/conspiracy will take a theory seriously as long as there is a good motive, there doesn&#39;t even have to be any actual evidence at all. So a shill coming to r/conspiracy and saying that it&#39;s all speculation is stating the obvious.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting parts of r/conspiracy is that in most of the theories presented, we have already established that there is motive. In this case the motive would be pedophilia for hastert... And the fact that Podesta was friends/colleagues w Hastert creates enough suspicion that Podesta could be involved in whatever Hastert is involved in. </p>

<p>Now add the evidence of suspicious code talk, sketchy people in Podesta circle, and weird code like email language and piece it all together. Given all these factors, the Japan pedo busts definitely can be theorized to be linked to pizza gate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all speculation, if it were fact, they would not be where they are now. As others have pointed out, this is a conspiracy sub. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really not helpful to point out that this is all speculation, almost every post in conspiracy is speculation, that is why this sub exists.</p>

<p>In my own words, the main goal of this sub is to propose speculative theories, such as this one, so that others can prove or disprove it. If you have solid evidence that proves that his theory is incorrect, then we are all ears, but if your only response is to exclaim that it&#39;s all speculation then you are probably a shill.</p>

<p>Tldr: of course it&#39;s speculation, that is the whole point of this sub! To point this out tips us off that you are prob a shill.</p>

<p>In the context of the Alex Jones school of thought, it seems like he&#39;s dead serious about the literal consumption of blood.
