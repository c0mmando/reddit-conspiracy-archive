<p>&quot;The Democratic National Committee has rolled back restrictions introduced by presidential candidate Barack Obama in 2008 that banned donations from federal lobbyists and political action committees.</p>

<p>The decision, which may provide an advantage to Hillary Clinton’s candidacy, was viewed with disappointment Friday morning by good government activists who saw it as a step backward in the effort to limit special interest influence in Washington.&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT: So I have been accused of this or that within this post. I have personally replied to each attack. None have replied to explain their accusations and none have responded to debate their post. Also none have responded by PM or past original post with any source. Be wary it is those people, they are trying to divide us.</p>

<p>3 day closed door meeting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conference, which kicked off Sunday night at Washington’s pricey Mandarin Oriental hotel, is sponsored by the influential Democracy Alliance donor club, and will include appearances by leaders of most leading unions and liberal groups, as well as darlings of the left such as House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairman Keith Ellison, according to an agenda and other documents obtained by POLITICO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DNC is supposed to be unbiased of all democratic candidates during the primaries. They didn&#39;t do that. They conspired to help Hillary while undermining Sanders campaign. The left media was in the pocket of Clinton as well.</p>

<p>I just posted what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVa4G32M7Bc">Roberta Langue</a> did in Las Vegas. The DNC Chair Donna Brazile gave Clinton the debate answers. And the wiki leak emails showed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was also helping Clinton.</p>

<p>Just to show how fucked up the media was about most of what was reveiled to the public I will state this. After the bullshit Lange pulled in Las Vagas Anderson Cooper from CNN had a six person panel on to talk about it. One of those people just happened to be Donna Brazile, imagine that. Anyhow for the next ten minutes or so all they did was rail against how unruly the Sanders delegates were being. Not once did they talk about what Roberta Langue had done. Not ONE person on that panel mentioned her. That was pretty much was when I knew without any doubt that Clinton had the media in her pocket. For people here that were paying attention you could also see how Clinton stole some of Sanders platform (later in the year) so she could look more like a progressive.</p>

<p>There is a new movement that is breaking ground. Look up Justice Democrats. Their mission is to remove the Corporate Democrats.</p>

<p>No other candidate had tens of thousands of people coming out to hear them speak. I think at one Sanders event more than 30,000 showed up. The DNC burned the entire party to the ground to help Clinton. Turned off a lot of young voters. Now they are trying to act like it never happened.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long post. I have been passionate about this and feel people shouldn&#39;t forget about what really happened.</p>

<p>The primaries are not part of any constitutional system.  This is what a lot people here do not seem to understand.  The primaries are privately run, meaning they are not run buy the government.  Neither party has to even hold a vote for the primary.  Each party is in full control of their own parties primary process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what he said is not propaganda.  Each party is a private org and the primaries while aided by local governments is a private function.  Parties don&#39;t even have to hold a vote for candidate selection and voting in primaries did not become a thing until 1973.  Prior  to this each party voted internally without public input on who to run under their parties name.  </p>

<p>This is why some state have closed primaries because the people do not have a right to vote in the primary process.  </p>

<p>In some states the GOP also holds closed primaries.  The purpose of the closed primary is to avoid having people from another party vote for the worst candidate on the other parties ballot. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why wouldn&#39;t you want to run the candidate with the most support?</p>

<p>Because the primary process for both parties is to poll the voters in those parties.  But then again in a lot of state people don&#39;t have to register as a D,R or I and can vote for what ever party during the primary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really was a very serious blind eye to <em>many</em> unethical behaviors that were raised time and again. Ppl were ignored, dismissed openly, and the farce just continued. No one in authority said, stop, this is wrong in democratic process, let&#39;s investigate and repeat the process if necessary. That was the beginning of the rape of American voters. Even with DNC media collusion stories got out of gross disservice to voters by suppressing their right to vote and of rampant election fraud discrepancies in states with paper ballots. Which of course implies, the corruption was really throughout the system, the party and the judicial branch.  The coup happened long before and the election was just the consolidation of power under Corporatists/ Banker interests who were paid up and well supplied with bought puppets. Both parties, just in case. </p>

<p>What&#39;s it like living in a fantasy-world where media coverage wasn&#39;t almost exclusively pushing the &quot;Sanders supporters are all white, young, male college students&quot; and similar messages? Where numerous articles tried to downplay his history of struggle fighting for civil rights? </p>

<p>And where it literally doesn&#39;t matter that these same media outlets were outed for working intimately with the Hillary campaign and the DNC itself?</p>

<p>I seriously don&#39;t know what the fuck is wrong with you and people like you where you are incapable of cross-referencing events and constructing context for things. Example:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Dude, I just fucking said that small things add up. How do you not get that? That these small things add up, over the course of the primary, to form that eventual large margin? How do you not understand that the end result does not justify the means taken to achieve it? That the &quot;3 MILLION MORE VOTES!&quot; talking point does not negate months of ridiculously dismissive and critical coverage of Bernie, of these outlets working directly with the fucking DNC on messaging? That maybe the consistent messaging I am talking about might have a little bit to do with him convincing minorities, which you seem to think is all that matters seemingly oblivious to the reality of what working against the media means.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a hint: working against the media means being crucified for nothing. Remember how Bernie was a horrible sexist because he said he wanted both sides to &quot;stop shouting about gun control&quot;? Maybe you don&#39;t. I remember at least three news cycles trying to make him out to be a misogynist, with Hillary saying things like &quot;When a woman gets assertive, maybe some men think we&#39;re shouting.&quot;  </p>

<p>How many news cycles were devoted on Hillary&#39;s dismissal of a young black protester who paid to enter a posh fundraiser, demanding Hillary address Black Lives Matter? Oh, wait, none, if you didn&#39;t read about it on the internet <em>you didn&#39;t know it happened</em>. This was the <strong><em>day before the SC primary</em></strong>, and there was literally booing, <strong><em>hissing from the crowd</em></strong>, and some guy calling her a trespasser (again, she paid $500 to enter). </p>

<p>If you tell me with a straight face that that would not have been THE END if it had happened to Bernie, if it wouldn&#39;t have been played nonstop on MSNBC/CNN/CBS/ABC et al, then you are a fucking liar, a deluded fool, or both. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to continue to respond to you after this, I&#39;ve already downvoted you 30+ times over the course of the past year, and I already know that you are going to toe the establishment line no matter what. </p>
