       Funny you mention aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think aliens are part of the pedo pizza code/symbolism, thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously
      </p>
      <p>
       Its come up quite a bit in my research.Aliens worshipping pizza and shit like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they role play as aliens,actually think they are aliens .
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought this during the very early days of p gate but never really followed up on it,p gate is crazy enough already,people are scared off by the satanic angle,never mind introducing aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reconfirmed this theory following on another group that 4chan has been investigating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should do thread about it,maybe wait till p gate makes some progress.

       I've seen the alien stuff around the edges too. And there is plenty of evidence the Clintons are highly interested in aliens, but not insiders. Bill was furious he dodn't rate being read in on that subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm not sure how they would tie that in with the rest of their occultism, but it's certainly a possibility.

       I'm also thinking it ties into podestas interest in ufos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe when Podesta is searching for aliens he is actually searching for other pedos?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it ties into their occultism because they have created a massive hidden sub culture/religion for themselves where they actually believe they are the aliens and their pedophilic practice are somehow nesercery for their alien agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think many of these people actually believe they are aliens because of me ultra mind control.

       I used to know a guy that was in this huge group that thought they were alien hybrids or something. He was dead serious too. And while I definitely think such things exist, I was having a hard time believing a fail to launch middle aged pizza cook.

       So, these ideas exist and can be formal. Wouldn't be siurprised.

       The CIA within the media conglomerates would absolutely take those down, but probably not the FBI, and maybe not the NSA. When you say "the feds," you may have to be more specific these days.

       4chan has been censoring child pornography for years. You can supposedly get a ban for even talking about pedos/pedophilia. They got a lot of heat for CP and don't want to deal with it. "Cheese Pizza" as a reference to "child pornography" was basically invented by 4chan users as a way to mock questions regarding CP. People would ask, "What does CP mean?" or just use "CP" without saying what it was and anons would answer "Cheese Pizza!", "Captain Picard!" or "Captain Planet!" or some other made-up backronym like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try searching for "cheese pizza 4chan" before ~2010 and you'll find a bunch of results referencing "CP" as "cheese pizza" (they all clearly refer to cheese pizza as a joke).
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/9wsox/how_to_safely_surf_b/">
        Here's
       </a>
       a 7 year old reddit thread in which people make that same joke. Most results will be similar. Then search for "cheese pizza" AND "child pornography" (both in quotes) and you'll find zero relevant results. There is no evidence that any of the other code words were used by
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       other than the 4chan anon that posted them.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Now, here's the kicker:
       </strong>
       The words "Cheese Pizza" (together) are
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       used in the Podesta emails. Don't believe me?
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/">
        Search for it yourself
       </a>
       . Yet the completely made-up code words are the entire basis of "pizzagate" (hence the "pizza"). PG proponents are now claiming that every fucking pedo in the world is somehow related to "pizzagate" because they literally have zero proof of any child-molestation crime having been committed by the originally accused. They are trying to legitimize their illegitimate conspiracy this way.
      </p>
      <h1>
       TL;DR: "Cheese pizza" was invented (by 4chan users) to make fun of people/questions asking about "CP". Even if they were serious, the words "cheese pizza" (together) were actually never used in the Podesta emails. All the other code words were made up by a 4chan anon. The most likely explanation is that some perv/idiot was using "cheese pizza" to try to upload child pornography or to talk about child pornography. Both of which are frowned upon. Hence the ban/delete-hammer.

       You still didn't address any of the other code words used in the email. You just debunked that "cheese pizza" wasn't said by Podesta. So by cherry picking this point to debunk it's suddenly suppose to make the while thing less creepy and less real?

      <p>
       How am I supposed to debunk these other words? Do you want me to prove that they are
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       code words? Do you know how hard it is to prove a negative? It's virtually impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about this: Can you (or anyone else) provide
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       proof that the other code words were ever used before the 4chan anon posted them in relation to Pizzagate? This is the foundation of pizzagate and should be trivially easy to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just one of the many, many holes in PG, but I'm trying to stay on topic here. Namely, the reasons 4chan would ban "cheese pizza" and/or "pizzagate" threads.

       My understanding is that 4chan is heavy on the censorship and has been for like a decade or something. I think the folks interested in pizza moved over to 8chan for the most part due to more relaxed moderators, but I'm honestly not into the chan scene so I'm not 100% sure.
