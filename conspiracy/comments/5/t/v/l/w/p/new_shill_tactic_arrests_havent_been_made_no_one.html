<p>Keep your wits, kids. They&#39;re looking for influence &amp; to slide legit conversation and speculation. Remember that journalists are relying on their sources. If a story doesn&#39;t pan, it could be a zillion dominoes (ha! pun) waiting to fall. </p>

<p>This investigation does not stop, not for threats, not for gaslighting. </p>

<p><strong>You don&#39;t need the authorities to tell you you&#39;re right.</strong> Keep digging. Remember, the shills will shame you. Doesn&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>Keep digging. Don&#39;t stop.   </p>

<p>No. I&#39;m sorry. (And I see you have a 6 day account, so maybe you&#39;re coming into this with some ideas, or perhaps directives.) People are not fucked. As a matter of fact The People are waking up. </p>

<p>The People are organizing. 
The people are demanding answers. 
The People are no longer willing to be frightened livestock. </p>

<p>Fuck ratings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>a 6 day account is fine - that has nothing to do with anything. Your account was 6 days old at one point in time. I&#39;ve been involved with alternative media/culture for 15 years now - because I recently joined a forum has nothing to do with anything, nor anyone&#39;s view/knowledge/intent. I mean, being on a forum like this would lead you to believe that not everyone falls under the same brush.</p>

<p>I totally agree with what you&#39;re saying - I guess it should have said .. some people are fucked. Some are very much so waking up ... I would imagine that&#39;s why most of us are drawn to a forum like this and others with alt news and where the people are putting in their own time figuring what we&#39;re not necessarily told..</p>

<p>it sometimes slips that it&#39;s an online discussion and you have to explain everything to the fullest detail so the full group can play along. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. According to the rules of this sub, I cannot name shills, even if many of us have confirmed them privately. </p>

<p>There have been multiple, repeated posts &amp; threads lately which echo specific forum sliding techniques. Celebrity bullshit, discrediting techniques, etc. Do you not read here often, or understand how that works? Glancing at your account history, I would think you&#39;d get it. It&#39;s a fairly common situation. </p>

<p>Has zero to do with opposing opinions, but everything to do with recognizing techniques. </p>

<p>You haven&#39;t confirmed shit, you&#39;ve speculated that some users are shills but don&#39;t have anything to back it up.

    <div class="md"><p>Battled shills for almost then years. Where I came from the gov has hired more than 5 million ppl doing full time shilling.
Some tips:
1. Shills do personal attacks often. The tactic is to drag ppl&#39;s actual attention from the topics and make them join the fights. Do not bother fighting with them. Focus on the facts and leads.
2. Shills have to, most of the time, make some outrages claims like &quot;Pz gate is bs ! / 911 is bs&quot; by order, which helps you instantly mark them.
3. Once marked them, they can be helpful. Follow the opposite direction of their claims you may find some gold.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read a ton about it and I&#39;m still not sure if there is anything to it. I am aware there are pedophile rings but is that what is discussed in the Podesta emails?... Who knows?</p>

<p>I think we need a lot more evidence before we can say for certain what all is going on here.</p>
