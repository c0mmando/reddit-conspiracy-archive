    <div class="md"><p>Yes, let&#39;s get rid of hope.</p>

<p>The only ones being deceived by Seaman are the ones who expected too much. Seaman is merely a voice, not an actor. For all he knows he might be off by a week on the plan in action. Trump got a lot of resistance in the senate, delays happen.</p>

<p>That being said, will something happen? Maybe, maybe not, but I have hope and you can&#39;t rid me of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No predictions?
So if someone came with a legit warning,
you&#39;d say &quot;NO PREDICTIONS MAN&quot;???</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safer to not put such an unnecessary and dangerous
rule.
What&#39;s worse, missing a warning,
or the inconvenience of getting a prediction wrong
or wrong by a week or something?
Predictions can be stupid, but not always.

    <div class="md"><p>No, not that - more the whole Comet Ping Pong being a location with kill rooms and such. They&#39;re saying that is the part that is possibly planted so that people put all of their energy into something that ultimately has no teeth or means to cause them trouble. This would be why they posted questionable materials to instagram and facebook and hosted a file with heavy encryption that looks very suspicious on the website.  Or maybe they do use it, but they don&#39;t do anything too crazy there (anymore) and so they use it as a scapegoat distraction. The point is that ultimately it cannot yield any indictments or actual danger to the pedos, compared to people finding out their real connections/locations that are in use. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been reported that the &quot;suspicious files&quot; on the website that were behind a password system were cracked in December by a hacker and confirmed to be child porn. It&#39;s also been reported that the hacker in question delivered the material to the DC police. No danger of any indictments? How about for the death threats Alefantis has made against investigators? No chance of indictment for that crime either? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have any answers, but then i&#39;d be wondering just like you &#39;why haven&#39;t these guys been arrested?&#39;</p>

<p>So either guys like Seaman are correct and there have been more speedbumps than expected in getting all these people arrested, or it could be that Pizzagate is a convenient distraction.</p>

<p>Again, i want to be clear that this is not my point of view - I dont&#39; know if Pizzagate is real or not. I think that there is definitely something behind Pizzagate no matter what, but i&#39;m not sure if that actual location is a true lead. Regardless, I do think the DOJ is working on this stuff, I just think they&#39;re being obstructed already. Even Flynn&#39;s resignation seems like some &#39;behind-the-scenes&#39; dealings...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. The way that works is; Secret Source gets  target (Semen) to trust him by leaking some secret bullshit that turns out to be true. THAT establishes the source&#39;s honesty to Semen. The source keeps occasionally feeding Semen tidbits that are real. This keeps Semen on the hook. When something really big is coming that &quot;they&quot; want to control the narrative on, they let the source &quot;leak&quot; a bullshit story to Semen (arrests tomorrow). Semen trumpets everything his &quot;trusted&quot; source has leaked to him......and Semen is embarrassed and looks like a fool. </p>

<p>He&#39;s talked about sources in law enforncement before. If you were a journalist and your source in the police told you a high profile arrest was happening, you&#39;d be inclined to believe it. It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;doesn&#39;t have a good bs detector&quot;, it&#39;s a matter of trusting a source that seems trustworthy but may be wrong.</p>

<p>However, we&#39;ve all seen that Sandusky fellow was arrested at about the time that Seaman claimed, so I would guess that the informant was talking about that high profile arrest. They said there would be a high profile arrest, not necessarily that it would be James Alefantis, for example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fine with some predictions because they&#39;re wild and interesting to think about (Armageddon, Y2K, etc.) but I agree; David Seaman seems to be slowly getting discredited through being wrong about the arrests, multiple times. Why you wouldn&#39;t wait until something was actually happening, I do not know. </p>

<p>People predicting arrests/leaks on pizzagate and being wrong make it look more and more like the whole thing is a sham. Granted, I think there is a lot more into PG, but to the normal person who doesn&#39;t read <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or keep their minds open, this could be doing an incredible disservice to the people actually trying to get the public to know about it and believe it exists.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even talking about PG solely. There have been many reports of sex rings being taken down in LA and Haiti and somehow it&#39;s not being publicized very well.</p>

<p>Ignorance is bliss, I guess. </p>

<p>On another note, the medias bias and contradictory statements have made me lose faith in almost all television news sources, including their online articles and such. It just feels like you can&#39;t go anywhere to get <em>real</em> news anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what people are forgetting is that there ARE factions out there trying to discredit Pizzagate (especially trying to discredit David Seaman because he&#39;s one of the loudest voices on the subject). Some of these people are in higher levels of the authority structure of the world. Not just in the US.</p>

<p>So, what&#39;s the best way to discredit a reporter? It&#39;s not by slinging accusations at them, and it&#39;s not by arguing their statements and research; those will often bring MORE attention to the message. No, it&#39;s by feeding the reporters misleading information so that their followers will start to doubt the trustworthiness of the person doing the reporting.</p>

<p>The feeding of misinformation could be what&#39;s happening to David. It&#39;s a classic maneuver. I think that&#39;s why he threatened to expose his source. There&#39;s only been reported 1 arrest so far of a semi-well-known individual, with very little information currently available on the arrest. Sandusky was arrested around the same time the source indicated (in addition to the the 1000-or-so recently arrested no-name human traffickers). Again, this single arrest could be bait to keep Seaman in trust of his source. If this person is well-enough connected as DS implies, then he could have possibly known about Sandusky&#39;s coming arrest, but skewed the magnitude of his &quot;leak&quot; to DS, thereby being &#39;accurate&#39; but not completely accurate. I still have major reservations about his SOURCE, but I yet have no reason to disbelieve David himself. Everything DS has reported on checks out with regards to #PG, but so far that&#39;s not the case with what his SOURCE has fed to DS.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to say that EVERYTHING he says should be blindly trusted. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s prudent for anyone. There is the UNDENIABLE chance, that the source could be completely made up. But often, these things take more time to develop and be resolved than we hope or expect, so if the &quot;source&quot; continues to be largely incorrect also ever-so-slightly correct, then it&#39;s difficult to put continued faith in that source and DS. Because anyone can say &quot;Oh look what my source says&quot; and then go on to make whatever leak that fits their agenda.</p>

<p>In my opinion, considering DS is putting himself out there publicly and in the face of legitimate threats so he can expose Pizzagate, I am not hopping on the &quot;Ditch David&quot; bandwagon just yet, and I encourage others to continue scrutinizing. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s logical to write off a journalist, whose source is incorrect, right away. I think only after trend of failure should any journalist be cast off as unreliable.</p>
