<p>I&#39;ll have to disagree with you on that. IMO, people should be allowed to speak freely, even if it is manipulative BS. However, it is up to the community to highlight that whatever is said is manipulative BS.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t like the ban idea, not only because it&#39;s not feasible, it&#39;s bad in general. Banning Seaman for his antics today, can be a sign of banning truthers tomorrow.</p>

<p>As individuals, we must always affirm our stance on non-censorship, no matter how crappy the post or person is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not stealing anyone&#39;s work.  He&#39;s reporting it.  He also reports leaks he gets.  What should he do?  Not report them and wait to see what happens?  His job is to report info.  Besides, that&#39;s his choice how he wants to disclose data.  It&#39;s also the choice of people not to listen to him if the data he provides has no value to them.  The mass of people who think there&#39;s something up with pizzagate indicates that people think there&#39;s value to the things he posts.  It&#39;s pretty much that simple.</p>

<p>As to the rhetoric that if his sources give him bad data this somehow makes his opinion worthless - that&#39;s a bit silly.  Even it he was reporting his opinion and he was wrong, so what?  People are not perfect.  This is reality.  The expectation of perfection by Heroes is a big lie, and has always been a big lie - thanks for perpetuating this ridiculous program which keeps us all waiting for someone to save us.     </p>

<p>This is bullshit.  Since DS references the same sources on PG as anyone else, everyone knows what the source material is, and he&#39;s talking about that source material.   The only exception to this is when he brings in data that&#39;s been personally leaked to him.  Since everybody knows the sources, your criticism becomes one of form and not substance.  Pretty weak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>banning things is a slippery slope.</p>

<p>As an online community we are hopefully gathered to hone our discernment while seeking objectivity. 
Testing this discernment is good and this fellow fails my personal test.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The media (and the public) love celebrities, so the easiest way to get attention is to be a celebrity.</p>

<p>Dirty Little Secrets of Buzz will teach you how to do just that, and for little or no cost. For example, Secret #2: Be outrageous or die. There’s a benefit to angering the public. “It’s often better to piss someone off than to leave them ambivalent.” It doesn’t matter whether they like you, only whether they remember you. This goes against the traditional advice – mind your manners—but it certainly makes sense. Who’s going to buy your product if they don’t remember it exists?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll have to disagree with you on that. IMO, people should be allowed to speak freely, even if it is manipulative BS. However, it is up to the community to highlight that whatever is said is manipulative BS.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t like the ban idea, not only because it&#39;s not feasible, it&#39;s bad in general. Banning Seaman for his antics today, can be a sign of banning truthers tomorrow.</p>

<p>As individuals, we must always affirm our stance on non-censorship, no matter how crappy the post or person is.</p>
