       Ill admit that I have learned this through an unhealthy obsession of watching this sub, but the fact remains.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any thread of merit or possible robust, free-thinking dialogue pops up, 15 new posts hit the sub, and the thread is trashed by people that you know are not neutral.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny, because no matter how hard you try, you just can't fake being genuine, even over the internet.

       No amount of money in the world compares to being just who you are, and thinking about exactly WTF you want to.

       These digital charlatans are a dime a dozen, and they should let their bosses know that they are poorly trained, and need new tactics.

       it's clear you're just looking to fight with people. Perhaps you have an issue that you'd like to discuss in an open and critical manner? That's what I find this sub is good for, like 50% of the time.

       2005 XP SP2 conference Microsoft had in San Diego convention center, you couldn't tell the difference between a bot or a human on comment control software, that was 12 years ago. Comment propaganda is their largest asset, to think otherwise is a big disservice to common sense thinking, these monsters laugh as they feed on people's naive tendency to trust, it's an instinctive nature in us, that they use to manipulate people with their propaganda, WHILE PLAYING BOTH SIDES.

       If you want to proceed with that assumption and argue why 90% of the comments and posts in this sub are, or are not, posted by bots/shills, that's up to you. Myself, I don't see that this is a "legitimate civil discussion about real issues".

       I didn't say that 90% were bots/shills.  There are many of those. 90% of this sub is the same kind of bogus convo as the one that I am currently responding to.  Although this is a 10% post. :)

       You say you want "legitmate civil discussion about real issues" and yet nothing that you have posted leans towards that.

       This is probably an alt. Next step is to downvote this comment and drwoodyg's. But you'll be able to tell bc it will be far down the comment tree and disproportionatly downvoted with respect to its tree depth and thus views.

       I find that it's become more and more like reading comments on MSM articles. I have been rage quitting more frequently, a lot of clueless/malicious responses that don't add to discussion or want to debate the details without bias. I keep coming back because I hope a lot of other people see these msm trolls for what they are and the real discussions are still happening so f* em.

       We should have a new rule that if your post has something related to Trump or Hillary, that post should be removed and a 24 hour ban. This is not a sub for politics. Most of us here dont like a lot of aspects of government so trying to sway others to support your candidate isnt going to work here.

       I'm noticing this too. People are downvoted for asking for sources now??? Saw someone downvoted just for replying to a pro-religious comment 'allah akbar.' Seriously? It means 'god is good,' and it's not just a cry of radicalisation, it's the same as anyone else saying 'praise be' or what have you. The amount of narrow-mindedness and seeking of confirmation bias in this sub is staggering. It used to be a great neutral discussion ground, but it's been flooded by folks with agendas. Research and sources, acceptance of others, and new views used to be welcome here. God damn sad.

       Do you know how fun it was providing sources to people only to have the other party deny the legitimacy of the information presented due to either attacking the website, author, or a single detail?

       It's a waste of effort to talk to people who would rather challenge others than perform a bit of self education in order to deepen their knowledge on a specific subject.

       I agree. Vocal fools will seek to confirm their bias and discount any source for any reason. It sucks. But if someone is asking to be educated, I think we should try and help them with that even if the anti-intellectuals shout their fallacies from the ailse. Some people you just can't reach and can't convince, and that's unfortunate, but it's also fine. It shouldn't get us so jaded that we can't help someone who's actually asking for help, you know?

       I don't disagree with that. It's also important to be able to back up your claims. If we make controversial statements and someone asks for a source, we should be able to back up our information with facts, not just tell them to Google it and take our word for it.

       All you need to know in that regard is that there is no point in arguing. State your stance in an informative fashion, answer questions, rebut debate, but never argue. Just move on.

       If they can't form an intelligent response free of hostility then it really doesn't matter whether they are a bot or not because at that point you're already talking to a wall.

       The goal of tptb is to divide us and in argument we have already conformed to their will. The only response is unity. A single cause that is independent of political association.

       You have to understand that there are very few people who are perusing this forum that are "average joes" that would begin with your first post of negative connotations to the very conception of this topic.

       I didn't say that 90% were bots/shills.  There are many of those. 90% of this sub is the same kind of bogus convo as the one that I am currently responding to.  Although this is a 10% post. :)

       You say you want "legitmate civil discussion about real issues" and yet nothing that you have posted leans towards that.
