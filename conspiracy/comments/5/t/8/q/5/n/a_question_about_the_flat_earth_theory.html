       You should probably do a bit more research on it.  It's honestly fascinating stuff to me, though I wouldn't call myself a believer at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth more or less posits the idea that our entire "universe" as we know it is contained within our atmosphere (or the glass part of a snow globe) and all that is outside of it is nothingness, or the other dimensions of heaven and hell.  That would mean that all the science behind the planets and stars was BS.  It would take us back to being the center of the universe that we know, which would make it extremely difficult to argue for the idea of not having been created by a higher intelligence of some kind.

       It is a preposterous theory propagated by people with low education levels and too much time on their hands. YouTube videos are not a replacement for thousands of years of math, science, physics, astronomy, astrophysics, geometry, etc.

       his grasp of physics was awful.  I think he grabbed bits and pieces of vids he seen and mashed them up.  It was insane.  I kept asking him to link to proof as he was trying to drive a thread.  I wouldn't let up.  When someone is that emphatic, I wonder what the motive is to drive wrong data.

       It's pretty sad that you write off anybody that has a different mind than you as "people with low education levels with too much time on their hands." Judgmental people like you is exactly why it's so much harder for everybody to come together and progress. What pretty and shiny college did you go that gave you such a superiority complex?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one thing to disagree with somebody, but it becomes an issue when you start to mock others that are trying to think outside the box. Can you imagine if none of us ever had any "insane" theories? It would be a very bleak world where we would just listen and do as we're told where nothing would ever change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a "flat earther" but I do have a question for you out of curiosity. Since you seem to loathe the thought and the people who believe in flat earth so much, how would you feel if it actually came out to be true? How would you personally deal with the fact if you found out you were deeply lied to about your entire world and very existence? It would be pretty interesting to see how quickly egos got stripped away if proof of a flat earth, the most "bat shit, insane, stupid" theory out there, actually turned out to be true.

       First of all, it's called the
       <em>
        theory

       of gravitation and the
       <em>
        theory

       of relativity. Secondly, gravity has nothing to do with the fact that A) there is no measurable curvature, and B) there is no scientific experiment proving the earth moves.

       the foucault pendulum proves nothing but how easy it is to deceive the masses with psuedo-science. The pendulum doesn't move independently; it must always be set in motion by an external force. Pendulums don't always swing in the same direction, or with the supposed rotation of the earth. Pendulums are circus attractions that belong nowhere near a museum, but yet there they are with dinosaurs, space, and other fake science.

       No there are people who 100% believe that the earth is literally flat. These people cannot be reasoned with at all. I tried to debate one on here about a month ago and any evidence I posted was just written off as lies.

       I mean, how did they get Super Bowl jerseys into the ISS? Did they just teleport them up there? Did the NFL manufacture 32 jerseys for this year's Super Bowl and send them up there last July along with an official game ball just so they could wear them on camera during the game? Or did they waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money to sneak them up there on a rocket when nobody was looking?

       Just saying, last manned shuttle went up July last year and they somehow had the super bowl jerseys of both teams playing in the Super Bowl this year. Only way to get stuff up is a spaceX shuttle no? Really gunna send that up last minute for the stupid fucking Super Bowl?
      </p>
      <p>
       So that brings up 2 questions: if the NFL isn't rigged to get 2 specific teams into the championship, then what are we wasting tax dollars sending some official super bowl jerseys up into space for, or why does NASA know who is going to be in the super bowl?

       The NFL sent jerseys for all 32 teams up in an already scheduled launch from the US. It wasn't a special trip just for them. Also the NFL paid for their weight. They sent it months ago.

       They don't. They

       it's flat. Big difference. One requires effort and investigation…the other requires nothing more than satisfying a deeply held desire.

       For a few reasons. One, there's no measurable curvature. That's the easiest thing to prove. Second, the massive amount of fakery from NASA and all other space agencies makes everything we think we know about space completely suspect. Most people don't realize every notable scientific experiment has been unable to prove the earth moves, but in fact proves the earth is motionless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth is definitely not a globe. Whatever it is, there will never be disclosure.

       Just suspend your disbelief til the end. The idea is that throughout history elites have told us we are a meaningless speck floating through space, which subconsciously diminishes the value of life. This is because they want to make us passive consumers of their products and their narratives (life has less meaning let's make it more meaningful by buying things). Further the shape of the flat earth is important, many people picture it as a rectangular flat map of the world but it would actually be a circle, think of the globe model of the earth flattened with the arctic in the center and Antarctica actually forming a large icy border protecting the "edge". Now imagine there's no edge and this icy plane goes on forever, or at least larger than we thought imaginable, with the flat earth indented into the plane. Now couldn't it be possible that in other parts of the plane there could be other flat earths? If these flat earths have people or human like beings on them then they could be a threat to the elites since they cannot be controlled from within their sphere of influence. So they flood the mainstream with fictional alien invasions so that if any of these people from the other flat earths try to come here they could paint them as alien invaders. I don't believe in the flat earth theory but I think it's fun to think about if you suspend your disbelief for a moment.

       And I see it precisely the opposite. The notion that life is somehow more special because it was created by a superior entity makes no sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creation of life by a superior being may seem awe inspiring to us but to the entity it is likely no more than the snap of fingers…whereas a confluence of events with no seeming connection that winds up creating sentient, self-aware creatures is truly magical.
      </p>

       After all which is more magical…a snowball or a snowflake?

       Right I've seen a lot of their stuff, the main reason I've seen for some people I know to go along with flat earth theory is because they haven't seen the curves for themselves or actually been to Antarctica, it's a very primal literal way of thinking.

       It's a massive deception. Real, genuine people who believe flat earth are doing their part to spread truth. They may not know the whole truth, but they know the earth is not a globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the whole world woke up overnight realizing they've been lied to since birth about the nature of our earth, there would be a real revolution to overthrow establishment science, medicine, energy, government, etc. It unravels so many other lies. It would start a new renaissance and lead to real innovation. Do I believe that will happen? No, but I do think it's a likely outcome of a mass awakening.

       Ever wonder why every post about flat earth is always stuck at 0 points? Just the fact that reddit's bots manage to keep a lid on these posts should give you a clue. Flat earth is not a psyop. It could be considered a distraction depending on your definition. But that doesn't change the fact that more and more people are waking up to the globe deception every day. Reddit may not be the best place to talk about it judging by the vitriol and hatefulness that gets spread on every one of these posts. At least there are some reasonable people in this thread.

       Why is it that this topic gets insanely down voted every time it is brought up? It isn't even allowed to be discussed, more than any other topic. Like, verbally abusive to people like this OP who just simply entertained the thought of "what if?". He doesn't even believe in it, and yet this thread is under very heavy opposition. This is the only topic left on this sub that gets denied heavily. The only topic on here where a comment can be "you are a stupid fucking idiot troll" can be a top comment in a thread in response to a question provoking thought. Everything else stays civil.

       i think it comes down to whether or not you trust the scientific method. making a hypothesis making observations testing the hypothesis and scrutinizing the results adjusting the hypothesis. in my opinion the scientific method is the best tool we have for understanding the world around us, its not perfect because even scientists have biases, but ideally they practice the method and thats what i trust, we may not understand everything(and i dont think we ever can) but we have a tool which can lead us closer to understanding. the reason i believe the earth is round is because our observations back it up. eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the earth some 2211 years ago, i admit that im not a mathmatician, and i haven ever tried the expirement, but maybe i should, its easy enough anyone can do it.

       I think the reason ppl think the earth is flat, is because you're supposed to be able to detect curvature at 15,000 feet. An amateur flat earther sent a balloon up to 120,000 feet and saw no curvature. They've also performed laser experiments, and also being able to see downtown Chicago from 60 miles away. Technically, Chicago should be out of view, under the curvature of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the #1 reason that gets people interested in the first place, is that there's no unedited photos of the earth. They're all CGI or paintings. Like WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've seen, FE's don't really have an agenda, they just truly believe the earth is flat. If the earth is really a globe, why are there no basic photos of the earth?

       My question, is so simple, when did the earth become pear shaped? That is what sold me. That and the videos filmed by pilots, hot air balloons and drones. In them, we can see the sun and moon are much smaller then we we're told and literally right above the clouds leaving obvious hot spots.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, now NASA claims that the earth has a considerable pot belly around the equator. So, but then why has every single image shot from space shown the earth to be perfectly round?
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA's spokesman laughed and said, oh yeah, we were sold a lie about earth and in fact earth is a little lumpy. "Deal with it" he said trying to be funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA also has this ridiculous video where the artist who created some of the composites, explains why they just HAD to do it that way. Basically be there were no images shot from space lol
      </p>
      <p>
       At about min 8:28 he talks about earth being pear shaped:

        https://youtu.be/PBD7A-OMWyE
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, unless this video is somehow fake, the astronauts who supposedly died in the 1980s are still alive and kicking. many using their same name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Video of the mysterious NASA astronauts who cheated death:

       Tell me, that is not suspect. Especially when we remember that the whole program was headed by Wernher von Braun a NAZI rocket scientist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think as well, that many of the really high profile UFO researchers, like Richard Hoagland, David Wilcock and Greer are disinformation. I used to give them the benefit of the doubt, but if Flat Earth theory is correct, then at least it'll make it easier to sort out some of the frauds.

       It's pretty sad that you write off anybody that has a different mind than you as "people with low education levels with too much time on their hands." Judgmental people like you is exactly why it's so much harder for everybody to come together and progress. What pretty and shiny college did you go that gave you such a superiority complex?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one thing to disagree with somebody, but it becomes an issue when you start to mock others that are trying to think outside the box. Can you imagine if none of us ever had any "insane" theories? It would be a very bleak world where we would just listen and do as we're told where nothing would ever change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a "flat earther" but I do have a question for you out of curiosity. Since you seem to loathe the thought and the people who believe in flat earth so much, how would you feel if it actually came out to be true? How would you personally deal with the fact if you found out you were deeply lied to about your entire world and very existence? It would be pretty interesting to see how quickly egos got stripped away if proof of a flat earth, the most "bat shit, insane, stupid" theory out there, actually turned out to be true.

       You should probably do a bit more research on it.  It's honestly fascinating stuff to me, though I wouldn't call myself a believer at this point.

       Flat earth more or less posits the idea that our entire "universe" as we know it is contained within our atmosphere (or the glass part of a snow globe) and all that is outside of it is nothingness, or the other dimensions of heaven and hell.  That would mean that all the science behind the planets and stars was BS.  It would take us back to being the center of the universe that we know, which would make it extremely difficult to argue for the idea of not having been created by a higher intelligence of some kind.

       As OP, I can say you are right: I just wanted to understand the theory better and see what it's all about.
