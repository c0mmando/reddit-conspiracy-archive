       Pizzagate is not political, it is about pedophiles, human and organ trafficking. It involves both parties.
      </p>

       However it is funny that you subconsciously knew Pizzagate involves one side more than the other.

       Or it is projection from the Putin who still uses those old CIA/KGB blackmail tricks, who benefits from the Russian Mafia who does a lot human trafficking on the West Coast of the U.S. and the Trump camp to steer the spotlight on their pedophilia and connections to big pedophiles. Tony Podesta could be a pedophile no doubt about it, but Besta Pizza and Comet Ping Pong? Come on now lol.

       To be fair, the reasoning behind the 7 countries being banned was because the US doesn't share information with those countries or those countries don't have verifiable records.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it's a good idea to let people into your country when you cannot verify who they are? Is the honor system a good method to immigration and foreign travel?
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally agree that Trump wrote a piece of shit EO, but the point of the EO was not garbage. He just didn't put enough provisions in it to protect green card immigrants, which makes some sense as it was their first kick at the can. A new staff in the white house means there are going to be some learning moments off the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, with that said, I'm surprised how many people are promoting this idea that everyone should be able to come to the USA no matter what, whenever they want, from wherever they want. It's kinda crazy to me. There is middle ground between 'we dont' let anyone in' and 'we let everyone in', but nobody wants to really acknowledge it from my perspective.

       this is exactly the issue here. So few people are catching on to the fact that the main legal issue to date has been how poorly written and planned the whole thing has been. The 9th circuit themselves ruled based on lack of due process, they didn't even bother with the constitutionality of the ban (much less whether it was discriminatory).

       Yep, the problem was the writing of the bill, not necessarily the intent of it. I wouldn't be surprised if that was the republicans trying to take control of Trump from the beginning either and make him feel like he needs them more than he might have. One of Trump's major flaws from their perspective is going to be his lack of experience, and giving him some horseshit bills that get slapped down is a great way of reminding him that he needs some help along the way...

       If you have evidence to support that I'd love to hear it.
      </p>
      <p>
       as a former lawyer the issues that the media (all media, msm and otherwise) are reporting on about this ban are complete nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) a TRO isn't a hearing of the merits of the case, it's a pause button under the merits can be heard. There wouldn't be any point in having a judiciary if the president could do something, and have it done, before the judiciary can hear the case. It's pretty standard for courts to stop a law from going into effect if there's a substantial chance of there being an issue, especially since the travel ban is a temporary measure and may be over before the courts can fully hear it which could be years.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) All the courts to date have focused on the lack of due process inherent in the order. Regardless of your stance on the immigration ban you have to admit that it didn't come with any instructions (the head of homeland security said the same). The ban could be 100% constitutional but no court can let it stand if it doesn't come with instructions on how to make it work.

       I never said I knew any part of the constitution but one state judge and then 3 other appellate judges ruled against it. We'll see if the Supreme Court wants to hear the case or if Trump will change the order but it's gone through the judiciary and they ruled against it that's the way the law works.

According to court documents, after being prevented from boarding an international flight, Abood told FBI agents that he intended to go to Iraq to visit family. Subsequently, Abood left the United States through Mexico and then traveled through various countries to get to Syria to join ISIS.

He was separately indicted on March 17, 2016 for attempting to provide material support to acts of violence overseas. Al-Jayab – a Palestinian born in Iraq – was admitted to the United States as a refugee in 2012. According to the criminal complaint, beginning in October of 2012 – the very same month he first arrived in the United States – Al-Jayab began communicating with numerous individuals about his intention to go to Syria and fight for terrorist organizations. In April 2013, Al-Jayab made multiple statements to another individual (later identified as Omar Faraj Saeed Al Hardan) regarding his experience handling weapons and killing individuals in Syria. In November 2013, just one year after being welcomed to the United States as a refugee, he traveled to Syria and posted on social media that he was fighting with various terrorist organizations, stating “America will not isolate me from my Islamic duty. Only death will do us part.”

The indictment states that he attempted to provide training, expert advice and assistance, and personnel – specifically himself – to a terrorist organization. Al Hardan – a Palestinian born in Iraq – was admitted to the United States as a refugee in 2009, and obtained a green card in 2011. When applying to become a U.S. citizen, he knowingly responded, certified, and swore untruthfully that he was not associated with a terrorist organization when, in fact, he associated with members and sympathizers of ISIS throughout 2014. During an interview in October 2015, Al Hardan falsely represented that he had never received any type of weapons training, when in fact he had received automatic machine gun training. According to media accounts, Al Hardan told his wife “I will go to Syria. I want to blow myself up. . . . I am against America.”

Ibrahim is a native of Somalia who came to the United States as a refugee in 2007 at the age of 22 and subsequently obtained a green card. Ibrahim knowingly lied on his citizenship application and previously lied in his request for refugee status, by falsely claiming that he was of a member of the minority Awer clan in Somalia and subject to persecution by the majority Hawiye clan. Ibrahim was actually a member of the Hawiye clan and not subject to persecution. In fact, according to court documents, “Ibrahim’s family was famous . . . [and] [t]hrough his clan lineage, Ibrahim was related to known Somali terrorists[.]” Ibrahim also admitted he lied on his citizenship application by having previously lied on his refugee application by falsely claiming that he had not provided material support to a terrorist group, when he had in fact provided material support in the form of cash to an Al-Shabaab member.

Pazara, a native of Bosnia who sources indicate came to the United States as a refugee, later obtained a green card and became a citizen in 2013. Pazara was never charged in this case because he is believed to be dead. According to court documents, the others who were indicted provided material support to Pazara, who left the United States to go to Syria and fight with ISIS just 11 days after becoming a citizen. Among other things, Pazara allegedly told an individual about a mission where they “captured a large area, killed eleven individuals, captured one, and added that they intended to slaughter the prisoner the follow[ing] day.” According to press reports, at the time Pazara was purportedly killed in Syria, he was a deputy to one of the top ISIS commanders.

       One of the problems with this list is that it proves that our law enforcement is up to the task of stopping these people before they accomplish any attacks. That's why I think a false flag attack is going to be incoming.

       "bad people have been coming in but we've been totally on top of stopping them" isn't nearly as powerful as "bad people are coming in,

       <p>
        "FBI Director James Comey acknowledged an estimated 900 active investigations pending against suspected Islamic State-inspired operatives and other homegrown violent extremists across the country."
       </p>
       <p>
        U.S. law enforcement officials have sounded more ominous warnings over the growing numbers of suspected homegrown ISIL recruits.
       </p>
       <p>
        "(Islamic State) is fueling an unprecedented tempo for law enforcement authorities combating the homegrown Islamist extremist threat,'' a House Homeland Security Committee threat assessment stated earlier this month, adding that almost 60 people have been arrested so far this year in ISIL-related cases.
       </p>
       <p>
        Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the Homeland Committee's Republican chairman, last week called the Islamist threat a "menace'' that is increasingly challenging the capacity of counterterrorism authorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Comey has been particularly vocal about the potential danger, indicating that earlier this year the bureau redirected "hundreds'' of investigators from criminal cases to deal with the growing national security threat.
