        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have observed an extremely disturbing trend in Reuters articles previous to the inauguration.</p>

<p>Let me ask you, when you hear or read the word &quot;grassy&quot;, what is your immediate thought association?</p>

<p>Every single person I asked this question of today, (12 people) responded in a very similar manner, indicating that the word &quot;grassy&quot; immediately invoked thoughts of &quot;the grassy knoll&quot; having to do with the JFK assassination.</p>

<p>Three articles from Reuters dating January 5th, 18th, and 20th use the word &quot;grassy&quot; when reporting on the inauguration.</p>

<p>When have you EVER read or heard the word &quot;grassy&quot; used in political reporting, other than references to the JFK assassination?</p>

<p>This is intentional. So damn obviously intentional.</p>

<p>I know this sub, for good reason, suggests avoiding links to propaganda sites like Reuters. I have cut and pasted the offending paragraphs from the articles so you don&#39;t have to link, but have links as well just for further proof that I&#39;m not blowing smoke.</p>

<p>January 5th</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agency spokesman Mike Litterst said the Park Service would regain control of permits for the Ellipse, a <strong>grassy</strong> area south of the White House, from the inaugural committee on Jan. 21.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14P2HR">http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14P2HR</a></p>

<p>January 18th</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The DisruptJ20 protest group said it will send groups of demonstrators to the dozen entrances to the <strong>grassy</strong> National Mall where hundreds of thousands of people are expected to gather to watch Trump, who has never before held public office, be sworn in as president on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Friday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1522XQ">http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1522XQ</a></p>

<p>January 20th</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A protest group known as Disrupt J20 has vowed to stage demonstrations at each of 12 security checkpoints and block access to the festivities on the <strong>grassy</strong> National Mall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1531GH">http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1531GH</a></p>

<p>There is a fourth search hit on Google for &quot;Reuters grassy&quot; , search summary saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>https://wwwâ€‹.reuters.com/.../us-usa-trump-... 22 hours ago ... About 900,000 people were expected to pack central Washington, including the <strong>grassy</strong> National Mall ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But when you link to the article, that phrase is not contained within it, despite it being in the search summary.</p>

<p>However, that exact phrase from the Reuters summary, &quot;About 900,000 people were expected to pack central Washington, including the grassy National Mall&quot;, when entered into a search engine, does yield many other news sites using that exact phrase in their articles.</p>

<p>This is the repeated use of a rarely used word which most Americans immediately associate with assassination. This word is so rarely used in other instances of reporting that I must conclude that Reuters is intentionally trying to draw some distasteful parallels.</p>

<p>Seriously, how often does anyone use the word &quot;grassy&quot; when NOT talking about that damn knoll? My point is that Reuters is using the word in an odd manner, <strong>in three different articles within a 2 week span</strong>, all having to do with the inauguration. The way they use the phrase the &quot;grassy National Mall&quot; is contrived, and the adjective is entirely superfluous to the information being presented. It is subtle, but it is an odd place to insert the word.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no reason for them to get oddly descriptive in these instances, especially considering the context and subject matter. It seems completely extraneous, and sticks out like a pile of shit on a linoleum floor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhhhhhm... No. Sorry.</p>

<p>The MSM that may seem to advocate for his assassination were the ones that were asking &quot;What if Trump dies? Who&#39;d take over?&quot;</p>

<p>In any case, the MSM are Trump&#39;s friends, despite what is shown, because they gave him 5 billion in free advertising, Hillary only received half that amount.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are friends by the circumstances you describe and only in that way.

<p>Wikileaks showed requests to the News Media to <em>elevate</em> Trump&#39;s campaign months before he even announced as candidate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care about what &quot;every white lady wearing a pussy hat&quot; thinks, really. All the BS in the US is just that - BS.</p>

<p>The Dem supporters turn a blind eye to everything that Obama and Hillary did, and the Rep supporters turn a blind eye to everything that Trump did. The American masses are basically all the same, the only difference is the team, the colour. But ultimately, they are all united under the BS idea of &quot;American Exceptionalism&quot; - America can kill everyone they want and it&#39;s good because it&#39;s for democracy, and everyone that does not like America are just jealous.</p>

<p>Pathetic, but true.</p>

<p>That has nothing to do with my initial post here. It is a fact that Trump received 5 billion in free advertising and Hillary received half that.</p>

<p>Often enough that you&#39;d need to show more than just that to convince me that it was deliberate (especially as Ian Simpson is credited as a writer on all three articles - maybe he just uses the word more than most). Few examples (no particular order, emphasis added):</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been seeing this from all angles, not just Reuters. It is intentional. Some of it is subliminal and some of it is out in the open. They are using &quot;grassy&quot; subliminally for sure. Whether it is the writers themselves or an editor doing it, someone made the choice to use that adjective several times.</p>

<p>All these twisted fucks need is one dumbass on insert_pharma_drug_here to capitulate on the thoughts that keep being programmed into his head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible that they are using subliminal messaging often in there headlines/articles, but these are just examples of shoddy writing ability.</p>

<ul>
<li>Journalists are not good writers. They use practically meaningless superlative in almost every sentence, such as &quot;the delightfully superb music displayed on that foreshadowing, seemingly distant day which the boisterous, much maligned President, was charming....&quot;, Just to say &quot;the Presidential Inauguration music was good.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<p>It increases their word count and makes the article seem worthy of perusal as it&#39;s long enough to make you believe you&#39;re reading something new, and not too long to seem like a mammoth task. They generally keep within a word limit which they need to reach on these mass media sites as the masses are just like that.</p>

<p>Compare &quot;the grassy clearing in which the flag-draped, most patriotic podium stood, was overshadowed by the towering, almost knuckle-dragging figure that took position slowly, and eagerly behind it.&quot; with &quot;the President stepped behind the podium in the clearing.&quot;</p>

<p>The most annoying thing is when a old fashioned, practically dead word comes back in vogue for the year and you start to see it fucking everywhere. Such as &quot;the Gameboy and others of its ilk&quot;, usually poorly used with particle confusion in the syntax because NOBODY FUCKiNG USES it anYMORe!!!!!!!!!! </p>

<p>Let me ask you, when you hear or read the word &quot;grassy&quot;, what is your immediate thought association?</p>

<p>I think of an area with a lot of grass. My front yard. A random field. A park. Just, something grassy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right. I posted this in two other subs a few weeks ago, and the title in those posts used the phrase &quot;associate the idea of assassination with Trump&quot;. I was running out of online time and quickly tossed in this title. I&#39;ll fix it, thank you.</p>
