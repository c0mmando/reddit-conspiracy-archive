       Perhaps they should be pressured to "volunteer" for reconstruction projects in the countries destroyed by the war on terrorism. I wouldn't mind being involved in such projects myself.

       I believe it lowers the emotional and spiritual development of the one who commits or supports the act. Violence only has a place in situations of necessity such as a revolutionary war, not as a preferred form of vengeance.

       ...of the mind, yes! There is literally nothing else to fight. Who are we gonna shoot to save the problem? Violent revolution achieves far less than what we could hope for, history has shown that often enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a revolution of the mind, all of our minds, and it's happening, right, fucking, now. "There has been an awakening, have you felt it?" Prophetic words for our times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm having conversations about propaganda and manipulation with people who were comfortably asleep all their lives all of a sudden, and I feel they are pissed, and desperate for some sanity in this world, the only struggle now is to imagine another way of living that isn't this, that isn't war and isn't unnecessary scarcity, but we're getting there.
      </p>
      <p>
       We understand that we can do better, once the truth is on the table. And I mean all of it. Every child knows there's more to this world, we all feel it and hurt for it, but nobody talks about it because we're made to feel alone. Only once everyone knows that everyone knows what has really been going on will we be able to regain control of ourselves and our visions and dreams and our unhindered thoughts. That's the revolution we truly require. Everything else becomes easy once we clear our minds of false assumptions and stride boldly into a future among the stars, ever thankful for the grace of the earth which has allowed us to flourish and grow so patiently.

       It depends if you hold any philosophies. I don't think we should necessarily harm them, but l think we need to study them, under strict securitym See what and why their brain ticks that way so we can hopefully prevent others from turning into them

       When I first started digging into it all, I did want vengeance. I wanted to see people taken off in hand cuffs with my own eyes. I wanted to see them all on trial and see each and every one of their downfalls. Hell, I'll admit that at one point I may have enjoyed watching these demons literally burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now? I honestly don't care. I just want this darkness to ultimately stop. Even if for some reason, this evilness in the world coming to halt didn't involve these people to physically suffer on earth, I am okay with that as long as long as it STOPS. Yes, I would prefer a public outing but it's not the first thing on my mind or at the top of my list anymore. I believe in karma and they will ultimately get what they deserve. I just want order to be restored and for us to able to win this battle over evil.

       There is more to life than direct capital punishment. They sold their souls for immediate gain, they violated natural laws for their own benefit. They know they did it at a cost, whether it is the angry mob that immediately inflict it upon them or them being reborn as a cockroach it will come to them. There is no need for us to exacerbate it as the more we convince them that we are irrational and vengeful, the more they will fight to hide it. We don't need to add much extra punishment upon the mountains and mountains they already have headed their way.

       I don't even think just the people who aided the cover-up should be held accountable.. if you are in the media and you ignored it or just assumed it was crazy talk you should pay some kind of price. I mean it's not like there is no evidence of high level people being involved in this.. it's been being shown for years and years and years. The media has a responsibility. Law enforcement has a responsibility. If they ignored it for any reason,  what they have done is almost as heinous as the actual pedos.

       There was a time when I dreamed of spilling rivers blood in a fit of righteous revenge. Not anymore. To do so would make me every bit as evil as them. It may sound cliche, but for any progress to ever be made we cannot fall to their level. It is a very hard pill to swallow, but we would have to try and forgive them. That's not to say they couldn't be punished, but the punishment would have to be humane.

       Drain their bank accounts. Force them fix any destruction they have caused. Change policy on media and law enforcement. Media needs to be controlled by the people as a check on the government and privately owned by individuals not corporations. Law enforcement works for us as a check on the elite not the other way around. All governmental communications should be monitored by citizen owned group in order to prevent corruption. They have lost our trust and should be treated as such.

       Seriously, it should be illegal to amass billions of dollars. The only way that can happen is if they are paying their employees less than their fair share of the profits. Unless of course, people simply work for purpose of making a few people rich.

       Furthermore, they should have to return the stolen money to the people. It's insane that they can just drain the country as dry as they can with their businesses.

       All of their life savings are forfeited and used to improve the quality of life for the world. Just the Rothschild's family savings would be enough to fix up china's air quality. Use it for research into medicine and renewable energy. While it wouldn't last too long, it's more the sentiment in this case.

       They aren't killed, but rather are forced to work minimum wage jobs with no government support nor help from others. They couldn't save money and they couldn't have any insurance.

       I would say that all the laws regarding the punishment of accomplices and accessories to any crime should be fully applied to anyone that obviously was, and that we pay no more attention to the fact they any may claim they were only following orders than was paid to those that said the same thing in their defence in the Nuremberg trials. These are crimes against humanity in no uncertain terms and deserve to be treated as such.

       A grand public trial. Minimum sentence 50 years. For politicians, life sentence in solitary confinement. Journalists and other people of influence who colluded with politicians should be given life sentences as well. People who were found to have directly murdered or raped children should be sent to a special type of prison with minimal/no human contact.

       The truth has already come out and nothing happened. In Europe after 9/11, just days later, there were reports and videos showing all the discrepancies and confusions of the attack from the footage seen that day. There was no need to state the plain truth for even a photo says a thousand words. 16 years have passed. Has justice prevailed?

       All the foreign intelligence agencies saw a controlled demolition on TV and knew what was up. That was sold as a terrorist attack to the public.  Then GWB came with the treat: "If you're not with us, then you're with the terrorists."
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the US is willing to perform such an attack on its own people, what will they do unto other countries? So, keeping in line with the US narrative is then the most prudent way.

       And when is this supposed to come out?  I keep hearing tons of speculation and a lot of people pushing the "IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOON!" narrative, but nothing has happened so far in regards to the high profile arrests people have been talking about.  When should we expect these?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to be clear I'm not saying this stuff is all lies nor is it 100% true, I'm just asking for the timetable.  People talk about fatigue in regards to the news, and this stuff is similar.  Sure these rallying cries that constantly get posted here are great for true believers, but those of us who are on the fence about many of the claims will start to feel like we're being led on/manipulated.  Some of us are skeptical and know that Reddit in general is being bombarded by shills from many different angles/agendas/sources, so constant promises of "soon" with no delivery makes it feel like someone is trying to manipulate visitors through repetition instead of proof.

       A giant public trial, using the RICO act to catch any stragglers who were only "kinda" involved. Sentenced by a jury, with the perps receiving maximum/most extreme available punishments/sentences. News stations (and production companies) that in any way pushed against public or private investigation of pedogate should be fined, and thoroughly investigated. All "journalists" that were involved would be banned from tv and radio for life. It must be as public as possible- it would need to be presented to the public as what it is: a history and future changing event. 
Or else it could happen again.

       Hmm, they should have a month of daily meet and greets. Force them to look into the eyes of people they have hurt, hear their words. The worst of them are sent to "Deplorable Island" out in the middle of nowhere. Everyone should know what they've done so they can't even make eye contact without seeing disgust. That oughta do. 
(seriously though, bring their crimes to light and serve justice. That would be fantastic)
