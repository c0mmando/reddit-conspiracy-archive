        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Money is Bad Design.  I&#39;m going to explain why.  </p>

<p>Money is a proxy to Value, in that the value of something is determined by how much money someone is willing to exchange for it.  Thus, the value of something will change depending upon the purchaser, and what they are willing to pay.  This leads to the phenomenon of the &quot;The People With the Most Money&quot; determining value of things because they set market price, as they have the most money to spend.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania</a> is a canonical example of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>What this means in practice is that the &quot;Producers of Money&quot; will tend to be the &quot;Arbiters of Market Value&quot;, because, oddly enough, the &quot;Producers of Money&quot; tend to have the most money.   What a surprise!</p>

<p>Essentially what money does is make a very small set of actors become the determiners of the value of things.  Think about that.</p>

<p>Why is such an arrangement Bad Design?  </p>

<p>For starters, Human Values, or what humans value tends to stay the same.  It doesn&#39;t really change much.  Most of us want shelter, food, love, care, friendship, etc.  The relative values of these things to most people will tend stay the same.  And the spectrum of human values will tend to stay the same, as well.  </p>

<p>The Bad Design arises when we use money as the determiner of the price of Human Values.  Human Values don&#39;t change, but whoever has the most money can decide what they are worth.  The &quot;value&quot; of Human Values is thus easily changeable by very few actors.  </p>

<p>Letting a handful of people decide what Human Values are worth is an Absolute Dictatorship.  </p>

<p>Human Value Systems need to divorce themselves from Monetary Systems, or We will forever continue to be led by a handful of Broken Heroes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think in the past, the Jews had no prohibition against lending money, but others did; I don&#39;t remember all of the details but I think there is also a history of different cultures shunning the Jews and making it difficult for them to find jobs and support their families. If these conditions resulted in Jews frequently becoming involved in the world of finance, that is not a terribly surprising outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a completely unrelated note relating to Jews, some of their design lessons are really awesome.  Their language, by giving letters numbers, is akin to the advent of names.  It predates names, in a design sense.  I find a lot of the stuff I myself figure out often has some analog in Jew stuff.  Weird eh?  Given the design lessons around things like Wholism, that is also found in all the Saturnian religions (or basically all human religions of note, more or less) I don&#39;t see the Jews as particularly evil either.  I think their culture has kept knowledge.  </p>

<p>I have an open mind about all the suspicions, as I have an open mind about most hypotheses, but from a design standpoint, Jews are pretty cool.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s not achievable by one, then you scale out.  You collectivize until you have &quot;collective self-reliance&quot;.  And continue in that fashion.  Like a spiral growing outwards.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree except that money is part of the evolutionary process however we have surpassed its usefulness. The only alternative to money is Sacred Economics. </p>

<p>Right now, money has become a conspiracy since it is so easily vacuumed up by the elite. They are kind enough to leave some so the world keep moving but they take all they can. </p>

<p>We should be working for each other for free like in the Sacred Economics value. It would make life a whole lot easier and make the world go round.</p>

<p>Some common problems with the usage of money today:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Criminals, cartels, gangs, bankers, and elite trying to absorb it all by doing terrible things. These terrible acts lead to more money but without the money, there is in incentive to be a gang banger like Rothschild. </p></li>
<li><p>People do things that are outside of their best interest for money. For example, someone might steal, cheat, or join terrible groups like CTR. </p></li>
<li><p>Money forces us to use lots of land, people, and resources to maintain the money system. These things include banks, accountants, police, small claims courts, and many other systems designed to administer money. All of those jobs can be cut and the people can do something else that enhances quality of life for all. </p></li>
<li><p>Many people suffer from mental illness and drug abuse because of the enormous financial pressure applied onto society. This leads to mental hospitals, over-packed prisons, and broken families. </p></li>
<li><p>Many dangerous items are brought into the marketplace for the sake of profit. These items include drugs, fattening foods and terrible foods, and outright garbage that ends up being thrown away. Sometimes people create items that are NOT designed to last so that the consumer can keep spending and so it eats up massive amounts of resources as well. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The list goes on and on. Money is like Pandoras box. It was used as a bridge to get people to work which is good but now people are used to working and are ready to move beyond money and into a more productive work lifestyle. The end game is simply to increase quality of life for all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great comment!</p>

<p>I agree that it was an evolutionary step.  </p>

<p>I basically look at money and capitalism as a way of showing humanity how some designs translate into greater common good.  We&#39;ve actually accomplished a lot over the last 200 years because of a somewhat-common monetary system.  We were shown that if we collectively arrange our actions we can accomplish whatever we want.  The question then becomes how do We steer?  And that&#39;s where the Money Hero Monoculture thins out our collective capacity.  It&#39;s time for a new design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Historically (thousands up thousands of years ago), people were so primitive they couldn&#39;t figure out why they had to work. Many of these old school workers were involved in hunting and agriculture but they were primitive. Eventually, we figured out how to get people to work. Later we taught people how to work fast instead of dragging their asses. </p>

<p>Now, almost everyone is willing to work if the pay is right. That step is established. </p>

<p>And now, we have to teach them how to keep working if we use the new economic model found below:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs</a></p>

<p>The biggest selling point of this model is that it is the most lavish, it eliminates many wasteful jobs, and it offers people to follow their passions whether that be making gardens for the homeless or cleaning up the streets with a broom. Now that people won&#39;t have to worry about the profit motive, they can do things like that which typically don&#39;t have a financial profit motive but they do have quality of life enhancements attached to them. </p>

<p>Here is a small video explaining how it works:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im curious though, would a society based on this model be functional if everyone only desired appealing work and labor over work in the  agricultural and power sectors?

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first, we will need our men and women of lesser skill to work. Some people can&#39;t speak English and or simply have a lack of skills. A man in a wheelchair can be some kind of a watch guard. A low skill person can work in mcdonalds without issue. </p>

<p>There will also be a new set of feelings and motivations that will quickly creep up into the American psyche. First, they will become aware that what they are doing is helping the world in the fairest way possible. Even if they work at mcdonalds, they can still feel important and fortunate because they know this is a group, nationwide effort. Some people are low notes. Some high but all equally important in a way. Someone has to work at mcdonalds. If there are openings, we can create recruiter groups to recruit people for jobs. In this case, I would target teenagers or people in their twenties. At the end of the day, the whole country will be one enterprise and all working men and women will feel a sense of teamwork and belonging. We can all be on the same page for once. </p>

<p>Also, many people will eventually volunteer for the crappy jobs and be honored for it. A man who picks up the trash will be respected for it. These hard jobs will be looked at with honor and many people love the feeling of being honored and so they will volunteer. Of course, this mentality will seep into the American psyche by end of year but not immediately. </p>

<p>We will be a giant American enterprise. We share all secrets because we all benefit from the fortune of others. This will do away with the &quot;every man for himself&quot; problem that pure competition promotes. Cooperation will be the name of the game but we will still compete in our sciences, sports, inventions, etc.. Those who can make life easier for all will be revered as heroes. This newfound cooperation will bring a sense of long needed security among the people for 2 reasons. First, there will never be a financial problem ever again. We might have some resource problems but those are much easier to solve since all of us are working in unison to solve pr</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm I understand that it&#39;s a hypothetical, it just doesn&#39;t seem very feasible to me that people born today and later into a world where you can get anything quickly by throwing currency at it will readily accept free labor.. Sure we can strip currency but how do we strip value from things people want? I feel like in this system there will be no variance in quality spurred on by competition for consumer interest... People born today and later won&#39;t stop wanting finer things, most things of high quality require fine/rare components... Technology, jewelry, art, manufacturing all require rare, expensive, and limited components.. It sounds like in your proposed theory competition must be spurred on by basis of earned honor and gratitude if I understand correctly? Perhaps on the other hand quality may improve as hobbies and trade skills are more readily taken up, and effort is put into quality of work again... but in general your theory sounds pleasing but even for a hypothetical I see it being platformed on too many assumptions, the unforeseen implications seem to build the more I dwell on arsing issues... But it would be very pleasant and utopian if people could be brought to the same page and issues were addressed..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s  perfectly fine to want quality. Keep in mind, there is an average quality that is acceptable. For example, a tuna salad is great and cheap in resources. We can still have our lobster but if we overconsume lobster, we will have to wait for the resources to refill again. It would be in our best interest to educate ourselves on responsible consumption. What we don&#39;t need are the cheap and very expensive things. All that cheap junk is made of our resources. Nobody ever buys this junk but some there are a lot of desperate people scavenging the economy. The more expensive stuff like giant mansions should be done away with to save space and resource. </p>

<p>In the end, when the people are ready to finally cooperate on our common goal of increased quality of life, then they will be ready for this system. I think we are close so I drop a seed here and there so people think about the idea. That way, once we are ready, some of us will already be aware of this alternative to capitalism which has been corrupted by the elite. We can still play around with money but it&#39;s always caused endless problems. There are many ups and downs with money and for many, it&#39;s always down and so they waste their lives away suffering endlessly with nobody who can help them. Some of the giant cities are where you see the most desperate of people who need relief asap. These people go on for decades in shambles and a large portion of the population is in this boat. This clearly means the system is failing us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The consumers can have all they want. It would be a matter of converting the system slowly so that it goes smoothly. </p>

<p>First, the workers of the country would have to commit to working most any job with the advice of following a passion and to do it for free. </p>

<p>Second, we would have to educate them on the glory and honor of work. We would have to make connections on how 300 million people can raise quality of life for all. Also, this would mean that we all rise and drop together so income inequality is solved. </p>

<p>Third, we would have to teach the people on how to work and consume responsibly. The workers have to stop wasting time on expensive, time/resource consuming projects like building Bentleys and focus their attention on powerful products that can last for a very long time. For example, the Ipad is pretty spot on. It doesn&#39;t take much time or resources. The Ipad would have to be better built to last so that we don&#39;t waste resources on rebuilding. Right now, people hold off the good technology and they milk the market. For example, the Ipad 1 was heavy and bulky. They should have came out with the best right off the bat. It would save on resources. </p>

<p>4th. We would have to teach the people how cooperation would be a new aspect in the economy since we no longer have to keep business secrets from each other. Since we all rise and fall together, it is in our best interest to share all of our business secrets so that we can create a more efficient economy. Can you imagine how far humanity would evolve if we all shared out secrets to success with each other?</p>

<p>This is the general idea. Whatever it is, its always best to ease into it so that the economy doesn&#39;t strain as massive changes are made. That can lead to even more problems and so it has to be done bit by bit so people can get used to the new changes and adjust at a reasonable rate. </p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does one count anything? ... How does society manage the Commons?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideally there would be a representation between money and available natural resources.  Resources are finite.  So too should our money be to reflect that.  That&#39;s why inflation makes so little sense, because that connection is lost, and our monetary instruments don&#39;t reflect earth&#39;s available resources.  It leads to wasteful consumption and human behavior that doesn&#39;t make sense in macro relative to the earth.</p>

<p>I still think money as a tool makes sense.  It just needs to be the right money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand what you&#39;re asking.  It seems strange to have a currency backed by &quot;nothing&quot; and where no one is in charge.  But that&#39;s precisely what the open source code achieves by aligning economic incentives of network participants to achieve decentralized consensus.  The token (e.g. bitcoin) trades for real world fiat or goods and services.  Its price is determined solely by supply and demand.  Demand is based on speculation and utility (instantly transmit money across the world for low fees without asking permission).  Supply is governed  by the protocol to release new tokens at a predetermined rate.  The Bitcoin blockchain has been functional for 8 years now and has experienced consistent exponential growth in number of transactions to date which you can see for yourself at <a href="https://blockchain.info/charts">blockchain.info</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consuming and quality of life improvements like 3D printing and robot workers is a must. All we have to do is to stop wasting our resources, space, and time. </p>

<p>Resources - We don&#39;t need heavy resource eaters like making bentlies or even making junk items. Most of these items are made for profit but without cash, this stuff disappears. </p>

<p>Space - There are so many empty homes and so much homelessness. Without money or profit motive, we can give or build everyone a home and so homelessness disappears. </p>

<p>Time - Countless companies can&#39;t afford stock and so they lose many days before they have the money for that stock. This is a waste of time plus customers will have to drive to another store which wastes time and duel. Also, since we use money, people are sending jobs to china and so it takes months to get merchandise. We can make this stuff inside the US and save tons on fuel and time. </p>

<p>We need hard numbers on our resources and they need to be publicized. If we overconsume wood, for example, them we all agree to try to avoid wood consumption when possible until our resources refill. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about cooperation and the enetertainment of human progress is a lot more fun than consuming so that alone can bring some balance. </p>

<p>To top things off, they are holding 30 years worth of technology if not more. Once we release that, humans will have a lot more free time doing what they love most. </p>

<p>Again, great topic OP and one that needs to be seen a lot more given the circumstances the US dollar and us by extension finding ourselves in a very precarious situation regarding the American dollar as the lead currency. </p>

<p>What kind of solutions should be taken and how do we adapt to it, I&#39;m not sure about crypto currency as it appears to be nothing more then digits in a system and has no physical value backing it. Who writes and controls the coding to put it altogether and can they be trusted. </p>

<p>I personally like the idea of going back to community and possibly state issues currencies that only come from local economies and held by local banks, centralized banks hold to much power for my taste. Either that or backing the US dollar on something else. Lot of things to discuss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a great post. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you what...when I was younger (10 years ago) I was much more financially well off. The reason being is that I had that younger 20s motivation and didn&#39;t really put my morals and values first. Now here I am in my mid 30s and I am struggling more than ever even though I have a decent job, 1 rental property,etc. and the reason for that is because I now have prioritized my values and morals whereas before I didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I still strive for financial freedom but I personally find it harder when you cherish a guilt free conscience. </p>

<p>True. However practically impossible to do. We need a medium of exchange to exchange our value which is procured by our time spent here on earth. Monetary system of central control will always leech from the bottom upwards. However new monetary systems are arising due to the demand for the hive mind of humans to exchange without restriction and freely. Those monetary systems start with Crypto-currencies(such as bitcoin), decentralized in nature and with a real free market decided by the people in contrast to the fiat system which is enforced upon us by a monopoly on violence held by our governments. </p>

<p>Unless you are arguing for abolishing private property, money is an excellent tool to manage private property exchange and capital savings.</p>

<p>Since it is a tool that makes certain transactions easier, it also makes abuses of power resulting from those transactions easier. And I think it is those abuses of power that we need to talk about, not blaming it on money itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re bringing up a design mistake that happened years ago and was rolled into policy - private ownership of the Commons.  Also there&#39;s another issue with the design of ownership (it&#39;s hierarchical) such that &quot;spawn of things owned&quot; also fall under the umbrella of ownership.  Hierarchical design is Bad Design, btw, but that&#39;s another discussion.  Anyway, because of this umbrella of ownership issue, lots of abuses happen in the name of property.  By this policy, one just has to go far back up the parent tree, so to speak, to find the real Owners.  I&#39;m pretty sure the establishment and all of the dickheads who are supporting the private property concept DON&#39;T WANT THE REAL OWNERS FOUND.  If you go far enough up, you&#39;re into non-human territory.  Capische?  </p>

<p>This issue does illustrate another significant problem with how We design things.  Which is the issue of rolling back bad designs.  This can be done if you design things Decoratively. But if you adhere to Hierarchical Design, you&#39;re pretty much fucked, as you introduce brittleness that can&#39;t ever be fixed.  Such are the design mistakes Humanity has made and will need to be fixed.  </p>

<p>The private property issue, in other words, is dead.  Whether owners know this or not is irrelevant to the design reality.</p>

<p>Think about this..... imagine an automated country with products built by automated robots and distributed free to every citizen, self driving taxi type cars available to everyone for free. People growing and producing food as a hobby etc. Basically everything is free and anything not automated is done by hobbyists (tv entertainment, music etc). Now imagine the average family, they just exist, they spend time together and do stuff everyday maybe walk in the park or go to the movies or something. What is the point?

<p>My point is do we not need aims and goals? With no money there is nothing to aim for, nothing to achieve. Money is a reward, a number for people to measure their own progression, it gives people purpose and an aim that I think is part of basic human nature.</p>

One of the top posts on this thread goes into what a common monetary system has enabled society to accomplish in terms of increasing the capacity of individuals.  The fruits of labour, lol.  The thing is, what we currently have doesn&#39;t manifest our capacity as well as other approaches, because it steals time.  It can be done better.  A monetary system will never be able to maximize this because it puts power in the hands of a few, and this is antithetical to &quot;how high the tide is for all boats&quot; if that makes any sense.    </p>

<p>You paint a bleak picture of your own existence if you really don&#39;t know what you would do without a master cracking a whip over your back. </p>

<p>Actually, no. Once you reach a goal, you need a new one. What we really &quot;need&quot; is a <em>purpose</em>. Huge difference. </p>

<p>Money is the worst incentive one can think of, as proven by those who are &quot;rewarded&quot; by today&#39;s money - for polluting the environment, inciting wars, causing famines and enslaving humanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Inflation is a weird subject.  I&#39;m no expert on it, that&#39;s for sure.  Zero inflation <em>does</em> however run into what that Paul Krugman describes as the &quot;babysitter chit hoarding&quot; problem or some shit.  His description of the mechanism makes total sense, whatever else you might think of the guy.  This phenomenon is probably why near zero inflation theory is popular and manifested in monetary policy.  </p>

<p>Generally speaking I don&#39;t think Human Values need a market.  I think they should be divorced from currency completely.  There are collective considerations that supercede money such as the Common Good.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money works in the domain of real estate because the price for land fluctuates.  It doesn&#39;t work in the domain of things that reflect Human Values.  It can&#39;t ever work in this domain.  </p>

<p>If money allows for people to be underserved by society in basic ways such that they <em>can&#39;t</em> (note the specificity of the term can&#39;t) meet their potential (and it clearly does) it&#39;s a destruction of The Commons.  If we have a Commons at all.  If we don&#39;t have a Commons then what&#39;s the point of government?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm I understand that it&#39;s a hypothetical, it just doesn&#39;t seem very feasible to me that people born today and later into a world where you can get anything quickly by throwing currency at it will readily accept free labor.. Sure we can strip currency but how do we strip value from things people want? I feel like in this system there will be no variance in quality spurred on by competition for consumer interest... People born today and later won&#39;t stop wanting finer things, most things of high quality require fine/rare components... Technology, jewelry, art, manufacturing all require rare, expensive, and limited components.. It sounds like in your proposed theory competition must be spurred on by basis of earned honor and gratitude if I understand correctly? Perhaps on the other hand quality may improve as hobbies and trade skills are more readily taken up, and effort is put into quality of work again... but in general your theory sounds pleasing but even for a hypothetical I see it being platformed on too many assumptions, the unforeseen implications seem to build the more I dwell on arsing issues... But it would be very pleasant and utopian if people could be brought to the same page and issues were addressed..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re bringing up a design mistake that happened years ago and was rolled into policy - private ownership of the Commons.  Also there&#39;s another issue with the design of ownership (it&#39;s hierarchical) such that &quot;spawn of things owned&quot; also fall under the umbrella of ownership.  Hierarchical design is Bad Design, btw, but that&#39;s another discussion.  Anyway, because of this umbrella of ownership issue, lots of abuses happen in the name of property.  By this policy, one just has to go far back up the parent tree, so to speak, to find the real Owners.  I&#39;m pretty sure the establishment and all of the dickheads who are supporting the private property concept DON&#39;T WANT THE REAL OWNERS FOUND.  If you go far enough up, you&#39;re into non-human territory.  Capische?  </p>

<p>This issue does illustrate another significant problem with how We design things.  Which is the issue of rolling back bad designs.  This can be done if you design things Decoratively. But if you adhere to Hierarchical Design, you&#39;re pretty much fucked, as you introduce brittleness that can&#39;t ever be fixed.  Such are the design mistakes Humanity has made and will need to be fixed.  </p>

<p>The private property issue, in other words, is dead.  Whether owners know this or not is irrelevant to the design reality.</p>
