    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s enough for you? A government thought project? </p>

<p>The intel community has interns come up with theories like Northwoods everyday as thought experiments to run preparation and alternate scenarios. It&#39;s what think tanks do. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be disappointed if the government didn&#39;t think of this. There is still a landslide of evidence to overcome, not to mention...</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a single verifiable witness. It has been 16 years. You really think there isn&#39;t a disgruntled person who would have leaked the conspiracy? There was no Snowden leaker, no foot solider with a change of heart, no official who discovers a conscience? </p>

<p>Instead of concerning yourself with suppositions, look at the lack of people. It would take <em>thousands</em> of people to pull the conspiracy off. There has never been a covert op of that size which stayed covert. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Please provide evidence that Russia got the bomb because the Manhattan Project was not secure. </p>

<p>How about Operation Paperclip? How many people kept Nazi scientists working in the states secret?</p>

<p>Your whole point about the size leading to a leak does not take into account that organizations have developing methods to get large projects done with only a few realizing the scale of a project. Compartmentalization is just one small technique used. </p>

<p>As for the first part... how naive are you? This is the whole argument for Pearl Harbor been allowed by FDR. I don&#39;t believe that one, but I&#39;m pretty sure the Maine exploded on it&#39;s own and the US just ran with it for their own purposes</p>

<p>So wait you said that the intelligence agencies make models to help brainstorm defense strategies.</p>

<p>Operation Northwood was an attempt to provide a justification for millitary action against Cuba.  Did Cuba threaten our survival?  The activity of planning a &#39;terror campaign&#39; in Miami area to blame the Cubans. Is not an act to justify a defensive war. It is a deception to further someones interest.  That interest and the safety of the citizenry are not aligned.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Cuba did not pose an existential threat. </p>

<p>There are 3 things in classical war theory that are its causes. Fear of the population, defense of the population, or interest.  This was pure interest. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The citizens through deliberative processes and proper channels decide to go to war. No president should have the ability to wage war for any reason, unless declared by Congress. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would you rather the US loses NYC and Boston to first strike nukes (potentially 60 million lost) , or, if you are the FBI, do you make a feint on a city and kill 40 citizens? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not a utilitarian. The correct course is to have a deliberation by the citizenry, and the citizenry can decide whether to go to war or not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t want my government intending to do these things. I do want them preparing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are talking about a plan where the government was going to create a spectacle to justify military action. You know, be the aggressor.  Something that is prohibited by international law, and which is unethical. It is even worse than that, it shows complete disregard for international law by attempting to create a loophole to justify a war of aggression.  A government that does that, is not a legitimate government. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, if your argument is that there is a justified cause to 9-11 by invading Iraq/whatever, don&#39;t you think they would have put more reasonable evidence to solidify the intent?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? The State Department made it clear in 2001 that the Taliban would be held collectively responsible for any terror attack by anyone affiliated. </p>

<p>September 11th happened.</p>

<p>We invaded Afghanistan to stop the Taliban.  Moreover the talk of a &#39;Pearl Harbor&#39; like event was discussed by foreign policy institutes as justifying Americas dominance.  They used precisely the impetus that was hoped for in Project North-Wood.  People were angry and shocked, and the invasion was easy to sell. </p>

<p>They did not fuck up the war. The DOD and related contractors made out like bandits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. So, I don&#39;t get into <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fisking">fisking</a> arguments. Nothing says a person is unreasonable then what you just did, which is </p>

<p>YOU ARE WRONG AND HERE IS A THOUSAND POINT BREAKDOWN OF EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID. </p>

<p>If you disagree with me. Fine. Just say so. But fuck this <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a> argument bullshit. You aren&#39;t a lawyer and this isn&#39;t a court case. You don&#39;t get to command the dialogue by countering every single sentence. Build a goddamn case with an argument, don&#39;t try to split out everything. </p>

<p>I have absolutely no interest in doing point-by-point mass arguments. You have opened up 15 different arguments. What are you trying to accomplish? And, more to the point, what does this have to do with the original point? </p>

<p>My original hypothesis was that I don&#39;t believe that 9-11 is a conspiracy because there isn&#39;t a single person who would have been on the inside who has come forward. </p>

<p>And at best, you roundly dismiss it with &quot;Compartmentalization.&quot; So you skip over it because it&#39;s not of interest to you. </p>

<p>You ask for sources but don&#39;t source anything. You make sweeping generalizations. You misappropriate victors of a government cabal by those who are in the military industrial complex... as if that&#39;s somehow a viable source of capital. But I would have to do exactly what you have done here to even get back to the point, because you wasted 1000 words on side tangents. </p>

<p>No offense, I have no interest in replying further. I&#39;m not your argument monkey, here so you can fisk everything I say. </p>

<p>Your proposition:  If there is a large conspiracy then someone would spill the beans is false. </p>

<p>This is evidenced by the Manhattan Project and Operation Paperclip. </p>

<p>It is also evidenced by internal mechanism of which compartmentalization is one. </p>

<p>I though we were discussing project Northwood. If you were not familiar with it let me source:</p>

<p>On just war theory:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proschema (plural proschemata) is the equivalent Greek term, first popularized by Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian War. The proschemata are the stated reasons for waging war, which may or may not be the same as the real reasons, which Thucydides called prophasis (πρóφασις). Thucydides argued that the three primary real reasons for waging war are reasonable fear, honor, and interest, while the stated reasons involve appeals to nationalism or fearmongering (as opposed to descriptions of reasonable, empirical causes for fear).</p>

<p>Ok let us narrow it down: Was project Northwood a model to justify a defensive war or a plan to justify an invasion of a Sovereign country? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t tend to believe anything the government says 100% about something of this magnitude. </p>

<p>Do I believe their narrative for the most part? Probably, because nothing else seems to be close in competence. </p>

<p>I believe a bunch of pissed off Saudis and radicalized Jihadis hickjacked a plane and crashed them into the Pentagon and Twin Towers? Yes. </p>

<p>Do I believe tower 7 fell on its own? Yes. I know everyone uses that and the free fall speeds as a gateway drug into this, but no. I believe that there was substantial debris and fire that hit the building from the twin towers collapsing. </p>

<p>Do I believe flight 93 crashed due to passengers rushing the cockpit? Probably, but it also seems highly likely it was shot down by US jets. </p>

<p>I think Bush incompetently overlooked the intel he was given, and if Gore was in office (or if Clintons term ended in say 03 instead of 01) that there is a 70% chance the attack wouldn&#39;t have happened. I think he was so much more obsessed with Iraq that he missed the real goal. </p>

<p>Is my mind closed on it? No. But until there is an insider or a leak proving more, the government narrative is close enough. Too many people stand to gain from it being revealed as a cover up to have not come forward. The absence of insider evidence or cracks opposed to a mass narrative of presupposed shady dealings is where rationale ends. </p>

<p>I imagine you&#39;ll claim that they aren&#39;t &quot;insider&quot; enough, but why would you think the people that would have that type of information would have more to gain from releasing that information? If they aren&#39;t directly gaining from it, wouldn&#39;t they have much more to lose by coming out (their life)? Do you want Cheney to come out and say it or something? </p>

<p>Saying the US didn&#39;t commit the attack themselves is one thing, but do you really think the official narrative is the most plausible account of the events that transpired?</p>

<p>Someone who actually overcomes the plausible deniability threshold to a point where real news sites would have a hard time scrambling to dismiss. </p>

<p>They should have functional proof, some kind of tacit connection to a person who would have stood to benefit (like a Cheney or Bush). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a fine line between conspiracy and crackpot. Nothing of the whole truther movement holds up. From loose change to Charlie Sheen to every shitty post on here. They hold up for 80% because we all want to believe it was a big sham... then all you have to do is question the sources. You can&#39;t crowd source a conspiracy theory. At least the JFK assassination had people from K street. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been 11 years. The grand puppet master behind it all accomplished... what? I fail to see what it all adds up to. It&#39;s a matter of faith now. </p>

<p>You want a real conspiracy? The big 6 media companies are dismantling the internet because it&#39;s the last bastion on uncontrolled free speech. They appointed a lackey to head the FCC and they are going to crack down on the net. </p>

<p>But there won&#39;t be false flags or government feints. They are just going to tell you it&#39;s &quot;draining the swamp&quot; and will be good for you in the long run. </p>

<p>But yeah, your government is trying to take away your sources of information and they are using the whole anti elitist bent to do it? </p>

I heard the same from friends and acquaintances on social media. &quot;Embarrassed for America.&quot; Yet, I think this has been the single most valuable election cycle in my lifetime, as it has served to lift the veil of MSM bias. The fact that projections for Hillary&#39;s victory were so clearly purposely skewed, that the MSM did everything they could to lie about Trump and avoid any detrimental narrative about Hillary...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of other aspects than just WTC7 or how the buildings came down.  <a href="https://youtu.be/IzP9YJpBubk">Here is Richard Clark discussing how the US intelligence agency were following the terrorist</a>, but for some reason the reports were blocked.  They even <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hijackers-lived-with-fbi-informant/">lived with an FBI informant</a> and were <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/alleged-hijackers-may-have-trained-us-bases-152495">trained how to fly at a military base</a>.  You also had <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_operations_and_exercises_on_September_11,_2001#Operation_Tripod_bioterrorism_exercise">all the Military drill on that day including Operation Tri-pod</a>.  </p>

<p>But the most glaring aspect is flight 93, look at the photos, look at the debri field, and you can watch several videos where top level people from the Bush Administration proclaim (maybe by mistake) it was shot down.  Let alone this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But prosecutor Timothy Stone told the six-member jury of U.S. military officers who will decide Hamdan&#39;s guilt or innocence that Hamdan had inside knowledge of the 2001 attacks on the United States because he overheard a conversation between bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.</p>

<p>&quot;If they hadn&#39;t shot down the fourth plane it would&#39;ve hit the dome,&quot; Stone, a Navy officer, said in his opening remarks.</p>

<p>The tribunal&#39;s chief prosecutor, Col. Lawrence Morris, later explained that Stone was quoting Hamdan in evidence that will be presented at trial. Morris declined to say if the &quot;dome&quot; was a reference to the U.S. Capitol.</p>

<p>&quot;Virtually no one knew the intended target, but the accused knew,&quot; Stone said.</p>

<p>United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in a field in rural Pennsylvania. U.S. officials have never stated it was shot down although rumors saying that abound to this day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The false evidence put forth to confuse people about 9/11 works on people who are really clueless about basic physics. There is a LOT of nonsense stuff put out about 9/11 in order to confuse us, which I consider to be evidence of a truly massive and well funded cover up. They never seem to run out of resources to keep the lid on it, implicating a whole lot of insiders IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even people knowledgable in physics are fooled.</p>

<p>That is the frightening part.</p>

<p>I tried to redpill a very intelligent member of my family to no avail.  This person was aware of the Gulf of Tonkin admission by McNamara, by the way, and has a PhD in medicine, so clearly they understand Newtonian physics enough to comprehend the fallacies of the official 9/11 report.  </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t even remember that the towers stood and burned before they were demolished.  When asked how do you explain how they fell if they remained standing so long after plane impact, they immediately responded &quot;the jet fuel&quot;.</p>

<p>I explained the impossibility of this scenario, as jet fuel burns cooler than steel&#39;s melting point and the amount of fuel was a drop in the bucket compared to the truly mammoth scale of the buildings.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t respond, but were clearly unconvinced.  </p>

<p>I then asked how can less than 20% of a structure disintegrate to dust the bottom 80% of healthy structure if gravity is the only force at play.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; was the response.</p>

<p>I then mentioned the Society of Architects and Engineers who all disagree with the official story.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not an architectural engineer&quot; was the answer ti that.</p>

<p>I offered to show them <em>9/11: The New Pear Harbor</em> by Massimo Mazzucco when they are ready to open their mind.</p>

<p>Sadly, I don&#39;t think they want to really acknowledge the truth and would rather stay in a comfortable bubble.  Most Americans appear to share this same sentiment.</p>

<p>My journey looking at 9/11 started well after the event. Personally, I knew it wasn&#39;t what the government said but my own life was in tatters. </p>

<p>When my life started to square up, I had new access to Hi-speed internet I began looking. Crazy &#39;cuz I was on digg as it was in its death-spiral and I burned up a few user accounts trying to navigate reddit - by the time I found r/conspiracy I was able to settle in, ask questions and not get bombarded by jerks, creepers and twelve year olds!</p>

<p>The PG has red-pilled many people to 9/11 and our governments deep deep corruption. </p>

<p>Good people like you, u/Sister_Lauren,  can carry the torch, be the light of those that were sacrificed on 9/11 and in the weeks, months and years where the death toll continues to rise from the dust!</p>
