       Overview
      </h1>
      <p>
       Right now, the world is ruled by small groups of elites:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Policy organizations (Bilderberg, Council on Foreign Relations), 2. Politicians
       </li>
       <li>
        Secret societies (Freemasonry, Bohemian Grove)
       </li>
       <li>
        General staff of the armed forces
       </li>
       <li>
        Intelligence agencies (CIA, FBI)
       </li>
       <li>
        Executives of large corporations
       </li>
       <li>
        Academics at elite colleges and universities
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If you're not in the elite groups, your voice means very little. For a thorough explanation by Professor William Domhoff:

      <h1>
       Means of Control
      </h1>
      <p>
       The elites maintain their control in several ways. They blackmail people to keep them under control. They subvert legitimate protest movements (Occupy, Tea Party). At times they arrest, torture, and even kill people who dissent (JFK, RFK, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Seth Rich).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of their most powerful means of control is through the media. They allow debate only within a narrow range of "acceptable" viewpoints. It's ok if you like Trump or Clinton, but not acceptable if you like Johnson or Stein.

       I could go on for hours about the problems in our world. But before you even began studying conspiracies, you knew something was deeply wrong.
      </p>
      <h1>
       What You've Been Looking For
      </h1>
      <p>
       Right now, there are relatively easy solutions to all of our political questions. We can cut taxes to 0, maintain social security, pay off all of our debts, and push GDP to 20% or more for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Space-based solar power is the answer to all of our energy needs. It can provide many hundreds of times the energy needed to run our planet. There are no clouds, or night time to create capacity issues. There is no real estate to buy or lease.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing holding us back is an adequate launch vehicle, and feasible plans have been around (and actively suppressed) FOR DECADES. We can cut our launch costs to almost nothing with an investment of only about $500 billion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is achieved by means of a space orbital ring, which can be built entirely with existing technology.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Once we have a cheap method of going to space, we can fill start putting satellites into space for 1% of their current cost. Power generation costs would be cut 98%. We can sell power to the whole world, pay off all of our debts, institute universal basic income, and have 0 taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once energy become cheap and abundant, entire new industries pop up that drive economic growth. Desalination of sea water (no more water shortages). Indoor hydroponic farming, so people in areas with poor soil don't starve anymore. High speed rail, automated recycling, all kinds of new industries become plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       This proposal should tell you everything you need to know about our political discourse. Climate change has been debated for years, when an easy, economical solution was before us. Poverty, wars, all distractions to maintain the status quo.

       Excellent post (overall).
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe nuclear fusion, whether in the form cold fusion or hot fusion, would be an ideal source of power. Currently, investing in renewable energy and in the R&amp;D of the aforementioned solutions would be ideal.
      </p>

       Unfortunately, that is not going to solve all of our problems as a civilization, overpopulation being one (possibly legitimate) and pressing concern of the elite, and perhaps even more unfortunate when one realizes their 'solution' to the problem.

       Certainly not all of them, but about 90% of them. Cheap energy is strongly correlated to economic growth.

       There are tons of elite academics that are consulted on public policy. These policy groups are far more important than any politician's views. It's in the Domhoff video I linked to.

       I don't think you realized it but I was agreeing with your statements. I just didn't think that these professors are in any position to be considered a member of the ruling class. Maybe some, sure, but brandishing academics as members of the ruling class seems silly.

       A moron is a moron. I'm sure a few morons here and there can scheme (albeit poorly). It just takes a particularly well-versed person to scheme effectively and I have heavy doubts that the majority of these morons fit such a characterization.

       That's what's so scary. A lot of the problems we observe in the government are really, at their root, related to incompetence.

       For example, Paul Ryan really has no idea how to replace Obamacare. He couldn't come up with anything for several years.
