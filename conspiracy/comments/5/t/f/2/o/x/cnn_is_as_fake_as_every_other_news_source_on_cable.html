    <div class="md"><p>CNN is a holding of Time-Warner, of which, the Jewish Bronfman family has controlling interest. Time Magazine is also owned by Bronfmansâ€™ Time Warner Corporation. Ted Turner was blackmailed into selling CNN, and after he did the &quot;deal&quot; he lost $9 billion overnight. When he complained to the public about being swindled, Bronfman said &quot;Ted needs to shut up. We could have taken it all, but we left him a billion.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I see. So  &quot;From the [share price] high to the low, [I lost] seven or eight billion [dollars]&quot; is the same to you as &quot;losing $8 billion overnight&quot;? Because that&#39;s what OP said, right before making it sound like Bronfman screwed Turner out of the money intentionally instead of acknowledging a TON of people lost a TON of money on the fucked up AOL-Time Warner deal. </p>

<p>But we&#39;re getting off track here now, which I suppose is at least half my fault. Where&#39;s the proof of Turner getting blackmailed into selling CNN? As I&#39;ve said, I believe that to be true simply on instinct and experience, but I&#39;ve never heard anything concrete about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think &quot;news&quot; is ever removed from the internet? Did you ever read news from reputable sources years ago, and today it has been removed? Anybody can &quot;google&quot; stuff, and when it doesn&#39;t come up, claim it never existed. But for me, I use the help of a family member who works in intelligence, and he can find me anything. Even the stuff that has been deleted and has supposedly &quot;disappeared&quot;. So you see, for me to provide you with this, I have to call him and ask him to dig it up (and he will) but for what purpose? I prove to you my claims, and I most likely won&#39;t even even get a &quot;thank-you&quot;. I&#39;d probably get more ridicule and insults. </p>
