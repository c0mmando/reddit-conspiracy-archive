       CNN is a holding of Time-Warner, of which, the Jewish Bronfman family has controlling interest. Time Magazine is also owned by Bronfmansâ€™ Time Warner Corporation. Ted Turner was blackmailed into selling CNN, and after he did the "deal" he lost $9 billion overnight. When he complained to the public about being swindled, Bronfman said "Ted needs to shut up. We could have taken it all, but we left him a billion."

       No, I didn't make it up. If I take time from my busy day to find it and post it for you, will you pay me? How come people on this subreddit are too lazy to do research? I followed this whole mess very closely when it happened. At least try to do some research. If you can't find anything, let me know, and I will find the info for you.

       No rush on this. But when you find proof to back up your claims, please post a reply. Right now, I don't believe your assertions to be correct.

       Ah, I see. So  "From the [share price] high to the low, [I lost] seven or eight billion [dollars]" is the same to you as "losing $8 billion overnight"? Because that's what OP said, right before making it sound like Bronfman screwed Turner out of the money intentionally instead of acknowledging a TON of people lost a TON of money on the fucked up AOL-Time Warner deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we're getting off track here now, which I suppose is at least half my fault. Where's the proof of Turner getting blackmailed into selling CNN? As I've said, I believe that to be true simply on instinct and experience, but I've never heard anything concrete about it.

       Do you think "news" is ever removed from the internet? Did you ever read news from reputable sources years ago, and today it has been removed? Anybody can "google" stuff, and when it doesn't come up, claim it never existed. But for me, I use the help of a family member who works in intelligence, and he can find me anything. Even the stuff that has been deleted and has supposedly "disappeared". So you see, for me to provide you with this, I have to call him and ask him to dig it up (and he will) but for what purpose? I prove to you my claims, and I most likely won't even even get a "thank-you". I'd probably get more ridicule and insults.
