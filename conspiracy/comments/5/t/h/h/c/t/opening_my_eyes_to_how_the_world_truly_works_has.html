       They aren't people.  They are human animals.  They do no refuse, as they are not able.  These are creatures that seem human but lack trinary consciousness.  They have traded or lost their eternal soul.  These beings can be helped with healing and love, not hatred.

       It basically goes into detail about what you are saying. Apparently about 50% of the population are incapable of activating their higher chakras, and they are basically just robots. They are 3D service to self beings. The other half with a soul are the same but have the potential to connect to their higher selves. A long time ago the beings with souls have fallen from the "4D service to others" state of being and memories still remain within them and this is why some people have the existential internal conflict. The soulless beings do not have that internal conflict, their only inner conflict is related to needs like food and water, and sexual impulse. The soulless and souled beings have been interbreeding for so long that they could be both within the same family.
      </p>

       There's a lot more detail in that article so if you're curious or skeptical I would check that out, I'm not saying its true but it's very interesting.

       You gotta remember--all these people have been getting programmed literally since the day they were born. Some of them probably aren't very bright to begin with. Others have been brainwashed into believing that material goods will bring them happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people can break past it, but it isn't easy and it usually requires some level of pain, and the brain is trained to avoid pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way to take these people is with bemused detached fondness for whatever their better points may be, and everyone has them. I have friends who I can't really discuss anything but baseball with, but the baseball conversations are pretty good, LOL.

       I understand your frustration.  I try to focus on what I can do to help.  Hatred slows down advancement and at best is a low vibrational motivational force.  Most people need to learn for themselves in order to be convinced.  People don't want to be told what to believe and some will even just try to play devil's advocate.  I try to steer people in the right direction depending on the person.  :)  I think certain people are better off not knowing the truth.

       Hating them is pretty dumb - especially because you probably THINK you know how the world works, but there is always a level deeper than what you realize.  If you knew exactly how the world worked, that would mean you were the guy at the top of the food chain - always be humble and look to a higher power

       That is pretty much what I was thinking. Guy needs to settle down. It's attitudes like his that drive people away from the truth.

       Some of them are willfully ignorant, others are really just ignorant. How much blame can we put on a populace that is the product of generations of propaganda and lies?

       As easy as it is to get super frustrated, Truth and love are brothers that can't be parted. Hate only makes you fall for a different lie.

       Hate is a strong word and an even stronger emotion.

       Though my eyes have been opened up, I try to focus my attention not on the victim of the systematic domination, but on the parties responsible for the abuse - for I too have been blind and ignorant to the world.

       Fyi the acceptance of conspiracy theories as true is just as bad as someone who doesn't acknowledge them at all,  noticing there is sketchy shit going on they most people don't realize is just step one, but if you are incapable of filtering 90% of the shit ideas that are this thread then you are just as much of a sheep as the people you so aggressively hate

       Try to find a hobby! What about gardening? It's almost the time of year to start seeds in my area! Pick an heirloom, something strange, and grow it! Pick up guitar? Exercise? Meditate? Find a book series to get into? Hike? Bike?

       These are things you can do alone, and not feel lonely. I don't really relate to most of anyone anymore. The world is crazy, make it better in your corner at least.

       Don't blame the victim, friend. All you can really do is accept the world is a pretty fucked up place &amp; make your peace with that, while trying to be of service to those around you who really need it. Spread love.
