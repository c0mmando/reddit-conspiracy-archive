    <div class="md"><p>there may be something to trump&#39;s russia ties.  More info needs to be seen and time will tell.</p>

<p>But Hillary has had multiple crimes ignored.  At a minimum she overran Democracy this summer when she and the DNC knocked out Sanders.  This alone has created a target on her in many peoples&#39; eyes.</p>

<p>For me, the insecure server she hosted that she put secrets onto for who knows what reason, or who knows who got those files.</p>

<p>She has many sins to answer for.  Trump may too, he&#39;s no saint.  But she&#39;s made a freaking career out of it, and the time for it to end has come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy if you know how public figures make money. You have lucrative revenue streams in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Public speaking: She&#39;s a FLOTUS, and a popular one at that. Her speaking fees from this, being a senator, and being a SecState cause considerable wealth transfers to her.</p></li>
<li><p>Book deals: Public figures can write books, and people buy them. Another revenue stream.</p></li>
<li><p>Clinton has had these types of arrangements for the past ~30 years. She undoubtedly has a few financial portfolios, managed by very competent people. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Given her average net worth of 32 million (google if you want to see the source), this comes to around 2 million dollars of earnings (roughly) per year. For someone in such positions, this is a very reasonable sum of money to be earning with these various revenue streams. </p>

<p>So no, it&#39;s not bullshit, it&#39;s being smart financially. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Real conspiracy-theories realize the Dog-and-Pony show that goes on. There are PLENTY of Anti-Trump/Anti-Hillary attack posts but very few discussing the things they have in common (Which is more than you think)</p>

<p>Shills are common in all conspiracy forums but really are nothing new. The history of fake news is as long as human history. Hell, if you believe accepted human history for that matter I have some wonderful coastal property in west Texas to sell you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Set your bias aside. Think about this: why do you view Russia as the &quot;enemy&quot;?  Answer that question to yourself before researching to see why you believe it. Write them down. Then research your beliefs to see how they align with your views. See if you notice a pattern. Is there evidence to back up the research?  Is there a narrative in place in that research?   To be clear, Russia isn&#39;t a saint by any stretch. But for every so called crime they stand accused, you can be sure they pale in comparison to the United States.   Russia is being set up world wide as a scape goat for war.  See if you can figure out why the elite are moving their chess pieces in place to set thr stage for war.   Hint: look at their independence from foreign energy and monetary policies. Another hint: look for actual evidence presented connecting Trump to Russia.  Hint: the role of the CIA is to lie and muddy foreign affairs. That is their job. They lie to Congress. They&#39;ve been caught multiple times.  And they are legally allowed to disseminate propaganda to US citizens. Now look for the narrative in the media (unverified sources &quot;say&quot;, intelligence &quot;says&quot;)  without any proof other than &quot;we say so&quot;.  Remember when the CIA lied to Congress about WMD?  Now look at the &quot;evidence&quot; of Russia &quot;hacking &quot; (there is zero)    you&#39;ll begin to see that you&#39;re able to easily see through narratives and agenda. You&#39;re on a path to more awakening </p>
