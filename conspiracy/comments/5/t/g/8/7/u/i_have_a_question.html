       Why is there so much Hillary Clinton information on here, but none about any of the information (which has more source material) pertaining to trumps Russia ties?
      </p>
      <p>
       I like reading conspiracy theory stuff, but the Clinton articles are more political hit-pieces and not conspiracies, whereas the trump stuff actually seems to have legs behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone want to answer that?

       Pretty sure they are though aren't they? Isn't that the reason The oversight committee requested the emails from the FBI? I also recall Chaffetz said he wasn't done with the Clinton email issue, but I might be remembering that wrong.

       Chaffetz said he had stuff 'stacked' up against her for investigations, but hasn't said he started any of them. I think he's bullshitting, personally. It's also blatantly hypocritical that he investigated Benghazi more times than 9-11 was investigated, and yet on these very real issues that trump has... he is silent.

       Yes, on that I'll agree with you that 9/11 needs to be investigated deeper.  That investigation was crippled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chaffetz said he is still investigating her, it just takes a lot of time to go through it all.

       there may be something to trump's russia ties.  More info needs to be seen and time will tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Hillary has had multiple crimes ignored.  At a minimum she overran Democracy this summer when she and the DNC knocked out Sanders.  This alone has created a target on her in many peoples' eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, the insecure server she hosted that she put secrets onto for who knows what reason, or who knows who got those files.
      </p>
      <p>
       She has many sins to answer for.  Trump may too, he's no saint.  But she's made a freaking career out of it, and the time for it to end has come.

       Sins? She's been, probably, one of the most investigated people in history. And she's never been brought to charges on any of it.

       Trump has something like 3,000 lawsuits that have been brought against him. That's not comparable in the slightest.

       OK, you sound like you want a political discussion which this sub is NOT about.  This isn't a comparison.  I admitted they both likely have sins.

       Your question was about Hillary, and I told you why the focus is on her.  She was investigated by a DoJ that did not want to prosecute.  Now there is a new DoJ.  If she is clear, she will live her life enjoying her days with Chels and baby.

       The religious undertones of that dudes comment was kinda scary to me. I agree with you. I think we need to look at every single possibility, so there should be more about this subject, but from what I see there are alot of blinded Trump fans around or maybe even shills who knows.

       It's easy if you know how public figures make money. You have lucrative revenue streams in the following areas:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Public speaking: She's a FLOTUS, and a popular one at that. Her speaking fees from this, being a senator, and being a SecState cause considerable wealth transfers to her.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Book deals: Public figures can write books, and people buy them. Another revenue stream.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Clinton has had these types of arrangements for the past ~30 years. She undoubtedly has a few financial portfolios, managed by very competent people.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Given her average net worth of 32 million (google if you want to see the source), this comes to around 2 million dollars of earnings (roughly) per year. For someone in such positions, this is a very reasonable sum of money to be earning with these various revenue streams.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, it's not bullshit, it's being smart financially.

       Her private net worth might be that, but her functional net worth through vehicles like the CF, and what would have happened in terms of "pay to play" which she was found engaging in, is much much higher.  She's made money off her position in the bureaucracy, and a lot of it.  This is pretty much a huge Failure Modality that typifies the proverbial "Swamp".

       She doesn't have access to the CF money, it's held by the charity. To paint it as 'her' money is intentionally disingenuous.

       Why don't you make a post with the information? You aren't here to do that, you just want an argument and that's very clear from your post history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just glancing through you call Trump a turnip, chimp, buffoon, you say things like "lazy uneducated whites" and talk about how people need to be "shouted down" and punched in the face for their idiotic beliefs, while shit talking the fly over states.

       Real conspiracy-theories realize the Dog-and-Pony show that goes on. There are PLENTY of Anti-Trump/Anti-Hillary attack posts but very few discussing the things they have in common (Which is more than you think)
      </p>

       Shills are common in all conspiracy forums but really are nothing new. The history of fake news is as long as human history. Hell, if you believe accepted human history for that matter I have some wonderful coastal property in west Texas to sell you.

       Set your bias aside. Think about this: why do you view Russia as the "enemy"?  Answer that question to yourself before researching to see why you believe it. Write them down. Then research your beliefs to see how they align with your views. See if you notice a pattern. Is there evidence to back up the research?  Is there a narrative in place in that research?   To be clear, Russia isn't a saint by any stretch. But for every so called crime they stand accused, you can be sure they pale in comparison to the United States.   Russia is being set up world wide as a scape goat for war.  See if you can figure out why the elite are moving their chess pieces in place to set thr stage for war.   Hint: look at their independence from foreign energy and monetary policies. Another hint: look for actual evidence presented connecting Trump to Russia.  Hint: the role of the CIA is to lie and muddy foreign affairs. That is their job. They lie to Congress. They've been caught multiple times.  And they are legally allowed to disseminate propaganda to US citizens. Now look for the narrative in the media (unverified sources "say", intelligence "says")  without any proof other than "we say so".  Remember when the CIA lied to Congress about WMD?  Now look at the "evidence" of Russia "hacking " (there is zero)    you'll begin to see that you're able to easily see through narratives and agenda. You're on a path to more awakening
