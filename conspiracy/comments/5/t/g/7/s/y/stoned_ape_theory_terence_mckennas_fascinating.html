        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Perhaps the most intriguing of Terence McKenna&#39;s fascinating theories and observations is his explanation for the origin of the human mind and human culture.</p>

<p>To summarize: McKenna theorizes, for instance, that synesthesia (the blurring of boundaries between the senses) caused by psilocybin led to the development of spoken language: the ability to form pictures in another person&#39;s mind through the use of vocal sounds.</p>

<p>About 12,000 years ago, further climate changes removed the mushroom from the human diet, resulting in a new set of profound changes in our species as we reverted to pre-mushroomed and frankly brutal primate social structures that had been modified and/or repressed by frequent consumption of psilocybin.</p>

<p>McKenna&#39;s theory has great appeal and intuitive strength, but it is necessarily based on a great deal of supposition interpolating between the few fragmentary facts we know about hominid and early human history. In addition, because McKenna (who describes himself as &quot;an explorer, not a scientist&quot;) is also a proponent of much wilder suppositions, such as his &quot;Timewave Zero&quot; theory, his more reasonable theories are usually disregarded by the very scientists whose informed criticism is crucial for their development.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnEKoFrx1rI">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnEKoFrx1rI</a></p>

<p>We wonder where human consciousness came from that separates us from other animals. I believe that psychedelic plants definately played a part in our evolution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>read Food of the Gods in which the theory is presented in its entirety extremely cautiously and with many qualms. The way he lays it out would give you a different impression than this post title. It&#39;s very physiological and mainly refers to development of language and culture. McKenna was working on refining it and all his papers burned in a fire. I don&#39;t totally buy it but I do think it was going somewhere.</p>

<p>from the interview:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And certainly when I reached La Chorerra in 1971 I had a price on my head by the FBI, I was running out of
money, I was at the end of my rope.     And then they recruited me and said, “you know, with a mouth like yours
there’s a place for you in our organization”.  And I’ve worked in deep background positions about which the less
said the  better.   And  then  about 15 years ago  they shifted  me  into  public relations and I’ve  been there  to the
present.</p>

That was what happened when he reached La Chorerra.

    <div class="md"><p>McKennan&#39;s idea of Human consciousness is that our early pro-human brains were mutated by a serious of ingesting psilocybin, and not injesting it.</p>

<p>This is a fine theory ... at least, I have nothing against it ... However, as an explanation for Consciousness it fails because it does not account for non-Human consciousness - namely, those species which did not / could not ingest the chemical.</p>

<p>I suppose my one presumption is that when McKennan &quot;explains Consciousness&quot; ... he means in a greater sense than only that of Mankind.  If he limits it to that of Man, then the source of Consciousness for non-Humans is still an open question.</p>

<p>And that would be a greater challenge:  Evolution has very, very few independent paths to the same mutation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a philosophy professor in college who wrote a <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Minding_Minds.html?id=wie5QgAACAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en">book</a>
claiming apes began interpreting each other&#39;s behavior which led to recognition of their own minds. Interesting theory, but I did my end of the semester paper rebutting it, saying other ape&#39;s actions could never be interpreted as anything to an ape until after it already had begun to get an inkling of self awareness about it&#39;s own mind and actions, so he had it backwards and we were still no closer to understanding the emergence of consciousness.</p>

<p>Another professor I had spent the entire semester studying <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ken-Wilber/e/B000APH4W2">Ken Wilber</a>
 and his theory that all life, and really all matter, had four aspects to it, and evolution therefore could be followed in a <a href="http://www.integralworld.net/images/figure1.gif">four quadrant model</a>
. <a href="http://www.integralworld.net/goddard2.html">Very interesting stuff</a>
. The main driver of consciousness in his model was sort of borrowed from Hindu philosophy, the idea that consciousness is playing a game where it hides in matter and tries to slowly over time come to once again know it&#39;s true nature as pure spirit. If evolution is real, I&#39;d probably sooner subscribe to this model than a materialistic scientific view.</p>

<p>Lately though under the influence of a lot of videos I&#39;ve seen that convincingly question whether evolution itself is a scam, a conspiracy if you will, I&#39;ve begun to lean more towards a creationist model without any major leaps in evolution like one species producing another, even though the two models could possibly be reconciled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You buy into that theory? Is your smoking gun that clip where he says that he &#39;used to be employed behind the scenes but at some point they moved me to public relations&quot;. The missing part from that quote is the part immediately before where it&#39;s obvious from context that &quot;they&quot; refers to the mushroom &#39;logos&#39; that he frequently mentions, not the CIA.</p>

<p>Now Esalen does have some weirdness to it but that doesn&#39;t mean everyone associated with it is a CIA plant. I mean by that logic Rupert Sheldrake and Ralph Abraham are CIA operatives as well which is just silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the whole Gnostic perspective on the genesis myth is awesome. It survived as a religion in the early ADs until all the sects got crushed by the holy Roman church. They thought that the old testament entity Yahweh was actually a lesser being more like what Christians think of as angels/demons which at least makes sense of all the quotes where God is &quot;jealous&quot; or &quot;angry&quot; or &quot;pleased&quot; which seem like odd mindstates for the supreme entity especially considering the horrible shit that happens as a result. </p>

<p>Either way they saw us as being created by Jahweh to live only as adoring worshippers (again a main theme of the bible) but the serpent (messenger of the true supreme being) showed us humans to the Tree of the Knowledge of <strong>Good and Evil</strong> (seems to get left out a lot). So after gaining autonomy and the potential for morality behind our creator&#39;s back the above quote shows the nervous Yahweh stopping us from completing our ascension to higher beings leaving us where we are now: still struggling with our human bullshit while having the capabilities to end suffering.</p>
