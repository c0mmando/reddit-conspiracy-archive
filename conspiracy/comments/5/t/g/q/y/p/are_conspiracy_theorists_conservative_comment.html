       Best answer. Conspiracy theorizing is all about seeing past the illusions powerful people use to manipulate society, i.e., labels and blind adherence to them.

       Indeed, but people who are
       <em>
        right leaning
       </em>
       have an innate distrust of government, namely 'big gov/over-reaching gov'. As such, they're more inclined to follow conspiracy theories.

       The opposite has been true since  at least the 1960's. The right trusted anything and everything the government while the 'leftist hippies' held all of the distrust of government.

       When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind. ~ J. Krishnamurthi

       I try to find the truth, and then base my beliefs around my conclusion(s) of the truth. So I'm a "moderate." Growing up, when I was an adolescent for the end of Bush 2 and the beginning of Obama, I was way more "liberal/democrat." That was before I knew about labels, divide and conquer, and the history of the military industrial complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty non-interventionist when it comes to foreign affairs. The history of the USA, unfortunately, disagrees with me in that regard.

       You mean the pretend libertarian neocons that the CIA sponsored to dilute true librertarians? "Social conservatism" is completely antithetical to a libertarian ethos. I'm not a super duper libertarian myself, but I admire the purity of the philosophy.

       Not trying to be combative and I think we are more or less arguing the same point; I just hate that people like Glenn Beck somehow feel justified to call themselves libertarians.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, it's funny, I had heard people say they thought Glenn Beck was CIA asset of some sort but didn't really consider the possibility until tonight when thinking about how the CIA infiltrates and neuters political movements that are at odds to their own goals. I digress...

       I have recently become interested in conspiracy theories and I didn't know there was a conspiracy theories subreddit until just know I would take about this stuff on my other social medias. I am just a curious teen, I have noticed that most conspiracy theorists are conservatives, I wanted to validate my hypothesis.

       Do you assume they are conservatives because of the interest in Trump? I find that most regulars posters here don't really ascribe to any specific political ideology... I took a quiz that said I'm a "Young Outsider" means I'm skeptical of government and don't fully side with either party... sounds about right to me.

       It's silly to fully ascribe to any ideology unless it is one you made up yourself... I don't like every single song by the bands I like... I don't like every single episode of a TV show I like... I don't like every single item on the menu at a restaurant that I like... why would a political party be any different?

       I'm mostly horrified by many of his cabinet picks (I do think Mattis and Tillerson are solid picks), but I don't think it is out of keeping with expectations. I voted for Trump because I felt Clinton was a greater danger to the long term health and wellness of the United States. If the dems had put nearly any other person up, I would have voted for him or her.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny about the actions that Trump is taking right now. Approximately 50% of the things he does (killing the TPP, aggressively pursuing immigration reform, normalizing relations with Russia, getting to the bottom of this Syria quagmire, etc) I think, "Wow, that's pretty great." But about 50% of what he does leaves me just slack jawed, and I have a hard time reconciling those two feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I think immigration reform is a good thing. I think that banning all members from countries X, Y, and Z based essentially on religion is ham fisted and seriously damaging to our foreign policy interests. I just wish that he would focus more on the "how" when it comes to execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's a mixed bag. I'm elated that the Clinton Crime Syndicate appears to be shut down. But I am disappointed that we couldn't get Bernie to do it. Trump is an okay stop-gap, and I hope for the best, but am expecting something slightly worse than average over the next four years.

       I reject all -isms, but might be considered a "Radical moderate."  I voted Bernie but was glad Hillary lost because that establishment must be rejected, America deserves to deal with Trump as a result of all of our failures and blind spots, and throwing the chessboard across the room might be the best move for the people.

       The ideal form of government for this crazy modern world has yet to be dreamed up.  I think it requires open-source style governance nd drastic amounts of transparency, however.

       Conspiracy Theory has its modern roots in groups like the John Birch Society and Christian Doomsday prophecy, although there's always been a left leaning Lyndon Larouche element.

       I just want to point out that 9/11 truth was VERY popular among left leaning individuals. Remember it was BUSH and CHENEY in office when it went down. Many people in Gen X were introduced to conspiracy after that event.

       I'm mostly horrified by many of his cabinet picks (I do think Mattis and Tillerson are solid picks), but I don't think it is out of keeping with expectations. I voted for Trump because I felt Clinton was a greater danger to the long term health and wellness of the United States. If the dems had put nearly any other person up, I would have voted for him or her.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny about the actions that Trump is taking right now. Approximately 50% of the things he does (killing the TPP, aggressively pursuing immigration reform, normalizing relations with Russia, getting to the bottom of this Syria quagmire, etc) I think, "Wow, that's pretty great." But about 50% of what he does leaves me just slack jawed, and I have a hard time reconciling those two feelings.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I think immigration reform is a good thing. I think that banning all members from countries X, Y, and Z based essentially on religion is ham fisted and seriously damaging to our foreign policy interests. I just wish that he would focus more on the "how" when it comes to execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's a mixed bag. I'm elated that the Clinton Crime Syndicate appears to be shut down. But I am disappointed that we couldn't get Bernie to do it. Trump is an okay stop-gap, and I hope for the best, but am expecting something slightly worse than average over the next four years.
