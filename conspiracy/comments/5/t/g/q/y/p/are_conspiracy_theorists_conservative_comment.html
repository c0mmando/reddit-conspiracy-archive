    <div class="md"><p>When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent?</p>

<p>It is because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence.</p>

<p>So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind. ~ J. Krishnamurthi</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m mostly horrified by many of his cabinet picks (I do think Mattis and Tillerson are solid picks), but I don&#39;t think it is out of keeping with expectations. I voted for Trump because I felt Clinton was a greater danger to the long term health and wellness of the United States. If the dems had put nearly any other person up, I would have voted for him or her. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny about the actions that Trump is taking right now. Approximately 50% of the things he does (killing the TPP, aggressively pursuing immigration reform, normalizing relations with Russia, getting to the bottom of this Syria quagmire, etc) I think, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s pretty great.&quot; But about 50% of what he does leaves me just slack jawed, and I have a hard time reconciling those two feelings.</p>

<p>For example, I think immigration reform is a good thing. I think that banning all members from countries X, Y, and Z based essentially on religion is ham fisted and seriously damaging to our foreign policy interests. I just wish that he would focus more on the &quot;how&quot; when it comes to execution.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s a mixed bag. I&#39;m elated that the Clinton Crime Syndicate appears to be shut down. But I am disappointed that we couldn&#39;t get Bernie to do it. Trump is an okay stop-gap, and I hope for the best, but am expecting something slightly worse than average over the next four years. </p>

<p>The ideal form of government for this crazy modern world has yet to be dreamed up.  I think it requires open-source style governance nd drastic amounts of transparency, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to point out that 9/11 truth was VERY popular among left leaning individuals. Remember it was BUSH and CHENEY in office when it went down. Many people in Gen X were introduced to conspiracy after that event.</p>

<p>I knew a lot of hippies who pushed for 9/11 truth back in the day.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t thought of as a conservative dominated group until the whole &quot;Right=retarded Left=Illuminated&quot; propaganda campaign began.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m mostly horrified by many of his cabinet picks (I do think Mattis and Tillerson are solid picks), but I don&#39;t think it is out of keeping with expectations. I voted for Trump because I felt Clinton was a greater danger to the long term health and wellness of the United States. If the dems had put nearly any other person up, I would have voted for him or her. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny about the actions that Trump is taking right now. Approximately 50% of the things he does (killing the TPP, aggressively pursuing immigration reform, normalizing relations with Russia, getting to the bottom of this Syria quagmire, etc) I think, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s pretty great.&quot; But about 50% of what he does leaves me just slack jawed, and I have a hard time reconciling those two feelings.</p>

<p>For example, I think immigration reform is a good thing. I think that banning all members from countries X, Y, and Z based essentially on religion is ham fisted and seriously damaging to our foreign policy interests. I just wish that he would focus more on the &quot;how&quot; when it comes to execution.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s a mixed bag. I&#39;m elated that the Clinton Crime Syndicate appears to be shut down. But I am disappointed that we couldn&#39;t get Bernie to do it. Trump is an okay stop-gap, and I hope for the best, but am expecting something slightly worse than average over the next four years. </p>
