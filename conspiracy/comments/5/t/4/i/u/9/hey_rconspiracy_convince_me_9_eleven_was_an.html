    <div class="md"><p>Easily done. We&#39;ll take the twin towers for $911.Alex.</p>

<p>There are two possibilities about why the towers collapsed. One is that some floor joists sagged down and caused the building to pull itself downward because of gravity working against the weight of the building.</p>

<p>This would mean that each floor would fall downward and slide off of the ever increasing strength of the increasing gauge of the steel frame. Physics would demand that the weakened floors would collapse to the side of the remaining undamaged floors leaving the lower floors as a stub of the original building. </p>

<p>As an experiment you may take any two objects that are similar to each other and stack them. The top one will never fall through the lower one because the top one must follow the path of least resistance as  the laws of physics demands. the only way the top object could ever fall through the lower object is if  both objects were shattered at the beginning of the collapses as  might be done by explosives. </p>

<p>If those  laws  of falling in the direction of least resistance as opposed to falling ion the direction of most resistance were suspended,  then gravity provides no lateral force to move any one floor out from under the one above it. </p>

<p>At ground level, if the building didn&#39;t even have to fall in the direction of least resistance, the floors would stack up in the order they were standing in.and you would see layers of floors. as the pile of debris.</p>

<p>The other way the buildings could collapse is with the use of explosives.</p>

<p>If explosives were used the building would be turned into shredded material called shrapnel. What you would see on the ground then would be shreds of material haphazardly distributed. </p>

<p>Now all that must be done is  to prove  that there were not layers of floors on the ground but shredded material,  or shrapnel. </p>

<p>That would leave no doubt that the buildings had been rigged with explosives and brought down on purpose by people with the power to do that stealthily and then to hide the evidence.</p>

<p>Take  a look at the forensic evidence and decide which kind of debris existed and which did not.</p>

<p>Here are examples of gravity caused collapses.</p>

<p>I think we can unanimously agree that  the debris consisted of shrapnel.</p>

<p>The only conclusion possible is that the government and its associated actors created the attack of 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I never hear mentioned is about where George W. Bush was on 9/11. We all know he was at a school reading to children when both planes hit, he was walking in as the first plane hit and there&#39;s video of secret service telling him the second plane hit. After the second plane hit the president of the United States was allowed to remain in the school for a full 30 minutes. On any given day the President&#39;s itinerary is available in advance, in this case W&#39;s was available on September 7th, a full four days in advance. So why is it that once the secret service knew a second plane had hit and that this was indeed a terrorist attack George W. Bush wasn&#39;t whisked away to a safe location ? Unless they knew for a fact that that building wasn&#39;t being targeted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The towers supposedly had sagging floor joist because of extreme heat but I can demonstrate conclusively that no such extreme heat existed in  the air or in the building frames of the towers.</p>

<p>In the north tower The frame was not as hot as 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  That&#39;s proven by Edna Cintron who was photographed holding onto the frame for support as she stood in the  airplane hole and also not cooking while she did so. No one can hold onto 200 F. steel.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/JLfw37G">http://imgur.com/JLfw37G</a></p>

<p>In the South Tower  Fire Chief Orio Palmer climbed from the 40th floor elevator sky lobby   to the 78th and reported the conditions there on his radio to his fellow firemen.</p>

<p>Here is the recorded  evidence that the 78th floor, the hole, in the south tower was also less than 200 degrees F. If it was even that hot he would be screaming in pain, not talking coherently to his fellow firefighters.</p>

<p><a href="http://vocaroo.com/i/s1u7U1ft68v3">http://vocaroo.com/i/s1u7U1ft68v3</a></p>

<p>So, conclusively, neither building was anywhere close to a steel weakening temperature at the most affected floor level.</p>

<p>Just as insurance here is the science involved showing that in impossibly  favorable conditions the hottest the steel frame could possibly have become is 536 degrees F..</p>

<p>That&#39;s a temperature regularly exceeded by a standard pizza oven which will never be weakened or melted by that amount of heat. Here&#39;s the science .</p>

<p>The Jet Fuel. How Hot did it Heat the WTC? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.uscrusade.com/forum/config.pl/read/1064">http://www.uscrusade.com/forum/config.pl/read/1064</a>,</p>

<p>Thus the buildings conclusively did not weaken because of the heat of the jet fuel (kerosene) fire.</p>

<p>This proves the official explanation is a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The man who ordered  that the hijackers be paid for their part in the 9/11 conspiracy was in the company of our top intelligence operatives as the planes hit the towers. That man was allowed to leave our capitol building to retire peacefully  rather than be  prosecuted. This fact is proven by the check for $100,000 written by Mahmoud Ahmad&#39;s office. and traced by the FBI.</p>

<p>The check was written by Ahmad Umar Sheikh who was General Mahmoud Ahmad&#39;s assistant.  Ahmad was the head of the Pakistani ISI, a partner organization   of the CIA. </p>

<p>The check originated in Dubai.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This photo proves 9/11 was an inside job.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/Kwb8A">http://imgur.com/Kwb8A</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s a law in physics about  the conservation of momentum or angular momentum or motion. It means that once an object is in motion it will continue its motion until some outside force acts to resist or change  that motion.</p>

<p>In the photo above the South Tower has begun to tilt over. Nothing is available to stop this tilting so it must continue to tilt until it falls off of the stub of the building below. As you all know this did not happen. </p>

<p>The angular  arch of momentum stopped in mid air. The top floors changed direction from a sideways tilting motion to falling straight down. That change in direction has only one possible explanation. In the second after this photo, the top portion of the building was shattered by the use of explosives and the now  much smaller particles of building  individually took a much smaller arch of momentum in their  trajectory towards the ground. That caused an appearance of the building fall changing directions in mid air, from tilting over to falling down. The change of direction of the top of the south tower as it fell, along with the near free fall speed of the collapse  proves the use of explosives to shatter both the top and bottom sections of the building at the same moment in time.  </p>

<p>The tilting tower defies the physical  law of conservation of momentum unless something  unseen intervened. that unseen intervention could only be explosive force.  </p>

<p>Again, this too proves 9/11 was an inside job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This photo  taken at the Pentagon, virtually proves 9/11 was an inside job.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/scXI5v3">http://imgur.com/scXI5v3</a></p>

<p>In this photo the explosion is still in progress and there is already no indication of  this plane being there. (file photo of the actual plane.)</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/TjvAl">http://imgur.com/TjvAl</a></p>

<p>Think about it. You&#39;re a photographer on your way to a meeting of some sort at the Pentagon, moving along their drive towards the guard gate and in front of the helicopter pad. You are not in a place where anyone could just loiter or stand waiting without express permission. It&#39;s a sort of no mans land between the Pentagon and the expressway behind you. There is a helicopter in the air near the pad. </p>

<p>You must realize the airliner you hear approaching above the din of the helicopter  is not  a normal one  and that something worthy of photographing is occurring.  You must get your professional     camera out of its case,  check for a  possible lens cap, get a clear view around your vehicle  of the action, bring the camera into the right position, and  then take the photo of a lifetime level and centered.</p>

<p>Fine, now try to do all of that and still get a photo of the scene before the explosion turns to flame,  before the explosion has ended.  </p>

<p>It is my conclusion that the cameraman was standing waiting for the event to get the shot and had his camera ready on a tripod. He had to know in advance that the chance to get the shot was coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The debris at the Pentagon also proves an inside job. The earliest photos of the pentagon that morning show no crash debris on the lawn at all. This is the very first photo that morning. Notice the pristine tire tracks and no debris on the lawn at all.</p>

<p>As the day went on there was more and more debris on the lawn ending up with full saturation of pieces of shrapnel there and a single piece of sheet metal that would be easy to place there by hand.</p>

<p>I believe the engine parts and the shrapnel were simply walked out of the hole in the building and placed there. </p>

<p>No one would notice the clearing of debris from inside as part of the hunt for survivors.  The engine parts were all within a few feet of the hole because they   would be  to heavy to transport further out.  Nonetheless, the late day appearance of shrapnel on the lawn proves an inside job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing both sides ought to be able to agree on is that the onus is on the government to explain what happened on 9/11 and to back that explanation with evidence that withstands reasonable scrutiny.  </p>

<p>Often in these arguments the onus is erroneously placed on those who are questioning the veracity of the government&#39;s evidence (or lack thereof) used to support the official story.  </p>

<p>This is like asking a defense attorney to not only disprove the prosecution&#39;s case - but to investigate, arrest, try, and convict the actual perpetrators in order to exonerate their client.  This is, of course, absurd.  </p>

<p>So that said - there are many things that refute the government&#39;s story about 9/11.  But I think one of the most compelling is that not one single person was so much as reprimanded for what we are to believe was the single largest defensive blunder since the Trojan Horse.  This is not how the world works.  </p>

<p>This is how the world works; Last year there was a very minor altercation in the Arabian Gulf between the U.S. and Iran.  A few U.S. sailors were detained but none were harmed.  Nonetheless, the X.O. in charge was fired - (which typically means his career is over).  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/navy-fires-officer-detained-sailors-iran/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/navy-fires-officer-detained-sailors-iran/index.html</a></p>

<p>Now how does one reconcile this - an incident with no loss of life and not even anyone hurt or any property loss - with 9/11 - thousands killed, entire country terrorized, 10s of billions in property losses... and no one is reprimanded for the obvious failures?  To me that nearly trumps WTC7.  </p>

<p>Cheers - 9/11 was an inside job.  We don&#39;t need to explain the how - just that it didn&#39;t happen the way they say.  Peace.  </p>
