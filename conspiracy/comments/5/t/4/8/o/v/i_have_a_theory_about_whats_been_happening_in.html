And I just remembered about the Jade Helm training that happened a few years ago. Could it be tied to what&#39;s been happening over here? And I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s cartel here as well. Will trump send troops down over here to start his plan? </p>

The police won&#39;t do anything if it&#39;s a federal law like illegal immigration, tax scandals, the more political type of crimes.

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely happening. Don&#39;t forget Austin is home to Stratfor. Forward Observer Magazine is also located there; as well as Texas being a solid Oath Keeper, III%er base. </p>

<p>There are major Army Reserve Intelligence Units as well the home of the Texas National Guard in Austin. Ft. Hood is an hour north, home to 1CAV and 3 Corps, and the Joint Base Sam Houston home to some Northcom and Southcom Military Units and the Airforce out of Lackland AFB.</p>
