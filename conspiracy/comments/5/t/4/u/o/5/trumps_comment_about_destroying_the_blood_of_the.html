       Today during the swearing-in ceremony of the new Attorney General, President Trump stated his intention to grant the DHS and DOJ authority to
       <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-09/trump-signs-three-executive-orders-crush-crime-drug-cartels">
        "undertake all necessary and lawful actions to break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and

      </p>
      <p>
       This got me thinking into what he meant when he used this very specific phrasing to describe the nefarious activities of the shadow cabal. I came up with three theories as to what it means to "
       <em>
        destroy the blood of our youth
       </em>
       ":
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) cabal trafficking kids for blood sacrifices and elite rejuvenation
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) cabal intentionally spreading diseases like
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_(disease">
        Kuru
       </a>
       ), a strange disease spread by prion proteins that originates with cannibalism through the consumption of infected human tissue.  It could potentially be introduced into the mass food industry through cow meat:
       <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/06/482952588/when-people-ate-people-a-strange-disease-emerged">
        "People have developed variant CJD after eating the meat of cattle infected with mad cow disease."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) cabal messing with our bloodstream or even possibly our DNA to achieve the ultimate goal of a controllable, trackable population.  This last theory is the one I will explore in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of today,
       <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/biotech/sd-me-illumina-novaseq-20170109-story.html">
        human gene sequencing
       </a>
       is a new branch of medical science rapidly developing as we speak. In early 2015, President Obama
       <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/01/30/obama-precision-medicine-initiative-white-house/22547019/">
        spent $215 million dollars
       </a>
       to launch the Precision Medicine Initiative to fund high-level research into a
       <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm509814.htm">
        "powerful new technology, known as next generation sequencing"
       </a>
       which would allow the NIH, FDA, and DOD and other agencies to assess the genetic information of a million volunteers.  Specifically, doctors are granted funds to research the effects of genes on certain diseases, and more broadly, to determine "how lifestyle choices... affect a person's genetic makeup" (
       <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm509814.htm">
        http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm509814.htm
       </a>
       ). In other words, they've got the money and the permission to manipulate live human DNA and start doing funky things with it.  Now, what sorts of things could (((they))) do with this highly interesting, highly invasive research into the fundamental building blocks of our bodies?
      </p>
      <p>
       As we have seen, there has been an incredible promotion of Transhumanism in Hollywood and the music industry as of late, starting from around the 70s and 80s, and some examples date back even earlier (ex: science-fiction film
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film">
        Metropolis
       </a>
       ) from 1927))
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikipedia used to define Transhumanism as: "an international intellectual and
       <em>
        cultural
       </em>
       movement supporting the use of new sciences and technologies to
       <em>
        enhance
       </em>
       human mental and physical abilities and aptitudes, and ameliorate what it regards as
       <em>
        undesirable and unnecessary
       </em>
       aspects of the human condition, such as
       <em>
        stupidity, suffering, disease, aging and involuntary death.
       </em>
       Transhumanist thinkers study the possibilities and consequences of developing and using human enhancement techniques and other emerging technologies for these purposes.
       <em>
        Possible dangers, as well as benefits, of powerful new technologies that might radically change the conditions of human life are also of concern to the transhumanist movement.
       </em>
       " Link to 2006 article:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transhumanism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119068882">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transhumanism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=119068882
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikipedia now defines
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">
        Transhumanism
       </a>
       as "an international and intellectual movement that aims to
       <em>
        transform
       </em>
       the human condition by developing and making widely available
       <em>
        sophisticated technologies
       </em>
       to
       <em>
        greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities.
       </em>
       Transhumanist thinkers study the potential benefits and dangers of emerging technologies that could overcome fundamental human limitations, as well as the ethics of using such technologies. The most common transhumanist thesis is that human beings may eventually be able to transform themselves into different beings with
       <em>
        abilities so greatly expanded from the natural condition as to merit the label of post human beings
       </em>
       ."

      <p>
       Subtle, but persuasive and intentional changes. Towards a very positive view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of us here are aware of the "mass subliminal programming" effect that Hollywood and mainstream music has on the public. So what is with this huge push to promote transhumanism in the art and fashion world, films and TV shows? Superhero blockbusters come out faster than we can say "Batman." Movies like the Matrix, Gattaca, TV shows like Heroes, Battlestar Galactica, Stranger Things, Smallville, Doctor Who, and many others all revolve around a central figure with superpowers that is promoted as the "good guy."
      </p>
      <p>
       So why promote Transhumanism?
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zoltan-istvan/a-new-generation-of-trans_b_4921319.html">
        HuffPo
       </a>
       described it this way: "The most important aim for many transhumanists is to overcome human mortality, a goal some believe is achievable by 2045."
      </p>
      <p>
       (((THEY))) will convince people to consent to DNA manipulation and gene sequencing by deceiving people into believing they can achieve a form of superhuman power.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are already literally
       <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/03/10/468556420/body-hacking-movement-rises-ahead-of-moral-answers">
        body hackers
       </a>
       who line up to get microchipped in an effort to augment the human body's capabilities with the aid of technology. One of these body hackers self-proclaims that "he no longer identifies as human but as a 'cybernetic organism.'"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, bear with me.  This is where the theory gets kinda weird, but it sorta clicked for me while reading into Biblical prophecy. In Genesis 6, when Satan was cast out of heaven, a number of his angels was cast out with him. These fallen angels ended up mating with human women and breeding new bloodlines of beings called the Nephilim. These beings were giant half human, half demon hybrids who were "extremely intelligent" beings with high level knowledge of "science, architecture, and engineering. Some believe they combined these skills with their powers of levitation to build the Great Pyramid and other great monuments around the pre-flood world...Nephilim may have sacrificed human beings all over the planet in temples and pyramids they built... They drank our blood and slaughtered our babies, and were almost certainly tampering with both human and animal gene pools to pervert the creation and make our redemption impossible. They were....the primary reason God had to destroy the world and all its inhabitants in the Great Flood."
       <a href="http://gracethrufaith.com/end-times-prophecy/the-nephilim/">
        link
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So.....these Nephilim were described in the bible to be a
       <strong>
        child-sacrificing, devil worshipping race.
       </strong>
       Now where have we heard of that sort of evil recently?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we entertain the theory that the Nephilim did in fact exist, then we accept the premise that the inter-mingling of humans and extra-dimensional beings could be possible. This is relevant because in the event of alien "disclosure", the cabal will tell us that similar extra-dimensional beings have come to "enlighten" us with their advanced spirituality and technology.  They will tell us that we are all One, with one another and with these aliens, and we should become interconnected by intermingling our genes with theirs and evolving into a higher form of superhuman ourselves. I would imagine this was the type of persuasion promoted by the fallen angels in ancient Biblical times, to seduce human women to sleep with them: for the rewards of power, for immortality, for enlightenment.  By the time disclosure happens, human gene sequencing and artificial intelligence will have concurrently developed to a level where we will be able to modify our genes and perhaps become a form of "superhuman computer", part human, part machine; thus fulfilling the "huge evolutionary leap in consciousness" promised by New Age ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the Mark of the Beast referred to in Revelations is not simply an RFID microchip, but an actual form of technology that will be designed to genetically modify our human DNA with this "alien" DNA in order to become our own modern-day version of the Nephilim. The "Antichrist" pushing this Mark of the Beast may be a half-human, half AI or alien hybrid himself. It will be promoted as revolutionary; a means to become superhuman and maybe even live forever. The fine print will be that accepting the Mark of the Beast would then mean you are "initiated" into the collective body of Satan, thereby literally losing your soul to the devil.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: what did Trump mean when he said he wanted to stop the criminal cartel that is "destroying the blood of our youth?" Theory: it means they're planning to fuck with human DNA and create a "superhuman" race that will be fully programmable, trackable and controllable with our 'consent'.  The consent will come when you accept the Mark of the Beast.

       Interesting.  It does seem like there is a definitely assault on humanity on many fronts (debased entertainment, addictive zombifying technology, ethics and morals no longer being taught in schools,  not to mention vaccines, anti-depressants, GMOs, introducing gender confusion at a young age, etc), and I was trying to figure out why, and I think part of it is because the human conscience - sense of right and wrong - is dangerous to people who either have no conscience or have lost it - and it has to be destroyed for them to pull off whatever grand plans they have.  Human righteousness is a weapon, especially when people come together, which is maybe why Christianity has been so marginalized in this country.  And what better way to destroy human morality and decency than create some hybrid human. Good theory!

I frequently encountered humans in cages, usually dazed or drugged, but sometimes they cried and begged for help. We were told they were hopelessly insane, and involved in high risk drug tests to cure insanity. We were told to never try to speak to them at all. At the beginning we believed that story. Finally in 1978 a small group of workers discovered the truth. It began the Dulce Wars".

       When the truth was evident that humans were being produced from abducted females, impregnated against their will, a secret resistance group formed. This did little though. Over time they were assassinated or "died under mysterious circumstances".

       Yeah, I grew up about 100 miles from this place! I grew up in one of the most occult/paranormal influenced areas of the entire world. Haha nightmare hall is aptly named. Look into the Dulce Wars...the connection to the Bavarian Illuminati and E.T. is there.

       Sure, but that's an odd way to talk about drug trafficking.  Also noteworthy that the title of the Executive Order merely refers to "International Trafficking" and covers both human and drug trafficking, with the Policy section listing human trafficking first. Point being, it's not obvious that he's talking about drugs in that comment.
