<p>We had this as a joke &quot;conspiracy&quot; in Germany in the &#39;90s - the Bielefeld conspiracy.<br/>
People starting around whether anyone present could claim to have been in the city of Bielefeld, or knew someone.<br/>
When none made that claim for a short while, it was agreed that Bielefeld didn&#39;t exist, and anyone coming later claiming to know better was either duped or &quot;one of them&quot;...  </p>

<p>It was a quirky little joke, but the principle works here too...</p>

<p>And it didn&#39;t happen.  So they just murdered 30 kids in a governmental false flag and didn&#39;t even get the results they wanted.  But were also competent enough in their planning to cover it up.  Genius, sheer genius thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there was also the long gun that took an entire weekend to get from the trunk of Lanza&#39;s car to the crime scene. And the fact that 105 lb Lanza would have been carrying about 40 lbs of ammo, making it damn near impossible to kill all those children singlehandedly. And the fact that the video surveillance system was conveniently out of service. And the issues with some of the parent&#39;s interviews being obviously staged. </p>

<p>See, that is how you know when a castrophe is manufactured. There are many aspects of the official story that make no sense. Just like 9/11 and Boston. Now, how much controversy is associated with the Virginia Tech shootings? None. What really happened is what we were told. No need to seal records or demolish buildings. What about Columbine? No controversy there, either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All your &quot;evidence&quot; has long been refuted and you know that so  repeating it to you here is silly.  He would have needed 40 lbs of ammo.  Seriously? You just state something so absurd on its face, and just act like that&#39;s a fact.  Unreal.  You&#39;re probably confusing the fact that they found 1400 rounds in his home with thinking he carried them.  That&#39;s as benefit of the doubt as I can give your dumb statement. Here&#39;s what was actually brought.  Keep in mind the shotgun ammo was left in car.</p>

<p>Two 12-gauge shotgun magazines
10 30-round .223 magazines
6 30-round 9mm magazines
6 30-round 10mm magazines</p>

<p>So you&#39;re stating that he couldn&#39;t carry those rounds, two handguns, and a long rifle.  He was over 110 lbs by the way.  I know this as you&#39;re not the first muppet I&#39;ve heard make this ludicrous argument.</p>

<p>He left one weapon in his car and brought three in.  Well doesn&#39;t that make it clear the government did it! That&#39;s some eye rolling shit.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say they couldn&#39;t speak, not once.  But there&#39;s ramifications.  You&#39;re the one trying to stifle those by &quot;changing my tone?&quot; Fuck off with that.</p>

<p>internet detectives who want to believe so hard that they&#39;re onto the truth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, see you already got it wrong. This isn&#39;t the X-Files, nobody wants to believe this. The idea that the government would shoot or simulate shooting children to further their own agenda is nauseating and depressing. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing rewarding about realizing this is a possibility with Sandy Hook. The innate feeling of deception is unshakable.  Like that sinking feeling realized in the pit of your stomach when a loved one is lying to your face. </p>

<p>Humans have survived off our natural intuition, subconsciously processing information to avoid deception/threats/death for thousands of years. I find it strange that people so violently reject this same intuition now, for the lie that they are safe and sound. Why do you care so much what others think, it&#39;s obviously not for the healthy conversation. </p>

<p>Because there is zero evidence, and when the people who believe their &quot;intuition&quot; harrass people who had their children die, that&#39;s the real nauseating and depressing situation. Not the one made up in your head, the conspiracy to take guns that didn&#39;t actually work.  Keep ignoring that by the by. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your tone is so dismissive and aggressive with assertive declarations of what you consider is the only truth. Yet I never even asserted that Sandy Hook was for sure a false flag. The dangerous implication you make is that the mere notion that I entertain the idea is the fruitless errand of a conspiracy nut.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just navigate the way you&#39;re interacting with me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You clearly haven&#39;t been reading the cream dream projection that go on in the pizzagate talks. Fact is, there&#39;s plenty of people who desperately want to believe this shlep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You start off the reply to my comment by insulting a group of people and a conspiracy that has nothing to do with what we&#39;re talking about. Very antagonistic behavior that I&#39;m assuming you hope with elicit an emotional response. So already out of the gate we can clearly see that you are not trying to have a productive conversation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because there is zero evidence, and when the people who believe their &quot;intuition&quot; harrass people who had their children die, that&#39;s the real nauseating and depressing situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then you boldly declare there is absolutely no evidence and that we should never question tragedies that involve children because it&#39;s insensitive. This is in turn would imply that any further questioning of the official narrative by critical thinkers will label them a monster. Not exactly the best environment for a healthy discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not the one made up in your head, the conspiracy to take guns that didn&#39;t actually work. Keep ignoring that by the by.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t know this was even the central element to the conspiracy, let alone the one I made up in my very own head. Thanks for informing me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mostly I like to believe that people can be talked out of their delusions with logic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See that&#39;s your biggest problem, you&#39;re trying to convert people to your cult of personality instead of just talking to them like a fellow person. As if anyone with a differing opinion to yours is lesser.</p>
