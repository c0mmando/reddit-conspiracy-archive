       Whatever happened to Jeff Sessions rounding everyone up? Wasn't this corroborated by the 'FBI Insider'? I remember everyone saying Monday or Tuesday of last week because of the insider. Then it was "wait till Sessions is in! Then they're going down!" And yet nothing. So what's up, pizzagaters? Been saying since this started in October that I'll be with you guys with pitchforks and torches if someone is implicated in a crime and still...nothing.

       Well I've been trying to tell people that the code words originated on 4chan and all the "fbi insiders" came from 4chan, and that 4chan is not a reliable source for anything more than lulz and memes. But pizzagaters don't want to listen. Cognitive dissonance

       As far as propaganda goes, it's been a way to make Sessions look like some great Law and Order hero and miracle solver of established conspiracies (not unlike the D), meanwhile serving as a counter to all Sessions critique, his history of anti-voting right's act anti-civil rights legislation and the notion that the "massive voter fraud" claim may be used by Trump/Session/Republicans at large in order to further restrict voting rights nationwide and implement a federal Crosscheck system (system architect Kris Kobach is a Trump adviser), which is a real possibility and huge potential blow to basic democracy in this country. Also the in-progress deportation machine and further authority given to increasingly militarized police, notions of increased surveillance, etc...all ignored because Sessions will supposedly bring Pizzagate to justice. There's a long and brutal history of the right promising "law and order" while including many innocent people as targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, Sessions is promoted as a golden god, during a bizarre time when people who've been suspicious of every government in history are somehow totally on board with the new one. Not to mention the further bizarre irony of a board that wants to nationally legalize weed singing the praises of a man who irrationally hates weed and has said he fully intends on enforcing all federal laws, and weed is still schedule one.

       What are the pizzagate researchesr supposed to do? Vigilante civilian justice? No, you have to hope that the entire justice department isn't corrupt and that the FBI and other investigative agencies will do their jobs and follow up on the evidence that has been uncovered. This process will take months, even years to get in prosecutions - you are talking some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the country that are implicated with this. Some LARP on 4chan saying something about arrests doesn't have any bearing on the work that these citizen investigators are doing.

       I'm guessing you are referring to a 4chan thread that speculated on the meaning of "pizza related map" and whatnot. I remember reading about that and thinking it sounded pretty far fetched. But then you start seeing the pedo symbols as revealed in declassified FBI documents being used by organizations connected to Podesta. And all the pictures of kids and weird jokes on Comet Pizza instagram. And emails about hanging out in hot tubs with kids. Then it starts sounding plausible. Compared to some random guy on 4chan claiming he is the same "FBIanon" from last year saying arrests incoming. Anyone anonymous on the internet claiming something will happen at a specific date is almost always disinfo used to discredit a theory.

       However, I simply do not get how people don't understand that throughout time, wealthy (and therefore, usually, smart) people use their positions of power to entrench themselves and subjugate those below them, in order to protect their wealth, power and families.  We all would do the same.

       It's up to us to hold them to account, rather than focusing on semantics.

       I don't really know why most pizzagaters have it in their minds that Trump and Sessions are these big heroes who are going to save the day. I do hope something is done to put a stop to all this child porn/sextrafficking/torture/murder, But realistically, if this is true, its been going on for a very very VERY long time. Why would it suddenly get stopped now? The people are the only ones who can make a difference now, We need to stop relying on the untrustworthy's. IMO Trump has shown no interest in pedogate.(If he has said something relating to it at some point please could someone throw me a cheeky link?)

       Well you're speaking as if I've supported pizzagate. I've been saying since about a week or 2 after it began that it was a farce.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think all the pizzagate supporters have fallen for a great 4chan/internet troll and/or are part of the trolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that the "investigation" has been going on for about 5 months and nothing has happened, not one person implicated in a single crime, I'm fairly confident it's a farce.

       Everyone is mixing up hoping with fact finding. That is it. There aren't any facts around Sessions doing anything. He hasn't said a word. All there was is hope that he would based on rumor. It is ridiculous to be disappointed that nothing has happened yet, and it is equally ridiculous to keep rubbing everyone's face in it. And then equally ridiculous again if Sessions does bust a bunch of people to have a week of Itoldyousos.
