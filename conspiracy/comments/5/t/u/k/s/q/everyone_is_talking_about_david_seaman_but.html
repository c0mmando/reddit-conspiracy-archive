    <div class="md"><p>As far as propaganda goes, it&#39;s been a way to make Sessions look like some great Law and Order hero and miracle solver of established conspiracies (not unlike the D), meanwhile serving as a counter to all Sessions critique, his history of anti-voting right&#39;s act anti-civil rights legislation and the notion that the &quot;massive voter fraud&quot; claim may be used by Trump/Session/Republicans at large in order to further restrict voting rights nationwide and implement a federal Crosscheck system (system architect Kris Kobach is a Trump adviser), which is a real possibility and huge potential blow to basic democracy in this country. Also the in-progress deportation machine and further authority given to increasingly militarized police, notions of increased surveillance, etc...all ignored because Sessions will supposedly bring Pizzagate to justice. There&#39;s a long and brutal history of the right promising &quot;law and order&quot; while including many innocent people as targets.</p>

<p>Instead, Sessions is promoted as a golden god, during a bizarre time when people who&#39;ve been suspicious of every government in history are somehow totally on board with the new one. Not to mention the further bizarre irony of a board that wants to nationally legalize weed singing the praises of a man who irrationally hates weed and has said he fully intends on enforcing all federal laws, and weed is still schedule one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are the pizzagate researchesr supposed to do? Vigilante civilian justice? No, you have to hope that the entire justice department isn&#39;t corrupt and that the FBI and other investigative agencies will do their jobs and follow up on the evidence that has been uncovered. This process will take months, even years to get in prosecutions - you are talking some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the country that are implicated with this. Some LARP on 4chan saying something about arrests doesn&#39;t have any bearing on the work that these citizen investigators are doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing you are referring to a 4chan thread that speculated on the meaning of &quot;pizza related map&quot; and whatnot. I remember reading about that and thinking it sounded pretty far fetched. But then you start seeing the pedo symbols as revealed in declassified FBI documents being used by organizations connected to Podesta. And all the pictures of kids and weird jokes on Comet Pizza instagram. And emails about hanging out in hot tubs with kids. Then it starts sounding plausible. Compared to some random guy on 4chan claiming he is the same &quot;FBIanon&quot; from last year saying arrests incoming. Anyone anonymous on the internet claiming something will happen at a specific date is almost always disinfo used to discredit a theory. </p>

<p>However, I simply do not get how people don&#39;t understand that throughout time, wealthy (and therefore, usually, smart) people use their positions of power to entrench themselves and subjugate those below them, in order to protect their wealth, power and families.  We all would do the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really know why most pizzagaters have it in their minds that Trump and Sessions are these big heroes who are going to save the day. I do hope something is done to put a stop to all this child porn/sextrafficking/torture/murder, But realistically, if this is true, its been going on for a very very VERY long time. Why would it suddenly get stopped now? The people are the only ones who can make a difference now, We need to stop relying on the untrustworthy&#39;s. IMO Trump has shown no interest in pedogate.(If he has said something relating to it at some point please could someone throw me a cheeky link?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is mixing up hoping with fact finding. That is it. There aren&#39;t any facts around Sessions doing anything. He hasn&#39;t said a word. All there was is hope that he would based on rumor. It is ridiculous to be disappointed that nothing has happened yet, and it is equally ridiculous to keep rubbing everyone&#39;s face in it. And then equally ridiculous again if Sessions does bust a bunch of people to have a week of Itoldyousos. </p>
