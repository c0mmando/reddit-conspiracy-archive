       You can see many celestial objects with the naked eye, aided with an optical telescope.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are all spheres, or at least, sphere like balls of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smaller ones can be more like lumps, I must admit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in a universe where
       <strong>
        every single observable large celestial object
       </strong>
       is a sphere, why would the earth be any different?

       I have looked through a telescope and they look like disc or just lights to me.  They could be spheres but they could also not be spheres.  If they are in fact spheres I would agree with you.

       Doesn't it seems odd that flat earth theory discussion, makes people so upset? It's just talking. The levels of vitriol is outrageous.

       Yup, and it's usually followed by:

      <ol>
       <li>
        OP is trying to discredit us
       </li>
       <li>
        This is why people think this sub is crazy

        OP is a shill/troll
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       ...and etc, etc... Tis' a shame. I'm not a FE (I've entertained the idea/theory - and have my own thoughts, but I'll listen and have a discussion), but we should be able to discuss anything civilly and rationally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally really fancy Hollow or Concave Earth. I suspect there is a reason people want to shout down FE'rs, and that is because if you entertain the theory, you will uncover how many occult/esoteric secret societies are behind the Heliocentric model, and how all of a sudden the Church was like: "Yup, it's round. Forget that we said it was flat for hundreds/thousands of years. Also, sorry we burned a few people at the stake for saying it was round, clearly we were just "drunk" "...
      </p>
      <p>
       At least, that's what I got from entertaining it for some period of time, just to see and test myself....

       FE started gaining real momentum in 2015. Discrediting conspiracy theorists is a side-show to a phishing net. The purpose is to identify groups of people that can be easily manipulated into believing,
       <em>
        and potentially acting upon
       </em>
       , things that are completely counter to their previous worldview. Why? Because he who can make you believe in an absurdity can make you commit an atrocity.

       FE was never a thing before PG. Sure, a few people discussed it in here, but nobody really gave credence to it or discussed it nearly as much. Besides, it is well known  in here that FE is a debate practice thing and not a "real" conspiracy.

       Anyway, at least we agree it's a mindtrap kind of deal regardless of the timing?

       This is the stance I take. I live my life by the philosophy of:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       -Aristotle
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll entertain any theory, fully (ie. I will become the idea/believer) in order to fully entertain. I then research and come to my own conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many of us here who are like this as well, but far more who claim they are "awake" yet have not truly grasped the idea. I will end it with another quote I also live by:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I know one thing; that I know nothing
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       I am not here to debate the origins of humans but a healthy but of scepticism is a fundamental part of science.  I would say it is possiblle humans evolved from apes. Last I read they still have not found the missing link.

       This is not used by scientists. There is a clear 'progression' from our ancestors to ourselves. Just because laypeople don't understand something and use old and outdated terms doesn't mean that we don't understand the evolution of our species.

       Actually missing link is used by people who doubt the claims of human evolution.  Saying there is no clear fossil record of the evolution from ape to human.  Since science can't find it. They just say well you are a lay person and don't understand evolution!

       is "the missing link". You have to be one hell of a salesman to convince anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree on the missing link term tho, to me it looks like the entire chain is missing in this case.

       implying there is a 'missing' link is idiotic. that implies a 'great chain of being', a

       You know, you link things, says a lot of things I do wrong, but you don't really prove your point aside from pompous rhetoric. Even if I am ignorant at this field, I have other strengths. All I say is that science need a bit more than fancy language to actually prove anything.

       I don't deny anything, I too believe we come from apes, what else is there? However, I have noticed those that believe in scientism. Like this lucy thing. You know that, this isn't proving anything. It was all oooh and aaah when this was found. I believe it was some norwegians, however the oohand ahh died fast, when "the missing link wasn't such a link after all". This is no proof of anything. However I see your point, this is the closest we have come. I assume.

       It's possible that both creation and evolution are true. Even that both occurred in the same reality. I don't mean creation in the genesis Adam &amp; Eve sense, but that a higher power created our universe and it was that power's will that humans eventually evolve from apes.

       No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its been done before, and the fact that you are re-bringing this up is basically resetting the timer on the issue as if to expect a tabula rasa on the subject.  Fact is, flat earthers don't like the facts, so its pointless to debate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least with 911 debates there is enough knowledge of science to have as debate, with flat earthers there always comes a time when they reveal how little knowledge they have in many domains.  In addition, you ask them for firsthand knowledge, and thery won't even accept that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, I propose if you want to have a debate, go back in time, read EVERYTHING IN THIS SUB ABOUT FLAT EARTH and collate the arguments and counterarguments and put them into a nicely formatted reddit table.  Then discuss the support and evidence for each point of view.  Try to discredit yourself as much as the adversarial POV
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do this and publish it, only then should we have a debate.  Otherwise younare effectively spamming up this sub with stuff intelligent people already know is a distraction psyop

       No surprise that every instance of this type of discussion begins with "belief". People can "believe" whatever they want. It doesn't make it true.

       This issue shouldn't be one of belief but of verifiable evidence…and in that respect a spherical Earth wins in a landslide. How can one have a rational discussion with those that choose belief of a flawed hypothesis over verifiable evidence?

       Yes and science isn't a belive system too? Can you prove the earth is a sphere and not flat?
Because if other don't believe in what you believe, doesn't mean they are irrational. 
And if the evidence is that verifiable beyond doubt, why is it being questioned? I think asking question is important, regardless how stupid the topic might look.

       Serious question.. Is that the best proof you have?  I'm not trolling, I do not believe the earth is flat or a globe.  I have no idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spinning drain is a myth look it up, hurricanes spinning are not proof of a ball, compass is not proof either (could be difference in magnetics), volcanoes are not proof(why would anyone think this?), Telsa the greatest scientist that ever lived did not believe in gravity or a spinning ball so your scientist claim is not true, I have read many theories on satellites, I have never seen one in person and I doubt you have, so that is not proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, the globe model seems like a belief as much as god, or the flat earth.  I have never seen any first-hand proof we live on a spinning ball 1000 miles per hour.  Almost no one has, yet billions believe it.  That is called a belief.

You never answered re: different stars in opposite hemispheres. Magnetism affecting our eyes?

       This is a misunderstanding of how avionic gyroscopes work.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are designed to "self level" over time, to compensate for the fact that the Earth is round.
      </p>
      <p>
       Old ones used things like a weighted ball attached to the bottom, but newer ones use a variety of technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       One such technology is called "pendulous vanes," for vacuum gyroscopes.
      </p>

       Does this answer your question about the airplane gyroscopes, or would you like me to elaborate more?

       Well you are the one that said you "have never seen any scientific proof of a flat earth".  I gave it to you.  You "explained" it with the usual mainstream explanation which has been debunked.  It's obviously you have never researched FE because you would already know that.  I suppose it is easy to have never seen any FE evidence if you have never researched it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear on am saying you are being intellectually dishonest. I am not actually asking you to research anything because I know you have not and I don't think you will.

       Thank you! 😊 I am a recent convert to flat earth and to me after reading as much I can find, the evidence is overwhelming that the international space program is a lie and that Flat Earthers are correct. I can't say anything 100% of course, except that we definitely have been lied to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely understand why people react strongly against the theory, because I did myself when I first heard about it years ago. But after finding out that a satanic cult has been ruling humanity for God knows how long, I know there has to be some effect whether we can perceive it or not. Imho, we have been brainwashed in our schools. So I'm open to at least entertaining more out there theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Telescopes have always been made with a fish or wide screen lens which distort far away objects. If you have a good camera, just don't use that type of lens and zoom in on the planets and stars yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't take a YouTube video as proof but instead, if you can, just check it out yourself. If I'm wrong, you can call me a crazy loon, but if flat Earthers are right, the truth to our reality is right above our heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if this theory is correct and the rest of world finds out, we're looking at a massive paradigm shift in humanity. The end result might be really positive imho.

       Is there not a point at which a faulty argument becomes a distraction? If a member of the group, continuously claims Red is Blue, I understand discussing it in a civil way... But after about a thousand years of it... Doesn't there come a time when the argument no longer deserves the same level of attention as others?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course some will see flat earth as more potent than a Red V Blue argument, but I see the reaction as similar. Those who believe in sphere earth, believe this argument has been resolved, and that further discussion is a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This becomes an argument about the nature of truth. Does everything need to be continually proved every day to every individual? Do we as individuals, owe someone a discussion and explanation when it has been discussed and explained already?

       I think that FE is something that touch a nerve somehow. We can see any other conspiracy and get sucked in. Like we know more than anyone else. Maybe we do. However, if the earth is flat, that conspiracy is much bigger than every conspiracy put together. And no one said anything for 500 years!? Because that's how long the ball has existed.

       If I can say my thought of the conspiracy: It is because humans are explorers by nature. History shows it. We love to explore. And we hate to be kept captive. On a ball we have nowhere to go. In a flat earth model like Gleason's map (UN Flag), where the earth has ice walls around the world. (almost said globe :D ). And yes that is considered Antarctica. The Antarctic treaty was signed dec 1st 1959. By a lot of countries, something sticks out tho. Soviet and USA in the middle of the cold war signs treaties. I don't know, it is room for some speculation I'd assume.

       It is ok to be convinced it is a globe. But make sure that you read upon FE too, it isn't all that stupid as many tries to suggest.

       I think it is at least worth a respectful debate here in

       It's pretty much disproven by physics. Because of the nature of matter having gravity, extremely large objects will tend towards being a sphere. Flat earth theory is the dumbest thing I've ever heard, because if you take it to be true, any logical conclusion is immediately seen to not exist.

       A lively discussion of limited topics?  Distraction from things that matter, like FEMA camps and militarized police with NSA capabilities and PD's that don't know what is the constitution or bill of rights.

       As for the topic of Flat Earth, it does amuse me that people get so triggered by it. Like Pavlovian conditioning. I say that as somebody who does not believe in Flat Earth.

       FE started gaining real momentum in 2015. Discrediting conspiracy theorists is a side-show to a phishing net. The purpose is to identify groups of people that can be easily manipulated into believing,
       <em>
        and potentially acting upon
       </em>
       , things that are completely counter to their previous worldview. Why? Because he who can make you believe in an absurdity can make you commit an atrocity.
