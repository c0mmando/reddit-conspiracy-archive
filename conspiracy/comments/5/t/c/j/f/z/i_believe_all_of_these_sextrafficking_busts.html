        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1) A series of false flag-ish operations to make everyone think they are actually taking action to clean up pedophilia and child-trafficking. That way once they&#39;re done, they can tell the public &quot;We&#39;re all good now, they&#39;ve all been caught! Everyone move along now, nothing more so see here.&quot;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2) Pieces are being put into place by a coalition of insiders across the world that are actually looking to stop the elite crime rings (not just pedophilia). All of these busts of small time sex workers, pimps, and the few traffickers that have been caught so far will be used to catch the bigger fish, given plea bargains in exchange for testimonies (basically like what they did with Weiner).</p>

<p>At this point, I&#39;ve seen enough evidence for both of these scenarios that I&#39;m almost 50/50, leaning slightly more towards option 1.</p>

<p>Trump gave FBI Director James Coney blanket approval to do whatever he wants. I think Comey is a good man who had his hands tied under the Obama administration. Otherwise he wouldn&#39;t have slammed Hillary while recommending no charges. You could see he was clearly disgusted at the press conference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think insiders leaked the PG stuff.  It&#39;s probably an organized effort because the establishment was letting the pedo stuff continue.  These busts you&#39;re seeing might be legit, or they could be for show.  So far it has &quot;for show&quot; smells, from the limited set of things I&#39;ve followed.  That doesn&#39;t really mean anything, though.  If insiders leaked it the leaks will continue.  This entire story will unravel.  I don&#39;t see it stopping.  We&#39;ve already seen how deep the infection is, by observing how controlled and uniform the PR response has been.  If shit&#39;s that bad, the leakers knew this, and designed their strategy appropriately.  Just look at the legs it&#39;s got.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that they are new. They do happen and have happened. Just that there is more emphasis and budget being put towards breaking up these human trafficking rings. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be straight with you: I&#39;m not 100% convinced they are actually happening (though significantly convinced). Why are no names ever released? That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get out of these people. Who&#39;s getting busted? Why are there no documents listing the criminals being charged? When will they appear in court?</p>

<p>I have a meeting next week with someone fairly high up in the region where I live and I&#39;m going to be asking these questions. We&#39;ll see what comes of it. </p>

<p>One reason for not releasing important names though could be so that the higher ups don&#39;t know who exactly they&#39;ve got so far, otherwise they&#39;d just have them killed or give them time to cover their tracks.</p>
