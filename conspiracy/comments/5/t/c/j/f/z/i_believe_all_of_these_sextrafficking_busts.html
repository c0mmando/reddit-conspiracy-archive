       1) A series of false flag-ish operations to make everyone think they are actually taking action to clean up pedophilia and child-trafficking. That way once they're done, they can tell the public "We're all good now, they've all been caught! Everyone move along now, nothing more so see here."
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Pieces are being put into place by a coalition of insiders across the world that are actually looking to stop the elite crime rings (not just pedophilia). All of these busts of small time sex workers, pimps, and the few traffickers that have been caught so far will be used to catch the bigger fish, given plea bargains in exchange for testimonies (basically like what they did with Weiner).
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, I've seen enough evidence for both of these scenarios that I'm almost 50/50, leaning slightly more towards option 1.

       Trump gave FBI Director James Coney blanket approval to do whatever he wants. I think Comey is a good man who had his hands tied under the Obama administration. Otherwise he wouldn't have slammed Hillary while recommending no charges. You could see he was clearly disgusted at the press conference.

       Comey is not a "good man." At best, he's a craven opportunist who will turn whichever way the wind is blowing to salvage his career. Maybe that means taking down the satanic pedophilia network. We'll see.

       Personally I think insiders leaked the PG stuff.  It's probably an organized effort because the establishment was letting the pedo stuff continue.  These busts you're seeing might be legit, or they could be for show.  So far it has "for show" smells, from the limited set of things I've followed.  That doesn't really mean anything, though.  If insiders leaked it the leaks will continue.  This entire story will unravel.  I don't see it stopping.  We've already seen how deep the infection is, by observing how controlled and uniform the PR response has been.  If shit's that bad, the leakers knew this, and designed their strategy appropriately.  Just look at the legs it's got.

       It's that first thing since 70% of the arrests are johns seeking sex with adults, then the actual prostitutes that were arrested, finally there were some pimps and madames, and a very small number of johns that were seeking sex with underaged. Most of these were stings using backpage type ads for sex workers, no real hard investigations going on at all.

       Nope. You are wrong. A week ago somebody hacked Freedom hosting (darknet site host). Hacker said that there were a lot of pedo content. He sent some data to government agencies. And now they are tracking every pedo down. Thats why there are so many arrests. Hacker also said that in hacked files there are also names, aresses and other identifying info.

       As someone who has recently been reaching out to people who work against human trafficking, I can tell you for a fact that this statement is not true. No idea whether what's going on is option A or B, though.

       Not that they are new. They do happen and have happened. Just that there is more emphasis and budget being put towards breaking up these human trafficking rings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be straight with you: I'm not 100% convinced they are actually happening (though significantly convinced). Why are no names ever released? That's what I'm trying to get out of these people. Who's getting busted? Why are there no documents listing the criminals being charged? When will they appear in court?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a meeting next week with someone fairly high up in the region where I live and I'm going to be asking these questions. We'll see what comes of it.

       The only names I've seen released are the poor Johns that just wanted to exchange money for sex between two consenting adults, publicly shaming them for the rest of their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       One reason for not releasing important names though could be so that the higher ups don't know who exactly they've got so far, otherwise they'd just have them killed or give them time to cover their tracks.

       Well.. Most girls, even 18+ aren't TOTALLY consenting.. It's usual consent by threat/coercion/fear of their pimps. They're abused and told that is all they're good for.

       Wow OP good call on the pedo arrests. Why no one big so far? I've been thinking this a lot. It's like they are doing something to make it go away unless they are using the little people to rollover to have more upper hand but who knows? We will just have to see and hope it's not them feeding us BS.
