        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>Please check my older threads for information from end of November 2016 onward.. I have run out of characters because there is just so much shit going on.</p>

<p>I will continue to post until I feel there is a change of &quot;pace,&quot; and everything slows down... but I don&#39;t feel like that&#39;s going to happen anytime soon. I don&#39;t feel that I am the only one who has suddenly become &quot;awake,&quot; at something not being quite right at the moment in the world, whether it being a local change I can see or a global change as detailed below.</p>

<p>First.. read this - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events</a></p>

<p>Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;</p>

<p>&quot;But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a surprise to us,&quot; said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw</a></p>

<p>Information on the &quot;Earth Wobble,&quot;.. or pole shift etc. Whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html">http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html</a></p>

<p>We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. The Earth Wobbling is natural my only correlation in this is that where the graph gets more extreme is where I feel the world has started to respond at a similar pace.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? I don&#39;t know. Climate scientists will tell you that our water levels are causing this to happen.. but this is actually a debated topic and not proven.. essentially a &quot;theory.&quot; </p>

<p>This is just a theory of mine, so bash it all you will but take in some of the rest of this information seriously and take note because this isn&#39;t a fucking joke.</p>

<p>For Earth Changes (weather,seismic,volcanic) I started posting around November.. because November is when I started to become &quot;awake,&quot; that there is something not quite right with our planet at the moment and it is behaving abnormally.</p>

<p>Why do I say this? Most articles state that scientists are &quot;perplexed,&quot; or &quot;puzzled,&quot; at things that are happening.</p>

<p>FYI - All information is from watchers.news, an invaluable resource which is unopinionated and deals in facts. They reference various local institutions.. obviously depending on what the earth change is.</p>

<p>(I have cut content from older posts, please see those for additional information)</p>

<p>OKAY...</p>

<p>STILL WITH ME?</p>

<p>That was just November!</p>

<p>Going to pre-face December with some quick facts about Earthquakes.. because most of you will be saying &quot;volcanoes and earthquakes happen all the time.&quot; and you&#39;d be RIGHT! they do..</p>

<p>but; There have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a 6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days. (Stats from End of Dec.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.anonews.co/257-earthquakes-9days/">http://www.anonews.co/257-earthquakes-9days/</a></p>

<p>This is also referencing a cosmic energy wave, which is also being attributed (mostly on youtube unfortunately.. but nothing [mainstream] is talking about this) a helium gas cloud which we have entered bringing in higher H3,H4 into our atmosphere.
does anybody know what a brown dwarf star is made of????? (HELIUM)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCyLWFZoAlE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCyLWFZoAlE</a> - WAVES OF ENERGY BEING PICKED UP MIMIC?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oecmq94Bt7E&amp;t=4s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oecmq94Bt7E&amp;t=4s</a> - HELIUM?</p>

<p>as a caveat to the brown dwarf statement.. we are constantly moving through space so its possible we&#39;ve just entered a fuck off massive helium cloud (our entire solar system) through no means of anything nibiru, end times, or whatever related. I WISH I COULD TELL YOU!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so these trails that are being produced by a flying object are always in the direction of the sun, and the whole idea is that if there is a celestial object coming our way and closer and it&#39;s coming by the sun, they need to something to cover it up. That&#39;s why you see these weird cloud formations and linear &quot;clouds&quot;. They are covering something up. That&#39;s why just recently I&#39;ve been seeing a huge increase in these in Illinois where I live. It&#39;s coming closer, it much easier to see that&#39;s why they need to start putting these in the Midwest. It began in very northern, southern, and coastal areas. Now because It&#39;s coming closer they need to produce these trails in the Midwest and other places, it&#39;s easier to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question as I believe that the earth could very well be in a wobble.  If the earth is wobbling then shouldn&#39;t the sun be in a different place in the sky along with other celestial bodies?  For instance, there&#39;s ancient places on earth that on the Winter Equinox the sun will shine through a carving in a rock for instance, which illuminates whatever and it only happens on the winter equinox.  These things were carved out and engineered using the sun thousands of years ago and they still line up with todays sun.  If the earth has wobbled wouldn&#39;t these ancient structures fail? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surprising you didn&#39;t mention the activity at Campi Flegrei in Italy, across the Bay of Naples from Vesuvius.  It&#39;s a partially-underwater caldera left from a VEI-7 eruption of &gt;1000 km³ of material that occurred around 39000 years ago that was responsible for wiping out pre-Bronze Age settlements and created massive drops in global temperature from volcanic winter.  It has some of the most consistent and troubling signs of caldera uplift of any in the world, and scientists recently have agreed that it has reached a &quot;critical degassing phase&quot; where the pressure of the magma below can suddenly and violently escape, and cause a structural collapse triggering a super volcanic eruption.  Some 3 million+ people live in and around the volcano itself.  People often say that Yellowstone is the biggest volcanic threat facing the world today, but in all likelihood Campi Flegrei will erupt far sooner than Yellowstone will.</p>
