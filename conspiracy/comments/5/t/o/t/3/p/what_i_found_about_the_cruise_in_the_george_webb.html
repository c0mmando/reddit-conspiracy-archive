    <div class="md"><p>I have been on a Royal Caribbean cruise to Labadee. It was bad. Local beggars were trying to climb the fence to try to get into the resort area as guards were on the resort side of the fence waiting to detain them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my God! I took a Royal Caribbean cruise in 1997. I was in my 20s (but looked young). Back then, I was an attractive young lady.  There was an incident that happened to me, leaving me scared and &quot;sticking like glue&quot; to the person I went on the cruise with for the remainder of the trip.</p>

<p>I was approached by 3 foreign men (I was alone) in one of the small hallways. Nothing happened though because (Thank God) another passenger showed up in the hallway (going to their room).</p>

<p>I used that opportunity to quickly get into a populated area of the ship.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll never forget this incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before this incident, I had noticed a few men (the day before) looking me &quot;up and down&quot;, if you know what I mean. They looked middle eastern to me.  But being on vacation, I just brushed it aside - thinking they were just jerks and probably looking at all the women. I didn&#39;t say anything to them.</p>

<p>The next day I was in our cabin/room with the guy I went on the cruise with.  I was taking a long time getting ready (you know how girls are).  So he left the cabin and went ahead to the casino. I told him I would meet him there when I was done getting ready.</p>

<p>When I left the cabin to go meet him, these men (3 of them) were in the small hallway. (Maybe waiting for me? I don&#39;t know).  When I came out, the approached me.  One of the men looked me up and down and asked, &quot;Where is your man?&quot;</p>

<p>I just stood there, stunned.  I had a &quot;bad feeling vibe&quot; run through me.</p>

<p>They were only about an arm-length from me (never touched me), when (like I said) another random passenger came into the hallway.</p>

<p>I took off running. I knew with another passenger in the area that these men would not run after me (because it would look suspicious).</p>

<p>Of course, this incident could have been nothing. But in 20 years, I&#39;ve never forgotten it.</p>

<p>And, for the rest of the trip, I &quot;stuck like glue&quot; to the guy I was with.</p>

<p>I told him about it, of course.  Never saw these men again either.</p>

<p>But since nothing really happened, we didn&#39;t report it to anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminds me of something I heard about way back when the Natalie Halloway disappearance happened in 2005. The idea that human trafficking was occurring briefly got mainstream media attention.</p>

<p>There was a girl that got abducted on 1998 from a cruise ship in the Caribbean...anyways, a few years later, a US soldier stationed in Venezuela snuck off base and went to a brothel. When he sat down at the bar, a woman came up to him and basically said, &quot;I&#39;m _<em>__, I was kidnapped _</em>_ years ago in the Caribbean. Please help me.&quot; The guy said that two people took her away and the girl has never been seen since.  </p>
