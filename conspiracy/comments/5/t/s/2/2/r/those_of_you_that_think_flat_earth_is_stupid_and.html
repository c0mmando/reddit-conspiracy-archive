    <div class="md"><p>These are my favorites:</p>

<ol>
<li>No curvature - so many practical examples to point to</li>
<li>Fake space (easy for anyone with half a brain to figure out)</li>
<li>The fixed north star (somehow globeheads will point to stars as proof for the globe, yet ignore the fixed north star)</li>
<li>The suspicious emergency landings on some flights, the locations of the landings make way more sense on a flat earth map</li>
<li>The fact that no one has circumnavigated the globe north/south</li>
<li>All the weirdness going on in antarctica sure is strange, it doesn&#39;t prove anything except raise suspicion</li>
</ol>

<p>That&#39;s more than 3, but the most common reasons I bring up. People need an open mind to entertain this crazy idea. My SO still doesn&#39;t believe me even though they&#39;re a smart and sensible person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it is based on bullshit pseudoscience with no reputable sources.  It is a theory that has been confirmed by other insiders to be disinformation created with the sole purpose of muddying the waters for other conspiracies and poisoning the well.  The entire theory relies on complete ignorance of every field of physical science we know of.  Notice how none of the people who support this theory know anything about earth science?  Care to explain how plate tectonics or volcanism works with the Flat Earth theory?  Are you going to literally tell me that every single satellite feed, photographs taken from space and amateur astronomers are all in on it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again you&#39;re openly stating that you&#39;re going to defend your eyes and your questionable scientific acumen versus thousands of scientists, professional and amateur, with accredited degrees and knowledge that have proclaimed it to be bullshit.  The onus of proof is on you dude.  There&#39;s so many reasons why it&#39;s bullshit it&#39;s not worth defending, that&#39;s why most people can pretty much call it out as such on face value.  You can make an argument to say that science can be twisted to fit political and social agendas, but the insane leaps of logic required to believe that the Earth is flat is not backed up by anything reputable.  It&#39;s a conspiracy theory that requires belief in equally retarded conspiracy theories (ALL science is wrong and they&#39;re in on it) to even consider it to be true.</p>

<p>Not that any hard evidence and scientific proof will sway your opinion, it seems.  Flat Earth is bullshit.  Doesn&#39;t need rigorous research, just common sense and hundreds of years of accepted measurements and scientific data.  The educated upper classes including Christopher Columbus almost 600 years ago accepted that the Earth was a sphere.  Ptolemy considered it a fact that the Earth was round, 1300 years before Columbus.  Pythagoras believed as early as the sixth century BC that the Earth was a sphere!  But who cares, some asshole on a blog insists that Earth is flat despite all evidence to the contrary, so #woke!</p>

<p>I can safely say that people who believe in Flat Earth theory as being real are incredibly ignorant, uninformed and uneducated, and will cling to any piece of evidence that paints their theory in a positive light while ignoring any evidence to the contrary no matter how scientific or well-sourced.  It is a conspiracy theory meant to bring ridicule to the idea of conspiracy theories itself, passed around and disseminated throughout the community to poison the well against real critical thinkers that follow true conspiracies.  FET can&#39;t even explain the sunrise and sunset without destroying their own theory or inventing an equally bullshit explanation.</p>

<p>What do you think of the actual evidence that normal citizen have gathered? Even you can go to as high of a place as you can and look and see that there is no curve. You can also launch a balloon in the air with a camera and do it that way. Many people have. This isnt bullshit no matter how many times you say that. Recorded evidence isnt bullshit, its recorded evidence.</p>

<p>They do it based on the evidence that there is no measureable curvature and no visible one. </p>

<p>Your whole post was one strawman. You never adress my point which is that you can not detect any curvature and people have tried to do this many times in this age. What some people said in ancient times have no bearing on actual testable proof.</p>

<p>Unfortunately its all fantasy more than fiction, you say many good points? I cant seem to recall any which I could classify as good, a few youtube video&#39;s depicting fake NASA imagery, the flat horizon, these are not good points. </p>

<p>let me give you a website to try to explain.
<a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/THT522/c72460b">https://www.flightradar24.com/THT522/c72460b</a></p>

<p>Here you can track every commercial flight in the air at this very moment, you can clearly see commercial airlines accross the globe from every direction and heading to nearly every direction. This kind of tracking would be very hard to fake. The earth is round, it makes more sense, it&#39;s the most energy efficient shape in nature itself, all other celestial objects we can see are round. </p>

<p>Flat earth was a myth Sailors used to use back in the day when ships used to get lost at sea due to poor navigation. The stories people used to tell each other was that they sailed off the end of the earth, it was believable back then (nobody knew any better) we know better now.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You know that after a ship has went &quot;under&quot; the horizon if you take a camera and zoom in it becomes visible again. Works with phone camera or with binoculars too. If the boat was under the body of water it would not become visible when you use the zoom of a camera. The horizon line is simpy how far our human eyes see. </p>

<p>If you had ever investigated flat earth and ships going over the horizon you would have known that this isnt a problem to the flat earth model. Why dont you take a look at some youtube flat earth videos so you at least know what you are arguing against?</p>

<p>No, you don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m saying. I know wide-angle lenses exist and have been used at some point in time. What I&#39;m saying is that every single time some dumbass flat earther is presented a video, they just cry about a fish eye lens and don&#39;t respond again.</p>

<p>Not every lens is a fish eye lens. How come I have never heard a flat earther cry about barrel distortion? Pincushion distortion? Hint: because they&#39;re not the optical geniuses they think they are. You have no idea what the camera lens is, and if you did, you could get the specifications for the lens and map the distortion out to get the original geometry back.</p>

<p>Besides, the real problem is that flat earthers are never (can never, and will never) be specific about their claims. Since we&#39;re talking about some guy named Felix, what should the horizon look like from his video? Can you draw it? I&#39;ll give you an example of what I think a flat earther might expect. How close am I?</p>

<p>Curved glass distors the horizon too. Its not a big distortion but enough that some say they can see the curve.</p>

<p>Is every piece of glass a fish eye lens to you people? How do you know the window isn&#39;t correcting for the distortion in your eye&#39;s lens? How do you know the distortion is where the horizon is? Could you provide a coherent map of the distortion for any video I sent you?</p>

<p>I am not a part of any &quot;you people&quot; that you try to label me as. If you want to argue with a flat earther then find one. I am simply pointing out that some of the things that flat earthers have found is going contrary to what we have been told about the globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Study how a lens works.</p>

<p>In order to take a picture....you need a lens.  Even NASA needs a lens.  Utilizing a fish eye lens is not to &quot;give a false image&quot; its to show a wider viewing angle (nearly 180° in all directions).</p>

<p>Read this article - <a href="https://thulescientific.com/Lynch%20Curvature%202008.pdf">https://thulescientific.com/Lynch%20Curvature%202008.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reports and photographs claiming that visual observers can detect the curvature of the Earth from high mountains or high-flying commercial aircraft are investigated. Visual daytime observations show that the minimum altitude at which curvature of the horizon can be detected is at or slightly below 35,000 ft, providing that the field of view is wide (60°) and nearly cloud free. The high-elevation horizon is almost as sharp as the sea-level horizon, but its contrast is less than 10% that of the sea-level horizon. Photographs purporting to show the curvature of the Earth are always suspect because virtually all camera lenses project an image that suffers from barrel distortion. To accurately assess curvature from a photograph, the horizon must be placed precisely in the center of the image, i.e., on the optical axis.</p>

<p>From the equator you can see both the Polaris (the North Star) and Sigma Octanis (the South Star).

<p>The top diagram is a view from west to east, with the north pole on the left and the south pole on the right. As the Earth rotates west to east, the stars trace a path from east to west in the sky (the arrows represent the star path and directions). The stars always appear to move from east to west, no matter where you are.</p>

<p>The lower left diagram is the point of view of someone (P1) looking north at Polaris. The path they see the stars trace is from east to west, in a counterclockwise manner.</p>

<p>The lower right diagram is the point of view of someone looking south at Sigma Octanus. They path they see the stars trace is from east to west, in a clockwise manner.</p>

<p>This observation is impossible on a flat earth.</p>

<p>Only if the camera has a fish eye lense.</p>

<p>All cameras have curved lenses in them, and you haven&#39;t put forward any description of these &quot;fish eye lenses&quot; except any curved piece of glass doing causing it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a medium of air denser things fall and less dense than air rises.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is obviously not true because airplanes are more dense than air and rise, and aerogel is less dense than air and falls. Objects separate due to forces acting on them - in the case of falling objects, this force is gravity.</p>

<p>&quot;Density&quot; is not and can never be an explanation because it doesn&#39;t say anything about the mechanism of falling. Not to mention its complete inability to describe objects falling in a vacuum, or the strength of gravity from sources other than the Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Planes use force to rise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Planes do use lift to rise, and everything that falls does so because of the force of gravity. Keep my point about planes flying due to forces in mind for the end of my comment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Put anything more dense than water in water and it falls. No expections. Just like no expections in air. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you ignore the exceptions to your simplistic rule like aerogel and related substances... Why would you say aerographite is more dense than air when its density is a fraction of air&#39;s?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you not wonder how gravity keeps all of this water glued to this ball of rock but a helium balloon or a small particle that is less dense can just rise up and defy it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what isn&#39;t glued to the surface. If there were no atmosphere, the water would turn to gas and not be on the surface anymore. Even now, with an atmosphere, water is constantly coming and going from the oceans into the atmosphere and back. Water is constantly &quot;defying&quot; gravity as you put it - but defying is obviously the wrong word.</p>

<p>Planes rise because they generate enough lift to overcome the force of gravity. Ballons rise because the weight of the water displaced is greater than the weight of the object itself - density can be used as an intermediate in that type of calculate, yes, but it is always the forces that do the explaining.</p>

<p>What flat earthers never seem to understand is the concept of net forces.</p>

<p>I know.

    <div class="md"><p>No you are absolutely wrong.</p>

<p>From the equator you can see both the Polaris (the North Star) and Sigma Octanis (the South Star). As you look at Polaris (the North Star) you can see the stars revolve around it counterclockwise. at the same time from the same location on the equator you can see Sigma Octanis (the South Star) and the stars revolve around it clockwise.</p>

<p>If you are so dedicated to find the truth a little trip to the equator will prove it to you.</p>

<p>Or you could pull out a random phone book and find a random person that lives on the equator, give them a call and ask the to look and confirm what I am saying.</p>

<p>Somehow, though, I think you don&#39;t want to prove this one way or the other. </p>

<p>globeheads often point to the northern/southern hemisphere star trails as a &quot;proof&quot; of the globe. All it really proves is that we don&#39;t live under a simple dome like a lot of flat-earthers believe. It sure as hell doesn&#39;t prove a globe because there&#39;s no parallax and polaris has always stayed fixed above the north pole for thousands of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That does not prove the earth is a globe. And it&#39;s the most common evidence that&#39;s brought up to try and prove the globe model. Why try to prove the globe with stars when you can easily prove it with a curvature test?</p>

<p>There is no curvature.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://thenarrowgateweb.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/sgu-from-pole-to-pole-pe-half-1200-cp9.jpg">this pic</a> of star trails, taken from the equator looking east. How does this prove &quot;outer space&quot; as it&#39;s been told to us? Things are nothing like they seem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only truth it proves is perspective.</p>

<p>Look at any timelapse of star trails and notice the complete lack of parallax. Parallax is absolutely necessary to prove that stars are millions and billions of miles apart. Stars are clearly moving on fixed paths above the earth.</p>

<p>Polaris is FIXED above the north pole. Has been for centuries, will be for centuries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are not willing to look at valid evidence then you do not want to see the truth, or you know the truth and have an agenda different than the truth.</p>

<p>You can look into this if you want the truth, or you can ignore it if you want to spread misinformation to muddy the water.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the quick rundown, verify or ignore, your choice determines if you seek truth or follow the dark side.</p>

<p>It takes 5-6 hours to fly across the US.</p>

<p>Look at your favorite flat earth map. Call the width of the USA &quot;one (1) USA unit&quot;.</p>

<p>Look at the distance from Santiago, Chile (SCL) to Auckland New Zealand (AKL) on your flat Earth map.</p>

<p>The distance between Santiago and Auckland on your flat Earth Map is about &quot;ten (10) USA units&quot; as related to the size of the USA.</p>

<p>If the USA flight is one unit and the Santiago to Auckland flight is 10 units, that means it would take 10 times the amount of the USA flight time to get from Santiago to Auckland. </p>

<p>So if the USA flight takes 5 hours that means the Santiago to Auckland flight would take 50 hours according to your flat Earth map.</p>

<p>It takes Qantas about 13 hours to fly between Santiago and Auckland. That&#39;s just about &quot;2.5 USA units&quot; if you look at a globe of Earth, you will see that the distance between Santiago and Auckland is about 2.5 USA width units.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t say Qantas is lying. If you go there you are hopeless. Or do some real research and contact someone that has or is going to travel from Santiago to Auckland</p>

<p>If you are not smart enough to figure out what I just described, then you are surely not smart enough to determine that the Earth is flat.</p>

<p>Images that show a concave and flat horizon are caused by wide angle or fisheye lenses. If the horizon is below the middle of the image it becomes flat and the farther you go it becomes more and more concave. That&#39;s what fisheye lenses do. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen multiple times from multiple Flat Earthers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQITXbcz2hg">this video</a>, of the &quot;little piggy&quot; weather balloon. The video and its flat horizon has been upheld as some sort of incontrovertible proof that the Earth is flat. However, what they fail to realize is that by declaring that the image of the horizon in the video is flat they are actually supporting globe Earth theory.</p>

<p>If you venture three clicks into the &quot;related&quot; videos section, you will find the raw footage of the weather balloon in its entirety. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbtXZm_BPe8">In this section in particular</a>, the balloon pops and the camera starts falling towards the earth. You&#39;ll notice that the horizon distorts <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rRCGi8q.png">concave up</a> when it is below the centerline of the video, and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wRzFWMK.png">concave down</a> when it is above the centerline. This is indicative of the optical distortion of a <a href="http://www.lenstip.com/upload2/17906_sam8_dys.jpg">fisheye lens</a> .</p>

<p>Now if we go back to the flat earth video you&#39;ll notice that the horizon does indeed <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VF5fmdf.png">appear flat</a>, which would have a curvature of zero. However, I&#39;d like to draw attention to the fact that it is below the centerline of the video, meaning that the actual horizon being filmed has a more negative curvature than the image. This means that the actual horizon is concave down, which would be indicative of a globe Earth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m flabbergasted whenever this video is posted, because all anyone has to do is look up the raw footage and verify for themselves. Instead they&#39;ve taken a random youtuber on blind faith. For shame.</p>

<p>Right. That&#39;s why the videos you are looking at are false representations of reality. Discard them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah fish eye lenses distort the image what about the balloons that don&#39;t have fish eye lenses?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have no idea which videos have a fisheye or not. Therefore you must discard all video and images from balloons unless you do it yourself.</p>
