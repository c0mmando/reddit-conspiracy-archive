        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m making a prediction. </p>

<p>Zero people named in the &quot;pizzagate&quot; conspiracy theory will be arrested today. The Clintons, the Podestas, James Alefantis, Marina Abramovic- none of these people will be arrested today.</p>

<p>What may happen: Somewhere in the world, maybe today, maybe within a week or so, there will be some event, arrest, announcement, news release, celebrity break-up that has some broad kind of element relating to sex, children, politicians, celebrities, wahsington or anything within six degrees of separation from any of that or the brother-in-law of the hairdresser of the former college roomate of someone named in the conspiracy. I give it 50/50 that at least some in this sub and on voat will take that vaguely connected event as confirmation of the validity of Seaman&#39;s prediction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far knowledge and science have no idea how the reality we experience is perpetually generated or what the primary source of it is. </p>

<p>We experience the world around us as a perfectly flat material plane in all directions. If it was a ball, by all rights we ought to be able to see and measure it&#39;s curvature yet that cannot be done, and kindly don&#39;t tell me that a laser beam gets curved or pulled down by gravity because it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>According to quantum physics, nothing exists until it is observed, including our own physical bodies. Everything is continually unfolding before our consciousness and enfolding behind it. Billions of frames of three dimensional spaces sequentially unfolding and enfolding with every passing second to create the illusion of motion and the narrative of life that appears to pass through them when it is in fact our consciousness that is just as paradoxically passing through them that is responsible for that illusion.</p>

<p>The answer to the question is neither a flat plane nor a ball but something else altogether and beyond the limitations and restrictions of our physical senses or even any technology whose results we are still limited by those very same senses and how they operate when it comes to interpreting whatever additional information the provide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, that literally made no sense whatsoever. The world is never seen as a flat infinite plane. If that were true, with a good enough telescope, you could see Hawaii from LA. But you can&#39;t. And no, lasers don&#39;t bend, which is why if you track a ship sailing away from you with a laser, you will eventually lose it over the curvature of the earth. This shit is so easily verified experimentally that the utter stupidity of the flat nonsense gives me an aneurysm. </p>

<p>Kathryn says:</p>

<p>I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island.</p>

<p>Then Susaner says:</p>

<p>The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus?</p>

<p>Question... </p>

<p>How did Susaner knew it was pizza related and that it has a map? Since Kathyn only said it was white w/ black. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should do some research on his father, of course people who dismiss blatant connections as baseless conspiracy don&#39;t do much leg work when it comes to this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Some facts from Harry&#39;s IMDB page 
(<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2124178/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2124178/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm</a>)</p>

<p>Elected President of the North Carolina Crime Stoppers Association (two terms). Served as Executive Director for Protect-A-Child, a national, non-profit organization to prevent abuse and abduction of children. Appointed by Governor Jim Martin to the Governor&#39;s Commission on Child Victimization.</p>

<p>In 1988, President Ronald Reagan selected Harry to join 15 other broadcasters to visit US Military Instillation in Colorado. They received national clearance from the US Defense Department to visit the Cheyenne Mountain Nuclear Bunker the alternate command center for NORAD.</p>

<p>Harry worked on federal , state and local task forces fighting the war on drugs. He served five years with the Rowan County ABC police. Duties included: stakeouts, watching illegal stills, patrolling the county for suspected bootleggers transporting non-tax paid whiskey, working undercover to purchase illegal liquor and participating in raids on stills and gambling houses. Their agency also worked with the U.S. Treasury Department&#39;s local office of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms which increased their coverage area to eight counties.</p>

<p>You know, just a normal everyday citizen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tmz.com/2016/11/04/abc-news-linsey-davis-fake-crime-scene/">http://www.tmz.com/2016/11/04/abc-news-linsey-davis-fake-crime-scene/</a></p>

<p>My point is. No journalist is ever going to have a 100% accuracy rate, and holding someone accountable to that is foolish.</p>

<p>Of course it will result in slander, we are all human. People make mistakes, sometimes they are wrong. Whether that&#39;s about 1 thing or everything is what is left up to debate by me.</p>

<p>David can be wrong about adrenochrome and still be right about pizza gate. His research has lead him in plenty of directions, he just needs to do a better job vetting the info before sharing it with his followers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem I&#39;m noticing is when people like this get to close to the subject and it becomes part of their every breathe everything they see and hear becomes pizzagate related, and that&#39;s what scares me. they tend to disconnect from reality and drift further into this pizzagate world until what they stood for initially no longer applies. </p>

<p>That being said the reason people get so lost in the pizzagate world is because despite the high level political involvement being unconfirmed, its at least revealed how prominent human trafficking and pedophelia is independently. How this shit is going on right under our noses is disturbing and easy to feel like regular life should take a back seat until we get the problem sorted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I admire the fact so many of you brave the derision and mocking and refuse ro be apathetic or in denial like 99% of Americans.  As a survivor myself that moves me and what I experienced is nothing to the horrors visited in the helpless and innocent every day and they have no Marvel Comics hero coming to the rescue.  It&#39;s only endless fear and despair and hell on earth.</p>

<p>I am Christian and I do believe absolutely in Rebirth through Christ but more and more I wonder if the Cathars were right and this is hell, here and now. And our suffering (and those blessed with happy lives) are all just a turn on the wheel of reincarnation molding our souls for the divine.  Sometimes that&#39;s all that gets me through a day.  The only way I can reconcile a Jesus loving 5 year old got left alone in the closet to experience the end of trust and innocence is that we have free will and without it we would never learn and grow.  We would just be slaves, safe and comfortable but never realizing the triumphs and joys either.</p>

<p>My parents refused ti believe me or do anything and that sticks with a person. Now I am 39 with a son of my own and trying to let that anger and hurt go.</p>

<p>You guys help a lot.</p>

<p>You all who refuse to give up or be dissuaded from trying to get this blown open wide are my heros.  Just needed yall to know that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a believer in pizzagate. I do think there are a lot of evil people in the world, including Clinton, but I do not see the evidence in the emails. I interpret the pizza gate emails more innocently.</p>

<p>I do, however, believe to an extent in psychic powers and ability to read people by looking at them. I will continue to try to keep an open mind on pizzagate and to listen to you guys. My question is, how many believers are going  more by their gut feelings rather than the emails? I wouldn&#39;t judge that negatively, I just want to understand where pizzagate believers are coming from. Is this a feeling you have and can you describe how that works and how often your intuition is right?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe a majority of the stuff on this sub, and while i find it entertaining, I think some of the people here are batshit insane.  With that said, I believe that with this whole Pizzagate thing, there is something there.  </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because pedophilia is everywhere.  It&#39;s in the Vatican, it&#39;s in Hollywood, it&#39;s been found all over Asia and Europe, and it&#39;s in our hometowns.  Why would it <em>not</em> be in DC?  Why would slimy, corrupt politicians and our extremely powerful intelligence agencies not be involved?  There&#39;s just too much potential for blackmail, which is the basis for politics in general.  </p>

<p>And then you involve convicted human traffickers, and convicted pedophiles like Jeff Epstein?  What about the owner of Comet Pizza&#39;s Instagram - that&#39;s not a false flag, that&#39;s this guy posting pictures of statues of famous gay lovers and some other strange shit.  This thing might be overblown in terms of scope or scale, but there is definitely something here, involving some clearly less-than-ethical &quot;public servants&quot;.</p>

<p>There was a book written in the 1980&#39;s that stated that statues of him &quot;remain without doubt one of the most elevated and ideal monuments to pederastic love of the whole ancient world&quot;.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s just another small find that has paedophile connotations in it - adding to the large pile of small finds.</p>

<p>This thing might be overblown in terms of scope or scale, but there is definitely something here, involving some clearly less-than-ethical &quot;public servants&quot;.</p>

<p>Who has ever denied there aren&#39;t a percentage of pedophiles in any significantly sampled population?</p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying here would not be what has been hyped as &quot;Pizzagate&quot;. (Where some here are saying 30 or 50% of some huge subset will be arrested. Or that the Clintons or their key staff are all involved. See how very different that is from what you wrote?)</p>

<p>That&#39;s what people being called shills here have been trying to say, and being received with anger for saying. They aren&#39;t saying there&#39;s no such thing as child abuse in the hallowed halls of politics. That&#39;s probably false, and proof is the issue here. </p>

<p>This would be like someone saying for months that Bank ABC has been systematically cheating the automated stock market. And then some dude from Bank DEF gets a one-off arrest for some financial crime, and someone uses that to say, &quot;see there, we told you so!&quot;</p>

<p>People shouldn&#39;t get labeled as &quot;paid shills&quot; for challenging evidence. Or for requiring more of it. Or for pointing out that a sliver of evidence against Person A is no indictment of Person B, just because they&#39;ve met before. </p>

<p>They take a very pragmatic approach, and have a big discussion at the end about how we can&#39;t get ahead of ourselves and act without proper information like reddit did with the boston bombing.</p>

<p>Key thing is, &quot;pizzagate&quot; is a distraction, and the reality behind it is nothing new, and is no secret.</p>

<p>Insiders knew as far back as Bill Clinton&#39;s presidency that Hastert was a serial pedophile, he molested kids as a wrestling coach before he was ever in politics. Throughout his time in office, people knew it was being covered up and kept secret.</p>

<p>Same with Jimmy Saville, and so many others.</p>

<p>Also, Trump is so egotistical, that for him to see such a great opportunity to be a the heroic president he sees himself as...it just isn&#39;t something that I think he wants to pass up. Especially if the rumors are true that intelligence personnel is sick of it and willing to work with him.</p>

<p>If your understanding of &quot;pizzagate&quot; is limited to Comet Ping Pong, Podesta, and Alefantis, you are missing a LOT of information.</p>

<p>This is just public relations for Trump targeting a specific sub.  He won&#39;t arrest Clinton; He won&#39;t release info on 9-11, and he won&#39;t audit the Federal Reserve.   This is the Right&#39;s version of the 2008; Obama wasn&#39;t going to stop wars, he wasn&#39;t going to close Guantanamo and he was not going to Change things.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m one of those people who has a crazy intuition in things. I can&#39;t say it happens very frequently but when it does I&#39;m dead on and freak out my friends... I usually get a sense of a situation and an emotion attaches for me. I suppose it&#39;s the best way to describe it. Early on I looked through the pizza gate theory and my stomach sunk, it made me almost physically ill.. Since then I&#39;ve stayed away, I don&#39;t want to believe it but I trust my gut feeling too, and according to that pizza gate is potentially very real, or pieces of it are. In comparison, the first time I looked into the 9/11 theory I was sick for days until I uncovered so much information that I had a clear answer and I knew it wasn&#39;t what I wanted to be the truth but I pushed on because of how I was feeling. Also, whenever I&#39;m looking at new theories my ears will get red hot or ice cold, ice cold typically means dead end but when they&#39;re red hot I usually discover a new theory to something or other. I hope this makes sense or answers your question. </p>

<p>But these were obviously not pedophile busts. They were sweeps of street level pimps, prostitutes and johns. A few of the prostitutes were underage. So they can claim pedo busts. In the press releases anyways.</p>

<p>One interesting thing. If you can find footage of the press conferences, and read the press releases, and reports, the number of agencies involved is mind blowing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hangthebankers.com/pizzagate-major-pedophile-bust-california/">http://www.hangthebankers.com/pizzagate-major-pedophile-bust-california/</a></p>

<p>&quot;More than 30 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and task forces, including the Los Angeles Regional Human Trafficking Task Force, participated in the third annual “Operation Reclaim and Rebuild” enforcement operation, according to a sheriff’s news release.&quot;</p>

<p>All those resources, 30 agencies no less, literally dozens and dozens of people publicly proclaiming they were abused by the Hollywood elite, and the best they can do is round up a few pimps, hookers.</p>

<p>30 agencies. All those staff people. Standing up and proclaiming pedo busts. They all know that these aren&#39;t pedo busts. They all are standing there knowing what is going on and what isn&#39;t going on. 30 agencies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile..... where are the Podestas? The Clintons? Alefantis? The Hollywood elite?</p>

<p>Business as usual.</p>

<p>Looks like if there is no vigilante justice meted out there will be no justice.</p>

Anybody can edit HTML and make a page show things that aren&#39;t really there and then screenshot it. With how fast most of this shit was shut down and the way it all played out, it honestly seems like James alefantis is a CIA op who ran a psyop on us and it worked out beautifully. They just flooded conspiracy sites with all kinds of bullshit and everyone bit the bait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best, most concise post I&#39;ve read yet on &quot;Pizzagate&quot;.</p>

<p>Notice all the replies to DS on Twitter that are encouraging him. They all say in some way, &quot;we know it&#39;s true, so keep working on it&quot;.</p>

<p>Saying I <em>know</em> something is true takes a lot for me. I can believe it is, think it is, want it to be, or hope it isn&#39;t. But the level of proof I need to <em>know</em> something is true needs miles more documentation than those people on Twitter are even stopping to consider. </p>

<p>One analogy might be someone who &quot;knows&quot; that GHW Bush was involved in the JFK assassination because they have evidence he was in the state of Texas when it happened. </p>

<p>Being ultimately famous, and also being in Texas, does not equate to me &quot;knowing&quot; anything about his level of knowledge or participation in a Dallas assassination. Nor does Bush being personally acquainted with thousands of other people, due to his government job. Proximity to, nor acquaintance with, other people does not constitute &quot;knowing&quot; he&#39;s a murderer.</p>

<p>Key issue here is &quot;famous&quot;. That&#39;s where people make the stretch. Nobody could possibly deny that child abuse or sex trafficking exists. But tying famous people to it on the basis of their general proximity or the thousands of people they cross paths with, is ludicrous. </p>

<p>Anyway, sorry, your post was far more concise than mine. Well done!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was known for going on vacations.  Other kids were known for being National Merit finalists or brilliant actors; I was known for absurd vacation tees and little else.
&quot;You&#39;re on island time!&quot; one faded t-shirt from the Caribbean declared. I thought this one was especially comfortable, so I wore it often. It became a school saying. If someone was late to class, especially if that someone was me, the students would look at each other and say, &quot;Dave must be on island time.&quot;</p>

<p>Lets be real thou, shit may not go down today, tomorrow, or ever..</p>

<p>You got to look from a bigger angle..</p>

<p>Just look at the sick fucked up shit what we have uncovered... Normal, hard working, everyday Americans teamed up from all across the country to QUESTION and INFORM THEMSELVES. We&#39;ve stepped up to the plate when MAJORITY of our elected officials coward in the shadows. The elite are scared, they tried to shove the corrupt whore down our throats and they still failed to get her in. The media hasnt done shit, the FBI/CIA/NSA knows damn well whats going on and they still havent done shit. You and I must continue to fight to expose this to the public. For OUR COUNTRY and FOR THE FUTURE. Dont give into the bullshit comments in here. Question everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m waiting to laugh at the 4chan brigade on this subreddit as well as the entirety of that website. Nothing will happen today. I asked these people to provide one credential for this man, and they ignored it. At least that last person who made the disinformation story about a coup was a CIA memeber. Trump being elected isn&#39;t a coup, it&#39;s just democracy and anyone who thinks it was clearly is contradicting themselves as a conspiracy theorist/patriot. That man also said that Clinton would be arrested, as well as others, for child trafficking, pedophilia, etc. Nothing happened, and that person was supposedly credible. It turned out that he was just a controlled opposition shill.</p>

<p>They&#39;re laughing at you, 4chan brigade and believe me, they don&#39;t give a shit about you. They aren&#39;t going to DDoS your worthless website or delete posts. That&#39;s ridiculous. They would shut it down immediately if anything clandestine or incriminating came out. No real FBI or CIA agent would post on there either because there&#39;s such a thing as being surreptitious. I mean, do you really think 4chan is secure? It&#39;s not on the deep web, literally any troll can go on there and roleplay as an agent. You actually think a real agent would post on there, really? If anything, the agents on there are reading posts and obtaining the IP addresses of everyone posting. That way they have a document of every white supremacists, extremists, two-bit script kiddie hackers, and anti-government people that post there. You people are a joke.</p>

The issue with PG now is that the perpetrators have had tons of time to destroy immediate evidence, intermediate evidence and are in the process of unraveling their associations with companies and people that are clearly associated with PG.  Granted, they won&#39;t be able to completely unravel their associations, but the big names we are wanting to see arrested will not happen.

There’s a benefit to angering the public. “It’s often better to piss someone off than to leave them ambivalent.” It doesn’t matter whether they like you, only whether they remember you.

    <div class="md"><p>How are weird photos and strange wording in emails evidence of child trafficking?</p>

<p>I think, if you have thousands of people sifting through every connection to a group of people, reading emails without knowing the events or people they refer to, you are guaranteed to find things worded in strange ways. Because people who know each other understand their histories and inflections in ways that strangers won&#39;t, and because most people communicate awkwardly from time to time.</p>

<p>That some writing meant to be private will seem odd to the public is not suspicious, it&#39;s guaranteed given the the circumstance.</p>

<p>As for the weird photos, which in particular? The kid taped to a table? Here&#39;s a humor site from years ago with kids taped to the wall. <a href="http://www.boomsbeat.com/articles/2097/20140331/kids-taped-on-the-wall-with-duct-tape-photos.htm">http://www.boomsbeat.com/articles/2097/20140331/kids-taped-on-the-wall-with-duct-tape-photos.htm</a> Neither sinister nor particularly unusual.</p>

<p>The one with &quot;chickenlover&quot; in the comments? The sinister interpretation is that it&#39;s supposed to be a term for a gay man seeking a younger lover. Only the child in the image is a girl. And the term in the gay community is &quot;Chicken Hawk&quot; not chicken lover, and it doesn&#39;t refer to toddlers.</p>

<p>I find all of it massively unconvincing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one of the biggest problems with conspiracy theory is the tendency to latch onto any coincidence as though it&#39;s somehow meaningful.</p>

<p>I only went on google to search for a moment, and while I couldn&#39;t quickly find statistics for molestation, trafficking or statutory rape, I did find a study showing that in 2009, in the US alone there were almost 5000 arrests for possession of child pornography. Elsewhere I found sex abuse cases reported for the UK were above 8800, and that&#39;s a country with a fraction of the US population.</p>

<p>If you take all the crimes related to child sex abuse, it would be surprising if a day went by without some number of arrests, even if they tend to be clumped together in particular raids.</p>

<p>So a child sex abuse arrest itself is not a coincidence, clearly.</p>

<p>Is the particular perpetrator a coincidence? He&#39;s not high profile in his own right, every news article refers to him as Jerry Sandusky&#39;s son. Not even his name in most headlines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;teabagging&quot; is slang for placing your testicles in someone&#39;s mouth or on their face, often while they are asleep, unconscious or otherwise incapacitated.</p>

<p>Yet millions of tea shops worldwide offer tea bags to their customers. Are they advocating for sexual assault? Secret rape parlors?</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that just about any food or common word has been slang for sex or violence or something unsavory in some context at some point. Almost every object that is longer than it is wide has been used as a metaphor for a penis.</p>

<p>As a society, we are middle schoolers.</p>

<p>So the fact that a piece of crude slang can apply to a business is not particularly interesting. The fact that an image so basic that stock image shops sells multiple variations is not interesting:

    <div class="md"><p>In order to arrest, you must have enough evidence to potentially convict, and in order to convict that evidence must hold up beyond any reasonable doubt in a court of law.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case just yet and the deliberate failure and foot-dragging by all the responsible authorities to immediately obtain search and seizure warrants on the grounds of reasonable suspicion the moment all the indications of a possible crime in progress were there and in order to obtain any and all incriminating evidence has left more than ample time for anyone who&#39;s not a complete and utter fool sitting on any to destroy and permanently get rid of it and carefully cover their tracks.</p>

<p>The elites are at war and always have been with all of the ordinary people who are too dumbed down to believe that these creatures have absolutely nothing in common with them, least of all any common decency and it&#39;s a 24/7 a no holds barred assault against the mind, body, and souls of all those ordinary people.</p>

<p>One of their favorite and most effective ways to impress ordinary people everywhere that they are completely powerless against them and don&#39;t stand a chance is to surreptitiously build up their hopes for a positive outcome of any kind only to dash them to pieces just when they appear to be within reach and they rarely miss any opportunity to do it and take a great deal of delight in doing it.</p>

<p>So be aware and beware of a serious let-down coming our way and understand that this particular battle against them is one that they have been waging against us and the common decency of ordinary people everywhere for centuries and there&#39;s a lot more to do to finally pull it completely out of the closet, into the bright light of day, and to put any kind of a realistic end to them and it.</p>

<p>If nothing else the conspiracy of elite pedophilia, trafficking networks and the ritual abuse and even murder of their victims has moved up significantly on the list of ones that won&#39;t go away and at the same time there&#39;s been a huge increase in the number of people that now realize that such high level conspiracies can and do, in fact, exist. </p>

<p>There&#39;s still a ways to go to reach the tipping point where more do than don&#39;t and it will have to reach that point before any real action will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is conspiracy that the elite are involved in pedophile rings. Sandusky was an elite member of society who ran his own personal sex slave operation. Those two are directly related and it&#39;s interesting you claim to speak for the investigation when you don&#39;t know shit about it. </p>

<p>What do these dates have in common?</p>

<p>The Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses have claimed &quot;the end of Times&quot; would come in each and every one.  Aaaaannnndddd....it never happened.  Why do I bring this up?</p>

<p>For the last week and a half we&#39;ve had around a dozen front page posts claiming that Podesta, the Clintons, or any number of other larger names amongst the PizzaGate conspiracy name list, would be arrested publicly.  Then those posts would be followed by the &quot;source&quot; of the information backtracking and saying something along the lines of &quot;we were off on the date and time...maybe next week&quot;.  FFS last week there was a widely distributed &quot;alternative facts&quot; post about the Clintons fleeing the country.  Yet here we are only a handful of days later and the Clintons are still in country, not arrested.</p>

<p>Seriously, this is getting stupid.  I get it, we want people investigated, we want all of these tidbits of information which are all extremely suspicious and point to some very serious accusations to be looked over and some action to be taken.  But this &quot;anonymous source&quot; bullshit is getting old.  We don&#39;t accept &quot;anonymous sources&quot; when CNN, MSNBC, FOX, or other &quot;news&quot; uses them to push lies and propaganda, why in the fuck are we so accepting of them for our pet projects?</p>

<p>So please, for the sake of credibility, or sanity at least, Stop.  Getting.  Baited.</p>

<p>If none of the people I listed are involved, then what does &quot;pizzagate&quot; even mean? That some person who is famous in some way or connected to someone well known in some way will be involved with some sort of sex with minors? That&#39;s inevitably true. That also has nothing to do with Podesta&#39;s emails or Alefantis instagram. If these specific people aren&#39;t involved, then the theory is meaningless. Pedophiles exist isn&#39;t something that&#39;s particularly controversial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tenuous, I&#39;ll give you, by your definition of pizzagate. I am also not one of those who are very uptight on semantics of what &quot;is&quot; and what &quot;isn&#39;t&quot; pizzagate, and it seems the definition you ascribe to only involves a small handful of people.</p>

<p>My point is that it&#39;s very stupid to argue over the minutiae of what &quot;is pizzagate&quot; and what &quot;isn&#39;t pizzagate&quot;, when we are discussing massive, widespread, pedophilia, in rings that cannot and do not exist without overlap. Many people (whether their definition is right or wrong by your opinion or mine) consider pizzagate to be much larger in scope than your definition. I don&#39;t know how long you&#39;ve been paying attention, but these are not new definitions. Sandusky may not be one of the five people you consider pizzagate, but for many, it&#39;s a large bust.</p>

<p>You weren&#39;t wrong in your OP. You were exactly right. None of the biggest names got hit today. But to argue that this isn&#39;t a big name bust among many busts lately is just false. To outright say that this isn&#39;t pg is your opinion, and time will tell. Just keep in mind what you&#39;re downplaying.</p>

<p>Also, Trump is so egotistical, that for him to see such a great opportunity to be a the heroic president he sees himself as...it just isn&#39;t something that I think he wants to pass up.

<p>This is just public relations for Trump targeting a specific sub.  He won&#39;t arrest Clinton; He won&#39;t release info on 9-11, and he won&#39;t audit the Federal Reserve.   This is the Right&#39;s version of the 2008; Obama wasn&#39;t going to stop wars, he wasn&#39;t going to close Guantanamo and he was not going to Change things.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s really hypocritical of pizza neighers because they claim we are making wild accusations, wild assumptions, the whole 9 yards but they simply just look the other way and say, &quot;nope, nah, notta, it doesn&#39;t exist, blah blah.&quot;</p>

<p>Talking about far out assumptions, at least we have heavy circumstantial evidence. I mean for Pie sake, people have been detained for lesser damning evidence than this!</p>

I agree with your post, but I did not want to reply to each and every comment here with a rant, so I instead commented what I wanted to say.
