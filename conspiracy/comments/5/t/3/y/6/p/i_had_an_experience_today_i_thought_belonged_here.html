        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Granted this could be &quot;climate change&quot; whatever that means at this point.  I know weather is more erratic I guess is the best word now.  But man, that was something.  I looked up from my auger and saw the clouds light up with gold as the snow came down.  And then maybe a mile out to the north I saw a giant crack of lightning make landfall and a few more streak across the sky.  It was so awesome and spellbinding, especially the thunder that scared the piss out of me.  But I immediately got this very odd feeling.   Like this just wasn&#39;t normal and shouldn&#39;t be happening.</p>

<p>Granted &quot;thunder snow&quot; has always been a thing and I wasn&#39;t the only person who this today.  <a href="https://www.boston.com/weather/local-news/2017/02/09/watch-people-are-witnessing-thunder-snow-across-new-england">A lot of other people saw what I saw today.</a> For the first time ever in their lives here in New England.  I&#39;m convinced this is HAARP.  I know it&#39;s far fetched, but this feels like weather fuckery to me.  </p>

<p>It weirdly aligns with this <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/national/superstitious-lunar-eclipse-rare-comet-and-full-snow-moon-all-coming-friday/pBd71MkjT4GGm29lS5Mw7H/">eclipse tomorrow, the New Year Comet</a>, a bunch of other garbage.  As beautiful as it was, I couldn&#39;t help thinking it&#39;s George Soros trying to blanket new York in snow for some nefarious reason, maybe to protect the Clintons from Sessions.  Yes, I am that crazy-old-second-movie-Mulder.  Do any of you here believe Geoengineering is even a thing and do you think its going on right now?  Possibly related to chemtrails and all that?  The sky is literally mostly long whispy clouds behind jets up here.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know is I see planes leave long trails on a daily basis.  The long straight wispy clouds are in the sky every day unless it&#39;s so cloudy that I can&#39;t discern any particular type of cloud.  One day I counted four planes in 10 minutes leaving their trails.  Then in the same few moments, a normal plane w/ no trail (so it can&#39;t just be &quot;weather-related&quot; why the trails remain...)  To me this is the craziest thing happening now.  WTF are these things for?!  I would love to bury my head in the sand once in a while and pretend the world isn&#39;t so messed up but it&#39;s hard when even the sky above us is affected.  There was a video linked from a website on here earlier that showed particles actually coming down from the sky (possibly from planes) in Florida.  The guy was talking about the hypocrisy of people marching for the environment without questioning what&#39;s going on in the sky. </p>

<p>Where I live, the past 1-2 weeks have alternated between a few very overcast and windy days, with clouds completely blocking out the sky almost 24/7, and clear days. </p>

<p>On the nights when the clouds have cleared up, I have definitely noticed a lot more planes leaving trails behind them in the sky, and then what do you know, the next day it&#39;s back to being overcast.</p>

<p>I never thought anything of the &quot;whatever&quot;-trails because I&#39;ve seen them forever and growing up as well as currently I&#39;ve lived super close to airports. It struck me as weird the other day because a few days ago there were a ton of trails (sunny and normal) and I did see a few planes leaving them. It was super cloudy the next day with crazy wind and it downpoured for half the night. The day after was cloudy but not too bad (I didn&#39;t see any trails) and today was pretty normal, back to sunny, not as humid and also no trails. </p>

<p>I understand the concept of Chemtrails vs contrails and I know this sounds like a pretty explainable scenario lol. I&#39;m not sure that I think there&#39;s anything sinister to it at all but if someone wants to ELI5 what happens that would be lovely :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same for the weather in Chicago. We have been going through a crazy weather pattern where one day it&#39;s 20° and the next day we have a near record 50° day.</p>

<p>This is not normal for Chicago, we are use to winter starting in Nov. And ending in Mar.
We are expecting more 45-50° next week as well HAARP is in full scale over drive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One theory is that it&#39;s to hide the sun during sunrise and sunset because it&#39;s at those points of the day that the approaching Nibiru would be most visible. Can&#39;t see the danger, can&#39;t panic </p>
