<p>Technique #3 - &#39;TOPIC DILUTION&#39;</p>

<p>Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a &#39;RESOURCE BURN.&#39; By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a &#39;gossip mode.&#39; In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to &#39;drive in the wedge.&#39; By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.</p>

Just because of that, I have a hard time believe that there wasn&#39;t a real plane involved, but that was a long time ago and human brains aren&#39;t the best at remembering things properly so I admit I could have been deceived... it seemed so convincing compared to how fake and weird and contradictory everything else was surrounding 9/11... like the newscasters were saying it was terrorists before the 2nd plane hit... back in an age when people didn&#39;t use the word terrorists very often. </p>

<p>The possible theories</p>

<p>The crazy but look like they may be legit theories </p>

<p>And</p>

<p>There&#39;s the theories that have been proven true ...</p>

<p>Whether most of us believe recent ones like pgate, it&#39;s important to note what happened when Sessions was sworn in.  It was rumored for awhile now Sessions will deal with this when he is in, then to hear Trump and see Trump make executive actions on fl trafficking of humans and even made a comment alluding to the youth being hurt beforehand!  Man, if it&#39;s not what everyone expects and it probably won&#39;t be buy if there&#39;s just some truth in that whole pgate theory, that&#39;s fucking amazing.</p>

<p>Right now it&#39;s the main topics because there&#39;s a growing fascination about it.  It&#39;s a batshit crazy thing but it may have something there.  As far as Soros, I don&#39;t bother read anything about him, I know he&#39;s rich and not good, I&#39;ll wait for more concrete stuff to show he&#39;s purposely sabotaging humanity and all the other shit he&#39;s apparently involved in.

    <div class="md"><p>A company called &quot;Sharia Blue&quot; (was &quot;Correct The Record&quot;), owned by super creep David Brock (a friend of the Clintons), hires and pays real people to pretend to be genuine unpaid/unbiased people and &quot;correct lies&quot; about Hillary and the Democrat party on social media sites like Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and even YouTube comments. The problem is that many of these &quot;lies&quot; actually are not lies and it is pretty clear that the real purpose is to push the agenda of the Clintons/DNC and use fancy tactics to disrupt conversations, and ultimately cause readers to come to the pro-Clinton/DNC conclusion, winning them votes and support. </p>

<p>One of the major agendas is the story that &quot;the Russians interfered in the US election in Trump&#39;s favor by hacking the DNC&quot;, which is pretty funny because even if the Russians <em>did</em> hack the DNC, the information that was hacked and exposed proved that the DNC (which is supposed to remain neutral during primaries) was working closely with Hillary to ensure she would win the nomination instead of Bernie. Remember how EVERYONE wanted Bernie and somehow Hillary won? So of course they are going to try to shift the blame to Russia, or someone else. They are salty they got caught and will probably never admit they were wrong, even when people start going to jail.</p>

<p>Sorry I inferred you might be a shill, but we are on HIGH alert here because you literally could be talking to one of David Brock&#39;s little minions and not even know it. What&#39;s worse, it&#39;s very hard to prove that someone is a shill except when their accounts glitch and post things that directly give them away, so the word gets tossed around a lot. It&#39;s extremely frustrating which I&#39;m sure they know and are quite happy about. Not for much longer though. Things are definitely happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched the 2nd plane hit live on TV... but I wasn&#39;t hypercritical of everything I saw on TV at that point... though I was skeptical since Waco... Just because of that, I have a hard time believe that there wasn&#39;t a real plane involved, but that was a long time ago and human brains aren&#39;t the best at remembering things properly so I admit I could have been deceived... it seemed so convincing compared to how fake and weird and contradictory everything else was surrounding 9/11... like the newscasters were saying it was terrorists before the 2nd plane hit... back in an age when people didn&#39;t use the word terrorists very often. </p>
