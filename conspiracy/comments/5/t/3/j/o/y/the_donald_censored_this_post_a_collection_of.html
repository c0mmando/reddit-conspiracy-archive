       We're all concerned about Pete's Zagayt, and all signs point to progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on his Tweets, we know
       <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/255294883680632833?lang=en">
        how Trump feels about child molesters and the like
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know
       <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/266276897305026560?lang=en">
        he's in the know on the Weiner case
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We know Steve Bannon was basically in charge of Breitbart after Andrew passed, and since
       <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewbreitbart/status/33636278100561920?lang=en">
        Breitbart clearly knew about PeaszahGait
       </a>
       , we can assume Bannon does and chats with the president about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today
       <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/09/presidential-executive-order-enforcing-federal-law-respect-transnational">
        an executive order was passed
       </a>
       to eliminate human, drug, arms, and wildlife cartels and to prosecute all those involved and profiting off of them to the full extent of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems coming indictments are likely.  FBIAnon suggests high profile arrests are incoming, as does journalist David Seaman, and our beloved crazy person, Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex also says that behind closed doors, the outer rings of the larger abduction and sex trafficking rings are being shut down, and that some of this has been released to the media.

       I'm an FBI Fanboy so I always keep an eye on their big brother the DOJ... DOJ hasn't been pulling any punches lately... 20-30 years in federal prison for just possessing child porn... with tons of cases every single day... so it isn't just the trafficking they are gunning for it... it is the whole enchilada of perverts... Just watch this link fill up every fuckin' weekday... hell... they even update on Saturdays now which was never a thing in the past...

       I dont know who that is but how the hell do we prevent things like this happening. Honestly? I saw a girl on instagram who had a huge following (cant remember the name) and was dressed very scantly but not pornographic, so where do we draw the line?

       In regard to Traci Lords, she was 80s pornstar (quite popular at the time) who made a ton of movies before turning 18, and only 1 right after turning 18. Though all the early stuff was "banned", it can still be found quite easily on the internet, without the need to crawl into any deep, dark, scary places.  But...unless the vid is from her last movie, it's all CP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what can be done as far as instagram, etc., particularly with age being an obvious question...better parenting? An effort to make it clear the actions are illegal, perhaps by prosecuting a few underagers? It's the same issue involved with sexting, to a large extent.

       Even scarier; Imagine a "person" getting into your Home PC (easy with alt OS to bypass most BIOS). All they have to do is make a small partition on your hard drive. Plant some kiddie porn there. Make the partition "invisible" to the normal user. All of a sudden, the cops kick in your door. Serve you with a warrant based on an anonymous tip. Do a forensic analysis of your hard drive, and VOILA! evidence of your child porn proclivities.

       Try posting again but remove the reddit link at the end it might be getting flagged since one of their rules is no linking to other subs, maybe they halt all reddit links.

       I disagree. The only race related thread I've seen all day was the picture of all the interracial kids walking together and the title said fuck racism. I'm pretty addicted to that sub, so I'm biased. But I was encouraged by the Anti-racism sentiment I've seen lately.

       If you do a web seach for sex ring busts in the year prior, you will find that law enforcement and the fbi have been busy for some time, playing cowboys and kidfuckers for awhile now. I think we are just paying more attention to it.

       Lol at people thinking Trump hates pedos. He's friends with Epstein, been on his private jet multiple times, and he joked about Epstein liking the women a little young. AFTER IT WAS KNOWN HE WAS A PEDO.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's right. Trump joked about a pedophile liking his women on the young side.

       He hasn't been on the jet. Check the flight logs. That rumor got started because Trumps contact was in Epstein's address book.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what joke you're referring to, but I do know of the time Trump kicked Epstein out of one of his resorts for arriving with two underage women. So young or not, Trump doesn't appear to be cool with underage.

       She's a beautiful girl. He says it like it is. Only a sexual predator creep would have an issue with what he said because that's the way YOU think. Ivanka is a certified dime piece, no denying that, even if you are her father. Not all people are PC.

       Trump seems to be 100% fine with underage, per his comments on Epstein (who, let's remember, settled out of court with
       <em>
        seventeen

       underaged girls):

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trump told New York magazine that Epstein was a “terrific guy” who he had known for 15 years. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and

       Weird how he threw that in there

       Oh, and YES, Trump HAS been on Epstein's jet.  Epstein's brother

       Looks like the numbers since Trump took office exceed the total numbers from
       <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/additional-reports/human-trafficking-report/human-trafficking.pdf">
        2014, for example
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The boom started in November of 2016, which was when he was elected, so I wonder if there was an internal "go-ahead" once it was known that Trump would be getting in with a house and senate majority.

       This exact post was removed by the moderators as it climbed rising.  I tried reposting three other times, all removed.  I tried posting it in comments of related threads, removed.  I mentioned in the comment sections that this post had been removed, and that was removed. Another commenter and myself wondered if the mods had been compromised, and those comments were removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted it as an all text post without links to sources, and that stayed.  So I'd wonder if it were an auto-removal of one of the link sources, but the mods never got back to me and that doesn't explain why the comments talking about the removal were removed.

       Do you even know who is being arrested?  My guess is none of the people arrested were arrested trying to buy sex from an underage officer.

       These are just johns in 70% of the arrests not some vile pedophile cult.

       Yeah I am wondering too of these arrests bow many are adult age prostitutes. This should not be illegal. Having that off the black market can help law enforcement focus on sex slaves and abused minors and pedophiles

       Removed it four times, removed my comments with the above links to the arrest stories, removed my comments saying the post was removed and comments with another poster and myself wondering if the mods were compromised in some way. Then radio silence in asking why the removal after messaging the mods in a group, and individually messaging one of the most active mods.

       There is a difference between The_Donald censoring your post and your post triggering an auto removal. The fact is that T_D has been the pioneer sub in reporting subjects such as this one and there is no reason to believe the mods would want to censor this particular story.

       Been wondering about the media black out on this also, but what benefit would the _ Donald gain from centering it?

      <p>
       Seems if anything it would make Trumpet look good. I'm thinking this pedophile thing is used to black mail politicians and too large of a percentage is involved to openly blow the lid off it. Lets say 50% of current politicians are proven to be involved, it would be a constitutional crises over night.

       Most of those operations take months of planning. They did not happen in 10 days just because Trump became President.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also note how they are all being conveyed as "sex trafficking" when they give almost no evidence that most of these aren't just typical prostitution busts. The vast majority of arrests are Johns and just because you call someone a "victim" doesn't mean they weren't out there on their own accord.

       I see someone has spotted the blurring of offenses with the blanket term 'trafficking'. These reports are lumping regular johns, pimps and hoes in with pedos. I anticipate a paradigm shift in that the extension of the words trafficked and exploited will soon be extended to illegals in the work place.

       So is this appeasement? Seeing more of us believing pizag8 they start making it look like tons of these creeps are getting arrested?

       Distract us from wanting to catch the witch boiling kids by arresting a bunch of old women that make harmless charms or love philters kind of thing.

       I think you guys need to get a better understanding of a sex sting busting johns looking for pussy on Craigslist and an actual fucking human trafficking ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       All people getting arrested are johns and low level pimps.  This isn't really all that special.  What clearly happened is there is a nationwide push to curb the illegal prostitution online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most sites that have online escorts like backpage have all been taken down.  This was a nationwide sweep and nothing at all related to Elite Pedo Rings.

       the problem is that ISN'T all the people getting arrested.  The majority of the people getting arrested in these stings are adult prostitutes- people who likely are already victimized.

       Very interesting point of view. Would certainly fit in perfectly with their religious agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arresting of-age sex workers and civilian clients is absolutely ridiculous, on the same level as the war on drugs. It shouldn't be illegal in the first place. If it was, you wouldn't have the sex-trafficking problem in the first place!
      </p>

       They should be going after the people bringing them in, or anyone involved with under-age trafficking.

       Although, I also just read another interesting perspective, and that is that you have to arrest a whole bunch of little fish first, and offer them plea deals to turn on the people higher up the ladder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still though, you don't need to bust regular dudes trying to pay for sex from an of-age consenting adult. That's just fucked up.

       That bust small fish theory might work with drug dealers but not with pimps and johns. Pimps are the boss. They don't answer to a higher pimp if they did they would be getting pimped. As far as johns are concerned they have no clue about human and child trafficking if they did they wouldn't be johns.

       In terms of sex-trafficking underage children, where do the pimps get them? I'm talking more of a trafficking-ring situation. To suggest that pimps cannot ever have a boss is a completely baseless claim.

       how man pimps do you know?  I have known quite a few over the years.  Most were ex drug dealers that released they coulkd make equal amounts of cash without the risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       They dont have bosses.  They dont answer to anyone.  At least not you typical pimp.  Asian apartment massage parlors have bosses which likely are organized crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average pimp though is just a street guy that has a way of convincing chicks to sale their pussy and give him the cash.

       I wouldn't give Trump too much credit here. The investigations that led to the busts were completed under the Obama administration. These things take time, and much more time than a few days to a couple weeks after Trump took office.

       Precisely.  The investigations were in progress, yes, mostly by local and fbi types that are more loyal to Trump.  For all we know, the investigations were only taken seriously after they new trump was elected because they knew they wouldn't be suppressed by seemingly pedo-friendly Dem's and creepy Uncle Joe.

       He didn't "have to sign" an EO. And I agree, it should've been cracked down on long ago. But to say all the investigations happened during Trumps couple of weeks in office, all because of an EO is lunacy. Especially with busts as big as they've been. Those investigations started well before he took office.

       There were lots of these busts before Trump took office. It takes long periods of time to investigate, they didn't start the investigations just since Trump took office. Child porn busts have been happening since the internet was invented, police have been recusing children since the beginning. Nothing has changed except you pizzagaters want to try to link every single one to a far reaching conspiracy involving Comet Ping Pong.

       IF the DC rings get busted, I have no doubt there will be millions of people in denial of reality, claiming their favorite politicians were framed. Interesting you're laying the groundwork.

       The groundwork is already there I'm just looking at it. The whole point is to punish the pedophile rings not remove your political opponents. We should just be looking carefully at who's being arrested and what proof there is.

      <p>
       Even if we arrest say, 50 politicians, I think we're in the clear if the evidence is sufficient, that they're political enemies is irrelevant at this point, especially since historically bipartisan arrests and convictions have been made.  It would only be natural for there to be less republicans over-all because many republicans have been pushing for this for quite some time, but mum's the word from dems/liberals, they seem to be actively sweeping these stories under the rug via MSM control.

       Also, these are initial arrests
       <em>
        on the ground

       Punishing pedophile rings is far more important than politics. If Trump or anyone chooses not to pursue a politician pedo because they're allies then that's as bad as the pedos themselves.

       I'm curious about this one, since that's a lot of arrests. According to the article, 128 arrests plus 28 arrests were accounted for (iirc, on mobile). What were the other ~325 arrests for?

       Removed it four times, removed my comments with the above links to the arrest stories, removed my comments saying the post was removed and comments with another poster and myself wondering if the mods were compromised in some way. Then radio silence in asking why the removal after messaging the mods in a group, and individually messaging one of the most active mods.

       In regard to Traci Lords, she was 80s pornstar (quite popular at the time) who made a ton of movies before turning 18, and only 1 right after turning 18. Though all the early stuff was "banned", it can still be found quite easily on the internet, without the need to crawl into any deep, dark, scary places.  But...unless the vid is from her last movie, it's all CP.

       I don't know what can be done as far as instagram, etc., particularly with age being an obvious question...better parenting? An effort to make it clear the actions are illegal, perhaps by prosecuting a few underagers? It's the same issue involved with sexting, to a large extent.
