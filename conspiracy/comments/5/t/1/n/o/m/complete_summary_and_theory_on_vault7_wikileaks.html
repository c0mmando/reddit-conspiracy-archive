       Wikileaks Vault 7
Theory: I believe that wikileaks has the 650,000 emails that the FBI has from Anthony Weiner's laptop. These emails will contain info on where Gaddafi's gold and silver went, that F119 plans were sold to the Chinese for the J-20,  and many more things that I'm sure many of you have speculated about yourselves. I believe they received them from an agent within the NSA. I believe that they have timed the release of their Vault 7 tweets with the House Oversight committees deadline for the FBI to turn over all evidence i the Clinton investigation. 
These are the tweets

       I'll give my best break don of the tweets to support my theory but by no means do I consider my opinions conclusive.

        Tweet 1: What is Vault 7?
       </a>
      </h1>
      <p>
       The picture attached to this tweet is a picture of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Global_Seed_Vault">
        Svalbard Global Seed Vault
       </a>
       . It is an 11,000 square foot facility on a large island north of Scandinavia called Svalbard. It is one of the northernmost inhabited places on earth. The vault contains a wide variety of seeds from around the world.  This a quote from the wikipedia page
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The seed vault is an attempt to
        <em>
         insure
        </em>
        against the loss of seeds in other genebanks during large-scale regional or global crises.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The vault is seen as a type of "Global Insurance" in the event of some major crisis. I believe the intended message of this tweet is to say that what Vault 7 is is insurance for the world as it will reveal, at least in part, the massive corruption on the global scale. Who knows what else Huma and Hillary talked about over 650,000 emails, what we do know is they definitely don't want us to read them. Weiner's (Huma's husband)laptop is the FBIs

        source of the 650,000 emails
       </a>
       , and on that laptop the files were allegedly filed under

      <p>
       This one I will give a brief summary of but I've already made a full post breaking it down

       The only other incident since then that I can find of the much gold being taken over by a foriegn entity is Libya in 2011. Hillary had a direct hand in toppling Gaddafi as Sec of State in 2011, and no one knows what happened to his $7 billion in gold and silver. The answer to that question I believe is in the 650,000 emails. Read my original post for more detail on this tweet.

       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5sjt72/answer_to_jet_engine_tweet/">
        HERE
       </a>
       but I will give a brief summary.
This is a picture of the egnine for the F-22. It is a stealth engine that can achieve
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercruise">
        supercruise
       </a>
       without using afterburners (which make a fuck ton of noise). Most countries with substantial militaries either have an engine that can do this or are developing one for their
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_jet_fighter">
        5th generation fighter jets
       </a>
       . Except the Chinese J-20 as far as anyone can tell. And to build a fighter without this capability would be ridiculous for the Chinese. However, there is much speculation that the J-20 is a F-22 rip off and you cna find all that info in my original post on this. China has yet to release info about the work they have done on the J-20s engine. I believe that the emails will show that the technology of the F119 was sold to the Chinese. More detail in original post.

       The picture attached to this tweet is of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning">
        Chelsea, then Bradley,  Manning

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">
        Edward Snowden
       </a>
       . All three have either leaked or published secret government documents. Manning sent military documents to Assange who published them through wikileaks. Snowden exposed the NSA mass surveillance program. I believe that this tweet means that the person behind vault 7 or giving them the information is someone like these three. A whistle-blower from within the government.

        HERE

       This is a picture of a 509th Air Force engineer welding together a blade for a snowplow at

        509th bombing wing

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Global_Strike_Command">

       and handles all nuclear weapons for the USAF.  The B-2s have been the first to strike in almost all of the US's engagements, and key Clinton ones like Kosovo and Libya. Perhaps the way here is to say because the whistle-blower is tired of the bombing based on lies and wants to expose the lies. There's much more detail in my original post about this tweet.

      <h1>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/829693251133272064">
        Tweet 6: How is Vault 7?
       </a>
      </h1>
      <p>
       The picture attached to this tweet is an East German surveillance photograph of mail box activity. The East German state security
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi">
        Stasi
       </a>
       wanted to know
       <a href="https://thevieweast.wordpress.com/2013/07/11/everything-about-everyone-the-depth-of-stasi-surveillance-in-the-gdr/">
        "everything about everyone"
       </a>
       . This immediately makes me think  of the mass email surveillance programs that have been uncovered in recent years. And the 650,000 emails on Weiner's laptop I believe were caughtin the web of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program">
        NSAs mass email surveilance program
       </a>
       ) (possibly Germanys because of the german picture but I think that it was used because its a specific picture about government surveilance on mail). 
All of that combined with the last tweet being released today February 9th,
       <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/jeff-sessions-will-walk-the-line-for-donald-trump-as-u-s-attorney-general-after-hours-of-intense-debate">

       </a>
       and the last day for the FBI to

        turn in all evidence they have in the Hillary Clinton email investigation
       </a>
       makes me strongly believe that Vault 7 is the 650,000 emails and that wikileaks has the and will release them if nothing is done with them. 
I'm sure there's many holes in my logic and theories here but I'm just giving my observations and opinions. There's lots of 9/11 speculation going on about these tweets but I just don't see it. Especially considering Julian's
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/595lw3/wikileaks_founder_julian_assange_is_annoyed_by/">
        stance on 9/11 conspiracy theories
       </a>
       What do you think? What else do you think would be in the 650,00 emails?

       This theory makes a lot of sense. The biggest factor in my mind was that WikiLeaks tweeted out their first Vault 7 teaser directly after tweeting a link to the FBIVault's 6th batch of HRC emails. It's pretty obvious that Vault 7 has to do with the other 6 batches of HRC emails, and it also makes sense that it would be the emails from Weiner. Though it could also be the 33k missing emails that Hillary deleted that were recovered from the NSA.

       Thanks for writing this summary, I have been doing research into these tweets all day long.

       I find it interesting that the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway was included. There is a post on the front page of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       showing that Norway has cut ties to the Clinton Foundation and also busted a huge pedo ring local to the country. OP, do you think this ties into Vault7 or has any significance?

       It's certainly possible, one of the ideas I toyed with was that perhaps there's more than just seeds in there, it's an 11,000 square foot space. I know there are a lot of different seeds out there but something tells me there's room in there for something else. What that is I don't know and didn't have anything to go on so I didn't include that. There's several instances like that for each tweet where I had fun theories but nothing at all to support them

       I'm just saying the more you know, it's a really specific engine to tweet about, the Chinese are lacking that technology, Hillary goes to china February of 09 as her first trip being Sec of State, and a few months later china announce they are going to start producing the J-20 and it turns out to look very similar and share many properties with the F-22 but china has been very quiet about the engine system for it. I wonder why? That's my reasoning, and I just wanted to know you're reasoning for it being February 22nd

       I think what the difference in the "when" tweet from the others is that when is the one parameter that Wikileaks has no control over. They don't have control over when 07 of 07 comes out and I believe it's more of a threat/warning tweet than an indication of a date

       Here is a thought of mine:
      </p>
      <p>
       What represents the insurance.
Where represents the vault of leaked Clinton emails.
When shows the F119 and represents 9/11.
Who is just representing Asange who gathered info from Manning on the military side, and info from NSA involving people's private information.
Why shows an image that is from a site with the headline "Keeping structures strong" meaning the government.
How involves Statsi which monitors people and wanted to gather all information. I think that it is referring to the info gathered by the NSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that it may have something to do with Larry Silverstein having inside info on 9/11. The guy made a fortune on 9/11 through the insurance policy and has been suspect of having prior knowledge. Making connections between Manning, Asange and Snowden's leaked information, all of the pieces to the 9/11 truth could have been put together. Manning leaked military information and Snowden could have gotten information on Larry Silverstein through the NSA. With an attack occurring in NYC would allow the government to stay powerful and exert more control over the people. They use 9/11 as an excuse for monitoring people worldwide, and give an explanation for any expansions of power.

       I hope Trump doesn't somehow get in the way of all this. I know he loves the truth being exposed, I just feel that he doesn't want this kind of disruption going on anymore. He'd rather focus on our other issues.

       However, the culture is still being severely damaged due to her not being charged with full disclosure of who she is. She is still a princess and Trump the monster. The lack of awareness is still driving me insane.

       I think you're largely right here, especially on the 9/11 issue. Assange has always parroted the official narrative, and it's the main reason I know he's controlled opposition.

       Very insightful. My interpretation of the image of tweet 5 was that it was meant to juxtapose the beating of swords into blades of a plow (eg plowshare) with the terrible machines of the military industrial complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       "And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."

       It has to be the emails I think.  That last picture of the mailbox surveillance was a big hint and the fact that the FBI released the emails in a set of 6 data dumps just shows to me that wikileaks know there's more to it.

       There was a recent arrest of
       <strong>
        ANOTHER
       </strong>
       Booz Allen Hamilton security contractor named Harold T. Martin...
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is part of a story I found regarding it on Yahoo News:
       <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/nsa-contractor-could-face-200-231443513.html">
        https://www.yahoo.com/news/nsa-contractor-could-face-200-231443513.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "U.S. prosecutors unveiled an indictment Wednesday detailing what may amount to the largest data breach in the history of the National Security Agency — an archive of classified material that may total more than
       <strong>
        500 MILLION PAGES
       </strong>
       . The incident is a black eye on the secretive spy agency’s attempt to crack down on so-called insider threats and may have exposed some of the NSA’s most sensitive spy tools.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecutors allege Harold T. Martin III stole a huge trove of classified documents, which he stored at his home in Maryland, while working as a contractor to the
       <strong>
        NSA and other intelligence agencies
       </strong>
       . While the full scope of Martin’s collection of top secret material remains unclear, Wednesday’s indictment includes 20 charges of improperly retaining classified information. If convicted, Martin could face a maximum of 200 years in prison."
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that Wikileaks now has this cache, and they are hinting to intel services as a warning to prevent them from doing anything to Assange.  It is also possible it is set to be a timed release in the event of his capture after the Ecuadorian presidential election in the coming weeks.
