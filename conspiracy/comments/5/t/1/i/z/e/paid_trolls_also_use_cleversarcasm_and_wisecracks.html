       I agree with OP to a degree here. I think the the conspiracy that's been labeled Pizzagate was named that by paid operatives in order to make it sound ridiculous and not credible. The only reason it has survived the name was because of the overwhelming and ever-increasing circumstantial evidence . Also the absolute horror it contains has driven the masses to steamroll over any ridicule.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an active coordinated effort to ridicule,laugh and dismiss the subject. It seems the effort worked on all media and the D.C. police, or they were part of the effort themselves . Independent researchers overcame their design by motivation for the truth and working for justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have moved the needle on pizzagate in spite of the name not because it helps. I couldn't be prouder of the civilians risking their own lives to potentially saving others.

       I think the real issue is that "serious discussions" are not really that persuasive to the majority of people. They want sound bites and snarky comments they can repeat and look clever or funny for doing...
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence the Meme war.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, there is still a small audience that may take "serious discussions"  seriously, but you still need to find a way to repackage those ideas to better appeal to the masses who have no interest in having those types of challenging debates. This is the true failure of honest and rigorous discourse... it isn't really that persuasive.

       in addition, it is REALLY easy to get attention and spread a meme using anger inducing tactics, but the memes that have REAL legs are the ones that are intended to be light and humorous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outrage memes don't have the same lasting appeal as a joke about someones hair, or a person with funny expression on their face. You need to find a way to package complex ideas into quick and funny images with limited text and create a language of they hieroglyphs that have immediate meaning to those who see them.

       I'm also suspicious how some memes make it "big" so to speak (where the msm even reports on them), i.e. the "Biden/Obama bromance" ones. How come the memes about Biden being a creepy don't make it on my Facebook feed?

       Yeah those were so inorganic they disappeared in a couple weeks... 
I DO know Facebook will ban people who share or post "offensive" memes. That is pretty broadly defined, so the person reviewing the case has the majority of the decision, and considering the cultural climate at Facebook, it all sort of makes sense. There are a lot of popular groups that get removed for wrongthink.

       in addition, it is REALLY easy to get attention and spread a meme using anger inducing tactics, but the memes that have REAL legs are the ones that are intended to be light and humorous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outrage memes don't have the same lasting appeal as a joke about someones hair, or a person with funny expression on their face. You need to find a way to package complex ideas into quick and funny images with limited text and create a language of they hieroglyphs that have immediate meaning to those who see them.

       Since Reddit is a form of media, without a doubt NDAA tactics are used here as well,  but if your looking for proof, Bush said he doesn't have to disclose the propaganda part of the information, with that said, the how when where and why, will be hard to prove unless an insider with massive amount of snitch material surfaces, which I won't see in my lifetime, if ever.

       Not sure.  I posted a lot there during the primaries because of Sanders and the slow unraveling of HRC. I would say it definitely leaned left though,  yes.  But like HRC was the devil in that sub and then exactly on Labor Day weekend it was a complete 180. They banned everyone who questioned the change in narrative,  all the comments were divisive and combative, and it turned into HRCs reddit headquarters. I've since rejected politics completely after peeling back layer after layer of government shit. We don't need politics,  I'm convinced of this

       yes, there was a palatable difference in energy.  Labor day was the day she had her coughing spell on stage while Kaine clapped behind her like one of those clapping monkey toys.  Minutes of coughing, it was so cringy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That might have been the day she spit her cough drops into her water she was drinking and it was caught on video - leaving people to make crazy guesses as to what came out of her mouth.  That was the same day, right?

       That and r/worldnews are precisely where I got this hypothesis from!
Really... I'm sick of people mentioning Trump's tiny hands, emulating Trump's speech, adapting Conway's "alternative facts" to craft a joke, etc. and so forth.
We can (and maybe should!) ridicule those individuals, but do we really need to do that in every god damn thread? Specially in r/politics, where people are always reminded to "keep the discussions civil"?

       They call it "not normalizing the fascists". They'll drop the snark and go straight to apoplexy if they think anyone's talking about Trump or his administration in a normalizing, "he's not THAT bad" manner.

       Yes!  It is what drives me to assert myself in discussions.  I try to keep things calm and factual when it is at all possible.  But the way they drive it, they dont want calm - and they have superior numbers.

       I am awed by the cognitive dissonance on daily display in this place. Critical thinking requires thinking critically. There are three groups of people on this subreddit: indoctrinating shills, indoctrinated useful idiots, and incredulous observers.

       So now anyone that says a sarcastic comment is a shill?  To lump all sarcastic people into that category is just wrong. I for one am a pretty sarcastic person on a daily basis. Always have been. 
I personally have noticed people who make judgmental comments about other peoples opinions and words in order to divide us are most likely shills. Guess that makes us even shill.

       I mean even if Melania is transgender, doesn't that mean Trump can't possibly be a bigot against homosexuals?  Also, since she's so passable, doesn't that mean she done a lot for the LGBT community, since she's demonstrative of gender binary within an expansive gender inclusiveness?  /example

       But that what this whole post-modernist troll politics movement is about.  EVERYTHING is subjective.  Snarky sarcasm deflects the cognitive dissonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       You KNOW that you're being intellectually dishonest, so you take intellect out of the equation.  This is a PR technique that propagandists have used for a long time.  Mainstream media has always done it, but I'm seeing it used by the troll armies of both the Pro-trump and anti-trump folks now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people I see arguing objectively are the wikileaks/ Intercept crew who are willing to criticize both Trump and his detractors.  Almost everyone else- EVEN A LARGE PORTION OF THE CONSPIRACY COMMUNITY, has been coopted into "picking a side".

       Good finding, u/soberreflection.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION'
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.
