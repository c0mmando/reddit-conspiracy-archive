    <div class="md"><p>I agree with OP to a degree here. I think the the conspiracy that&#39;s been labeled Pizzagate was named that by paid operatives in order to make it sound ridiculous and not credible. The only reason it has survived the name was because of the overwhelming and ever-increasing circumstantial evidence . Also the absolute horror it contains has driven the masses to steamroll over any ridicule. </p>

<p>There is an active coordinated effort to ridicule,laugh and dismiss the subject. It seems the effort worked on all media and the D.C. police, or they were part of the effort themselves . Independent researchers overcame their design by motivation for the truth and working for justice. </p>

<p>People have moved the needle on pizzagate in spite of the name not because it helps. I couldn&#39;t be prouder of the civilians risking their own lives to potentially saving others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the real issue is that &quot;serious discussions&quot; are not really that persuasive to the majority of people. They want sound bites and snarky comments they can repeat and look clever or funny for doing...</p>

<p>Hence the Meme war.</p>

<p>That said, there is still a small audience that may take &quot;serious discussions&quot;  seriously, but you still need to find a way to repackage those ideas to better appeal to the masses who have no interest in having those types of challenging debates. This is the true failure of honest and rigorous discourse... it isn&#39;t really that persuasive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah those were so inorganic they disappeared in a couple weeks... 
I DO know Facebook will ban people who share or post &quot;offensive&quot; memes. That is pretty broadly defined, so the person reviewing the case has the majority of the decision, and considering the cultural climate at Facebook, it all sort of makes sense. There are a lot of popular groups that get removed for wrongthink.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure.  I posted a lot there during the primaries because of Sanders and the slow unraveling of HRC. I would say it definitely leaned left though,  yes.  But like HRC was the devil in that sub and then exactly on Labor Day weekend it was a complete 180. They banned everyone who questioned the change in narrative,  all the comments were divisive and combative, and it turned into HRCs reddit headquarters. I&#39;ve since rejected politics completely after peeling back layer after layer of government shit. We don&#39;t need politics,  I&#39;m convinced of this</p>

Really... I&#39;m sick of people mentioning Trump&#39;s tiny hands, emulating Trump&#39;s speech, adapting Conway&#39;s &quot;alternative facts&quot; to craft a joke, etc. and so forth.
We can (and maybe should!) ridicule those individuals, but do we really need to do that in every god damn thread? Specially in r/politics, where people are always reminded to &quot;keep the discussions civil&quot;?</p>

<p>You KNOW that you&#39;re being intellectually dishonest, so you take intellect out of the equation.  This is a PR technique that propagandists have used for a long time.

<blockquote>
<p>Technique #3 - &#39;TOPIC DILUTION&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a &#39;RESOURCE BURN.&#39; By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a &#39;gossip mode.&#39; In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to &#39;drive in the wedge.&#39; By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.</p>
