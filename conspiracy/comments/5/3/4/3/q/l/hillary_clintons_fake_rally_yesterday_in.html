       I wonder if they are doing this because of her medical condition? It would be to stressfull for her to do a real rally and should would get a seizure or something.

       Agreed. My guess is that they are having a live rally and a recorded rally so if she does spaz out during a live rally they can show the masses via tv/internet a reenactment of the event without anything that could hurt her "healthy image".

       What background? I see nothing fake in this video you posted. And reflecting what we see here to the OP video, the original is just filmed with a high zoom lens to bring the US flag behind Hillary that big while from any other angle or with a wide angle lens it would not look like that.

       He is saying this is a legit video and the one the OP has posted shows obvious signs of CGI or green screen work.  Zen only confirms there is something going on as there is nothing like that going on in the video he found.

       What CGI signs? We see the phones filming and those match well with the second angle video. Also the official cam can now be better understood, to my eye it shows exactly the right things too when compared with the second angle. Just a high zoom lens, showing such a small and flattened view.

       Decompression artifact. Around 2min prior to that there is a similar error where large parts of the image are repeated vertically from top to bottom, and in the disappearance that happens again, just more and the stripes are repeated from top to bottom. There are plenty of error examples in the video to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: and this is my last reply to this insignificant matter where I have spent too many hours answering already =) Other streams did not have Hillary disappearing, wonder why that is. See my post history for links.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will read your reply anyway of course. Even in the case this was filmed in front of a green screen or some parts are CGI, what is the point of this all? That her medical condition is bad? Or even that she's dead and now CGI ;)

       I'll be honest I'm not seeing it either. I do believe Clinton is liferally a pile of bullshit and lies, but honestly, I've worked plenty with film and video editing, and I don't see any green screen work. It could just be due to the fact that I'm on my phone, so enhancing on an actual desktop might help, but still...
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that weirds me out is the phones. Firstly, at least with the handful of talks I've seen on TV, fuckin... there are never that many phones out at once. Looks like everyone is recording with their HD smart phone. Not to mention the exposure on every screen happens to be set almost identical and the camera recording the event isn't experiencing any issues with their screens or viewing angles... THAT'S what bugs me. The phones are fucky.

       Most keep their phone screens and camera on auto settings so I think it's no wonder they look closely the same. The zoom lens on the TV cam too makes it seem almost everyone is filming, but I see that as an effect of the lens flattening any depth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, I agree there are quite many of them despite the above, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were told to film. For wharever reason

       Could you be more specific? Her hair great for green screens, not fuzzy or anything, but other than that I could not see any artifacts even when she walked behind the prompter - took a look frame by frame too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you watch the second angle video her movements match 1:1 as far as I can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be clear I'm not trying to defend her. This instance just does not seem like a part of a conspiracy to me.

       Are you looking at it on a computer monitor? The first time I watched it was on my own computer and it was blatantly obvious. I watched it on my moms computer and it seemed like the whole video was much lower quality. Not sure if it was a lower quality screen, internet, etc. or the conspiracy theorist inside of me thinks youtube could have lowered the quality so its harder to tell lol. Probably just a different screen

       I don't put much stock  in a lot of the stuff on the site I've just linked, but if you watch the version linked there, you can see her start glitching out around 19:30 into the video, and not long after 20:30 you can see her totally disappear for a second while the background stays intact.
      </p>

       Conspiracy theories are fun, but this is some real messed up stuff.

       I didn't watch a few seconds long enough last time, indeed she does disappear, but why does this not happen in the original stream, just on the ABC15 one? While she does disappear, it still looks like compression artifacts, just like the ones prior to the disappearance at 20:51, where parts of the image is repeated vertically, thus stretching the flag stripes over her. Then as she moves, the colors keep stuck to her movements just like they should in such an error scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       See
       <a href="https://youtu.be/RQ7PJpQ7cRA?t=2888">
        https://youtu.be/RQ7PJpQ7cRA?t=2888
       </a>
       too, no disappearance or any other of these artifacts that might have happened when ABC15 decoded the stream.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: what is your thinking about this, assuming she is in front of a green screen and it glitches out? More proof of her medical condition or of something else? If the hall she's making the speech is real and she's there as can be seen from the other angle (among other angles that are available I would assume, though have not searched), and if the striped background (flag I assume) is actually green or otherwise manipulated, would that mean something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just trying to grasp what is the possible conspiracy here in case the glitches are what some think they are - not just compression errors.

       What you see there is compression artifacts, not green screen artifacts. She does not disappear in a way that it would reveal the background. Pause on and walk frame by frame on the messed up parts and you see how the colors of the flag do go all over her, but in a smeary way, not in a revealing way. The colors of the stripes for example stay attached to her arms, but when crossing the stripe boundary it does not change color from white to red. Just compression artifacts this time from what I can see. Another thing is that the background is motionless and the encoders use motion for not needing to encode color data to each frame, thus you don't see almost no glitches on the flag but only on things that update on each frame.

       Modern video compression is quite sophisticated, analyzing the imaged into objects, movements, etc. So in a way it is doing "CGI" on images all the time to compress them, so when there are errors they can manifest with objects disappearing and what you see here. (not directed at you specifically, just anyone reading not familiar with MPEG etc.).

       This looks pretty good, in terms of her clothes are the right color and stuff but it is very odd that the background would be that fabricated. I mean it is pretty clearly a greenscreen and the waving.

       yeah, something is definitely amiss, and the green screen idea is growing on me.  As I watch I just get such a "canned" feeling about the whole thing, it just doesn't sound like theres the correct atmospheric background noise, n the crowd's response is so even as if it was achieved with a dial or something.  How can anyone believe any of this shit the Elite/Illuminati is forcing through, via mASS media anymore?  Glad I don't own a tv,

       Look at social media engagement too. Trump blows her away on FB and Twitter in terms of fans AND likes/engagement on every post. 5:1. The establishment wants the world to think that she is loved (and Trump is hated) by the majority of Americans. But hard stats show otherwise.

       I think very few people are pro-Hillary, but there are many many people who are anti-Trump. That's where her polling numbers come from. No one actually wants her to be president, many just prefer her to the alternative.

       It's really sad that Trumpe appeals to so many with divisive identity politics. That these messages are popular. (Here come the downvotes)

       I think most people are unenthusiastic and not going to vote, extremists on both ends will be at the polls.

       100 likes 700 thumbs down - that's the story right there. She has no real support.  Also listen to her at 23:40 - she's so GD disingenuous it's pathetic.

       Green screen? Eh I don't think so - phones are too out of focus to be definitive. Green screens used for the Orlando shooting PsyOp hoax were much more obvious.

      <p>
       Someone in comments said look at her wave at the wall behind her at 23:35 or so --- she's clearly waving not directly behind her but behind her and to the left where there is a (probably paid for) group of people.

       I'm on my phone. I can tell the atmospheric perspective is being manipulated in a way that a camera lense can't produce. Look at the edges of the camera phone screens verses the lack of sharpness in detail of everything else in that plane. The renderers lost the forest for the trees. This is basic art 201 stuff. Can't they afford better audio visual shills?

       Maybe I'm just having trouble understanding what I'm seeing, but look at the phone screens of people recording (in the first minute). It seems that the phones are showing similar scenes, but nothing that looks like the background in the youtube. I'm not seeing the hanging flags in the phones. And I am seeing some blue or green rectangle in the phone that I'm not seeing in the background.

       Apparently she also used a green screen for a speech in Reno, NV too. In that one, it shows people recording videos of her on stage, directly in front of them, with a similar american flag background, and the phones do not show flags at all.

       You can see in the phone screens that are facing her as she's entering the area have the bright blue logo that's on the podium.  The problem is that she is at ground level coming from the far right of the stage.

       The "angles and perspective" excuse is laughable. The phones are showing exactly what the crowd is recording, not our birds eye perspective. They are fucking with us, seeing what they can get away with, and with a dumbed down populace, CTR, and the DNC, it is clear that they can get away with anything.

       Its pretty much just the beginning couple minutes. Whoever the fuck announce her and she walks in. Thats where you see people "recording videos" and the transition of her walking onto the stage is where the green screen is most obvious.

       I am just a guy from germany following the US election campaign and I have to admit I was partly convinced at first that the accusations are true and there is indeed something fishy about this particular rally. 
Ofc I digged deeper into it because it was just to crazy to be true, and I am thankful for your explanation. In my opinion you should be upvoted because you have a point here, people jump fast to conclusions without questioning, it is rather scary to be honest. 
Nonetheless, I think the whole battle for the "throne" is rather entertaining, and it feels sureal. As an european I struggle to wrap my head arround how this whole shitshow is even possible in an country refering themselfes as the leaders of the free world. It feels like watching a movie rather then a serious political race, but then again it is the US, I guess. Sry for any grammar/ spelling mistakes, cheers.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not even close.  We attended one of her rallies to see how big a farce they are and we weren't disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rally we attended literally took place on an auxiliary basketball court.  Even with that small size of a venue they still had to literally bus people in to fill up the half-court the rally was on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe, just maybe 700 people there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tops.

       Well ok, she has far less people attending. But on Tuesday, I said to myself that the only way I would believe the rally in North Carolina was genuine wad if it was held outdoors with a sizeable number of people. Well it was indoors and with far less people. But there is still potential for a staged rally.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all this talk now about the NC rally being fake... I definitely understand how people could deduce this, but if the people inside who were waiting for her with their smartphones only numbered around 700, don't you think they could find 400 (some amount slightly less than 700) rabid Hillary fans to help stage that event? In other words, why would you need to artificially insert a crowd into that auditorium? Surely there are enough die-hard fans that would do anything for the Clinton cause even if it meant cheering for their hero when she's not even there.

       You can use the "angles" defense on the phone screens all you want.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         People are trying to record videos of Hillary (theoretically). you cant see her on the phone screens at all just some walls. Do people really wanna record walls that badly?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You can tell the videos/phone screens are edited onto the phones themselves. Edges of the videos are slightly pixelated.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The phones arent the only thing that prove the whole thing fake. You can see pixelated/blurry edges around hillary's body.

       Yeah, but it's the credibility of the sub that makes people seriously consider things like this whole greenscreen thing. Maybe once the sub loses all credibility people will actually vet the information.

       Yea this is a way far-fetched.  Even if it was greenscreened, it's obviously her, and its obviously post 9/11/16.  So that being the case and seeing her healthy, there's no reason for them to fake this...

       Never tried to claim it wasnt her. And how is it far fetched? If you look at the details on a good resolution computer monitor you will see what everyone else is seeing. Half of the point is that it is after the 9/11 collapse. She is trying to pass herself off as fine and healthy, but cant even make a public appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or actually, shes done this before in Reno, NV. I think thats shes just not good at doing anything live, unfiltered, and honest.

       Having Hillary collapse during the rally would end the election race right then and there.

       By previously green screening her speech, they can record it and then play it back at the rally with 100% certainty she won't collapse since it's already a recording of her.

But on Tuesday, I said to myself that the only way I would believe the rally in North Carolina was genuine wad if it was held outdoors with a sizeable number of people. Well it was indoors and with far less people. But there is still potential for a staged rally.

       With all this talk now about the NC rally being fake... I definitely understand how people could deduce this, but if the people inside who were waiting for her with their smartphones only numbered around 700, don't you think they could find 400 (some amount slightly less than 700) rabid Hillary fans to help stage that event? In other words, why would you need to artificially insert a crowd into that auditorium? Surely there are enough die-hard fans that would do anything for the Clinton cause even if it meant cheering for their hero when she's not even there.

       I am just a guy from germany following the US election campaign and I have to admit I was partly convinced at first that the accusations are true and there is indeed something fishy about this particular rally. 
Ofc I digged deeper into it because it was just to crazy to be true, and I am thankful for your explanation. In my opinion you should be upvoted because you have a point here, people jump fast to conclusions without questioning, it is rather scary to be honest. 
Nonetheless, I think the whole battle for the "throne" is rather entertaining, and it feels sureal. As an european I struggle to wrap my head arround how this whole shitshow is even possible in an country refering themselfes as the leaders of the free world. It feels like watching a movie rather then a serious political race, but then again it is the US, I guess. Sry for any grammar/ spelling mistakes, cheers.
