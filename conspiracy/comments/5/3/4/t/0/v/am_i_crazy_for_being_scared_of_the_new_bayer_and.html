        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m surprised to see that this story hasn&#39;t been covered here a lot, especially since the the news that Monsanto&#39;s roundup chemical had been found in honey. I&#39;ve heard about the merger a day or two ago, and it greatly worries me. You have an agriculture giant with dubious practices and an awesome online shrill team merging with a medical powerhouse. I can&#39;t really put it into words, but I feel like nothing good can come from this merger. I&#39;m worried that there will be a correlation between crappy or tainted food and medicine. Basically get the people as sick as possible, and they&#39;re rely on us to get well.</p>

<p>Whenever I bring this up to others, they call me insane. I went on Monsanto&#39;s FB page and everything was glowingly positive. Anyone who questioned it was called crazy or a conspiracy theorist or a science hater. Crap like that makes me question if I&#39;m really on the right side, because in my heart and my mind, this shit isn&#39;t good AT ALL. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely agree that they had that in mind. Monsanto is infamous for how many people, myself included, dislike it, but Bayer has a better reputation. They can keep doing Monsanto&#39;s dirty work without any criticism because &quot;why criticize a company dedicated to health?&quot; - someone actually said that to me. </p>

<p>What weirds me out is why would a health company merge with an agriculture company? It&#39;s a huge red flag for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Red flag for sure. The experiments they&#39;ll be working on will be straight from a sifi novel. I can totally see why they would merge though.

<p>They have been popular since the recession thanks to the Fed&#39;s cheap, easy debt. but more importantly it&#39;s also an artificial way of inflating the stock market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only imagine what type of shit is going on behind doors. I know the are definitely some experiments going on. Of what? I&#39;m not too sure. I do believe that these experiments go beyond simple vegetable GMOs. </p>

<p>I need to stay up-to-date with the markets, because I know basic business information, but I need to know more. I had no clue that mergers inflate the stock market, though it doesn&#39;t surprise me since Bayer&#39;s stocks are doing extremely well last time I saw them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they come out with pharma-infused crops to &quot;counter the negative western diet&quot;. Maybe some cholesterol lowering corn?</p>

<p>Anyhow one easy example of why M&amp;As inflate the market is because of the S&amp;P500. This is what most people&#39;s 401k&#39;s and IRA&#39;s are invested in. It&#39;s made up of 500 companies. The value of the SP500 is based on the underlying companies. When two of these companies merge, there is only 499 companies, but still the same value in the SP500. Now there is a hole that needs filled, bringing in a 500th company, and billions of new money into the index that is the SP500.</p>

<p>This is also the main index people are talking about when referring to the stock market. In other words, when the SP500 is up, the stock market is up.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the worst part. It&#39;s annoyed me to no end when people call me out for using the term, &quot;printing money&quot; as if I don&#39;t know what it means. I know exactly what it means: the Fed buying government securities, thereby making them more expensive but with very little yield. In turn, investors buy corporate bonds instead because there&#39;s not a viable alternative. It&#39;s propping up the market.</p>

<p>And then the European Central Banks actually buy corporate bonds themselves... which to me is all kinds of crazy. Oh and guess what? The guy who runs the ECB, Mario Draghi, is <em>also</em> part of the Rockefeller&#39;s &quot;group of 30,&quot; which is &quot;a private group of lobbyists in the finance sector.&quot; I looked at the Group of 30&#39;s website and what they advocate specifically: it&#39;s essentially the privatization of stuff. Larry Summers&#39; symposium there laid out how countries should invest in infrastructure... but then have it through a user fee model (like toll roads, ugh). In his words, &quot;minimizing cost&quot; should be the &quot;primary objective&quot; as it relates to infrastructure improvement... so goodbye unions, stable work and ensured environmental safety regulations; hello cheap privatized labor and haphazard environmental risks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bayer&#39;s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer">chemical company</a> (like Monsanto - note that the PR wonks who hang out here claim to be pro-GMO, but mostly they push agrichemicals) and has a CropScience division. It makes sense as a merger, but yeah, it&#39;s scary and massive anti-trust issues. It will be interesting to see if their abusive marketing tactics change after the acquisition or if they continue unfettered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, I had no clue, but like you said, it does make sense, especially in this geopolitical climate. I also knew that agrichemicals is a huge business, but I underestimated the scope of it. </p>

<p>I think they&#39;ll keep their tactics, but try better to lay low and mobilize their team of astroturfers. In a way, this merger will make it easier to shut down any disagreements about GMOs and bad business practices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Monsanto&#39;s control goes way beyond their chemicals. Do a little research and you&#39;ll realize how many seed companies are owned by Monsanto. They dabbled in &quot;terminator technology&quot; in the late nineties, which caused crops to produce sterile seeds, forcing farmers and gardeners alike to purchase new seed every year, instead of saving seed from their crops. They promised not to pursue this, but I&#39;ve heard rumors that they started again a couple of years ago.
As a side note, the Syrian civil war has caused the first withdrawal from the doomsday seed vault, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they come out with pharma-infused crops to &quot;counter the negative western diet&quot;. Maybe some cholesterol lowering corn?</p>

<p>Anyhow one easy example of why M&amp;As inflate the market is because of the S&amp;P500. This is what most people&#39;s 401k&#39;s and IRA&#39;s are invested in. It&#39;s made up of 500 companies. The value of the SP500 is based on the underlying companies. When two of these companies merge, there is only 499 companies, but still the same value in the SP500. Now there is a hole that needs filled, bringing in a 500th company, and billions of new money into the index that is the SP500.</p>

<p>This is also the main index people are talking about when referring to the stock market. In other words, when the SP500 is up, the stock market is up.</p>
