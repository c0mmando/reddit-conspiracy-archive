       He's as fake as fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over at r/futurology and some of the sci and tech subreddits, they fucking love this guy. It's like he's reddit's boyfriend or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the guy is a billionaire. And in the kind of world we live in, you don't become (or remain) a billionaire without being a certain type of person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Musk's real ambition is to get into space. Him and his friends eventual goal is to privatize access to space. Someday they'll want to privatize NASA and get a hold of all their assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they're going to want to get out into space and become trillionaires by mining asteroids and doing whatever else. Since US or whatever laws don't apply in space, they could also do all kinds of research or other activities that would be totally illegal anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr; Space is the new frontier. Just like the old west, whoever gets out there first gets incredibly rich and powerful. This is what Musk and others like him are
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       after.

       Most of the people who admire Musk have never actually met him. All they know is what comes to them through the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be willing to bet he's got a carefully managed image. The real man behind the image probably has little resemblance to his public "Musk persona".

       Elon is a member of the
       <em>
        Atlas Shrugged
       </em>
       demographic; one of reality's answers to Tony Stark.  There are a few of those.  A lot of people hate them, but they truthfully don't bother me.  I've mostly got rid of my sense of inadequacy over not being one of them, too now, which took a long time.  If he wants to build electric cars and fly people into space, more fun to him; it's a lot more work than I am prepared to do, but when I was younger I used to have ambition myself.

       Way to side-step his legitimate observation.  He's right though, you reek of a sockpuppet account trying to 'blend in'.

       Also, there is no need for a coma after 'subreddit'.  Perhaps you should aspire to be a master of the art of grammar, instead of dick-riding billionaires for reasons you either can't understand or were paid to say.

       Look at the age and post count of my account before you assume that; but then again, I hardly need to prove anything to random people on the Internet.

       I am basically just tired of viewing people as monsters, like everyone else in this sub does, is all it is.  Elon also genuinely doesn't come across to me as someone who is that bad comparitively, either.  Yes he's a billionaire, but there are worse people.

       Who said you were plotting against me? This forum, like the others, is filled with shill accounts.  Just because I think you may be one doesn't mean I think it's got something to do with me, I don't know where you even got that idea lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think shill accounts existing for the purpose of derailing threads, etc is too far fetched an idea for you to internalize perhaps you're in the wrong forum, hey guy?

       If I felt he was legit I wouldn't have an issue with that at all. But I also feel I know how things work in the world - the new world order is in place.. that's why I find it odd someone like Musk could do what he is doing without being part of it.

       I don't think Elon is anything sinister, other than possibly being a common or garden variety self-aggrandising psychopath, which is hardly anything unusual these days.  Tesla are doing something positive by selling electric cars, even if in Elon's mind, he's just getting in on the ground floor.  Occasionally I hear about him being involved with SpaceX or a random bit of transhumanist silliness, but that is background noise to me.  I spent too long being paranoid about the transhumanists; I don't want to be scared of them any more.  I won't live forever anyway; none of us will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope Elon has fun.

       Keep in mind that all of this could be theater in preparation for a bigger agenda. Not unlike 9-11 and stuff that led to it being theater for that whole agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       For one weird example of the weird agendas they have -  in this video they talk about how there is this sacred geometrical line that goes around the Earth and the people in power constantly wage war just on this line for some reason...  they have really weird plans that are difficult for us to understand.

       You can't be one of the
       <em>
        Atlas Shrugged
       </em>
       demographic and also be an Alpha.  Alpha's assume responsibility for the pack, which is what the role of the Alpha actually is about, not being the 'strongest'.  They lead hunts for food, fight to defend all of the members of their pack and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being the strongest is merely the means of determining who the Alpha is, not what he should do once becoming Alpha.  If a wolf who was of the
       <em>
        Atlass Shrugged
       </em>
       mindset became Alpha, he would just wander off from the pack and no longer be an Alpha, having abandoned his responsibilities, and become just another lone wolf.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, being an Alpha doesn't give one carte blanche to just treat the others however he wishes- if he becomes too heavy-handed the rest of the pack will turn on and kill him or drive him away.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's amazing how often that term is misunderstood and twisted around to mean nothing more than 'stronk'.

       I recommend starting with his paper from Oct 2013 "From Theosophy to the Beat Generation" and work your way forward through his papers. He makes discoveries as he goes along, and the papers kind of build on each other, so it's best to start more or less at the beginning and work your way forward.

       Musk is obviously a very smart man, which begs the question, he must know that humans have never left Low Earth Orbit, in 2001 he said he hopes to send humans to Mars within 10–20 years, that is the most idiotic thing i have ever heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       This year he said  a manned flight departing in 2024 to mars is now happening, again absolutely ridiculous, he wants people to believe in 8 fucking years humans are going to land on Mars, that is some high level bullshit.

       Learn about them, you will then quickly realise that they are not compatible with human life, you would need at an absolute minimum of one meter of lead, it is preposterous what the Apollo missions claim, that they just went through them quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there is zero evidence for this NASA claim and zero evidence that humans have gone much higher than a few hundred miles above earth.

       What do you think the belts look like?   They are toroidal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you assume there is the same radiation over spherical volume that there is from a toroid?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look for yourself.   I would like to see your calculation of 1m lead shield needed to travel through the belt at their weakest points.
      </p>
      <p>
       The claim is not preposterous to me that they exposed them to dangerous but minimized amount of radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for evidence.   Why don't you fund and build an experiment to verify your theory.     You might be able to send a drone there yourself and check.

       More the Japanese satellite mapped the landing area in 3D and it matches very well with the photographs from the landing.   How could anyone have mocked it up in such exact detail before anyone knew what it looked like?

       you're right.  they did send other creatures and measured the radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instrumentation flown on these missions gathered data on micrometeor flux, solar and cosmic rays, magnetic fields, radio emissions, and solar wind. Many photographs were taken and biological payloads were also flown. Zond 5 was the first spacecraft to carry a group of terrestrial creatures (tortoises being the most complex) on a circumlunar flight and return relatively safely to Earth. Zond 5 splashed down in the Indian Ocean after descending steeply with a 20 G deceleration rate. Although unsafe for humans, these high Gs apparently didn't affect the tortoises' health, and they were reportedly able to breed afterwards

       I just have a weird feeling he is too good to be true.. and that he is someone who was groomed for the position he's in... for what agenda exactly I don't know.

       I don’t know much about his back story, but he certainly aims high. He's kind of like a modern day Henry Ford, in that he's trying to revolutionize transportation. I like everything he's doing and I hope it all works out for the best. Like I said, my knowledge of him is very superficial.

       Have you ever heard the theory of why we went to war in Afghanistan? One reason supposedly was the drug trade...  and the other was the incredible amount of elements in their mountains that could be mined - for making batteries for electric cars. Then we have Musk come along and start the electric car industry all of a sudden.. And he is taking over the space industry too... I don't think the people in power want someone out of their control in control of the space industry.

       Haven't read others' comments, but yes, he does have something weird going about him.

       For a start, there is the hair transplant.  That could be the major part.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other part I think is his rapid rise -- and here is my theory, could be totally wrong, this guy has the backing of the US Government to do
       <em>
        something

       we don't know yet.  Just like Howard Hughes back in the day.

       That and the hair transplant perhaps explains the weird vibe.

       There's been a secret space program for decades. The moon landing was just a stunt to make us all debate whether or not it was real or not. Meanwhile, they've been doing interdimensional travel with warp drives.

       Musk is just part of the disclosure program. They need to give us enough bread and circus to make us think that's the forefront of tech, so we don't go hounding them for the shit they've got classified.

       There is no evidence whatsoever that "warp drives" can or do exist.  If there is any please point me in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think advanced propulsion technology exists, certainly, but it doesn't utilize warp drives or tear through space-time, it utilizes the relationship between electromagnetism and gravity.

       Yeah, as you crank up the disturbance to the em field through an extremely fast rotating capacitor, you can locally reduce the gravitational effect. That essentially can allow for inertialess travel.

       I've only heard of that warp drive through nasa propaganda sorta channels.

       Gotcha.  In your other comment I responded to, it seemed like you were saying you thought they actually had warp drive tech.

       Yeah couldn't be bothered typing out an EM-gravity explanation and just used warp drive to illustrate the point.

      <p>
       I don't think they need warp drives because of the way stargates work.

       You see it exactly like I do.. I also believe there is a massive black space program.. OR there may be another alternative... maybe we aren't allowed to leave this planet for some reason.

       I don’t know much about his back story, but he certainly aims high. He's kind of like a modern day Henry Ford, in that he's trying to revolutionize transportation. I like everything he's doing and I hope it all works out for the best. Like I said, my knowledge of him is very superficial.

       Who said you were plotting against me? This forum, like the others, is filled with shill accounts.  Just because I think you may be one doesn't mean I think it's got something to do with me, I don't know where you even got that idea lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think shill accounts existing for the purpose of derailing threads, etc is too far fetched an idea for you to internalize perhaps you're in the wrong forum, hey guy?
