        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The FDA has failed to provide me with anything other than some officiousness and a confirmation that this request has been received, updated in terms of wanting &quot;all documents responsive to &#39;cannabis&#39; or &#39;marijuana&#39; or &#39;marihuana&#39; key terms&quot; since they are incapable of giving documents responsive to an event in their history (ex: &quot;when the decision was made that cannabis had no medical value&quot;), I figure they can put in a SQL query and give me results.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve kept track of all the emails sent, and I&#39;ve posted here on reddit those (search &quot;cannabis foia&quot; if you are interested).   </p>

<p>This is the latest update and the moment I go over the 20 day mark on the &#39;fwd&#39; I will contact OGIS and get them to help me, possibly will get foiaadvocates at that point to help also. </p>

<p>I want to subpoena that info.  I might make a case that this is racketeering and that I was harmed by their decision and go that route.  I&#39;m going to throw everything I can at them.  I can literally make this my only job in life is to get to the bottom of this gd issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  And I encourage you all to find an issue where the government is obviously full of shit and do good research and call them out on it.  It&#39;s not important that THEY know, they already know. Its important that you reach those in the larger public that still have years left in their lives.  you want to get them to do something and if they don&#39;t, to make them feel worse and even less powerful then they already do...until they shut the hell up completely, become so disengaged that they even stop fighting <em>us</em> like they have for the last 15 yrs</p>

<p>If we hit them with a million FOIA requests they&#39;d be swamped and they would not be able to fulfill their 20 day request, then we could logjam the OGIS and THEY wouldn&#39;t be able to fulfill, so then you&#39;d have to appeal to city of london (YEP) ombudsman on information and/or UN.  I mean that&#39;s one avenue to make ourselves known.</p>

<p>Turn bureaucracy into a bad self eater of itself until it literally breaks.  And it&#39;s perfectly legal and our right as citizens.</p>

<p>Another possible outcome--and this is crazy talk--you actually get the info you requestd</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s more than that.  I&#39;ve talked with them and had several email exchanges.  As is stands, the request has been accepted and forwarded to a specific &quot;department of drugs&quot; or something like that.  I&#39;m like, isn&#39;t that what the fda is?  Oh &#39;food&#39; and drugs. So it took her a week of back and forth to decide if marijuana was a food or a drug.</p>

<p>This kind of &quot;the government employs the most incompetenet of the incompetent&quot; is an attitute that is being validated by this very process.  We got caught in this loop of &#39;the fda doesn&#39;t answer questions it only gives requested documents&#39;....&quot;but I don&#39;t know what those documents are, how can I request them if i don&#39;t know what they are&quot;....&quot;we aren&#39;t obligated to answer questions&quot;....&quot;F- IT GIVE ME EVERYTHING WITH POT KEYWORDS&quot;  (except I said this nicely)</p>

<p>Schedule 1 is defined by DEA is it not? Id imagine they would be the appropriate people to submit an FOI request to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>US Patent 6,630,507  Cannabinoids as Antioxidants and Neuroprotectants </p>

<p>&quot;Cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties, unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found property makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease, Parkinson&#39;s disease and HIV dementia. Nonpsychoactive cannabinoids, such as cannabidoil, are particularly advantageous to use because they avoid toxicity that is encountered with psychoactive cannabinoids at high doses useful in the method of the present invention.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s good.  At some point, like I&#39;ve said many times before, we are barking up maybe a wrong tree with this FDA/DEA federal legalizing biz (see my post about bernie sanders never serious about federally legalizing &#39;marihuana&#39;).  It comes down to the UN, and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances...which is in stark conflict with their own UN Declaration of Human Rights in at least 3 or possibly 5 different articles (5 is a bit of stretch)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very cynical about this.  It&#39;s not about getting the information although I&#39;d love to get it.  It&#39;s about showing everyone that FOIA is an illusion and they don&#39;t give you what you ought to know.   They are little children with very little skill and a high amount of bureaucratic training that keeps them from getting into &#39;any trouble&#39; or &#39;reflecting poorly on the organization they represent&#39;.  This has the effect of stifling progress and transparency to the extent it creates a censorship.  It also has the effect of hiring and retaining the worst employees because mavericks and those who are good (ie: those who &#39;strive for excellence&#39;) have absolutely NO patience for either their low-skill coworkers (whom they will have to do extra work to accommodate or make up for) or the stifling environment of abject mediocrity that is the government, and so those &#39;excellent people&#39; leave and work for private industry.</p>

<p>I am convinced now, that there are no &quot;good guys&quot; in government.  They are either derpy nothingbots that just do their job and like to not do anything for the public while thinking they are (they are wrong), or they are vicious psychopaths whose entire lives is a narcisstic campaign to attract foolish people and money to them like a magnet.  And secret socieites help these people get &#39;on the grid&#39;, &#39;on the map&#39;, &#39;on the chessboard&#39;--they make them &quot;a player&quot; in this magnet game, because they get a cut of all the earnings, but most importantly they get to inculcate an agent that can &#39;increase their overall capacity to create more magnets&#39;.   </p>

<p>People who are both employees and members of secret societies are by definition double agents.  Because secret socieites aren&#39;t a secret without a loyalty oath that is primary to their secret society, which makes their public employment a secondary loyalty and therein creates a HUGE conflict of interest.  It ought to be illegal, but the fact that it isn&#39;t shows you who has the power in our society and surprise M&#39;fkas, it&#39;s not &#39;the people&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, don&#39;t do that.  They still legally have 20 days and it sounds like they are finally on a course.  When I get back something from the &#39;drugs&#39; dept that my request is &quot;too large in scope&quot; or some other problem, I&#39;m going to subpoena them for all of it and according to lawyers it will cost them, not me, to provide it.  Of course, that means all of us will be paying for it (taxpayers) and by us / taxpayers I mean Syrians and Iraqis and Afghani drug money, because our economy is so shit right now I doubt they are getting enough taxes (withiout a black money subsidy) since they are lying about unemployment numbers, increasingly using robots and other ways to disintermediate/disenfranch middle class -- that whole neolib trip</p>
