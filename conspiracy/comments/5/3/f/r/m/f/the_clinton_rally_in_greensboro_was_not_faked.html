    <div class="md"><p>Fishy as fuck. I find it hard to believe anyone truly concerned and involved with r/conspiracy would say they agree on issues, let alone openly support Hillary. The way OP repeatedly says &quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about.&quot; is a huge red flag. In fact, I call bullshit OP. Faked or not, he is up to something here. Possibly the &quot;voice of reason&quot; that comes in to show how wrong we were as per the &quot;black propaganda&quot; theory.</p>

If this is true, I highly suggest you start looking for some &quot;fringe conspiracy&quot; YouTube videos relating to the Clinton&#39;s so you can see what all the hype here is about.

Russia announcing US aiding isis (no surprise there tbh!), the very fabric of history being an absolute lie etc. There are many things going on behind the veil, where darkness conducts it&#39;s business. Of course she&#39;s corrupt, a puppet for the big players, sold herself and her country, maybe even so far to say she could be the whore of babylon, considering she&#39;s carrying out international Jewrys work. But in all honesty it&#39;s a distraction, keeping people on a little trail, dropping breadcrumbs that lead no where.</p>

<p>Natural gas is actually <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/09/140924-natural-gas-impact-on-emissions/">NOT</a> a great substitute for energy.

    <div class="md"><p>Because these pollutants are a lot more short term than something like co2 or methane that don&#39;t kill for years and years through climate change. Things like so2 and NOx that get filtered through the environment faster but are far more deadly. Also the numbers were a bit bigger than I said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This article says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our 2004 study showed that power plant impacts exceeded 24,000 deaths a year, but by 2010 that had been reduced to roughly 13,000 deaths due to the impact that state and federal actions were beginning to have. The updated study shows that strong regulations that require stringent emission controls can have a dramatic impact in reducing air pollution across the country, saving lives, and avoiding a host of other adverse health impacts. The study also shows regrettably that some areas of the country still suffer from unnecessary levels of pollution from power plants that could be cleaned up with the application of proven emission control technologies.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article says the reason this happened was because state and federal laws required power plant companies to have better emission control technologies in place, not fracking that reduced the pollutants . In fact they are finding out that fracking is much more dangerous then previously <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/are-fracking-workers-being-poisoned-job/">thought</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s honestly not meant to be! </p>

<p>Ignorance is defined as a lack of knowledge or information, which seems to be correct in your case, in regards to the negatives about H. You&#39;re choosing the leader of your world for the next 4+ years, its a huge decision. Like all adult decision (again, no insult here, adult meaning important life decisions like cars/homes/careers/marriage/etc), all sides should be taken into account. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be the first to say I know ignorance is bliss firsthand! I loooove eating meat. Chicken, beef, bring it all on. Because of this, I refuse to ever watch documentaries like Food Inc. I&#39;d rather be ignorant and continue eating my McDs.</p>

<p>My best friend is married to a serial cheater. She knows, and is devastated every time. He claims he&#39;s changed, but she knows he can&#39;t. She loves him to the point where she flat out told me she&#39;d rather be ignorant to whatever is happening. If she doesn&#39;t catch him she can keep believing her lie that he&#39;s changed.</p>

<p>Hopefully it sounds like less of an insult now, although I probably didn&#39;t use the best examples hehehe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are alot of these smaller issues you guys bring up. Yes, if true they are terrible. But at some point I am not voting for how good or bad of a person the president is on these small scale issues. They could be bought, they could be a murderer, they could be helping facilitate foreign wars. That sucks, but none of those things come close to the large scale issues I care about.</p>

<p>I have been studying or conducting research in Economics for the past decade. 
I know Trump is going to do everything he can for lower taxes across the board. It so overwhelmingly agreed upon in my field of how dangerous lowering taxes is at a time like this when the developed world is on the brink of massive automation. We already have mountains of evidence of how well many European countries are doing with high tax rates and very socialist policies. We also have mountains of evidence of how dangerous cutting taxes can be right now. Take a look at what happened in Kansas. Their economy has been absolutely obliterated since their cuts.</p>

<p>Low taxes works well in a very capitalist society, which we were for a long time. That time is over. Capitalism can&#39;t survive alone with automation. It has to work in tandem with many socialist policies. This is not even a debate among those who spend their lives researching economics.  Economic policies will have a far larger effect on us than anything else being brought up, bar maybe climate change. Which Trump is also on the wrong side of. I can&#39;t vote for someone who just ignores science and research. I rather have a criminal in office than someone who is literally running in the opposite direction of what science and research tells us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP, I also went to a Hillary rally. Did anybody shout anything or do anything goofy? Also, did they have you go through metal detectors? Just curious.</p>

<p>You should consider helping your local campaign office to garner votes. They typically do the phone lines, door-to-door voter registration, and personal email-wipes (jk).</p>

<p>Its a fun way to meet a lot of crazy people during this election time. Tell me you&#39;ll at least try the phone lines out!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did go through a metal detector. Some people had to be pat down because of necklaces etc. One guy got turned away for a pocket knife. During the speech there was one guy yelling &quot;you suck&quot; while holding a Benghazi sign. There was another guy who was really close to where I was that shouted &quot;Hillary! Imma let you finish, BUT FUCK DONALD TRUMP!&quot; Everyone got mad at him for trying to interrupt the speech. One ladies eyeballs looked like they popped out of her head while she was telling him to be quiet. I did sign up to register people to vote  but I had to turn them down because of all the exams I&#39;ve got this week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For myself, I don&#39;t pay any attention to the &#39;muddy the water&#39; posts in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  That generally means anything that includes a bunch arrows or discussions about CIA codespeak in some wikileaks email that really means someone put out a hit on someone else or whatever.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think they are possibly true, it&#39;s just beyond my personal ability to sift through all the crap and know if the person is a nut job.</p>

<p>I scan <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for things like early news about stuff that later comes out on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> etc...</p>

<p>Right now <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is having a HUGE boost in credibility due to the wikileaks exposures, especially concerning the DNC emails/podesta.  That&#39;s great.  I love it.</p>

<p>But... it also means that a bunch of CTR and other shills are going to be coming here to talk up patently schizoid BS and try to put the subreddit back in it&#39;s place.  Can&#39;t have the general public thinking there are critical thinkers here, that wouldn&#39;t do at all.</p>
