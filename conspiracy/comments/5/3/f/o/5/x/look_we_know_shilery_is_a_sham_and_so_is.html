    <div class="md"><p>When we have stories on Hillary the story is really about the collusion and owning of the mainstream media. She is the queen of the establisment at the moment. This is why she comes up so often. Never has propaganda been more blatant on NBC and CNN. The story isn&#39;t Hillary even if that is all we see in the headline. The story is the broken system, of which she is the figurehead. She is a puppet but has served as a gateway for much of this information to be circulated. Against all odds. It is a full court press of every media organization to label any anti-Hillary person as racist, crazy or ignorant. All of these Hillary stories are about the American and Global Oligarchy. That is why all of these articles seem to be about her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no more important, more pervasive conspiracy in the world right now than the absolute corruption of the American political elite (of which Hillary Clinton is the current puppet/spokesperson) and the propaganda industry known as the mainstream media. </p>

<p>This toxic collusion has been an enabler of a myriad of other conspiracies both in the US and around the world, including the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, and the trillion dollar fraud that is the &quot;war on terrorism&quot;.</p>

I&#39;m just numb to it knowing it&#39;s rigged and watching people get all worked up about something no one has any real control of and seeing that when people get all worked up (just like with sportsball) it&#39;s what TPTB want.

<p>Sorry but this is just a shitty mentality.  You should understand that the more the public knows about what&#39;s going on, then the public has more power.  A prime example of this is when something goes viral on Facebook or Reddit.  If something goes negatively viral against a corporation, then that corporation backs down, shuts up or apologizes and reverses course.  </p>

<p>Hillary isn&#39;t scary and neither were the rest of them.  The problem is that these people are crooks or aren&#39;t looking out for public interest.  They&#39;re just looking out for themselves and are stepping on the backs of the taxpayers to do it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted a similar complaint on this sub btw because it&#39;s blatantly obvious. These types of threads -- non-political -- are highly controlled here without a doubt. This includes controlled voting. The main repeated replies I received <em>in my same thread</em> was, &quot;those topics are for another sub (critical shower thoughts)&quot;, meaning, if you dont have political circle jerk topics to post here, then go to this other sub which implies any thoughts you have that do not contribute to this endless political circle jerk should be considered inferior and not worth discussing.</p>
