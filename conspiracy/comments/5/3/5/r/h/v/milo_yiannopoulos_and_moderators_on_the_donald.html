       Milo announced some self proclaimed billionaire u/nimblerichman that they formed a super pac called ''nimble america''
And wanted donation money. 
A trying to get rich quick scheme with Milo involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods started deleting comments and banning users who called out their scam (i was one of the first to get banned

       </a>

      </p>
      <p>
       Then an hour later, moderator u/tehdonald made an ''explanation'' sticky about what happened.
Doubling down.

       They planned this for months.
Yet the website
       <a href="https://www.nimbleamerica.com/">
        https://www.nimbleamerica.com/
       </a>
       has about 2 hours of design implementation.
And is ripped from the DJT website template. Which is what other scams have been doing this election cycle.
And no one can be named, for no real arguable reason.
And instead of being registered as a PAC, they supposedly registered as a charity.
Located in a strip mall in connecticut.
With a california phone number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moderators refuse to step down.
The_Donald has been compromised by corrupt scammers with Milo included.

      <p>
       Mod tehdonald and lil-z stepped down.

       have been taking advantage of all the Hillary scandals (wich is actually conspiratorial) to take over this sub. If you've been following closely, and have been well informed, it's pretty obvious that both candidates are total thrash. I've been against political bullshit in this sub since day one, but at some point it was just

       2.0 so I didn't even bother... Someone linked to Hillary get murdered? Yeah, I want to know about that. CNN polls are not accurate? well no shit, It's been the same forever, fuck both of them. No political fandom in this sub please!

       Uh if anything this sub has been taken over by foaming at the mouth leftists. Any mention of Donald Trump immediately elicits downvotes and scorn on here even though he has brought up actual "conspiracy theory" talking points several times this campaign unlike any other presidential candidate in history. The horde of Berniebots invaded this sub and than unfortunately never left even after their candidate lost. This sub was not filled with Marxist tankies and other far left degenerates like this a year or two ago at all.

       I disagree. I'll grant you that this sub has become a political battleground and that the influx of drones and shills comes from both sides of the spectrum, but the surge in low-quality OP's and comments has definitely skewed rightward. Maybe you thought it was too leftist before all this happened? Fine. Some people think Marxist = Degenerate. Nonetheless, the recent increase in flimsy, notional conspiracies attributed to the Clintons has been obnoxious.

       I have to 100% disagree. Every time I say something even remotely critical of Trump on this subreddit I am downovted. The front page is constantly filled with posts about Clinton. How can you possibly believe that this subreddit has been taken over by leftist Clinton supporters? That honestly sounds delusional to me.

       At best, maybe ten percent of posts/submissions here are worthwhile and insightful. Then you have the filler from places like AboveTopSecret and X-files fan fic.

       It was "called out" by blind Trump zealots and the friends/alts of the person who was exposed for abusing alts.

       Fuck, you beat me to it! I was going to say, what a surprise that the Jewish leader of a movement ended up subverting it. Never trusted him, especially when it was revealed that as early as 2011, there is an article written by Milo arguing FOR censorship on the internet! I can't find the article, but it's there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Found it. Here's a passage:
      </p>
      <p>
       "So perhaps what’s needed now is a bolder form of censure after all, because the internet is not a universal human right. If people cannot be trusted to treat one another with respect, dignity and consideration, perhaps they deserve to have their online freedoms curtailed. For sure, the best we could ever hope for is a smattering of unpopular show trials. But if the internet, ubiquitous as it now is, proves too dangerous in the hands of the psychologically fragile, perhaps access to it ought to be restricted. We ban drunks from driving because they’re a danger to others. Isn’t it time we did the same to trolls?"

       While I am Pro-Trump and do believe he is anti-NWO/Illuminati, I still think the 'system's shills' will surround him and guide him in his decision making to continue to do 'corrupt nwo bullshit' as a puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of Milo, I'm still going to wait and see. He blew up with the Trump movement and when you blow up, there is a lot of money and people that come around, so some times its difficult to gage who/what has what kind of principals and motives for being around you. So we shall see.....however what happened is not a good look.....I'm sure he's going to think twice now about selling out

       It's no coincidence that the jews are repelled by the Trump movement like vampires by the cross. He's exposing their jewish machinations just by existing. At this point it can safely be assumed that any jew seen supporting him is doing so in bad faith for ulterior purposes. We need to root out their influence.

       In case you haven't noticed, Milo is a Jew, homoosexual, likes to brag about his attraction to Africans, and calls Trump "daddy". It's exactly the kind of degeneracy we don't want in the Trump movement. He's a subversive influence, he's not in it for Trump, he's in it to draw attention to himself - a Jew participating in bad faith, as I mentioned above.

       I love how you assume being a jew makes you necessarily evil/malicious also that being homosexual is bad, (if not, why point  to it as a reason not to like Milo).

      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I still think Milo is scum, but I also think that of most Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it's funny that you Trumpets are all about fighting the "regressive left" while using terms like "subversive influences in the movement" that were
       <em>
        literally
       </em>
       used by Stalinist as an excuse to kill other people that didn't agree with them.

       National socialism is an actual ideology with actual beliefs and policy proposals, not a word meaning "person I don't like". I'm a nationalist, but not a national socialist. I'm further to the right than nazis.

       It does. If you dispute this, it's ok, I don't give a fuck. Jews made up the holocaust to perpetually play the victim to European peoples, and they did 9/11 to get us to fight their wars. They have no place in western civilisation, and must be driven out.

       It's degenerate and I won't associate with it. Also notice how it's primarily the jews pushing us to normalise and accept this manner of degeneracy to demean our people.

       He's fairly young. It's common for people to change their minds about things. It's fair to say that his current opinion has had much more impact than some article he wrote years ago, so who cares? It's not like he ran for office with censorship in his platform.

       As far as I can tell, his fans both pretend it never happened or don't know about it. I was sort of a fan of his for arguing against SJW's however I always knew there was something fishy because he defends Israel against "the dirty palestinian terrorists", which is straight out of zionism 101. If I had to guess he's there to steer the alt-right movement into a certain direction. I just don't understand how no matter what political affiliation, no matter what group, if you have a powerful group there will always be a zionist at the forefront, when they are only like 1 or 2% of the world's population. It just baffles me.

       I'm sure they kind of look out for each other, which explains why guys like Mel Gibson get effectively blacklisted. But IME so do blacks, Muslims, and many other minority groups. Jews are just smart.

       I did too then I started to notice a couple things about him. in his speeches and talks you can tell when he is lying because he wont reference any facts at all he will just say "we all know this" or "it's pretty obvious." Any other time when he says something he backs it up by referencing specific facts, figures or research. He also refuses to talk about how he became "independently wealthy" He has made one reference to it ever (that I know of) and it was during an interview on The Sam Roberts' Show. Even then it was vague, he just said it had to deal with "London real estate." I confident that he is only doing this anti SJW thing because it's controversial. In the early and mid 2000's he fought gay rights as much as he is fighting SJWs now. He goes to wherever the best combination of money and controversy is. I am 100% confident that within a decade I'll go back to completely disagreeing with what he thinks.

       Dang, thanks for the genuinely great response. I've watched a lot of his videos, and this sort of just clicked in my head. I'm a big believer in face-checking shit you read on the Internet, so this is troublesome, and i'll need to further investigate. That 'independently wealthy' thing I can sort of understand, depending on what
       <em>
        actually made him wealthy.
       </em>
       If it was some sleazy bullshit, then i'm obviously against that. Of course, I also don't agree with the relatively common notion that just because you have money, you're an asshole. I hate to hear that about the gay rights. I'm a straight guy, but I was on the boat during the wedding ceremony between my sister and her wife - needless to say, I believe in gay rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is disappointing. I guess it can be hard to tell who is full of shit. From now on, i'll be examining him with a much more critical eye.

       I only brought up his unwillingness to disclose his income because people here claimed that the reason he was involved was to rip off the
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       people. So it is possible that he has been involved in laundering money from various campaigns or just good old fashioned dark money from nonprofits and trade unions. But yeah, best case scenario is that he is a gay guy who loves attention and money while not caring about much else.

       I always knew there was something fishy about that guy. He's always come off as disingenuous at best, and at worst a con artist. Got to hand it to him, though, he's played so many people into believing him, and in doing so has gained a shitload of influence.

       Maybe because it shows unbecoming naivete on r/conspiracy to ignore...I mean just like you are 'racist' for hating the non-race of islam, a persecuted minority has advantage in conflating ethnicity and religion, like the Jews have done for centuries, by establishing heritability and discouraging conversion.

       I don't think he really ever was considered an alt-right leader by anyone in the movement. From what I understand he was a Breitbart writer. He makes his living being an "edgy" anti-SJW type.

       What's interesting is that the things that he espouses that pertain to the alt right are rejected by the ultra-right subreddits moderators themselves. they blatantly claim that race is a primary part of their platform.

       Imagine spending over half a decade pretending to argue with yourself on the internet. Thats basically all they do all day every day. Literally most of their "conversations" are fake and manufactured. You also need to lie to people constantly. Also you have to do all this knowing youre complicit in an act of mass murder (i.e. covering up 9/11 info).

       I cant imagine how fucked up these people are in person. Actually, I can, they are likely similar to the bjork mail bomb guy, google it if you wanna see someone degrade into insanity.

       Completely contradicts what he's been saying. What was the last speech where he opened promising that the livelihood of the American workers has always been his first priority? What a bunch of bullshit. I can't believe anyone buys his crap.

       They're the same PR company that was working hard to discredit the ron paul campaign on digg 8 years ago.  Very similar MO to the gmo team and ctr.  i think there's likely some overlap.

       TehDonald (AKA jcm267) is a POS who has created many subs in the past. He helped create or created r/The_Donald and used some skills to help it gain traction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next bit is a bit sketchy...His jcm267 account became CisWhiteMealstrom. He had drummed up drama between his own two accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       He did a lot of shady shit including asking for donations for fabricated causes. He was banned and came back as another mod TehDonald.
      </p>
      <p>
       A week ago, TehDonald double announced (stickied two posts at the top) a PAC for Trump that had been set-up by a "rich man". The PAC wasn't a PAC, but a charity (?????) and it would be used to put up cheap ass billboards with shitposts.
      </p>
      <p>
       A resounding sound of "go fuck yourself" was heard throughout the sub and by morning, TehDonald, Lil-z, and Milo (who all seemed to play a part) were removed from the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast-forward to today: edit is now using this to say r/The_Donald posters are paid. Apparently, "rich guy" was one of the Occulus people and got $700m.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where the story makes no sense. Why would he need the few dollars that he could get out of The_Donald for cheap billboards? How does this get to The_Donald posters being paid shills?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems, TehDonald had a plan all along to make this sub a joke. CTR has spent $6m already, this is at least worth something to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the original plan was to make it look like Trump and a big block of his supporters were participating in election fraud, but that didn't work, so they went with TehDonald was paid, therefore all r/The_Donald users are paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the closest I can make of it and I've been on there for a while.

       Okay, so I was checking the FAQ section of the site and I found this:
       <a href="http://sli.mg/rox2bW">
        http://sli.mg/rox2bW
       </a>
       It was supposed to be an image of the first billboard they have up. Instead they leaked a picture of one their conversations. Then I did a little more digging and found this:

       "Your candidate"? What sane, rational person in the USA today would use the phrase "my candidate" or "your candidate"? And why make assumptions? You talking like that is giving me the same feeling I get when CTR assumes I'm voting for Trump just because I talk about how Hillary is a literal traitor who deserves to spend her remaining time in prison. Chill the fuck out.

       the_donald is not some sort of grassroots subreddit despite what the centipedes say,  in fact there really isn't any kind of real grassroots movement anymore and maybe never was.

       Two months ago I found a trump shill posting identical comments to two different posts about Hilary's Alinsky paper.  Two different user names and one of the OP's were diff as well.

       This, I fucking hate hillary clinton but this place has become thedonald2. I miss the old conspiracy content. A lot of conspiracy boards all over the internet have become overtly political since Trumps candidacy. I'll probably vote for the dude but goddamn, not everything has to be about Trump and it's become that way on pretty much every "conspiracy" oriented site.

       I got banned from that sub yesterday for informing people about the scam and sharing the moderators chat logs proving a conspiracy. So yeah, it's definitely real and not some sort of false drama.

       On the anniversery of 9/11 that sub was giving itself handjobs in the comment section of a story about the supposed dancing and cheering Muslims on that day in 2001.  The only problem is that those videos are not of people actually  celebrating 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment section? Full of "we should turn all their sand into glass!!!" RAW RAW 'Murica shit that you get from a bunch of guys trying to compensate for never getting laid, and that are probably too overweight to do any of the warfare they're calling for. Basically it really pissed me off.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I post a video of James Corbet explaining how the videos were fake. I did it on a lot of comments, hell...I thought some of the comments were spam anyways.  And I was banned. I tried to message the mods....never got a response..I've gotten to the frontpage of reddit via that sub before. I'm clearly not a spam account. I've heard nothing from them

       Yeah I am very confused with that sub. They seem to latch onto known false narratives and encourage the users to promote such ideas and get them noticed etc. Not crazy to assume its a tool used to smear Trump supporters with the crazy brush.

       No I didn't miss that part. No idea what this has to do with my comment? Everything I said is true and what you just said confirms that it was real and not just false drama... just like I said. No idea what you are talking about, you wanted me to come back and give people constant updates about what was happening? I wrote one message explaining what happened to me regarding the situation.

       Yes the drama was real, yes it was news worthy, yes the entire community rioted and kicked out the mods responsible.

       I think its more a case of them just neglecting the thread rather than some sort of  hit job. I appreciate you explaining your position and I do agree with what you said. I just hadn't came back to this thread since that original comment I made, till someone replied today. Surpised it's still a sticky but Milo deserves to be called out for what he done.

       Yeah. I got banned there once for using a meme, supposedly concern trolling. The meme "wtf... I hate ___ now"
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course now the meme has gained some traction, as i've seen it used there the few times I visit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ban got lifted and shortly after the lift got perma banned for being racist. I said ''there's a reason Jewish stereotypes exist". Sure it's not a nice thing to say but it's true. Hahaha this new scandal proves it

       So far no evidence of a scam.  Seems like a lot of closet Milo haters coming out of the woodwork.  If people want to give money who cares.  If Milo wants to buy two tour buses with the money I wouldn't care.

       It's funny that only recently in an interview he stated that he was a gay Jew. Up until then he always identified as and said he was a gay Greek man raised in the UK. Funny how he neglected to mention that for so long. I always had mixed opinions about him but I think now that he's always been controlled opposition. What a shame

       I assumed he was Greek because of his last name and it has never occurred to me that he was a Jew. Maybe he is controlled opposition but then again the MSM still hasn't warmed up to him. Let's see.

       so you follow a clinton donor and family friend, who has been set up to "run against" clinton's wife? come back here in 8 years and tell us all about how that works out, then maybe stop falling for the same old false opposition, fake-political debate cycle over and over again every 4 years.

       Exactly my point. The alt-right, not the Queen Milo lead mainstream media narrative, is a white nationalist movement. There is a difference between the alt-right in the sense of what CNN is reporting on and people are talking about, and what the movement actually is. Cartoon nazi frogs and shitposting are only a part of it.

       , for example, is not an alt-right subreddit. It has some people that are alt-right within it, and espouses some alt-right values, but it is not an alt-right movement.

       If you're able to argue that the links I sent you do not exist, I'd listen.  But they're there.  That SoundCloud podcast is downright gut-wrenchingly bad, and they're endorsing Trump.

        Several alt-right members of Reddit that PM'd me when I tried to say the same thing you did (that it didn't exist).  They sent me the links above.  I've literally been arguing why they're racist assholes for many days now, and can provide screenshots if your'e interested.  They're much more reasonable than SRS or CTR shills have been, yet at the same time, they're incredibly racist and self-admitted bigots.  And Pro Trump as it gets (wish it weren't true but it is).

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I've been researching the shit out of it so that I could confirm for myself whether it exists or not.  From you comment, I do not believe that you have.  The burden of proof is on me at this point to show that it does, which is why I posted the links above.

       So... Some israelis and 3 other people embrace the notion of an alt-right therefore it exists? That's not enough for me. A movement is far more than that - go to YouTube during the next hoaxed event and see the 10s or 100s of thousands of people watching, researching, and exposing it - THAT is a movement - not 6 people. And you listed vox day twice in only 4 links.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm going to have to double down: the true movement they're afraid of and trying to discredit are the hoards that are waking up to corruption and social engineering - the alt right is a fabricated distraction. And these dummies embracing it are useful idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's what trump is too. A distraction for the masses while Hillary et al can realize their "unbridled ambitions" for power and influence and therefore: $$$$$$$.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corrupt government is the problem not people waking up to it.

       People waking up to corruption are not the problem but that is precisely who Government,MSM, Hillary etc are attempting to demonize with their fabricated "alt-right". Trump is exposing corruption all over - voicing what more and more are discovering on the Internet.  THAT is the true movement: people waking up to unbridled corruption.

       Science is and never will be consensus. If it were we would still be treating the mentally ill with exorcisms. Just think for a second, different genes make us look different, metabolize different, develope at different rates.... But not think or act different? You're unfortunately falling for the propaganda if you actually believe that races aren't real.

       Your argument makes no sense.  Exorcisms were prior to the development of the scientific method and evidence based medicine.  They are a religious practice, nothing to do with science.
You are the one falling for a simple divide and conquer strategy.
There is one race, the human race.  Do some research of advances  in interpreting the human genome and stop spreading hate.

       Really? Because I could have been raised in the south side of Chicago and wouldn't have an IQ of 85 or be in a gang. Guess why? You got it, genetics. Anyone who uses the "hur dur" argument tries to make others look stupid rather than making an intelligent argument themselves. You also think everything is black and white when you use works like "period". You try and end the conversation so you don't actually have to do any critical thinking. Obviously something as complex as human genetics isn't black and white and you've never taken the time to look into it. Lastly anyone who resorts to calling others names obviously has no intelligent counter arguments they can come up with so they try and use their emotions. Like you calling me "garbage", that's not an argument. You just can't come up with one so you're trying to hurt my feelings. Do you want to take some extra time and think of an actual counter argument this time, or just try and hurt my feelings again?

       Fine. Aren't you going to the detail of the hard genetics that makes black people different from whites. Why don't you also explain to me how things like environment has no effect on genetics at all because last I checked things like environment tend to  mold and change our genetics. My suspicion here is that you only looked at the side of genetics that support your claims that one race is Superior or different as some like to say. Unless you can prove that genetics are hard headed and don't change based on environment which would be retarded you can't really prove to me that any of the racial realism that's presented has any validity in adapting world.

       So, four hundred years of black people being in America and their levels of melatonin haven't changed, their metabolism hasn't changed, their bone structure hasn't changed, their limb length relative to their torsos haven't changed, their fat storage hasn't changed...... Etc. completely different environment to Africa eating different food and guess what, after all this time they haven't changed. Guess why? Because epigenetics still isn't very well understood and changes in the genetic level hardly happen in only four hundred years. They happen over thousands and thousands of years naturally or a few generations if you artificially create them in a lab. We've known for years each races average intelligence from IQ tests (ones that arn't verbal that only test mathematical/puzzle solving skills that aren't cultural). Look at the level of development Europe was at two, three, four, five, six, and seven hundred years ago compared to Africa, the Middle East and the Americas. What have Africans ever invented or contributed to society? The mud hut? Not trying to be a dick but that's pretty much it. When ever colonialism happened They were brought up hundreds of not thousands of years in the future. I'm interested to hear your arguments

       Like I want you to think about what it is I'm asking you to prove to me here. You're going to have to prove that epigenetic changes within black people are somehow possible and that they are hard coded to be as they are, or you're going to have to prove to me that their life hasn't been statistically harder than mine.

       Also, does anyone suspect that Milo could be a government operative/zionist sent agent trying to spread misinformation like some of the conspiracy shills they place in some places, like Alex Jones or Pamela Geller?

       I have a friend who met Jones, claims he is legit but was really paranoid about my friend visiting him (they have a mutual friend).  That shouldn't really convince you, but I trust my friend's judgement more than most anybody I've gotten to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something did seem to "switch" in Jones at some point, though.  I saw his Bohemian Grove documentary, and he seems so much more levelheaded there...  My friend met him in 2004, so who knows what happened?  I like some of the other people on Infowars though like Paul Watson or Millie Weaver.

       If you look at InfoWars today versus years ago, it's like a whole different site. Today's InfoWars is all about attacking Democrats and Democratic party views. So, yes, he definitely changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bohemian Grove stuff was his absolute high point. The rest of his work was not very good and quite redundant then and far worse now.

       I think that the focus is on now Democrats because of the election.  It's all everyone is talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many reasons why he could have changed.  I've heard many people claim he is a shill but provide no evidence except for the fact that his style is very hyperbolic and can seem stereotypical of a conspiracy theorist.  I'm guessing most of the change is just from stress + paranoia over time... he did gain weight.  The theory that he is Bill Hicks is ridiculous, I dunno if you heard that one, but it is worth checking out just for the humor alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am open to change my opinion.  Like I said, the other people on InfoWars seem pretty quality so I at least respect InfoWars and can at least appreciate what Alex Jones is doing.

       Here's the switch - he's a carny and he realized that carny clowning bullshit sells these days, so that became his bread and butter. Maybe once upon a time he opened people's eyes to certain things but now he is more concerned with lmaotrolled u little kid bullshit and selling his snake oil nonsense to marks.

       You are behind the times.  The media was calling Trump a clown back during the primaries.  That didn't work, so they switched to calling him a racist Hitler incarnate on steroids.  This proved to be more effective persuasion.  It isnt really logical, but then again, people aren't really logical.

       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald

       is so tightly controlled by the moderators is because they are monetizing that community as heavily as they dare. They encourage users to use certain image sharing sites, social media networks, and other platforms - it's always a new service, started by someone who claims that the old ones they're trying to disrupt are shills, functionally identical but with a more welcoming political atmosphere.

       This is true. They forced people to use a different picture hosting site other than imgur.

       Well, sli.mg and other platforms don't cost a dime.  An alternative for twitter is nice. But that was a failure.  Lots of subs also don't allow certain domains and whatnot.  The donald users just want the mods there to do their job as intended.

       I'm glad the community struck back. Yes, I understand Milo needs to make a living, and quite honestly, I don't blame him. Being an edgy faggot who writes and causes anger just isn't a marketable skill and is a huge problem as to why the people lecturing us over and over are actually out of touch elites who have never held down an actual job using a real life skill.
      </p>
      <p>
       He needs to go back to writing news articles part time, covering news events, even start his own fashion line if he so pleases, you know, ACTUAL work, like the rest of us every day Joes. I hope he learns his lesson and applies himself elsewhere. Politics should NOT be about making money on or making a living on. That's entirely the problem with everything in this country. 200 years ago politics was not a living and breathing industry with full time career workers. It was made up of volunteers and everyday men who took time out of their careers to make their community better.

       There was never any evidence of any of this. Everytime that was brought up by someone on this thread they got downvoted to oblivion and OP would say "This is

       Nothing. There's literally nothing going on here. Some mods at the_donald decided to create a campaign to put memes on billboards. Milo Yiannopoulos backed it and said he knew a billionaire who offered to match any donations made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a bunch of people, OP included, decided to cry about a "scam" for absolutely no reason. Even though from all available information, they went through all of the proper channels to set this thing up and had no intention of defrauding anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus OP has been replying to everyone calling him out by saying that "evidence isn't important" and "you're just ignorant if you can't use common sense to see that this is a scam".
      </p>
      <p>
       Prob just some people that hate Milo IMO because of his trolling, politics or sexuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way it's a witch hunt though and it def managed to drag down the credibility of this sub in my view at least.

       Looks like a scam, sounds like a scam. anonymous ''billionaire''.
Shady shit from mods.
Deleting comments, banning users.
Talking bout exist strategy by blaming a new mod going rogue.

       Sometimes you dont need proof.

Could be legit.

       Not my fault you're blind to the obvious.
Let me guess, you think a nigerian prince email scam isn't really a scam either.

       In fairness to Milo, I feel like his intent is to "troll" people more than to reap the rewards of scamming. Not saying it makes it right, but his motivation is probably different from the average conman.

       Is it possible that this is a false-flag? Consider: Just this media cycle, Hillary's campaign got busted triple-charging the credit cards of one-time donors. Just as this scandal breaks (right on cue) we have a scandal implicating Milo.

       And none of you find this the least bit suspicious?

        Footnote: Watch the movie "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". In it, the main character [played by Jimmy Stewart] tries to break up corruption in the Capitol. To neutralize him, the corrupt party bosses set up a fake fund [with Mr. Smith's name on it] and place money in it themselves. They later pretend to "discover" the fund and character assassinate Mr. Smith. They use all their media influence to portray him as the creator of the fake fund (when in fact he had nothing to do with it). See the climax of the film here:

       Milo isn't high profile though.
So i dont think it would hit MSM.
If they pulled it off, no one knew it was a scam until way later.
If the didnt (like right now) no one bats an eye on the media.

       Trumps camp has also had a donation scandal of its own.  People that donated to him had no way to cancel the donations.  It was set up so you could not make a one time donation, instead it was set up as a recurring monthly charge.  Only way to cancel was to contact your bank and have them decline charges.  Also Milo has had a scandal as well.  About taking donation to set up a collage fund that never happened.

       Shit, I forgot about that college fund for white males..... He's literally lied about everything for a good two years now. Has anyone done any research into his actual background? He always said he came from a Greek family and was adopted by a British family. Maybe he said he was Greek so people wouldn't think he was a Jew just from how he looks? He did say in a recent video that his mother is jewish. He's nothing but a con man

       Got downvoted to oblivion by Milo's asskissers.

      <p>
       Even got noticed on FB by him too.
      </p>

       EDIT: Also forgot to mention, hey Trump supporters, if you still think your prized prez candidate is legit, look into the fact that he's one of the biggest donors for the Clinton Foundation...

       Trump isn't one of clintons biggest donors.
But he has donated to them in the past.
He also donated to lots of other democrats and republicans.
It's called being a business man.

       Whatever the case, this (well... even the ones in the past) presidential "election" is nothing more than a mudslinging contest between Clinton  and Trump, while they are probably sitting behind closed doors sipping tea together and laughing at how the majority of Americans have bought the facade that is this election.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump truly was anti-establishment, the MSM would have censored the shit out of him like they did with Ron Paul in 2012. Instead they gave him more attention than he may have possibly required to win the Republican nomination.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr - fuck Hillary AND fuck trump. It's like choosing the shinier of two turdpiles.

       MSM cares more about ratings than anything.
Trump brings ratings.
The fact that the GOP and the republicans tried to destroy Trump shows that he's not part of the establishment.

       If you think there's anything to gain from choosing the "lesser" of two evils, then I got news for you too. Making the choice of who fucks you in the ass "less" is no fucking choice at all. The establishment wins either way. Trump is bought and paid for by the same people who have Clinton in their pockets. Enjoy your "democracy" while it lasts.

       With the highly probable exception of Bernie Sanders, this election is nothing short of a farce.
       <em>
        The press is making Trump out to be this sort of enemy that we're all supposed to oppose, but we're only supposed to do it behind Hillary Clinton
       </em>
       . The propaganda news rolls of WWII come to mind here. I guess the sinker for me is this:
       <strong>
        Bill Clinton and Donald Trump talked politics about 3 weeks before Trump announced his candidacy.
       </strong>
       Question is, did Bill Clinton encourage him to run?

When something looks like a scam and sounds like a scam and thousands of people think it's a scam.
With the mods on the chat log, saying how they'll blame a new mod going awol if they need an exist strategy.
Maybe it is a scam.

       If they wanted money from ordinary folks, no reason why they wouldn't just open a patreon or something. People would line up to give them cash with their level of dedicated followers.

       That's actually how the majority of political commentators on youtube work + anyone who isn't attached to an organization like Breitbart which funds them.

       Can someone explain to me where the crime / scam is? There's nothing unusual about this. This is a super PAC. This is how they operate. He wants to shitpost memes on billboards across America. They want money for the campaign. Totally normal. There's nothing in any of the links or even the modlogs to suggest that any of this was intended to rip people of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like he met with lawyers, did everything on the level. Asked his userbase to help fund it and they all decided to cry foul for no reason whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where is the scam? It's non-existent. This is how all super PAC's work and they aren't scams against the donors.

       Almost all campaign donations are non tax deductible. Where it's registered and where the phone number is are irrelevant. Are you presuming that a public figure, who is publicly attached to this endeavor, is trying to cover his tracks so he won't be tied to it?

       so if there wasn't a guy saying he would match donations that would make it less suspicious?

       I don't know how shady milo's past with charity funds are, AFAIK he's only been involved in the scholarship fund for white privilege, which last I heard is still in the making.

       Chat log has no indication that there was ever a scam, only that mods were nervous about the charges being leveled against them and wanted to protect themselves. I would feel the same in their position.

       Useless billboard 52 days before election? I mean I think this comment sums your bias up. Billboards are advertising tools that work to great effect and if they aren't supposed to use them in the final run up to the election then when exactly
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       they supposed to use them?

       Jesus not for nothing, those words sort of distill the absolute worst aspects of the thinking that happens here.

       Right but I don't understand how mods stepping down, when an entire sub is witch hunting them, somehow equates to an admission of guilt......unless you're one of the people on the witch hunt and you simply want to interpret reality in a way that suits your narrative, regardless of the facts or reason.

       You seem to have trouble understanding simple things.
What does a witch hunt do when the witch is killed/banished?
They go back their normal lives.
There's no hunt without a witch.

       (((jcm)))  and (((Milo))) sure are exhibiting pretty typical behavior. I'm surprised Milo has never told us about how his entire family was turned into lampshades by Hitler himself during the 70 trillion Jews murdered in the "muh Holocaust", and therefore needs reparation shekels.

       so you follow a clinton donor and family friend, who has been set up to "run against" clinton's wife? come back here in 8 years and tell us all about how that works out, then maybe stop falling for the same old false opposition, fake-political debate cycle over and over again every 4 years.

       Science is and never will be consensus. If it were we would still be treating the mentally ill with exorcisms. Just think for a second, different genes make us look different, metabolize different, develope at different rates.... But not think or act different? You're unfortunately falling for the propaganda if you actually believe that races aren't real.

       In case you haven't noticed, Milo is a Jew, homoosexual, likes to brag about his attraction to Africans, and calls Trump "daddy". It's exactly the kind of degeneracy we don't want in the Trump movement. He's a subversive influence, he's not in it for Trump, he's in it to draw attention to himself - a Jew participating in bad faith, as I mentioned above.
