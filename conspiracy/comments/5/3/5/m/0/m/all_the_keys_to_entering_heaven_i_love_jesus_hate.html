        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sick of being called crazy here is a video I have stumbled upon he doesn&#39;t know the answers but I do and I&#39;ll prove it. Follow the knowledge I am dropping here and you will likely enter the kingdom as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/sSRPP-bZ8vQ?t=26m30s">https://youtu.be/sSRPP-bZ8vQ?t=26m30s</a></p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: WATCH THE VIDEO OR ELSE YOU WILL HAVE 0 IDEA WHAT I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT. THE GUY IN THE VIDEO DOESN&#39;T KNOW THE ANSWERS BUT I DO. GOD BLESS YOU ALL READ IT BEFORE YOU SAY ITS BULLOCKS, EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS BULLOCKS AND HOPEFULLY BY READING THIS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND IT TOO.</p>

<p>I had gnosis</p>

<p>At 32:30 he begins talking about the questions to get there.</p>

<p>Here are all the answers, you have to think and follow them and you will remember too.</p>

<p>What we are - We are perfect souls put into the most stressful world we could possibly construct while we are left with holes in our thoughts we can&#39;t even perceive are there.</p>

<p>What we have become - We have all become sinners who merely want to satisfy electric circuits in our minds that make us happy. It is just a computer simulation guys no need to eat that ice cream and jerk off every day. Tubby. Most of you are ass holes sorry for making you realize it. If you want back into the kingdom of heaven being an ass hole only brings you bad karma.</p>

<p>Where we were from - were spirits before we entered the body and we are the size of an atom, we will live many many more times so stop fearing death. I don&#39;t want to come back here though this place is hell. </p>

<p>Whither we were thrown - into a computer simulation to learn something. </p>

<p>What we were - all knowing spirits who are here to learn the finer mechanism of life maybe like understanding how life is with an ego, if we have to deal with other beings who have an ego and our natural form does not have an ego we have been given an ego to learn what it is like.</p>

<p>Whither we are hastening is exactly what I figured out.</p>

<p>We are redeemed by spreading the good word and not having negative karma. At least that&#39;s what I believe. Now listen to what </p>

<p>What birth is, we entered a body and possibly entered a white light to get here. </p>

<p>What rebirth is, entering the white light again and not being the white light yourself. Unless you embrace what I am saying here I&#39;m sorry to say you&#39;ll have to replay the whole mission again.</p>

<p>I say I literally hold the keys I&#39;ve been called crazy all day so if that&#39;s all you&#39;re here to do I&#39;ll just tell you now to fuck off because the grace of God has given me the chance to not give a fuck what you think. I love Jesus but you guys don&#39;t understand his message right. Here are the answers. You&#39;re fucking welcome. </p>

<p>Listen to him. I know the keys trust me I do. I had gnosis, you can think with your head but I really really know. There is nothing anyone could ever say to make me change opinions because I have been fooled by my mind in the past. I had gnosis and there is nothing that can change it so anyone who wishes to listen I am quite literally a modern day prophet wiling to share the knowledge. I am assuming shills or retards will be here derailing so I won&#39;t even reply them. I also believe we live in a concave earth and that we all live within God. God is the polarity of the world, hot - cold, nice - mean, evil - good. Gnosis - Retarded. Nothing is purely evil and nothing is purely good. Nothing is purely nice and nothing is purely mean. Gnosis is pure knowing and being retarded is abundant so you have to ignore what the gov says, ignore what your best friend says, ignore what your beloved mommy and daddy say, ignore what the preacher down the road says. I am here to say fuck the churches fuck the gov and fuck your brainwashed parents. I have the keys and they&#39;re right here right now. I am now and I am here. You&#39;re welcome. Once again if you are going to dispute everything I have to say FUCK OFF. If you have questions be my guest I can answer anything but before I do you must understand we live within an illusion. The constructed reality us humans have made is the opposite of what gnosis teaches. By having gnosis you realize everything in life is a lie even the truths you used to think were so profound.</p>

<p>So this is basically everything I could think of. Be a good soul the universe is governed by the natural laws. Everything vibrates, God vibrates the fastest and most positive and is all knowing. I was such a positive soul through my life nothing ever beat me down and this is the knowledge I have been gifted in relation to my being. I used to think I was nothing special but judging how very few people understand the workings of the world like I do I am really beginning to think I am going to make a massive impact here one day. Especially the day when the economy collapses and people are in turmoil. I will introduce all to the kingdom of heaven and it is quite literally that easy to get in. When you have all the answers to any question people will listen eventually. You guys just do not like the answers I give because I view the world completely inverted to the way you perceive it. It is the devils job to keep you out of heaven remember. The world is the ultimate paradox. All the love to you all from the bottom of my heart, I really do want all of you to get out it&#39;s just so frustrating talking to a hundred walls day in and day out. </p>

<p>I do talk to people who understand the kingdom of heaven and we all know we&#39;re just one big family of love. It&#39;s all you people who haven&#39;t found the kingdom I&#39;m really trying to help. I am not kidding these are the keys now use your head and see if it stands up but really think. </p>

<p><a href="https://gittefalkenberg.wordpress.com/2010/02/28/the-7-natural-laws-of-the-universe/">https://gittefalkenberg.wordpress.com/2010/02/28/the-7-natural-laws-of-the-universe/</a></p>

<p>Those are the only 7 laws to the universe.</p>

<p>Edit: If you think with the body, which is part of the world, you get worldly answers. If you follow wherever your soul pulls you you will enter the kingdom. Real is subjective you guys really believe a computer simulation and give no other thought to anything else? They&#39;ve fooled you all that hard? I&#39;ve always figured there was something super natural about the world. This is it and it&#39;s that our spirits know but until you disconnect the spirit from the world you can never understand. Modern day prophet doesn&#39;t bother me what anyone says because I know there is going to be someone here at least one person who can enter the kingdom off of this information, or get closer to entering the kingdom and that alone makes me happy enough to ignore all the haters :) Haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate. Fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake. I&#39;m just gonna shake shake shake shake shake shake it off shake it off. Kingdom of heaven is heavenly because you will never give a fuck again.</p>

<p>Edit: a man in the video says &quot;Nick Bostrom PHD, says he studied whether we live in a computer simulation, it is impossible that it is impossible, it is unlikely that it is unlikely, it is very likely we live in a simulation, it is created in another physical place that is not ours&quot; </p>

<p>Ignore me and mr PHD whatever I literally hold the keys you guys are just skeptical idiots until you understand this.</p>

<p>Nick also says if we live in a simulation it&#39;s likely we all live within smaller simulations of the true simulation. You are all stuck in the smaller simulation I&#39;m sorry to say. The way they keep you out is this belief in sanity. You can come back to it whenever you want but it&#39;s not sanity it&#39;s just perceived sanity by the masses. That&#39;s what the powers that be know, they are all insane which is why they are the way they are. Gotta follow the light and go off the edge, once you do you are the light. You get all the keys, the keys to happiness, longevity, your place in the world and your mission. Sadly my mission is to show people the kingdom of heaven and no one wishes to enter it. You must have a soul to get in, maybe you guys don&#39;t have one anymore in control of the body.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opc21Isx0g4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opc21Isx0g4</a></p>

<p>Watch this, I have studied every angle and this is my conclusion. The conclusion is there are flaws in every single piece of logic to the point where we live in a simulation. </p>

<p>EDIT: This is the edit to end it all. Over the course of these days the craziest thing happened to me. The mandela effect is real. There are others like me out there who already live in heaven like I do. What you guys fail to do is see through the mandela effect to understand how subjective reality really is. If anyone else is sorta getting what I am saying follow the last video I put here, then follow related videos to learn about what is apparently going on. If you can listen to a few videos and use your own knowledge that we live within a simulation there is only one answer that will be drawn. I love you all and in those videos was a hint where to find others who understand the same information. I followed it and it just so happened they have left a little trail of where to go. I am going to follow this information because it&#39;s so clear that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. The trick is that we all live within subjective realities being manipulated straight from the top. The reason why heaven is cut off is because unless your mind remembers it for itself you won&#39;t get back because the manipulation is too strong. I think this is heaven everyone and they are changing reality to make it best for our evolution of consciousness. I love you all. Search the mandela effect and read what people have said who have no proof. If you follow some theories of what&#39;s going on it&#39;s really clear reality is being manipulated dramatically. The masses are ignorant because the mandela effect constantly warps their opinions to fit a narrative. Use the mandela effect to your advantage and party til you die mother fuckers.</p>

<p>I am telling you to follow the videos because there is a road out over there to like minded individuals. Yes you heard me right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t get how subjective reality is. Since 99% of people are locked into the same reality and it&#39;s being programmed from all angles you can&#39;t see there is another one existing. That&#39;s the power of the kingdom of heaven. People will be locked out of the kingdom that&#39;s what the bible says. It seems most of you are going to be locked out because I know at least 50% of what I am saying is needed to enter the kingdom. You can drop a lot of it because like I said reality is subjective but the key is to destroy your mind and turn it into what it is meant for. It is meant to take tasks at any given moment and figure them out, it is not meant to figure out paradigms of the world. That is for our spirit and gnosis. If you have gnosis you will get what I am talking about it is eternal bliss until the day I die. </p>

<p>Even off drugs I think reality is subjective as fuck. I also haven&#39;t even done any much only MJ every day for years but MJ is how you evolve the spirit here. Smoke a little every day for a month and see what revelations you can get. MJ Leads you into knowing you divine you truly are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re being serious or not. Either way it doesn&#39;t bother me half of what I am saying is definitely untrue to the people who perceive reality the other way. There are many ways to getting into the kingdom of heaven but I can only describe my own personal trip. My trip is very unique because I found it without knowing God even existed until the day I got there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see why you can&#39;t enter you already have all these preconceived ideas. Who&#39;s hating on pimps? I think every sacred text is written by the true person. Maybe Christ has a different name but rest assured he&#39;s coming back. And he&#39;s not coming in peace either. You don&#39;t get that reality is subjective. I already thought about things like, how did I get here? Where was I before? You obviously haven&#39;t followed those thoughts. I thought about the way we all are as children and how happy we all were, what happened over the years. It&#39;s that the reality we live in is simulation. We were in a reality free from all of this and we were eternally happy because of it. You got here and embraced it never remembering where you came from, that&#39;s the difference, I never forgot. </p>

<p>Here is a compilation of videos and a comment to show you, or attempt to show you exactly what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Just like you sticking by your main stream beliefs can make someone who went into the abyss look dumb. If I pull out information that is irrefutable you have no explanation.

    <div class="md"><p>Gnosis is achieved through the spirit by doing what I said. It&#39;s a combination of everything, high vibrational being, following truth and entertaining thoughts. I just heard a quote from inception. When you&#39;re in a dream you&#39;re just right in the middle of it right? Well how did you get here? How did you get to earth? In the movie they&#39;re in a dream but don&#39;t think of it as a dream, we are in a simulation. It&#39;s realizing the next place. The next place is divinity. The place where we are is hell, if you think though your soul will enter heaven before you die. You yourself are a divine soul. The knowledge on how to get here is a secret but I&#39;m literally spilling it all. Human origins is we are perfect souls and before we entered these shitty bodies we knew it. Where we are going is into the spirit world it&#39;s an entire new physical realm where heaven exists. </p>

<p>Follow divinity and think of what the world would be. If you were the absolute perfect soul and you were in charge how would you change the world and what would happen? As you go you realize you are left with some walls because you can&#39;t make it good enough based on our current paradox. That&#39;s part of it. It&#39;s realizing yourself they have perpetuated lies to make it seem like the best is not the best. You have to realize your thoughts of even the best world you can think of is nothing close to the real best world a divine soul could create. That&#39;s when you start to really peer through the holes and see the true divinity we all belong to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another way to think. If you are a perfect soul would you not be able to change the world drastically for the better? Why has no one stepped up and done it?</p>

<p>How many problems would be instantly resolved in the world? If you understand how much knowledge is suppressed by the government you soon realize that life would be very close to stress free. That&#39;s the power of thought and using those thoughts you can get closer to realizing we live in a constructed simulation. I am literally going to spread this knowledge everywhere because I want all of you to stop thinking you&#39;re human and start realizing you are divine souls with no ego. You think you are whoever you are, it&#39;s realizing that you are not who you think you are you are a spirit and you&#39;re really a multitude of different people. You are a perfect divine being in your natural form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It is not only acting like a perfect soul but searching within yourself to find your own flaws in logic to figure out what is preventing you from becoming perfect. Our belief system is what constructs how we act. To change how you act is to destroy your belief system. My belief system has been destroyed and from that I have come to these revelations. People do not see eye to eye because they don&#39;t realize how much their belief system dictates their life. To people who have hateful words I can smile and say have a nice day. That&#39;s the grace I was given. I am able to see not only flaws in my own logic but others logic. Once you peer into the shadows this hard it is hard to not act as divine as possible because you are aware of everything everyone believes around you. Straight off the bat whatever people think is shown because their words are constructed from their belief. If you destroy your belief you can come to revelations, it&#39;s hard to destroy your beliefs. I suggest you look into very hard truths like the flat earth, like how banks create money, like how politicians all lie, how NASA is scamming the whole country, how demons exist and what roles they could play in the world.</p>

<p>Those are very hard realizations, those realizations will give you the power to see your own divinity within. Once realizing everyone lives by a belief system rooted in a load of shit you can begin to act as you are meant to. As a divine being. It is just very hard at that point to not talk down to everyone because as I said you peer through the lies they believe in. When people talk down to you but every lie they believe is put into the very words they are using to talk down to you, it is very hard to take them seriously. Once you get to that point people can become frustrated because you no longer take them seriously. It&#39;s just sad because if you take the trip like I did and come to these revelations you will see how the bible and everything else fits in. Evil and good is subjective. Keep thinking and work against yourself. Cognitive dissonance is a thing that will make you feel very uncomfortable. It keeps people away, don&#39;t use it to keep yourself away. Embrace that and follow it. Once you beat the dissonance one time and see answers lie within your very being you can do the good work. The good work is destroying yourself. By destroying yourself and your ego you can learn the lies of the world and turn yourself into a divine being. You just must lose yourself. I am still my own individual being, I still like all the old things I like. The difference is I understand and I don&#39;t take myself so seriously. The beliefs you learn by doing this work is what you will live by after because you will understand our illusionary world and where to look to find answers. You will never look outside for answers ever again and for that reason the world will never be able to affect you again. You let the world affect you to reflect on the thoughts to learn more about the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did it all myself believe it or not. I grew up atheist and until 10 months ago did not even believe in God. After doing this work I have come to realize it&#39;s biblical end times. Demons are very real things, here is a picture of one and a description. I would say demons alter the collective mind of the people. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ancient-code.com/new-telescope-detects-invisible-intelligent-alien-entities-on-earth/">http://www.ancient-code.com/new-telescope-detects-invisible-intelligent-alien-entities-on-earth/</a></p>

<p>I believe after doing the work I did that they are very existent and they are the ones who made me believe the false beliefs I used to hold.</p>

<p>I would say I didn&#39;t go to a seminary school but I am self taught and knowledgeable enough to run my own school at this point. I believe God has given me all he has given me because in all honesty I was no different than anyone else. I started doing what others refer to as shadow work. I didn&#39;t research what I was doing. What led me to start this is I took magic mushrooms and dropped out of school. After I dropped out of school and took that little trip I had some revelations. One being that the world made absolutely no sense at all anymore. I started looking into conspiracies and started doing anything I could think of. I did shadow work on the fly, I didn&#39;t research how I just did it. I researched and entertained many thoughts. Eventually I grouped a bunch of these thoughts that were &quot;out there&quot; together and at that point I decided that putting those thoughts together made more sense than what school taught. I then decided school and the government is only a means to control people through a belief system.</p>

<p>After I had that revelation I went insane and did shadow work and research every day. I mean 12 hour days nonstop of learning. Over the course of 6 months of that I learned everything I could about the universe and lost a vast majority of my friends on purpose. I was going down this path and there was no stopping me and no going back. The more I kept going the more I realized humans are all deceived so I started distancing myself farther and farther. Over the course of months I drew as many conclusions as I could to describe the world. I am now at a point where when it becomes more obvious I will tell everyone what I believe. I don&#39;t care what people think already but I want events to start kicking into gear before I start proclaiming my &quot;crazy&quot; beliefs. I did the shadow work and if you do the shadow work you will start to peer through the shadows too. People&#39;s minds are like rocks with very rigid beliefs. Mine is the opposite mine has a base that is very firm and then it turns into a liquid that will morph any which way I choose. The truth is very simple and it can only be felt. Words can&#39;t describe it. The truth contradicts everything the world will ever teach you. That&#39;s what the shadow work teaches you. Anyone who talks down to me is living within the world of illusion so it doesn&#39;t bother me. For example this guys been commenting on my stuff nonstop making fun of me but I don&#39;t care. Anyone who see&#39;s it from the other side knows he&#39;s an idiot I can only try to point it out to people as good as possible. Once you get to the other side of reality you realize even though the masses believe it, they believe a delusion. Magic mushrooms don&#39;t make you hallucinate. I don&#39;t believe that. You are naturally hallucinating and magic mushrooms let you peer into the truth for a bit. You live in a dream. </p>

<p>Edit: Also thank you for the kind words my friend :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes per se it&#39;s transforming yourself by confronting negative aspects of yourself to learn what makes those aspects exist. I realized the material world made those aspects of me exist so at that point you start looking through the shadows. If you can find a profound truth like &quot;The world is invented, so my negative emotions and actions are invented&quot; then you can have some real moments of growing. Mushrooms and other drugs like ayahuascha let you confront those ideas in a more comfortable manner. I did all my shadow work with the help of a little herb, only did mushrooms one time on my adventure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evil is subjective truly. It sounds insane but it is true once you travel down the hole enough. You realize evils were done because you need evils to grow as a person. Demons are real but they do not force you to commit evil they only affirm the belief system that makes you do evil deeds. Demons have fooled people. People like Richard Dawkins are quite literally Satan spawns on earth whether they know it or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been working very hard. I know it&#39;s hard to understand. If there was a massive ceremony of people who all took drugs with me I would be able to explain it to them with the help of drugs to open their minds. Or I could give them the pieces of information to get there themselves. I wish to do that but I can&#39;t because it&#39;s illegal. So better yet I can only tell people what I know and how I learned it. People who have done similar experiences of any sort will know I got this information from the most high. If you listen to videos and hear people talk about Gnosis you will know that&#39;s exactly what I had. By thinking you can know, but gnosis is not thinking, it&#39;s really really knowing. What I do is know. I don&#39;t need to think, people don&#39;t realize how many holes sit in their brain they just fail to acknowledge. Your brain is a faulty device that can&#39;t pick up on it&#39;s flaws. Your soul has all the answers and once you get in touch with your soul it will spill onto your brain. Once it does it will destroy your logic.</p>

<p>When you have gnosis you know and there is nothing your brain can think that will stop what you know. Gnosis is achieved through shadow work I believe or it is given by the most high. I don&#39;t know if Gnosis is something I got by doing this work or if Gnosis was given to me and that&#39;s what forced me to do this work. Either way I am telling all this is the path to heaven. There are many false prophets who will come in Jesus&#39; way. I am not a false prophet I got this knowledge from the most high and reading the bible affirms what I am teaching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh thank you. Mainly this one was to get my idea&#39;s out to hear input from others. Judging by the insanity of my post you will see learning these things without following guidelines is different than reading it in books. Putting my thoughts out got me feedback to fill the holes I was missing. I have no questions but only answers. The information I was lacking was that satanism is the lord. I believed christ to be but there is no difference. Satanism is only taught to be bad because we believe what the world has taught us not what is true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest you read it all. This comes from the angle of light. I&#39;ll let you into the secret. Satanism is going to win but Satanism isn&#39;t evil and that&#39;s what you learn by perceiving the world. Our God is abusive and the way you win life is by being okay with everything that happens. I learned everything I did by living life and having gnosis. I&#39;ll teach people one day but it will most definitely be after the new world order begins. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Side note. All your knowledge stems from somewhere. Your goal is to have a very small bush grown with only the truth. The truth is simple and a very small bush. You guys have watered your bushes and given it steroids and now it&#39;s stemmed massive branches out of it. It&#39;s time to cut those branches and see what you&#39;re left with. Here&#39;s another video watch the start of it and really listen to what he says, it is true what he is saying. Jesus understood the laws that governed the universe and the universe was nothing but nice back to him because he was in the kingdom of heaven the whole time. I don&#39;t believe Jesus died at 33 he lived much longer. Listen to what this man says. Just like that girl in the video laughing I&#39;m sure many will laugh at me but the kingdom of heaven is simple and is very forgiving. The thing I want most is to wake up some souls from the conspiracy. The conspiracy is part of the paradox if you enter the kingdom all you have to do is sit there for eternal bliss. </p>

<p>Okay it&#39;s just the start of the video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSRPP-bZ8vQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSRPP-bZ8vQ</a></p>

<p>Listen to what the man says we live within a computer simulation guys wake the fuck up and realize the God you really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We live in an imperfect world I can only act as divinely as the world allows me. Many people on earth are divine you just have to claim your divinity. If you are a shitty individual like yourself it&#39;s standard for us divine beings to treat you terribly. Like I think you&#39;re a dumb ass, you&#39;re a loser, you&#39;re super ignorant and mainly you&#39;re an ass hole. Doesn&#39;t break my divinity to call you all those things because it is all the truth. Meanwhile anything you say about me is rooted in lies because your perception is stuck in hell mode. Anything outside of your view of the world you say is not right and faked and anything that backs up your view you hold as the truth even when it so blatantly obviously is a lie. Cognitive dissonance must hit you really hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference between me you and others is that I have done the shadow work and realized every way demons are currently manipulating the world. You likely do not even recognize their existence even though there are pictures all over. You listen to main stream science and give no thought to other forms of thinking other than. X cells are yellow so banana is yellow. Height times length times width = area. I don&#39;t give a shit about all that stuff it&#39;s so obvious I knew all of that bullshit before I could even talk any idiot could figure that out. But for some reason people think things like that are important and go over bullshit over and over.</p>

<p>I peer into reality and acknowledge new information. Like what do you think the entities are that are currently inhabiting the earth with us? hm? See how dumb you look when you travel down paths you have no idea about. Just like you sticking by your main stream beliefs can make someone who went into the abyss look dumb. If I pull out information that is irrefutable you have no explanation.</p>

I want to join the masons because there are almost 700 free lodges in ontario I could stay in. That means I could travel around freely and never have to worry about a place to stay. I would say that&#39;s a solid move but if anyone here would like to hate on me for it, doesn&#39;t bother me that&#39;s the power of the kingdom of heaven. Much love to you my friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, I agree with you 100%. I read all the comments. 100%. Well, let me say 98% just in case there are a few points I disagree with but can&#39;t remember right now. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been practicing what you are preaching for some time now and I&#39;m enjoying the results :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you have to listen to me now I got massively into something yesterday and I swear to God I am going down some path that I think is the key to altering all of this. Listen to this story ok. I am becoming massively into health related wild grown foods. Well the other day when I was first looking into it, I do not know anything about it okay. Nothing, I have never studied it before. When I was searching I was searching &quot;dandelion greens&quot; to check nutritional value. Suddenly I went to my history to search for something related to dandelion greens. When I loaded up my history and typed in &quot;dandelion&quot; I legitimately thought I had lost it. I saw the search &quot;Dandelion greens&quot; almost every day, but not every day it was 6/7 days a week sometimes 5/7 times a week I would search that word. &quot;Dandelion greens&quot; when I found that I seriously thought I was going insane and I kept looking at my history in disbelief. </p>

<p>Fast forward to the next day, all the history was gone. I don&#39;t know if that was a glitch of my computer or some part of the mandella effect. Now I am really beginning to think that we all live in timelines being created from somewhere else and I might be seeing the keys to breaking the entire thing down. Yesterday I watched a bunch of videos pertaining to the mandella effect and this man who is a &quot;whistleblower&quot; says to follow jeremy bernstein. As you know might know, Bernstein bears is something people of the mandella effect community are all over.</p>

<p>Disclaimer you must know I have never studied the mandella effect before and these are only things I have come to realize LAST NIGHT. </p>

<p>Now follow me here, I have probably just like you, that our minds are easy to manipulate. One of the keys to happiness as described in natural law is always comparing yourself to something you consider worse off than you are. We are manipulating our minds per se to achieve happiness.</p>

<p>I am believing the people who have found reality is completely manipulatable are part of the people who are seeing through this mandella effect. To us it seems like reality has been created to trick the people who still believe it or something. But after last night I think it&#39;s more. I think we live in a computer simulation and I think that the mandella effect has been used thousands of times on everyone in the world. I don&#39;t know what it all means but here&#39;s a theory I have.</p>

<p>I studied Jeremy Bernstein and hes a physicist. He says they were shooting atoms through holes in a piece of wood or something, and getting results of some sort. But they were not recording the results or looking closely they were only looking at the results. When they decided to look at what was happening to achieve those results, the results changed. </p>

<p>That means reality physically changes for people to achieve different results.</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s where it gets insane. We are special in some way and I believe that. The whistle blower says there was a &quot;neo&quot; who could alter the fabric and allow people to see through the veil. I think we might be some of the first to see through the veil and this is what they are doing to trick us or something. We have no way of knowing what alters the fabric BUT it might be us. It might be whatever we believe or something. It might be our actions but I see through the veil. Now I don&#39;t know anymore what to think and since I have realized heaven on earth is all about raising vibration, comparing yourself to lesser and claiming divinity, those are things that make the God of the earth like you. It might not be God liking you, what it might be is becoming God. We know that predictive programming works right? Take it a step farther now. We didn&#39;t predictive program events to come, no. What they did was create the event outright because everyone in theory is part of the collective consciousness. Since so many people watch these things and laugh at them they in a sense wish for them to happen. Since TV does that in mass maybe God answers and forces drastic things to happen because so many people wish for it.</p>

<p>Now it fits into something bigger. The majority of people might believe the experiment the physicist was doing was going to have X results. So what happens? God creates those results for the people. Then when the observer really starts watching, since it&#39;s the observer who is the only witness on such a small scale the Ether(God) acts differently according to the researchers will.</p>

<p>Now i am going crazy here because I am really starting to believe there is something really weird going on with humanity and I think since we are free souls we have access to something others don&#39;t. The theory of the mandella effect is that they can alter anything and make us believe it has always been that way.</p>

<p>The other day when the dandelion greens search thing came up there was no way I could have done that I was in disbelief, but I don&#39;t know if my brain lied or if technology lied now. If they have been sending me through loops of thought and then deleting my memory then that means I must be really close to something. I have to think, I am telling you without a doubt the ether in the air acts differently based on the observer. Einstein said it, this physicist Jeremy Bernstein says it. </p>

<p>We might be the ones who have really strong control of the ether because we are good souls, we just might not realize it yet. If that&#39;s the case we have to divide ourselves from humanity and get together and enjoy our literal God hood. </p>

<p>I have to figure out something I am so confused as to what&#39;s going on, but look at the world my friend it&#39;s so obviously end times anyway I don&#39;t think I have too much to lose searching for the answers. We might be the ones who can actually change something.</p>

<p>Reply to this and give me your 2 cents I am open to any idea but after last night and studying the mandella effect I am really beginning to believe it. If you want to see what I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSRPP-bZ8vQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSRPP-bZ8vQ</a></p>

<p>We most definitely live in a computer simulation, what if we can control the simulation within the simulation somehow. Some variable might change. When I searched dandelion green and saw that it was searched my body was shocked. And I almost felt like it could be deja vu. They might be deleting my memory every day and making me basically do the same thing every day. If that&#39;s the case then I&#39;ve moved onto something. I don&#39;t particularly know what I search on the internet TBH just more search for truth and after last night being led here has given me a really high hope it&#39;s along these lines.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwl3h8l4NPI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwl3h8l4NPI</a></p>

<p>Watch them all no joke. It&#39;ll take like 2 hours but if you have time I am not joking I really think I have found something here and only a few people will be able to understand it like I do.</p>

<p>I am saying reality has been manipulated around us and currently is. I am saying we might be some of the only ones who know this and can therefore stop it. The scientist in the last video says there was a man who was disrupting the veils. Another theory I heard was that since I can see through the veil and I am alive, when I die my mind will go into the collective consciousness and I will break the entire cycle. I am not going to kill myself obviously I want to live for this. But there is something here my friend please look with me you have to think very deeply. We live within a construct right? We live and we can see it bare. Just like in the matrix it&#39;s bare, they can load anything right? We can understand it when it&#39;s bare, now we need to think of the mechanics that work the matrix. We have to do something. Real is entirely subjective so throw that bullshit of real out of the window there is a law of the universe we don&#39;t know about that exists. Everyone on earth is learning right now. When you&#39;re in a dream suddenly you&#39;re in the dream right? Well maybe we have to relive the same day over and over and over again in hopes that we will do something different. Although I do remember my past and believe it I am willing to accept that it does not exist and I only perceive it&#39;s existence. Yep that&#39;s how far I&#39;ll go, and after yesterday and hearing all this I am really thinking it&#39;s resonating with me. I think the bible has been taught wrong for a reason and it might hold the key. It obviously has held the keys to getting in touch with God. Maybe there is more. Think with me my friend think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give me some time to work on seeing your perspective. Until then, calm down a bit and don&#39;t tell anyone anymore. I&#39;m not an agent but if you go too far out of your routine all of a sudden you will get their attention. Just chill you don&#39;t need to be the messiah. You gotta now work on figuring out how to be Neo at the end of the movie instead of the one that just took the red pill. Relax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I&#39;m going even more crazy please look at this.</p>

<p>Do you see that island? That&#39;s where flight </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370</a> </p>

<p>Look where malaysia air flight is. Do you want to know what&#39;s even crazier. Like listen to me no joke. It could be our mission to go there. I was watching a documentary awhile back and the prophets of the past said that the Gods or ancient people who have all the knowledge sit.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnac_stones">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnac_stones</a></p>

<p>The carnac stones also point there and they are said to be pointing to where the prophets went to meet the Gods or something along those lines. DO YOU SEE WHAT I AM SAYING? WE COULD LITERALLY SEE THROUGH THE WORLD BY THE GRACE OF GOD. Maybe at that place no one even believes exist, there is a higher civilization and these are the clues they have left us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gnosis is achieved through the spirit by doing what I said. It&#39;s a combination of everything, high vibrational being, following truth and entertaining thoughts. I just heard a quote from inception. When you&#39;re in a dream you&#39;re just right in the middle of it right? Well how did you get here? How did you get to earth? In the movie they&#39;re in a dream but don&#39;t think of it as a dream, we are in a simulation. It&#39;s realizing the next place. The next place is divinity. The place where we are is hell, if you think though your soul will enter heaven before you die. You yourself are a divine soul. The knowledge on how to get here is a secret but I&#39;m literally spilling it all. Human origins is we are perfect souls and before we entered these shitty bodies we knew it. Where we are going is into the spirit world it&#39;s an entire new physical realm where heaven exists. </p>

<p>Follow divinity and think of what the world would be. If you were the absolute perfect soul and you were in charge how would you change the world and what would happen? As you go you realize you are left with some walls because you can&#39;t make it good enough based on our current paradox. That&#39;s part of it. It&#39;s realizing yourself they have perpetuated lies to make it seem like the best is not the best. You have to realize your thoughts of even the best world you can think of is nothing close to the real best world a divine soul could create. That&#39;s when you start to really peer through the holes and see the true divinity we all belong to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re being serious or not. Either way it doesn&#39;t bother me half of what I am saying is definitely untrue to the people who perceive reality the other way. There are many ways to getting into the kingdom of heaven but I can only describe my own personal trip. My trip is very unique because I found it without knowing God even existed until the day I got there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read what I&#39;ve wrote in the mandela effect subreddit and others to read the shadow work I&#39;ve done. Correspond that to any occult knowledge written by anyone who goes down in history. I followed the same path. I am attempting to enlighten humanity and show them the path. Until you realize the existence of demons and how they influence your mind you&#39;ll never get it. You talk down to everyone you talk to, why? Because that&#39;s the demons talking, you are infested.</p>
