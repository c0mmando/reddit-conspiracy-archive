<p>A hilarious gamer posted this and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/53a8yv/proof_of_hillarys_speech_being_faked_with_a_green/">/u/shot-by-ford from /r/conspiracy picked it up.</a></p>

<p>This video had lots of technical glitches, not just one.  </p>

<p>Most alarming was the frame where she just disappeared.  But there were video problems across the board.  In the very end of the video, she&#39;s walking off the stage and down some stairs, I noticed several weird things.</p>

<p>1 ) There are 2 people holding signs saying &quot;LOVE TRUMPS HATE&quot; --&gt; um, that&#39;s totally saying &quot;love Trump&quot; in that message.  Mixed messages much?  Are you throwing the game to Trump, Hillary?  Maybe...because you&#39;re a CIA cgi program? or because you two are distant cousins?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love....
...Trump&#39;s Hate.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will learn to love his hate.  One way or another, you are going to embrace hatred with all your gusto and embrace Trump and all that hate that he stands for.  YOU Got it?  It was about Trump all along and his hatred.  </p>

<p>You either accept that they use &quot;twilight language&quot; (NLP) or you are an idiot at this point.  And you will never  again experience hah-penis in your whole life. (snort)</p>

<p>2 ) Hillary approaches these two very strange men, one young with red hair, one older one with dark glasses.  Maybe plainclothes SS.  They are wearing hats with a strange logo on it, one orane one red.  Someone holds up a cell to the one on the left.  They are whispering to the secret service, like weirdly, almost erotically neck to neck...the &#39;terminal group&#39; seems a lot like a weird pit of males wrapping around each other...it&#39;s ODD ya&#39;ll.  Monarch handler level odd.  Numinosity: Maxlevel.</p>

<p>3 ) As she&#39;s going down the stairs, the video shifts weirdly in hue and tone, suddenly it&#39;s just a weird blend of people-like figures and forms as Hillary splits into 3 different people going three differnet ways.  Oh yes.  Her sweater forks into 3 different people wearing her same sweater...one goes away from camera behind her, one is her continuing, and the third forks off and goes in front of her.  Then it morphs into people in the background and then &#39;becomes clear again&#39; as Clinton approaches the &#39;terminal crowd&#39;  This is some google <strong><em>AI deepdream level stuff, where the video has recursively replaced her sweater onto other people moving around</em></strong>.  Only deepdream would do something like this (apply elements of pattern onto another moving shape that &#39;looks ike person&#39;)--very telling of it&#39;s use here.  Unless that has been somehow incorporated into modern videocameras (it HASN!T)....</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my observations, or skipping over them.  Don&#39;t matter.  Sorry I put these into different links but imgur was aggresively fighting me to put these on there.  It was only saving 2 at a time, then 1, giving me upload failures (there&#39;s nothing wrong with my isp, this is some MTM thing, because imgur.com was failing to upload after time giving a white screen.  suggesting I had an aggressive intermediary that was screwing with my upload)</p>

<p>I thought the same thing when I saw her missing in the one frame, chromakey compositing, but it really seems to just be the same stream corruption that was evident throughout the video. What&#39;s happening is the top ~1/16 of the frame is being repeated down for the rest of the frame, as in your first pic. In the frame where she &quot;disappears,&quot; the same thing is happening, but since it happens closer to the top of the frame, where the only content is vertical stripes, it appears that you&#39;re just seeing the background. You&#39;ll notice in the frame with the missing Hillary, the stripes are perfectly vertical, whereas in the other frames, the are slightly diagonal. You can also see the vertical repeating on the right edge of the third white stripe from the left.</p>

<p>The guys with the hats might need to be looked into a little further. What&#39;s that logo? I&#39;ve never seen it before. </p>

<p>The one picture with her skin tone looking weird is just her behind the teleprompter screen. </p>

<p>The &quot;splitting&quot; into three people is likely just corruption of the stream as well. Most compression algorithms use keyframes, where the image is fully represented, and interpolate the frames between these using a smaller amount of data that only records what changes have been made between the key frames. When the stream becomes corrupted, it can produce &quot;ghost&quot; images like this, depending on how the algorithm is set to handle error correction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What puzzles me is that those glitches just affect one layer. If these are distorted video signals, why isn´t the flag background also distorted ? 
On some shots the effect can be seen over the whole picture. These look like real glitches to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s how digital video compression works. Stationary or repeating parts of frames are not stored for each frame, only things that have changed. So if there is an error in the video stream, things which haven&#39;t changed since before the error won&#39;t be affected.</p>

<p>This entire Hilary glitches theory is based around that. The video feed was interrupted, or lost connection for a moment, or whatever, and what you see is the compression algorithm trying to account for that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason the background shows up and the podium vanishes is that it is repeating the frame vertically, but out of sync. The flag red and white bars cover the whole top of the frame so when it glitches it overwrites Hillary.</p>

<p>Not a hologram in my opinion but this wasn&#39;t the first time I suspected green screen. And there is something weird going on with the mismatched cellphone video.</p>
