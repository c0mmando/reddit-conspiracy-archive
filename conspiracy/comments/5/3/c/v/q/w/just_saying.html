        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I work in Midtown Manhattan. Last week, the Fire Marshal came to our building to conduct a &quot;Non-Fire&quot; Emergency Plan. We were told what to do in the event of situations such as an active shooter and bio-terrorism, as well as hurricanes and earthquakes. (But the emphasis was on the former ones). </p>

<p>I have worked in the city for almost 20 years, and this was a new experience for me. I have heard of people having emergency drills like this, but something about it felt so sudden and urgent. It was kind of comical because the guy was giving us specific instructions on how to fight off an active shooter. He told us to &quot;use our talents to work together&quot; and ward off the attacker. He said &quot;if it was me, since I have experience as a firefighter, I&#39;d probably grab an extinguisher from the wall and blast him in the face.&quot; </p>

<p>Then, the same week, there is a guy attacking people with a meat cleaver down the block from where I work (1). They shut down the entire area with SWAT, helicopters, etc... I thought it was kind of over the top. Yes- a psycho with a meat cleaver is a big deal, but the guy was already detained for a couple of hours. This is NYC, and this isn&#39;t the first time something like that has happened.</p>

<p>Then there were the bombs. And how Clinton &amp; Trump both referred to it as a bomb before that info was confirmed (2).</p>

<p>And they were pressure cookers (3).</p>

<p>I know I am probably just going down the rabbit-hole, but this is the only place I felt I could share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That kind of thing happens at many workplaces. It has happened at mine but I doubt we would be the victim of any stupid staged event or actual terror attack (knock on wood).</p>

<p>But, the timing is interesting. Wasn&#39;t there Nat&#39;l Guard training going on nearby as well? Thanks for sharing.</p>
