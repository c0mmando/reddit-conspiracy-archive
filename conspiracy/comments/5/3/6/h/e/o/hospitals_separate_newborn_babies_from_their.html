       When a baby is born they're suddenly thrust into a confusing, new environment.  If the baby isn't immediately comforted by the mother, in her arms, the baby will have their brains wired with fear and trust issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       By fucking with our brains as newborns, the elite wire our brains to be more easily controlled as adults.  We're immediately distrustful, fearful, paranoid.  'where am i?  where is my mother?  I don't recognize her sounds or smells.  where did she go?  she abandoned me!'
      </p>
      <p>
       Having a newborn baby in those clear baby cradles is horrible for a baby.  Isolating them in a glass case.  Babies need to be touched, held, comforted almost constantly after birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       *****  Sure, yes, in cases of premature babies, especially extremely underweight prematures, they need special attention and perhaps the risk of catching an illness requires them to be placed in those glass cradles.  But normal healthy babies should NOT be routinely, standard procedure isolated for hours and hours.  Yes moms need to rest.  ideally the father is there to hold the baby while mommy sleeps.  or another relative.  or a friend.  SOMEBODY.  jesus christ, tons of jobless people.  surely they can pay someone minimum wage to hold babies, assuming they passed a background check...

       Do you have a baby? Bc this isn't true.  Many hospitals encourage immediate skin to skin contact and keeping the baby in your room versus in the nursery.

       Actually it depends on your hospital. Unfortunately when I had my baby they took him and didn't return him for what felt like an eternity but was more like an hour and a half. It's a bit hazy after all this time, but yes, many hospitals still do this and it is traumatic for both mother and child. If you're going to have a baby choose your hospital carefully. Wish I had known to check into their after birth procedures back then but I was young and new to this country.

       You might be interested in the works of author Dr. Clancy D McKenzie.  tl;dr: He found that mental illness often was rooted in PTSD from being separated from their mother at baby-toddler age, even in ordinary circumstances e.g., the mother simply went to work, or had another child so she was paying less attention to the first one.

       Fear of abandonment is the most primal and visceral fear to humanity.

       The brief separation you speak of is minuscule in terms of trauma compared to the satanic branding that is circumcision.

       Agreed. Circumcision is completely unnecessary. It is probably only done to provide foreskin for

       He means that many of us (I am one of the poor individuals) have been mutilated shortly after birth.  Some say that this may represent a mark of the beast of sorts, of course after the satanic inversion principle is applied to the bullshit religious story which claims a covenant with a holy God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did that "Holy God" create us with flesh that is intended to be cut off (also providing a multitude of benefits, proved sexual/physical benefits, and heretofore unproved but sensible emotional and spiritual benefits (and a lack of emotional and spiritual deficit)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it's even zanier if one isn't religious.  Science claims to believe in Evolution as the Gospel.  After hundreds of thousands of years of evolution we are going to defy what nature has "evolved" us with, and mutilate a large chunk of a population out of fear that something will go wrong (very tiny percent)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there's a cost benefit analysis.  If non-circumsized individuals came down with an infected foreskin +10% of the time,
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       it'd be worth thinking about more.

       I've always had the impression that the worst generations were those closest to the industrial / scientific revolutions. It's like they got a hold of a
       <em>
        little

       scientific information, and suddenly thought of themselves as being separate and "above" our traditional human nature. They became cold and sterile, and carried into power political movements which were compatible with their new "scientistic" personalities - namely, communism and fascism.

       Science didn't betray us, and industry didn't betray us. What doomed the world and finally lead us to an evolutionary roadblock we can't get out of, is we built our modern society where ultimately only people who were  psychopathic personalities could ultimately prevail. Only they would have the cold hearted self interest necessary to rise to the pinnacles of power in politics and business, able to crush those around them without an inch of empathy. now that unregulated capitalism has led to giant monopolies that are run by psychopaths with enough money to buy anything they want including the entire government, we are left, us sane masses, wondering why our leaders are doing nothing to try to stop the all to obvious disasters approaching. Simple, They are incapable of caring about anything but themselves. They want all the money and power, and they'd like a lot less populated earth. Welcome to the insane asylum, The most deranged inmates are in control.

       I pretty much agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to add a little more to the picture. In very "traditional" societies, the kind of society in which mankind lived for tens of thousands of years, it was a lot easier to spot and weed out psychopaths. Tribes were small, and people worked and played together. Everyone was known more intimately. There weren't the social structures which supported the level of anonymity which people have today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I think that many people who would otherwise be sane and healthy are squeezed into a mold which is psychopathic. There are some pretty good people in positions of authority, in business, academia, and even government, but at some point, their goodness cannot prevail, because of the demands placed upon them due to their role.

       Essentially, yes, but I'm not convinced that it was a conscious decision. If there was a deliberate plan to disengage babies from their parents in order to increase malleability and outside dependence, I haven't seen the evidence yet. The practice began when people started to think and behave that way - during the era when people's primary devotion was being diverted from God and family, towards the nation/state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. But as of now, you have only put forth a hypothesis. It has yet to become a proven theory.

       baby taken away from birth mother.  unfamiliar person holds the baby, if they're lucky.  their world gets turned upside down several times over the months before they're placed with a family.

       how does this affect them later?  any change to their life becomes life or death stress, fight or flight.  panic.

       I've thought that cesarean births might also be detrimental. There seems to be a lot of them that are unnecessary either for the convenience of the mother or the doctor. But if babies have been being born forever through the birth canal, the cranium of the infant may NEED to be squeezed through. I've never seen anything on this, if anyone has, please comment. I have heard that now the medical field has recognized the importance of smearing C section infants with vaginal canal fluids in their eyes and mouths for the immunity building properties of them that would have been naturally passed on otherwise. Which leads me to breastfeeding. I know it's well established the importance of breastfeeding for infant immunity, but a generation ago lots of women went right to formula, breastfeeding was almost abnormal. I hope it's better today, because for a while in the past it seems to me baby formula producers were misinforming  women through paid off doctors and the AMA taking money. I have no proof of this, if anyone does please post, but it seems to me they should have known and probably did know the importance of breastmilk to the immune systems of infants. They should have vigorously stressed it. I hope they are now, cause I don't know what they do now.
 You may have heard what the baby formula companies did in poor countries, if not, it is disgusting. They would send in teams of people to villages dressed as nurses and doctors, convince women that baby formula was much better for their babies, after all, the pitch would go, look how big and strong and smart American babies are? Don't you want that for your baby? They would masquerade as health professionals to push their product and mislead these third world families. This caused two things to happen. The mothers would soon dry up, so breastfeeding was no longer an option, and it was much more expensive, so it drained the families already meager finances, making it much harder to feed the infant and any other family members. All so those greedy pieces of shit could greatly expand their customer base.

       having actually had a baby doctors give epiderals which stop you from naturally pushing and then a function that should be vertical they slap you horizontal and they make way more money with the c-section than you just having your baby....ir doesnt hurt THAT much everyone of our ancestors went thru it but for some reason we do not want to feel LIFE at all anymore so we numb ourselves out mho

       Right? Now, I'm not going to deny a woman an epidural, but you've been there, and if you're telling me it's impeding natural childbirth for healthy women, sister I believe you. It just makes sense that women gave birth squatting and not laying. The vaginal canal is tough enough with gravity on your side. Let me ask you this, do you think squatting and holding on to something would have been better? Because laying down to give birth just looks wrong. Thanks.

       actually its ALL ABOUT THE GRAVITY and deep visualization of your baby moving [sorry this is how it goes] down the passage out ....and when you are vertical you actually do push from the right place and not your neck! [20+ years  of dance and i was still pushing from the neck at first]  ...squatting is great it works... standing and holding onto your partner  that works too [my godchild birthed that way] for me .. i asked for the birthing bar which holds you vertical and when i rested my head on the bar i stopped pushing from the neck ....

       truth is the body knows exactly what to do but all doctors think they know better than nature and the natural order they keep trying to depletely uranium out on our behalf.

       Thank you for your input, I Damn sure don't know, I can only surmise. But a lot of stuff seemed wrong about modern childbirth. I would also like you to know the depleted uranium phrase you used is acknowledged. Obviously you know depleted uranium is used in modern ammo, 20mms and 120mm for sure, but I would bet almost all ammo, for it's ability to melt and burn through steel. Problem is, it's radiated. Our soldiers handle it and are in close proximity to it constantly. Radiation poisoning, could this be the culprit in gulf war syndrome? Ptsd? Just the overall sickness of soldiers returning from deserts where we have spewed this radioactive crap? The list of things that has been done in the name of the American people that we never wanted is horrendous, and this may be the worst of all. We poisoned an entire sub continent with radioactive material.

       The dolphins left a note on the way out, "so long, and thanks for all the fish" that's probably what happened to all the fish. Yeah, the gulf oil disaster was bad, not looking good on a lot of fronts.

       well it kinda goes like this there is always a misread when pisces is sad everyone else thinks they are being the life of the party and when pisces is happy folks be why so glum sugahplum....pisces are always half in this world and half in the spiritual realm they rule the scales [music] and are the spiritual dreamers of the zodiiac ruled by neptune
      </p>
      <p>
       so yes this "Time same the at always directions both in swim fish those moon Pisces. "
is exactly correct  its like the eyes seeing upside down but the brain turns it rightsideup [headstands a whole other story]

       I am so upset after reading this. I was 19 when I had my son and the doctors bullied me into an induced labour and an epidural (which I refused for 10 hours before I gave in) even though I wanted a natural birth. After all this I had to get an emergency c-section because I couldn't push.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it was just exhaustion from being in labour for almost 24 hours but it turns out it was because of all those drugs I didn't want. I feel extremely angry and violated right now but I'm glad that I know in case I ever have another kid.
