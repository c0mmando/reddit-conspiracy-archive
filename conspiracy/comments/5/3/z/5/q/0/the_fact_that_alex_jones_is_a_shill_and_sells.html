       This is scary.

      <p>
       He knows that the people buying his products are a bit more awake and him being a shill makes them a great target to poison.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would never, EVER ingest ANYTHING coming from the InfoWars camp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as your water is fluorinated, you can no doubt expect his products be tainted to emasculate you in some way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should be rule of thumb to not ingest any products from any "news source". In InfoWars case, it could be dangerous.

       Think you're really pushing hard on the Alex Jones rhetoric. I don't like the dude but I just don't listen or watch him. I don't pay attention to what he has to say because it's 99% fear mongering.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've posted quite a bit about him though, for what purpose? What was the purpose of posting the "Alex Jones flooding YouTube to censor his own stuff" thread? And you never answered my questions there about how you know that was Alex posting all of those playlists. For all we know, YOU did it.

       Just don't watch or listen to the dude. Why do you think he's able to push an agenda and sell as much as he does? Because he has viewership. Take that away and he's just a dude yelling into a microphone for fuck all to hear.

       On the other hand he needs financial independence to do the things he does, other dissidents in other countries work similarly... with youtube cutting revenues for dissidents or about to, it's becoming even more important to sell real tangible goods. That is not to say he isn't selling shit, that would be worth looking into, but the "he is in it for the money" argument is bogus, playing the game pays far more than fighting it.

       I was sad when he started pushing that shit. I liked listening to his show. He even dedicated an entire episode to shill for that shit. They like to state that all illnesses are caused by vitamin/mineral deficiency. Come on now ... It's not hard to lose weight and be healthy without buying overpriced shit, Clyde. Hell, if you believe that shit actually works, you can look up the ingredients and buy yourself supplements and save yourself a lot of money. But no ... "you won't absorb it properly!!!" "BUY OUR SHIT!!!".

       I'm sure that Clyde has his health issues, and there's a possibility that these supplements helped him. But the whole thing just reeks of infomercial-level bullshit

       I like some of the stuff Alex has covered and I wander over to his channel every now and then but when I saw him using conspiracys to sell products at the end of his video I lost my last bit of faith in the man who Is worth 4 million.

       I support Alex Jones.  This is just more of the discrediting BS that he has been subject to his whole career.  He has done more for the truth movement than anyone else and woken up more people than anyone else.  After all these years he's proved to me he is his own man and I'll trust him unless proven otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side, wouldn't your time be better spent attacking the people that are proven to be the real problem, rather than an independent truth media icon with unfounded claims?

       I don't necessarily support Alex Jones, though in the name of 'free speech', his voice is no less important than any other in alternative media.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was one of the key influences that helped me wake up. I moved on from there and dug a lot deeper. In retrospect, he does engage in a lot of fearmongering...but whatever you think of him, he is a great 'entry level' info source for people who are beginning to question the official narratives of the mainstream media. Just because one might have 'outgrown' his rhetoric does not make his voice irrelevant....just personally irrelevant.

       Alex is getting some crazy flak lately so he must be doing something right.   Anyone who shows us a video of our cabal masters in Bohemian Grove sacrificing children to their evil god gets a pass in my book.  He has his reasons for doing what he is doing.  When the smoke clears,  he will be fighting for the people as he always was.

       WRONG.

      <p>
       He filmed the ceremony at the bohemian Grove at the request of his masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw nothing sinister except a mock sacrifice.

       This was by design to:

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gain trust in Alex Jones.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Think they only do mock sacrifice at the Grove.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Sorry, he is a shill. An obnoxious shill who nobody should give any credibility to.

       I would imagine if all of those leaders are at the grove, fat ass Alex Jones wouldn't be able to waltz in there that easily. The security has to be off the charts.

       I'm sure that Clyde has his health issues, and there's a possibility that these supplements helped him. But the whole thing just reeks of infomercial-level bullshit
