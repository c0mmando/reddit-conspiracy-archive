        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was at a mechanic yesterday and someone was going on with my friend about Black Lives Matter.  I said it was funded by George Soros, which I then had to explain was a rich guy; and that the Koch Brothers funded the Tea Party and that all of it was a means of social control and that our government allowed it otherwise these people would be in jail for conspiracy...which I explained was when you do stuff in secret to harm the public.  Anyone with computer and internet can fact check everything I just said.</p>

<p>They just kind of blink and then go back to the readymade narrative that FOX, CNN and others have made for them.  People literally don&#39;t know how to think.  </p>

<p>I got annoyed and doubled down on the confrontationalism becasue Mr. FoxProxy pissed me off.
I jumped back in and I said, &quot;it&#39;s called racebaiting.  Those people aren&#39;t real, they are employees being paid by someone on craigslist...online classifieds.  They pay people to go somewhere and act violent.  Nothing you think is real is real.&quot;</p>

<p>Then I walked out quickly before bubba gump got his overalls in a bind.  Not that he could do anything and if so, pretty sure I still remember karate, half his age and 3 times as fit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in NC where you encounter mostly shitapple rednecks, with a combined charisma and intelligence rating of zero, making them only the barbarian class.   </p>

<p>I have hope for the youngin&#39;s though.  They might be red but they aren&#39;t already dead. They&#39;ve already given up on news and they are into living.  They really don&#39;t care about all this stuff--they are checked out, but at least I&#39;ve run into a few that doubt 9/11, which gives me hope.</p>

<p>Anyone over 50 here in NC is worthless.  Worthless people.  I usually don&#39;t say such things out loud but I&#39;m going to now.  I&#39;m done with them.  A civil engineer who can&#39;t grok controlled demo job when all the signs are there.  It&#39;s proof the archons&#39; mindgate program is strong</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BLM appeals to both sides of the race issue. That makes it very difficult to shake someone out of their created world view.</p>

<p>Supporters of BLM see an overwhelming amount of evidence that the government systematically oppresses black people (which happens). They also see that black people are &quot;fighting back&quot; en masse.</p>

<p>Opponents of BLM want to see blacks as these ruffians continually breaking laws and attacking law enforcement while creating riots in otherwise peaceful cities. This reinforces their belief that BLM is a violent movement.</p>

<p>Neither side will admit/see that it&#39;s being fueled by money and agent provocateurs and designed to create division and hatred among races. It doesn&#39;t fit their personal narrative and that&#39;s going to end up shutting down any thoughts of bigger fish being involved in a nefarious manner.</p>

<p>No, opponents of BLM simply realize that it is fucking stupid to pin this on racism instead of just corruption/abuse of power, and also that while &quot;Black Lives Matters&quot; sounds good, the motives behind the &quot;Black Lives Matters&quot; movement are themselves racist and their demands are fucking ridiculous. </p>

<p>But thanks tho. I can always count on this sub for helping to further the retardation</p>

<p>So you think that every BLM protester out there is bought and paid for by Soros? All of them are not &quot;real&quot;? Just acting the part?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a foolish notion!
Even if the whole movement is financed and started by Soros the people out there doing stuff still believe in it and are doing it out of free will and not because someone paid them.</p>

<p>Not to mention that it is impossible to control a movement like BLM which has no centralized leadership from the top just by giving money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say what proportion are &#39;useful idiots&#39; and which are paid.  But we know that the &#39;paid provocateurs&#39; did in fact start the movement and that they&#39;ve led it.  Like I said though I have no idea what % are dumb college era kids with no grip on actual history and no willingness to defy their scripting</p>

<p>they steer and script the movement through provocateurs.  and it&#39;s not about being coordinated, it&#39;s in fact about being dyscoordinated and soaking up people&#39;s time and energy because then you will convert a bunch of well intentioned activists into lumpen losers who will never participate again because they know it doesn&#39;t accomplish anything.  That&#39;s what is meant by cultural stockholms syndrome</p>

<p>this isn&#39;t about achieving any goal except for telling a bunch of young activists that &#39;no lives matter&#39; implicitly, through their effectiveless participation</p>

It&#39;s an organic movement, and I strongly agree with its anticline brutality premise. You may disagree with some people doing certain actions, but who exactly are you accusing of being agent provocateurs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s difficult, I live in Colorado and my auntie I caretake here totally agrees. She was watching the NC &quot;protests&quot; on CNN and says &quot;It&#39;s not about color it&#39;s about class&quot; Of course we talked about it and she knew about the paid protesters too. She told me how my cousins were at the DNC protest and got rangled like cattle into a cage, not read their rights and denied a phone call until morning. Later they found out the &quot;rowdy&quot; ones from out of state were paid to be there who also happened to get off with no ticket while cousins had community service. Agent provocateurs I tell ya. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed you mentioned the younger generation is &quot;Red but not Dead&quot;. If I could throw in my 2 cents on it. I think a lot of it has to be with economic displacement. The older generation have jobs, and savings. They got in during the boomer years. The young generation has nothing but student debt an few good job prospects as everything was outsourced. Basically the young have no reason to defend this system. They have no skin in the game so to speak. It can burn for all they care. This is why they are more open minded. But also potentially easily manipulated by Marxist. It&#39;s a rebellion generation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this issue is so black and white. I see a claim by the Washington Times based on Soros&#39; tax returns that Open Society Institute (his foundation) gave some seed money to people connected with Black Lives Matter, but not that they continue to. I&#39;d like to see any evidence, if you say they continue to.</p>

<p>But regardless, the BLM movement is complicated. People are upset about a very real problem, that office waging war on their own citizens, especially in poor areas. Sure, you may disagree with certain tactics, or the racial emphasis in general, but look at their &quot;Campaign Zero&quot; web site; I think it&#39;s really on-point. What we really need to improve the inner cities is an end to the drug war. And, though I&#39;m not a Soros fan overall, he does financially support groups working to end the drug war, which I strongly support.</p>

<p>The world is a complicated place.</p>

However, you just insulted an entire generation of often poorly-educated people who had no choice but to be spoon fed whatever information was presented by either television news or the newspapers. Last time I checked, being fast asleep isn&#39;t a quality confined to any particular demographic either. Most people don&#39;t give a fuck about thinking critically and seeing past corruption or entertaining conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Can you grow your own food? Could you then can and preserve it? Do you know how to raise livestock? Fix your own car? Build your own house?

<p>Then how do you know what is real? If you really think those things are happening (Soros founding BLM, craigslist ads recruiting paid provocateurs to race bait, etc) then wouldn&#39;t that mean none of <em>that</em> is real?</p>

<p>Anyway, lets see some hard evidence that this Soros you speak of actually founded BLM. Not some article just saying he did. Real evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you are trying to do but in reality you&#39;ve proved OP right by being the exact type of head-in-the-sand person he is complaining about.</p>

<p>You are mocking him for being informed about the complete corruption of modern society and being disgusted that the average person does not even have the intelligence to understand the corruption when it is spelled out in plain english. And you are mocking him by saying he is using his intelligence to show off. </p>

<p>I mean, do you understand the irony here? You also have no idea what OP is talking about and choose the dumb ape coping mechanism of mockery rather than using what little brain you have to lift yourself out of ignorance.</p>

<p>And your post has the most upvotes. </p>

<p>edit: Ok it was at 6 upvoted when I replied now at -1 so perhaps there is hope for us after all :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see both sides though.  I&#39;ve had my mind open for quite a while but you can&#39;t open someone up by laying on the heavy stuff.  I know enough to not lay out most things as &#39;facts&#39;.  It helps to plant seeds and open folks up to ideas but you can&#39;t just &#39;blow their minds open&#39; and expect that someone is going to have a complete world view change on a break at work.  Subtlety and nuance work. Believe me, I  understand the frustration of watching intelligent people believe the propaganda while the world continues to burn but I have found no formula that works on people.  I just take little openings to expand someone&#39;s awareness when they occur.</p>
