    <div class="md"><p>You know why the genealogy thing is so important right? They&#39;re not doing it as a kindness, they are in the habit of claiming/converting/canonizing people as Mormon posthumously- it&#39;s part of their belief to claim as many souls to Mormonism as they can.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s some tax/legal reason for it, the change is only with their records, nothing official - but there has to be some reason why besides just keeping score in some religious game of Pokemon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ex-mormon here.  As a kid we would do little field trips where each one of us was baptized 10-50 times in a row.  The adult would say a little prayer, read a random name from the database and baptize us, then repeat over and over.  I believe the thought behind it is that to be &quot;saved&quot; and make it into heaven, you have to be baptized Mormon style.  But some people die before they have the chance to be baptized or even hear about Jesus.  So us being baptized as a proxy is a little loophole that allows the already dead person chilling up in Mormon purgatory to be able to choose whether or not to accept the baptism as their own and proceed into heaven.  Mormons being genuinely concerned for everyone want to save everybody, or at least give them the chance to save themselves.  So it&#39;s a pretty big priority to research genealogy and make sure everyone that has ever lived gets a baptism.  That may not be the entire story.  I stopped advancing in the religion as a teenager.  I think guys learn some more secrets when they turn 18-19 and couples get even more secrets when they get married.</p>
