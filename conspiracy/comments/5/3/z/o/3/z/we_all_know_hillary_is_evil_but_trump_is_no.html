    <div class="md"><p>What flavor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism">inverted totalinarianism</a> would you like, sir?</p>

<p>We have &quot;Original Establishment&quot; and &quot;Aggressive Nationalist&quot;. Most people enjoy the establishment flavor because it&#39;s the safe bet... but recently we&#39;ve had a lot of people trying out the nationalist flavor to change things up a bit. Variety is the spice of like, ya know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can change if people get oganized. Honestly, all it would take is some well organized boycotts that people take seriously. We could change the world by carefully selecting what we do or don&#39;t spend our money on. If we drove a few major corporations into the ground for supporting certain foundations or for hiding money offshore, things would change quickly. If the feds aren&#39;t going to arrest the criminals, we hit them in the wallet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am standing behind principle on this one... she cheated us in the primary, <strong>blatantly</strong>, and now they&#39;re trying to brainwash us into hating Trump. they&#39;re pretending that it will be our fault if Trump wins, because we won&#39;t stand behind a crook. by discussing these issues with close friends and family you&#39;ll realize, as I have, these means of manipulation are actually quite effective. people don&#39;t have anything positive to say about the Shrill, other than the fact that Trump is a &quot;bad, scary man, and his <em>rhetoric</em> is dangerous&quot;. It&#39;s about time we take it to the streets to get our message out. the MSM is putting people in bubbles, and we need to pop the bubbles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump actually used to scare me. I couldn&#39;t believe that people would support him.. that was until I saw what Hillary is capable of. I will NEVER vote for her, and despite the fact that they try to isolate us and make us feel like we&#39;re on our own, I know there are TONS of people just like me. in the end, she has the election bought.. short of her death it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s anything that could stop her and her cronies. what we need is for people to start waking up. waking up to the fact that the government truly <em>doesn&#39;t</em> care about it&#39;s people, and that there are a few elites stuffing their pockets while the rest of us work our lives away in a perpetual cycle of debt. the world could live in harmony and peace <strong>so easily</strong>, we all need to put our ego and greed aside and embrace ourselves as members of the same race: humanity. </p>

<p>I do get it, but that&#39;s not the point. the point is we need change. standing idly by and preaching &quot;business as usual&quot; only feeds fuel to the fire. </p>

<p>Cameron,  Blair,  both had to sniff US ass to make any move at all.   You are repeating a myth.   As far as the ultra elite,  yes,  its global,  and yes,  there is a lot of money in London.

    <div class="md"><p>The attempt to try and equalize Trump and Clinton (to pretend that they&#39;re &quot;the same&quot;) is intellectually lazy.</p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<p>Hillary sold access to US intelligence to foreign dictatorships for kickbacks to her fake charity.</p>

<p>Trump? (Didn&#39;t.)</p>

<p>Hillary sold Russia 20% of the US&#39;s uranium stockpile for kickbacks to her fake charity.</p>

<p>Trump? (Didn&#39;t.)</p>

<p>Hillary assassinated Gaddafi, destabilized Libya, Egypt, Syria, and touched off the migrant crisis affecting Europe.</p>

<p>Trump? (Didn&#39;t.)</p>

<p>Hillary (as verified by the DNC email leaks) is working hand-in-glove with George Soros, who is at this very moment destabilizing the US with race riots (like the ones happening right now in Charlotte, North Carolina). Riots, where 71% of the agitators being arrested have out-of-state licenses because they&#39;re being bused in by Soros. </p>

<p>Trump? (Didn&#39;t.)</p>

<p>I could go on and on and on [and not even touch all the people being murdered by the Clintons this election cycle like Seth Rich and John Ashe] . . .</p>

<p>The other side?</p>

<p>Well, Trump called Rosie O&#39;Donnell fat on Twitter 8 years ago . . . er . .  uh . . . so he&#39;s just as bad as Hillary.</p>

<p>(I hope to God that the people on this thread can&#39;t really be that mentally retarded.)</p>
