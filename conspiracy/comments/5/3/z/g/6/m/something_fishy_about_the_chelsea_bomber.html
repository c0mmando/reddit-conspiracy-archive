       All the news outlets are reporting that investigators are not able to speak to Ahmed Khan because he's unconscious and intubated..
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take a look at his last photo, before getting to the hospital.

       Does it look like that man needs to be intubated ?

       This reminds me so much of Boston

       He was fine when he was on the stretcher.  I was wondering when he was going to be "intubated".  Like you said- I remember when they got in a "shootout" with Dzhokar Tsaernaev in the boat and John Miller (at that point a CBS journalist... Now the head of Counter-terrorism for the NYPD...) was dropping all sorts of disinformation
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They said something popped up out of the tear in the tarp and opened fire and they returned fire. The incident commander then called for a ceasefire so they could set up a perimeter.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well how did he open fire if he didn't have a gun?  there was no gun found in the boat.  of course the police and FBI PR knew this (and John Miller, even though a CBS correspondent at the time, was actually probably FBI counterintelligence PR).  So they lie.  Then dzhokar is seen bloodied up getting out of the boat, and all of a sudden he's in a stretcher with a slit throat so he can't speak until he's on enough tranquilizers to take down a charging hippo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also want to point out some key rhetoric i've been seeing a lot lately in "police shootouts".  When you hear about police getting shot in a shootout with a "badguy", it's almost always made VERY clear is the officer is actually SHOT by the "badguy".  But when they don't say that he was specifically shot by the badguy, it's usually because he was shot by other police and the media is trying to make it sound like that's not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       from the boston shootout-
      </p>
      <p>
       here's a cbs article about a cop shot in the waterton "shootout":
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/boston-cop-wounded-in-shootout-says-he-cheated-death/">
        http://www.cbsnews.com/news/boston-cop-wounded-in-shootout-says-he-cheated-death/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       nowhere in the article does it indicate that he was actually shot by other cops.  they make it seem like he was a hero shot by the badguy.  but then there's this nyt article much much later:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        More than a dozen officers suffered minor injuries during the mayhem, but none was believed to have been wounded by the suspects. The only serious wound was suffered by Richard Donohue, a transit cop with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, who was hit in the groin by a police bullet and began to bleed profusely.
       </p>

       Yeah, and at the same time the Brussels bombing and other terror-related 'evidence' was just destroyed in a fire bombing:

       They literally fucked up from the start though, they accidentally tweeted out the original footage that was used in their photoshopped footage to then claim they accidentally tweeted 'archive material' followed by the clearly photoshopped footage and I'm just like ????

       I was joking about the magnets. That's a plot point from Breaking Bad, where they also go in to destroy evidence. Well here they don't have any evidence to begin with, then they concoct this story about people (terrorists!) breaking in to destroy the evidence to explain why they don't have any evidence.

       edit: this is from the Brussels bombing hoax, not Chelsea mind you

       Makes you think when they then come out to say 'terrorists' would benefit from this when it's your own government
      </p>
      <p>
       There was another false flag recently where supposedly two agents got sliced up with a machete (story just stunk especially with how it quickly was framed) much more low profile though didn't go beyond our borders, it was used to target political parties and push policies, truly pathetic and shows how far my country has gone if this is the new standard
      </p>
      <p>
       Our biggest political party who I'm pretty sure orchestrated that latest false flag wants a patriot act like law but no other parties do so I'm already awaiting the next false flag to push this garbage through
      </p>
      <p>
       Belgium is a fucking mess and unless these false flags are exposed all our policies will stop being rooted in reality
