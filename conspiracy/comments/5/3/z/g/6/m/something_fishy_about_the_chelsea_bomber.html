<p>Does it look like that man needs to be intubated ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was fine when he was on the stretcher.  I was wondering when he was going to be &quot;intubated&quot;.  Like you said- I remember when they got in a &quot;shootout&quot; with Dzhokar Tsaernaev in the boat and John Miller (at that point a CBS journalist... Now the head of Counter-terrorism for the NYPD...) was dropping all sorts of disinformation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They said something popped up out of the tear in the tarp and opened fire and they returned fire. The incident commander then called for a ceasefire so they could set up a perimeter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well how did he open fire if he didn&#39;t have a gun?  there was no gun found in the boat.  of course the police and FBI PR knew this (and John Miller, even though a CBS correspondent at the time, was actually probably FBI counterintelligence PR).  So they lie.  Then dzhokar is seen bloodied up getting out of the boat, and all of a sudden he&#39;s in a stretcher with a slit throat so he can&#39;t speak until he&#39;s on enough tranquilizers to take down a charging hippo.</p>

<p>I also want to point out some key rhetoric i&#39;ve been seeing a lot lately in &quot;police shootouts&quot;.  When you hear about police getting shot in a shootout with a &quot;badguy&quot;, it&#39;s almost always made VERY clear is the officer is actually SHOT by the &quot;badguy&quot;.  But when they don&#39;t say that he was specifically shot by the badguy, it&#39;s usually because he was shot by other police and the media is trying to make it sound like that&#39;s not the case.</p>

<p>from the boston shootout-</p>

<p>here&#39;s a cbs article about a cop shot in the waterton &quot;shootout&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/boston-cop-wounded-in-shootout-says-he-cheated-death/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/boston-cop-wounded-in-shootout-says-he-cheated-death/</a></p>

<p>nowhere in the article does it indicate that he was actually shot by other cops.  they make it seem like he was a hero shot by the badguy.  but then there&#39;s this nyt article much much later:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than a dozen officers suffered minor injuries during the mayhem, but none was believed to have been wounded by the suspects. The only serious wound was suffered by Richard Donohue, a transit cop with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, who was hit in the groin by a police bullet and began to bleed profusely.</p>

<p>That would be some top level keks in regards to my government trying to cover this shit up</p>

<p>They literally fucked up from the start though, they accidentally tweeted out the original footage that was used in their photoshopped footage to then claim they accidentally tweeted &#39;archive material&#39; followed by the clearly photoshopped footage and I&#39;m just like ????</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was joking about the magnets. That&#39;s a plot point from Breaking Bad, where they also go in to destroy evidence. Well here they don&#39;t have any evidence to begin with, then they concoct this story about people (terrorists!) breaking in to destroy the evidence to explain why they don&#39;t have any evidence. </p>

<p>edit: this is from the Brussels bombing hoax, not Chelsea mind you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes you think when they then come out to say &#39;terrorists&#39; would benefit from this when it&#39;s your own government</p>

<p>There was another false flag recently where supposedly two agents got sliced up with a machete (story just stunk especially with how it quickly was framed) much more low profile though didn&#39;t go beyond our borders, it was used to target political parties and push policies, truly pathetic and shows how far my country has gone if this is the new standard</p>

<p>Our biggest political party who I&#39;m pretty sure orchestrated that latest false flag wants a patriot act like law but no other parties do so I&#39;m already awaiting the next false flag to push this garbage through</p>

<p>Belgium is a fucking mess and unless these false flags are exposed all our policies will stop being rooted in reality</p>
