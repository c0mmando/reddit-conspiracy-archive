       The pictures are a dead giveaway. So many pictures of that stupid trash can and none of any of the injured people receiving medical attention. I mean imagine the scene there would have been with paramedics and ambulances tending to 29 people with various traumatic injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some other ones have surfaced but they don't seem convincing to me. All we got was a trash can for over 2 days.

       Maybe it's because anytime anyone injured in an emergency such as this is that they're immediately decried as a crisis actor.

       Yeah I was telling someone else, of course bona fide emergency personnel are going to show up eventually in a huge metropolis like NYC especially. The question is what are they doing? Are they actually transporting the dead and injured to a hospital or are they, as you say, getting coffee because they're being held to a block away from the scene?
      </p>
      <p>
       At Sandy Hook they blocked the road leading to the school parking lot with a crowd of cars and later you had actual EMTs giving interviews saying they weren't let into the school or even near it and were pissed that they couldn't do their job.

       I agree. Somethings not right...
      </p>
      <p>
       TBH, the explosion didn't even look very big or devastating. Looked like a movie prop or something. If these are jihadis getting info from the ME, you should go check out some liveleak vids of real IED's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, 29 injured, but no pics or footage of them? How were none of them not seriously injured? A little firecracker can fuck your finger up if you hold it.

       I'm so happy I found this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Couldn't agree more, I was at a concert a few blocks away when the explosion supposedly went off. The act came on and said the after party may be cancelled bc a bomb just went off a few blocks away.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we leave, there was cops everywhere. We asked if we'd be allowed to take the train home to LI.
      </p>
      <p>
       They said, in between mouthfulls of potato chips, "yea , no reason you wouldn't be able to, you know what you're best off just going to the station and finding out".
      </p>
      <p>
       As we got to Madison Square Garden (Penn Station) it was an absolute ghost town. All roads shut down for miles. Tons of cop cars all over the place with no one in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were virtually no police at Penn Station. I saw maybe 3. Being someone from the area it is down right creepy for them to not at LEAST delay the trains! Especially after a "second device" was found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then hearing the story today, and seeing the pictures. I couldn't believe it. First thought was that if he can build that device he would have a disposable. Then I saw the pictures! Unbelievable. And all the other sketchy details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway my point is, the environment of the situation felt like a drill to me.

       So true. I love how they present it with such enthusiasm as if it were a sporting event. Each play (new evidence, new occurrence) is replayed from every angle and analyzed to death.

       All these failed bomb attemptsnin one day. As if the string of them will be more convincing to people, that terrorism is happening all around them.
...Well it is. The State terrorises all of us with their antics,

       Somebody in /News got over 650 upvotes for responding to the headline "Terrorists blow up bomb in NYC", with:
"No shit." -The sane people of the world
      </p>
      <p>
       I was blown away, that some shill would so very biasedly proclaim, that people who don't believe it was terrorism are insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe the official story (the obvious, face value version), then you're insane.
We live in a world where shills like that influence more people than all of our civilian journalism. Or maybe we just have to keep hitting them harder...
...after all, they wouldn't spend millions warring against our truth seeking, if we weren't on to something/getting somewhere.

       Funnily I remember thinking something similar last time there were some BLM shootings. That was (If I remember correctly) exactly when the Clinton Foundation scandal hit the surface. Pure coincidence.

       My parents live where they caught the guy. That whole street is closed off and theres a bunch of FBI investigating. I gave a call to Linden cheif of Police and asked about the investigation. I was told that they investigation would go on for 24-48 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       When i asked if the information would be released to the public, i was told to "watch the news"
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think the news teams are the ones that are investigating. I want the information from the actual investigators. Its just so sketchy and its tearing me up inside knowing some BS like this is happening 5 minutes away from me.
