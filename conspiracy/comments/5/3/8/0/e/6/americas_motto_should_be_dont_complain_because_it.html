        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was thinking about how many times I&#39;ve been told this since entering the work force. I have been told:</p>

<p><em>Life is just not fair. You should just be happy you have a job.</em> </p>

<p>This was after expressing my discontent that I was doing far more work than others for the same pay. Of course I know life isn&#39;t fair, and it will always be like that to some extent, but it really made me feel terrible.</p>

<p><em>Other schools/places are way worse. If you went there, you&#39;d be far unhappier.</em></p>

<p>But I guess that means we should not try to improve anything here?</p>

<p><em>Just be happy you live in America. What if you lived in like North Korea or something?</em></p>

<p>This one frustrates me the most.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;ve been told several variations of these things over the years. The conspiracy is that we are told to just settle and be happy because it could be worse. Complaining (even in a respectful way) is now considered a character flaw. I have also found that people are really good at saying they want change, but actions never really fall into place.</p>

<p>There are plenty of articles to back up the fact that most people are visible at work:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jobs/11871751/Its-official-most-people-are-miserable-at-work.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/jobs/11871751/Its-official-most-people-are-miserable-at-work.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2014/06/20/most-americans-are-unhappy-at-work/#2d0882fa5862">http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2014/06/20/most-americans-are-unhappy-at-work/#2d0882fa5862</a></p>

<p>I feel like I am living in a world where mediocre (or worse) is what people expect and even want, and wishing for something better or more is considered idealistic or naive. The American Dream is dead, but people are content with their suffering:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/american-dream-suffering/397475/">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/american-dream-suffering/397475/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m going to end this here. It&#39;s really pretty simple. &#39;They&#39; give us just enough to not complain, to be satisfied with our suffering.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve often felt the human race is quit like honey bees.  Here&#39;s your task, just shut up and do it.  We have one proven way of doing things, do not question the system--ever.</p>

<p>People seem to forget that earning a living, is just that.  Your job should not at all define who you are, but it does, and that is fuuuucked up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the beginning of a brave new world. You are what you do. </p>

<p>One significant difference is that the two highest castes - Beta and Alpha - are not mass-produced, and thus have a degree of individuality. That individuality extends, logically, to physical characteristics as well as to personality. Moreover, just as the highest caste - Alpha - is comprised of the tallest, most beautiful individuals, the Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon workers are progressively shorter and uglier.</p>

<p>Huxley is implying that there is a caste system today, though based on race and economics as opposed to something similar to cloning.</p>
