        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know that the prevailing view is that they struck some kind of deal to keep HRC out of prison but that doesn&#39;t really make sense to me because why would they ever do that in public? It generated bad news for Lynch and the Clintons after all.</p>

<p>Do you really think they couldn&#39;t find a way to communicate without it becoming front page news? It just doesn&#39;t make sense except of course if front page news of the meeting was exactly what they wanted.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this: What was the consequence of those news? That&#39;s right, Loretta Lynch was &quot;forced&quot; to excuse herself from any decision making in that case because of the &quot;appearance of impropriety&quot;.</p>

<p>So when Comey gave his press conference in which he laid out what Clinton did wrong and nevertheless came to the conclusion that &quot;no reasonable prosecutor would indict this case&quot; there was no pressure on Lynch to indict HRC because she already had to excuse herself from the case.
She was locked in on following the recommendation of the FBI investigation but really it should have been the Justice Departments decision what a reasonable prosecutor should do. Especially in such a unique and high profile case.</p>

<p>So both the Clintons and Lynch benefited from the &quot;bad&quot; news about the meeting on the tarmac. 
Lynch got to excuse herself from this whole mess, the decision not to indict HRC is not tied to her in the public eye and Comey got all the heat.
HRC benefited because there was as faster resolution to the question if she would be indicted. The day of the press conference it was answered and the question did not linger around for weeks after where the public could pressure Lynch and the Justice Department to indict.</p>

<p><strong>TL:DR: The purpose of the tarmac meeting was to help Loretta Lynch excuse herself from the case so Comey&#39;s recommendation would stand without question.</strong></p>

<p>[The only assumption made for this theory to work is that Lynch and the Clintons knew what Comey was going to say by the time they met on the tarmac]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just makes sense, doesn&#39;t it? 
You can also read it as a political blame game between Lynch and Comey. Comey intended to fuck over Lynch with his ambiguous press conference which was designed to put Lynch on the spot. But he got outplayed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, conceding that her airport meeting with former President Bill Clinton this week had cast a shadow over the federal investigation of Hillary Clintonâ€™s personal email account, said Friday that she would accept whatever recommendations career prosecutors and the F.B.I. director made about whether to bring charges in the case.</p>

<p>by forcing a &quot;conflict of interest&quot; she somehow alleviated herself of accountability and put the ball in Comey&#39;s court.  I don&#39;t know what the legality is here, but I suspect the AG&#39;s office would have more of a legal responsibility to prosecute given the evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was under the impression they were caught by a photographer.</p>

<p>Why would they have to be so careful. Did anything happen except people called anyone who called shenanigans like us conspiracy theorists?
I would say that was just the convenient place he was confident was private. If someone saw her, meh, can&#39;t prove anything.
I think it was definitely a talk to get HRC off.

&quot;Yes.&quot;
Simple.</p>
