    <div class="md"><p>I was at work one day and it was slow. A customer spoke to me for 15 - 20 minutes about flat earth. They had math and other evidence backing the claims. They claimed it was impossible to launch anything into space and that all photos of earth are faked. I also had the impression he was not an Internet user, more of an anti-technology kind of person. It was odd but I politely listened while they tried to convince me; meanwhile I was astonished that someone could actually believe this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mountains disappear behind the diffusion of air.  It is air and your own eyesight that prevents you from seeing further.  Try using a telescope.  By the way, there are giant hills in Southern California, but again the air impedes.</p>

<p>I do not think it is flat, just not the perfect round shape we have been shown.  It does, however, display signs indicating it may be flat.  For example, take the descent of an airplane- it should take much longer than the ascent nearly every time, but it does not.  Take, for example, the reason why the ocean is flat, perfectly horizontal and I can see farther than 20 miles with a telescope.   Then there is the fact that in a glass elevator the horizon expands as you ascend, which should not happen on a ball.</p>

<p>To me, it is bumpy (like someone&#39;s mom).  That all I really know for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shape of Earth is not talked about rationally.  People get emotional.  Here are a few answers:  the balls on a pool table being round do not make the table round; we cannot dig forever, it was tried during the Cold War and failed; the edge is a ring of ice; planes always turn.  How can you believe the Earth is a spinning ball hurling through space both around the sun and through the galaxy?  If this were true the sky would look different.  Oh, but there&#39;s a theory for that: relativity, and a prophet.  Just like the theory of gravity, pure magic:  strong enough to keep down an entire ocean but weak enough for a small insect to fly.  Magic.</p>

<p>What is this about single linear evolution? Got anything on the topic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve found <a href="http://atlantisquest.com/index.html">this</a> site very insightful, and Graham Hancock&#39;s material is interesting as well.  There are some interviews with Hancock and an exposition of his ideas in this film:-</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpJ3yO4-Xpo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpJ3yO4-Xpo</a></p>

<p>I was first really introduced to the idea by the Architect&#39;s speech within <em>The Matrix Reloaded.</em>  That film was fictitious of course, but the concept of successive societies, rather than just a single, progressive, uninterrupted line towards what we have now, has fascinated me.  On this score, I&#39;d also actually recommend Mencius Moldbug&#39;s <em><a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com.au/2008/04/open-letter-to-open-minded-progressives.html">Open Letter to Open Minded Progressives</a></em>, as well.  You will frequently see me rhetorically crossing swords with fascists in this subreddit, but I&#39;ve truthfully developed some empathy for the neo-reactionaries.  I don&#39;t necessarily agree with them <strong><em>completely</em></strong>, but I think some of their ideas make a lot of sense. </p>

<p>The overall...aggregate if you like...of what I&#39;ve read on the topic, has strongly suggested to me that something very different has happened, where human development is concerned, to what we&#39;ve usually been told.</p>

<p>I think there have been a large number of different human civilisations that have not, for various reasons, left all that many visible traces of themselves behind, which has meant that we&#39;ve built up this picture of a single progressive line going from the Paleolithic Era up to the present day.</p>

<p>I think the truth is different.  I think people have gone from what we recognise as Stone Age, up to our own current level of technology (or close to it at least) before, and then because civilisations built on said level of technology are unsustainable by definition, they have destroyed themselves, and humanity has again gone back down to Stone Age levels.</p>

<p>I think some of those civilisations have had very different technological paradigms to ours, as well.  There&#39;s a book called <a href="http://www.shamanicengineering.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Magnetic-Current-Ed-Leedskalnin.pdf">Magnetic Current</a> by Edward Leedskalnin, in which he outlines the principles behind how he believed the Egyptians built the pyramids, and he claims to have used the same tech to build a structure called Coral Castle, as well.</p>

<p>It&#39;s weird stuff, but if you look into it, I think you&#39;ll find that there is enough there to at least cause some questions to be asked.</p>

<p>Here is something else from my Facebook feed, which I&#39;d forgotten about; and this illustrates another part of my point.</p>

<p>With the single linear evolution theory, they have to keep pushing the dates back.  For a while they thought that no one had been on the American continent before 10,000 years ago, but then they found something which forced them to reluctantly go back as far as 100,000 years, and then they found something else which means the number is now at 150,000 years.  They are having to do the same thing in India too, as you see here.</p>

<p>Archaeologists and paleontologists are an arrogant bunch, too.  A self-respecting physicist <strong><em>expects</em></strong> things to change every so many months or years; or at least, they do these days.  So they won&#39;t try and tell you that something is the gospel truth; they&#39;ll tell you how something looks, according to the most current theories, but with the understanding that a new theory could come along in a couple of months, which will potentially make their words now look silly.</p>

<p>Archaeologists don&#39;t do that.  An archaeologist will try to be paternalistic and authoritative.  An archaeologist will try and say, &quot;<strong><em>THIS</em></strong> is how it is, now and for all time.&quot;  As Werner Heisenberg knew, that is not a scientific attitude.  No opinion is worth more than the result of the most recent experiment, and that is all.  But because archaeologists do this, they make themselves look all the more like fools when they get things wrong.  If they were more like the physicists in that regard, people would forgive them, because it would be understood that they did the best they could at the time.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another one, just recently.  Someone needs to tell these guys that if your theory keeps getting shattered by new discoveries every few years, then it probably isn&#39;t a terribly stable or viable theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that in many cases, we&#39;re dealing with civilisations where even in the very best case scenario, there wouldn&#39;t be much left simply because of the amount of time that has passed.  All that&#39;s left in Egypt to a large extent is stone, and in many cases that is starting to get seriously pockmarked and chipped away, as well.  Then on top of that you&#39;ve got entrenched biases, and groups like the Smithsonian or the Vatican trying to bury what little <strong><em>is</em></strong> left.</p>

<p>I thought the <em>Ancient Aliens</em> series mostly consisted of a group of snake oil salesmen telling lies; I truthfully don&#39;t accept the ET intervention hypothesis much at all, to be honest.  Alternative Egyptology, on the other hand, is different; and part of the reason why I say that, is because I&#39;ve been able to employ the number ratio system for producing buildings within Minecraft, and have noticed the claimed psychological effects.  Egyptian knowledge is therefore testable, and that includes their system of mathematics.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t look for the remains of buildings, so much as the underlying paradigms and ideas.  Said ideas are still testable, and you will know that they work, if you are able to use them to reproduce similar buildings or objects within the present day.  I have been very happy to see truly experimental archaeology become a more widely known practice in recent years, because it means that we don&#39;t need to rely exclusively on artifacts which are naturally going to cease to exist with the passage of time.  If we can reconstruct the methods used to produce those artifacts, then we can get hard proof of their validity by using them to create more of said artifacts now; and we can also use said methods and value systems to improve our currently degenerate present, which badly needs them.</p>

<p>If the fascists on 4chan gave me anything positive, it was, in conjunction with watching material like <em>Magical Egypt,</em> a realisation that in many ways the past genuinely <strong><em>was</em></strong> better and more desirable than our present.</p>

<p>I dig your list and am largely in agreement, but this one is interesting.  I tend to agree with you, by the way, but is this a conspiracy or just the usual phenomenon of an entrenched academic paradigm railing against fresh evidence?</p>

<p>Both.  The atheists need Darwin very badly, because if you look at every other religious system that exists, they all have a creation myth.  Darwin gives atheism its&#39; creation myth, and without him they don&#39;t have one; and they also then don&#39;t have anything with which to challenge the creation myths of competing paradigms.</p>

<p>So they are very, <strong><em>very</em></strong> protective of Darwin.  Darwin is the very bedrock of neo-Atheism; more than merely the absence of belief in God, as they claim.  If you read books like <em>Sex at Dawn,</em> in fact if you read pretty much anything which tries to add to the mainstream narrative about human biology, every single author is always extremely careful to start with a genuflection in front of the altar of Darwinism first.</p>

<p>We very badly need to kick Darwin off his throne.  Natural selection is an idea with some extremely nasty social implications, apart from anything else; but unfortunately, I can&#39;t see it happening for a long time, if ever.  His cult are very robustly entrenched, at this point; and they are also deeply, viciously paranoid about any attempts made to remove them.</p>
