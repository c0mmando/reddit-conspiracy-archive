       Disclaimer: This is not intended to encourage hatred towards anyone. Questioning and noticing patterns is not hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently dismissed the idea of a Jewish conspiracy as obviously false, but once I started noticing connections in my fields of interest (philosophy, politics, and economics), I just kept noticing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that there are only 5.4 million Jews in the United States, representing 1.7% of the total US population. There are only 14.2 million Jews worldwide, representing only 0.2% of the world population. It’s also important to realize that Jews consider themselves primarily an ethnicity first, and only secondarily a religion. So even if you are an atheist/agnostic, you can still be fully Jewish in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following people either identify as Jewish or have immediate Jewish ancestry (father, mother, or both were Jews). I try to note when they are only half- or part-Jewish, but I wasn't perfect about that.

       I think there are too many Jewish people in positions of power and influence to simply brush off as simply a coincidence. When you look at how many Jewish students there are at Harvard and Yale, 26%, that's an overrepresentation of 1500%. The Ivy League is the gateway to positions of power, everyone knows this. There are 6 media corporations that control 90% of what you watch, and 5 of those 6 have Jewish people at the very top positions (the exception being Rupert Murdoch's News Corp/Fox News, wow, isn't that interesting?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is talking about the 1% and the banks, like Goldman Sachs. Why is no one making the obvious connection to Jews? Economists failed to predict the recession. They're using highly unrealistic, ideological models. And the profession has been dominated by Jews. Surely there is a connection to be made here. Why is no one talking about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is extremely interesting that you find prominent Jews on both the extreme pro-capitalism side and the extreme anti-capitalism side. And not just that, they're the crowning figures of their respective movements. Why is no one talking about this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do the Clintons in particular surround themselves with so many Jewish people in prominent positions of power?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, it could be because the media doesn't want you to hear about it. And don't expect your favorite cultural icons to talk about it either - would anyone want to piss off all those A-list actors and actresses?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that simply asking these questions gets you the label "anti-Semite" hurled at you? Of course I recognize the historical associations that have been made, and the consequences of that. But is that an excuse to refuse to look at the reality of the situation?

       my path was similar to yours, too many jews in key positions for it to be an accident or for it to be attributed to the famed 10 point iq differential. in our world, this is clearly cartelism bordering on sabotage and treason given the evidence of israeli involvement in 9/11 which of course would not be possible without jewish collaborators from within.
      </p>
      <p>
       guys like zuckerberg being propped is no accident - this is an attempt at capturing and monopolising the digital age, a practice which has served some jews well in the past, such as the slave trade, shipping trade, silk trade, cotton trade, coffee trade, sugar trade, diamond trade, precious metals, pornography, prostitution, gaming, alcohol, illegal narcotics (e.g. opium, cocaine), media,  oil trade and the weapons trade and good old political corruption. Not to mention the parasitic banking and economic system that has devoured nations and populations over the past 400 years
      </p>
      <p>
       obvious disclaimer that this doesntapply to all jews, but there is definitely a layer within the population that is evil and sees people not as humans but as objects.

       Yeah I was just learning about the Israeli connection to 9/11 too. I watched a lecture by Christopher Bollyn and it was really convincing. When you factor that in, all of the Jews I listed start to look like even less of a coincidence.

       I just started reading the "Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews," fascinating. I also agree about it being a layer within the population. I highly doubt that every Jew you meet is "in on it." However I think they can be highly influenced by the ideology emanating from the top.

       yeah there's a lot out there thats been vehemently suppressed by the jewish lobby led by the ADL, a lot of antisemitism is derived from this lack of loyalty, fleeing from empire to empire, using the monopoly of force afforded by the power of the age to opportunistically profit, with callous disregard to humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       alexander solzhenitsyn's 200 years together is another book suppressed in the west because it give one man's opinion of the role of jewish people in russia from the 18th century onwards

       Yes, Jews favor Jews and this is a racist practice.  It's at the core of Jewish culture.  To protect, preserve and defend their 'right' to be racist in this pursuit they have invented and practice many 'tricks', including the antisemitism and the holocaust gambits, to produce the desired results.  The nation of Israel itself is one such result and the racism upon which the nation is based is clear, comprehensive proof that this is a core reality of the world we all live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a right, an obligation, to make note of this aspect of how the world is put together and to expose and resist it as racist.  We especially must expose and resist their use of violence, exploitation and manipulation.  We who do this are not racist but the Jewish gambit is to label us as racists (i.e., antisemites), nonetheless, in hopes that they can continue this behavior and neither allow us to talk about it nor to work together toward ending it.  The bottom line is that this IS racism and that it benefits only Jews.  It IS bad for the people of the world as any racism is and we have every right to resist and overcome it.

       I'm in the process of reading that actually, and also "the Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews" which argues that Jews have a long history with the slave trade, and that Christopher Columbus might have been a Jew, or was at least funded by them.

       I'll check out those interviews, thanks. I actually read David Duke's "Jewish Supremacism" and found it to be quite earnest and not hateful, and if you ignored some of the comments about racial mixing, and replaced "Jewish supremacy" with "white supremacy" it could almost be a progressive tract.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is a lot of hatred on the left for "dumb white rednecks" but have they ever tried, you know, listening to them or reading their stuff? I think leftists unwittingly buy into very elitist views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also when you have both militantly peo-black Nation of Islam and the former grand wizard of the KKK both agreeing that there's something up with the Jews, that is quite interesting.

       I agree, I think Left vs Right keeps the gentiles confused and fighting each other. In reality it's People versus the Elites, but we're so divided we can't see that we're actually on the same side.

       Yeah, one of my favorite philosophers, Zizek, points out the hypocrisy of Charlie Hebdo and the drawings of Mohammed (look at these primitive people, they can't take someone making fun of their religion). What would be the reaction of Westerners if you drew cartoons implying the Holocaust wasn't real?

       Yeah I noticed this a leg time ago too.  I personally don't care if someone is Jewish.  The area I live in has little to no Jewish people, and I think I've only ever met 2.  But from what I gather, the reason you see so many prominent Jew now is because after ww2, they wanted to make the world respect them.  So today you have grandfathers and mothers that were able to pass down their wealth knowledge and power.  And it's true that a lot of the Jews you mentioned are worthy of respect, like all the Nobel prize winners and (imho) senator sanders among many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say that all Jews are in on the same conspiracy, or that they're all even zionists.  They're not.  George soros, a very prominent Jew that made your list, wants our govt to question israels claim to bring a democracy, and was probably reaponsible for Obama calling out Israel when they started building settlements in the weat bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there a cabal of zionists greedily trying to gain influence and power?  Fuck yes.  But not every Jew works for them or even likes them.  Also, there are several cabals in our govt trying to do the same thing, sometimes with the same but competing goals and sometimes with different goals and means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr not all Jews are scum, bros.

       I think there is a definite distinction to be made between Zionists and Jews, not all of whom are Zionist and some are fiercely critical of Israel (such as Jill Stein, who I support). However, I think we should question the overrepresentation of Jews in the media, politics, academia, and financial sectors. It could amount to a kind of Jewish privilege which is unfair. If you read the Ron Unz article I linked to in my sources, the number of Jews in the Ivy League is astoundingly high, even though their academic performance compared with Asians is not as good. There might be some serious nepotism going on here, that is hardly innocent. It may be unconscious, or maybe not.

       What if it is only an inner circle of Jews who have the most power, and you don't even know about it? But in any case 44% of Jewish adults make over $100k per year, I'd say that's pretty privileged. More than gentile white people earn by far.

       I definitely see the inordinate amount of influence but it makes me wonder what about being Jewish makes such a difference since all ethnicities and religions tend to stick together anyway? Just as well all religions would like strong influence over the world so what makes Jewish people better at it? And I know American industrialists and European elites created and funded Hitler's Germany but why target Jews? Even if you don't believe the accepted numbers of Jews killed in the holocaust, it's still confusing when the whole point of Zionism seems to be Jews above all else. Can anyone clear things up a bit for me?

       I think the fact that they have much smaller numbers is actually an advantage, they can cohere together much more effectively. Try to get 1 billion Muslims or 2 billion Christians to agree on anything, you can't do it.

       I want to read more about the US corporations funding Germany but I know at least that Henry Ford really thought there was a Jewish conspiracy which is probably why he supported Hitler.

       It's really interesting. Ford, I'm sure you know, built nazi tanks and jeeps and successfully sued the US over their bombing of his tank factories. Hitler's terrifying Air Force could only run on a patented Rockefeller oil additive.

       Jewish people are ethno-religious. The ethnic/cultural side is derivative of the religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judaism is one of the 3 major Abrahamic religions, along with Christianity and Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US used to be predominately Christian pre-mass media but has been getting smaller every generation. I wouldn't say that's a bad thing personally since I'm not a huge fan of religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hollywood was founded by Jewish people and the industry is kind of nepotistic which is why there's an over representation of Jewish people in the industry. It's why unfunny people like Amy Schumacher &amp; Sarah Silverman are famous. Still, Hollywood's influence on the US public is massive.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past, people got their moral and social cues from the church. After radio &amp; film, then tv and internet, social attitudes shifted away from a Christian centric majority to a Jewish centric majority. You can say anything about the Christians or the Muslims but you have to be careful about talking about Jewish people otherwise you get called an anti-Semite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews aren't bad though. Other people can learn a lot from them. As a minority, they have a strong sense of community &amp; family values to go get good educations and jobs. They support each other for the betterment of their collective group. Unfortunately, that kind of favouritism does kind of screw over others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holocaust sucked. Yes it did happen but WW2 was more than just Hitler having an issue with Jewish people. There was a lot of politics going on between France &amp; the UK vs Germany leading into the war that never gets mentioned. Jewish people got caught in the middle of all their politics and everyone just blames Hitler when the UK and France really did share equal blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holocaust is used as a persistent propaganda tool. By reminding people to 'never forget', it reinforces the victim roles that makes the US support Israel to the tune of billions worth of foreign aid. Flint doesn't even have drinking water but give Israel some more guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holocaust is a form of indoctrination. By telling young Jewish people that if they don't support the collective, that Hitler will come back and that everyone else hates them. It's shitty really. They send kids to birthright and to the camps and scare the crap out of them so that they believe all that junk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's really a conspiracy so much as an evolution of a few different social factors.

       What makes something a conspiracy?  When it's illegal, against the law.  Plenty of what goes on is illegal, and that means that plenty of what goes on is a conspiracy.  Racism in hiring, by the way, is illegal.  Add Adam Sandler, Jimmy Kimmel and

       I am aware of these cognitive biases and I'm generally very skeptical. But when 38% of Nobel Prize winners in Economics are Jewish, and 58% of John Bates Clark winners are Jewish, that's an overrepresentation between 2200% and 3400%. There is definitely a pattern there. I intentionally left this thread open ended so that people could have their own theories about why this pattern exists, but I believe it is there if you bother to look. The hypothesis that it is mere coincidence doesn't hold water. And it's not just a mere curiosity either, because these are the people that end up managing our economy, who may have failed to predict the Great Recession because of ideological bias, and who are in extremely prominent positions of power that influence our connection with Israel and the war on terror, for instance. We might not have even invaded Iraq at all if it weren't for the plans laid out by the Jewish Paul Wolfowitz for instance. That's pretty huge. And there is growing evidence that Israel's Mossad may be behind 9/11 in order to trump up support for the war on terror. They don't all have to be involved in the same conspiracy, or even all involved in a conspiracy except for a few a the top, for their positions of power to have a large effect on the state of affairs we find ourselves in.

       The pattern is that Jews emphasize education and academic pursuit as the keys to a better life. They also recognize that in order to prevent demagoguery and a second Holocaust it is important to have influence and political power, as well as a means to put pressure on elements of society which would otherwise not lift a finger to protect the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are far fewer Jews in positions of power/influence than there are on the outside looking in. If there were some vast, global Jewish conspiracy why would the leaders leave the rest of the group flapping in the wind?
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews, like any other group, try to work for the collective good of society. There is a concept in the faith known as Tikkun Olam, which literally translates as "healing the world." At the same time, Jews try to maintain a sense of community amongst themselves and this is often done through in-group dynamics. The Jewish community is a huge network unto itself, and it is often the case that everyone is just a few degrees of separation from everyone else. So you want a job at JP Morgan? Go talk to my friend over there, and tell him I sent you. I'll put in a good word. This is generally how it works. Jews like to see other Jews do well because it keeps the community strong, which is necessary for it to survive in a world that frankly doesn't like Jews.

       That's nice, but this has been

       Then there is
       <a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/israel.asp">
        this
       </a>
       . How about this question: why, if the Jewish community is so tightly knit, and so small, and everyone is in on the conspiracy, would Israel murder 400+ Jews on 9/11? Jews are not known for their willingness to die as martyrs. In fact, Halachic law states that unless you can safely save another person's life from mortal danger you should not place your own life in danger, as risking what God has given you is an affront to Him. So, if all the Jews are Talmudic and in cahoots, why would they knowingly go against their own teachings and martyr themselves knowing God would punish them?

        The pattern is that Jews emphasize education and academic pursuit as the keys to a better life. They also recognize that in order to prevent demagoguery and a second Holocaust it is important to have influence and political power, as well as a means to put pressure on elements of society which would otherwise not lift a finger to protect the Jews.

       That does not explain their positions of power. Asians outperform them academically, and yet Jews hold onto institutional power. And you don't see prominent Asian Americans in positions of power in the same way.

       I think that it is specifically inner-circles of Zionist Jews who are the conspirators. But they promote an ideology among the outside-circle of Jews so that even though they don't really know what's going on, they act as a protective barrier to the inner circle (for instance, denouncing criticism of Israel as "anti-Semitic").

        Jews, like any other group, try to work for the collective good of society. There is a concept in the faith known as Tikkun Olam, which literally translates as "healing the world." At the same time, Jews try to maintain a sense of community amongst themselves and this is often done through in-group dynamics. The Jewish community is a huge network unto itself, and it is often the case that everyone is just a few degrees of separation from everyone else. So you want a job at JP Morgan? Go talk to my friend over there, and tell him I sent you. I'll put in a good word. This is generally how it works. Jews like to see other Jews do well because it keeps the community strong, which is necessary for it to survive in a world that frankly doesn't like Jews.

      <p>
       I think that nepotism probably does explain a lot of their positions of power, but if they're just like any other group then that doesn't explain why they're in these positions of power and not some other group. Also I can't believe any skeptical person would think that religious zealots have nothing but world peace and harmony in mind.

       You can probably add Murdoch to the Jewish list. His mother Elisabeth is said to have been Jewish, and she raised Rupert as an orthodox Jew. It is very hard to verify this story. When she passed away a few years back I watched the media for any clues that her funeral might be Jewish, but it was all conducted in private on the family estate- perhaps the secrecy itself is evidence. Anyhow it is rumoured that her father provided the (Jewish) cash for her husband Keith to buy the Adelaide advertiser: the first building block of the Murdoch media empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this can be dismissed as hearsay. But when you consider Rupert's ardent Zionism, contempt for Arabs (on record), and the fact he once took an intimate helicopter trip over the occupied territories with Ariel Sharon, it all points towards Murdoch being Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why keep it secret? Well, it is handy to have one media mogul who is "not Jewish", isn't it? Adds a bit of balance.

       Good points. If he's not Jewish, the fact that only someone fervently Zionist who curries favor with Israel could become as powerful as Murdocg is in itself evidence of the Zionists' power.

       Why bother with r/conspiracy if you want the proof handed to you on a silver platter. This forum necessarily involves some speculation. That can be a bridge to more serious investigation, but shooting down all speculation by demanding such investigation is counterproductive.

       Asking for actual analysis rather than fuzzy-headed thinking isn't asking for proof on a silver platter, it is asking for epistemic rigor and an actual commitment to the truth.  It means separating what we want to be true from the truth by ensuring that the conclusions we draw aren't due to confirmation bias, Dunning-Kruger, or any other of the many pitfalls along the way to actual knowledge.

       I'm not saying don't explore. I'm saying that unless you are rigorous your exploration isn't meaningful.  Unless you can have confidence in your findings through real research protocol then your "research" is a joke.

       You can simply state your hypothesis -- which you have done here.  But to actually "explore" the idea for real you need a rigorous approach otherwise all you end up with is anecdotal evidence -- like what you present here.

       Your assumptions are very Anglo-Saxon in nature, there has been a tradition in analytic thought which says there is no place for philosophy and metaphysics, or at least a very strictly limited and secondary place (behind science). This is the minimalist philosophy of Wittgenstein. On the exact opposite end of the spectrum, you have Deleuze who says that philosophy is a matter of pure exploration on abstract planes without any regard to whether it is true or not (leave that up to the scientists). I don't know if I would go that far, but you should at least recognize that your strict empiricism is a product of the current place you're in, historically and culturally.

       Sure.  But surely Deleuze still agrees that the formal logic of Aristotle (finally proven by Godel) is accurate: many statements can, at their core, be determined to be true or false, sound or unsound in their reasoning.  I'm not convinced that Philosophy can't be entirely distinguished from notions of true and false, but I'm also not saying that all philosophy must make truth-finding its core objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the later Wittgetnstein was right: much of philosophy essentially boils down to word games.  If we are asking questions of fact why play at games when we have measures of statistical significance and other more reliable epistemic approaches?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd agree that hard empiricism is a cultural product but we've had nearly 500 years of it and look at what a 500 years it has been.

       For me, the point of philosophy is to understand the truth. However, it should push beyond what is currently possible to prove scientifically, because the domain of things which are scientifically provable is a small subset of what is actually true. While philosophy may never claim absolute knowledge, through reasoned discussion and speculation we can get an idea of what the larger domain looks like. Philosophy should take Wittgenstein's advice to heart and not get caught up in word games, but nevertheless we shouldn't forget the power of words to point in the direction of an unspeakable truth.
      </p>

       Anyway I already kind of changed my mind on the thesis I was pushing here. I don't think it is a conspiracy so much as a result of Jewish culture. Early on, their religion encouraged scientific and philosophical thinking, so they got a head start. And combine that with a culture of merchants, and they were well positioned to rise to the top of capitalism.

       These episodes were responsible for changing my mind:

       Jewish finance and their hand in both WWI and WWII are a huge, not to mention the creation of the pan-European movement which would become the EU. If you want to see why there is an obvious race replacement scheme ongoing in Europe look up Coudenhove Kalergi on google. White Genocide is not racist paranoia, the UN itself has articles on its own site about immigration used as 'replacement' stock.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, if your new to this stuff, I advise you to type "6 million Jews BEFORE WWII" into Google. You soon start questioning a great deal of other things too.

       I think there is a definite distinction to be made between Zionists and Jews, not all of whom are Zionist and some are fiercely critical of Israel (such as Jill Stein, who I support). However, I think we should question the overrepresentation of Jews in the media, politics, academia, and financial sectors. It could amount to a kind of Jewish privilege which is unfair. If you read the Ron Unz article I linked to in my sources, the number of Jews in the Ivy League is astoundingly high, even though their academic performance compared with Asians is not as good. There might be some serious nepotism going on here, that is hardly innocent. It may be unconscious, or maybe not.

       I am aware of these cognitive biases and I'm generally very skeptical. But when 38% of Nobel Prize winners in Economics are Jewish, and 58% of John Bates Clark winners are Jewish, that's an overrepresentation between 2200% and 3400%. There is definitely a pattern there. I intentionally left this thread open ended so that people could have their own theories about why this pattern exists, but I believe it is there if you bother to look. The hypothesis that it is mere coincidence doesn't hold water. And it's not just a mere curiosity either, because these are the people that end up managing our economy, who may have failed to predict the Great Recession because of ideological bias, and who are in extremely prominent positions of power that influence our connection with Israel and the war on terror, for instance. We might not have even invaded Iraq at all if it weren't for the plans laid out by the Jewish Paul Wolfowitz for instance. That's pretty huge. And there is growing evidence that Israel's Mossad may be behind 9/11 in order to trump up support for the war on terror. They don't all have to be involved in the same conspiracy, or even all involved in a conspiracy except for a few a the top, for their positions of power to have a large effect on the state of affairs we find ourselves in.

       Your trick is to move the goalposts a bit, try to make the OP defend something he/she hasn't actually written, isn't it?

       Check out Bollyn's investigation on Rupert Murdoch. You were wrong but not by much: All 6 of the media conglomerates are owned by them.
