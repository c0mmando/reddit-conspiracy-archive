       If she has the power to do that in the Primary, then why wouldn't she have the power to do that in the General Election?  But, if Trump would win, then shouldn't that also be a red flag?  This is Pro Wrestling.  They've been friends for decades anyway, and until this election Trump supported her.

       the election IS already rigged, and if/when caught, they've already lined up Russia as the scapegoat. Oh and wouldn't you know it, Russia was just caught in their Own election scandal, so why not rig American's election as well? it's all a farce, these are long laid plans that are just not holding up thanks to Hillary's health, whatever the truth of that might be.

       There is a popular theory that Trump is controlled opposition. Trump playing a republican demagogue when he identified as a democrat not long ago is pretty suspect, and he has had ties to the Clintons for over a decade.

       Trump is a "third way" Democrat just like the Clintons. Basically a centrist corporatist. That's why conservatives and liberals are both pissed: neither are represented by these two.

       I'll take it one step further I've been arguing with this asshole in r/politics all day today because "I'm a privileged Bernie die hard" and "won't fall in line" so this type of thinking is still going on regardless of how many of us have capitulated to voting Hillary, or how many of us have left to vote for someone else, in their eyes our votes should be hers and we're being children by not giving it to her, meanwhile they're the ones that treat us like shit and throw temper tantrums because they're not winning because she's unelectable as fuck. By now Bernie would have been kicking the fuck out of Trump and we'd be looking at a landslide.

       I'm not for Trump by any means but if I didn't have more to worry about I would base my vote in this election as a big fuck you to the Hill-bots that act like this, but that's being petty and I'd like to think I've grown past that a bit.

       I prefer Bernie Sanders but barring something happening to Hillary in less than a few weeks that ain't happening, I guess Stein is an apt substitute, but she still pales when compared to Sanders, she's as liberal but the ideas aren't there for her, and she doesn't have his understanding of what is broken, as in like the sources of the problems we're running into and will run into within the next few years, that was the thing about Sanders for me, despite being as old as he is his vision was clear, he seems to understand what problems we're going to face within the next decade or so, like when automation surpasses the amount of available jobs.

       Hillary Clinton could die tomorrow and the Democratic Party leadership would simply choose someone else through the judicious use of party bylaws. One thing they won't do is follow delegate wishes and allow Sanders on the ticket.

       You saw the shenanigans along the campaign trail and at the convention. Remind you of the bullshit the GOP did to Ron Paul in 2012? Now I happen to disagree with Paul on just about every substantive matter of policy. But the man is honest. And he ran an honest campaign. Which is why GOP insiders ate him for lunch.

       But yeah you're preaching to the choir over here, I saw the same thing with Ron Paul, I was a lot younger but saw both parties try their best to crush Ross Perot, and now Bernie, they either need to be changed fundamentally down to their core, which we all know won't happen, or they need to go.

       Well, when he supported Clinton he didn't give away his delegates. Therefor, we can hope that if she's put in a courtroom before the election, then he will be the one people are voting for/against.

       He had all of that fucking grass root support,yet he roll'ed over by not fighting back when ever Clinton stole victories  from him.

       That makes me fucking furious.

       I'm also furious over the thought of trump fcking over his supporters.
It's not like like what we saw with Romney. Trump's supporters are the silent Majority who're finally speaking out. They're Grass roots.

       Clinton called the Silent Majority a basket of deplorables.

       Silent Majority does not equal Grass Roots. Grass Roots is a method of reaching out to people personally... Trump's supporters aren't grass roots.

       But regardless, I agree with your overall sentiment.

       As haggard as she looks now its telegraphing something.  Its very risky doing something like this this late in the campaign.  The body double thing really bothers me, its brazenly dishonest.

      <p>
       My theory is that her health failed a few weeks ago, they tried to fake it with green screens giving the crew only enough time and data to do a half ass job.  She thought she could do the 9-ll ceremony wore her anti seizure glasses, and failed.  Not its basically over, they're organizing the transfer to Biden or Caine now.

      <p>
       Yes there is. Combetta asked reddit how to delete/change information in a server that was under order from (either a court or the FBI) for preservation. He then deleted all of the emails because he didn't know how to change it. Felony, without a doubt. A very, very bad one at that.

       If you're not a shill and truly believe this, then I'm sorry. I hope you continue to live in ignorance, because the world is filled to the brim with corruption, greed, and even (including Clinton), murder(Hitmen). If you can't handle it, fine, but don't preach that something is wrong when there is undeniable proof that it's true and you just can't handle it.

       This is the only true part of your comment.  The rest is lies.  Lies, without a doubt.  And very, very bad ones at that.

       There is no undeniable proof of your original assertion.  You are lying or deluded and

       can't handle it.

       It refutes what's occurred without any counter-proof, for one. It comes  off as a stand-offish attitude. Usually those replies start with people trying to prove the original comment wrong but it usually devolves into pointless arguing about how the other person is an idiot. Like right now.

       I replied that way because OP just made assertions without any proof.  I was just challenging him, or anyone else to prove anything in the post.  So far no one, including you, has risen to the challenge.  You just keep "diluting the topic", an calling me an idiot and a shill.

       Excuse me, but it's a widely known fact that Hillary had her server wiped. We know now her IT head was Combetta and he did so after asking how to change information and used this as a last resort. I didn't think I would need to cite something like that considering one part is all over even the front page and the other was on even MSM. If inductive reasoning was never used in any cases the only way we would catch criminals is if they confessed.

       It's actually very illegal to do that after being ordered by a court/FBI to preserve the information after the court hearing. That's what the felony is. It wasn't being "decommissioned". They deliberately destroyed data after being specifically ordered not to.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, this is why both I and others think you're a shill. You're arguing about something that is a fact. It doesn't matter if they say it was being "decommissioned". They destroyed data they were ordered not to destroy and they did it anyway.

       Ok, here's some inductive reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guy posts on facebook group asking about ways to make a specific explosive device. A couple weeks later, same guy makes said device and blows it up at a mall and is not caught. People find facebook post, and it turns out he made the device the same way someone described it to him. Person is arrested and/or has a search warrant against him because of said facebook post. They find that he had bomb making materials which means "hmm, he could have done it with these materials". More inductive reasoning. Guy is put in jail for 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Used facebook because It's commonplace)

      <p>
