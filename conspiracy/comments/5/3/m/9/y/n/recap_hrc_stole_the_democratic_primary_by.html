By now Bernie would have been kicking the fuck out of Trump and we&#39;d be looking at a landslide.</p>

<p>You saw the shenanigans along the campaign trail and at the convention. Remind you of the bullshit the GOP did to Ron Paul in 2012? Now I happen to disagree with Paul on just about every substantive matter of policy. But the man is honest. And he ran an honest campaign. Which is why GOP insiders ate him for lunch. </p>

<p>They still exist too, Florida has/had a Whig party guy I believe in the state level. </p>

<p>But yeah you&#39;re preaching to the choir over here, I saw the same thing with Ron Paul, I was a lot younger but saw both parties try their best to crush Ross Perot, and now Bernie, they either need to be changed fundamentally down to their core, which we all know won&#39;t happen, or they need to go.</p>

It&#39;s not like like what we saw with Romney. Trump&#39;s supporters are the silent Majority who&#39;re finally speaking out. They&#39;re Grass roots.</p>

<p>My theory is that her health failed a few weeks ago, they tried to fake it with green screens giving the crew only enough time and data to do a half ass job.  She thought she could do the 9-ll ceremony wore her anti seizure glasses, and failed.  Not its basically over, they&#39;re organizing the transfer to Biden or Caine now.</p>

<p>Yes there is. Combetta asked reddit how to delete/change information in a server that was under order from (either a court or the FBI) for preservation. He then deleted all of the emails because he didn&#39;t know how to change it. Felony, without a doubt. A very, very bad one at that.</p>

I hope you continue to live in ignorance, because the world is filled to the brim with corruption, greed, and even (including Clinton), murder(Hitmen).

<p>edit: You added this after I replied, and it really has nothing to do with the Combetta issue, unless it&#39;s some sort of veiled threat to me or him.</p>

<p>There is no undeniable proof of your original assertion.  You are lying or deluded and <em>you</em> can&#39;t handle it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually very illegal to do that after being ordered by a court/FBI to preserve the information after the court hearing. That&#39;s what the felony is. It wasn&#39;t being &quot;decommissioned&quot;. They deliberately destroyed data after being specifically ordered not to.</p>

<p>You see, this is why both I and others think you&#39;re a shill. You&#39;re arguing about something that is a fact. It doesn&#39;t matter if they say it was being &quot;decommissioned&quot;. They destroyed data they were ordered not to destroy and they did it anyway.</p>

<p>Ok, here&#39;s some inductive reasoning.</p>

<p>Guy posts on facebook group asking about ways to make a specific explosive device. A couple weeks later, same guy makes said device and blows it up at a mall and is not caught. People find facebook post, and it turns out he made the device the same way someone described it to him. Person is arrested and/or has a search warrant against him because of said facebook post. They find that he had bomb making materials which means &quot;hmm, he could have done it with these materials&quot;. More inductive reasoning. Guy is put in jail for 30 years.</p>

<p>(Used facebook because It&#39;s commonplace)</p>

<p>You see how it works?</p>

<p>There you go.</p>
