        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These are all per his <a href="https://twitter.com/danrolle">Twitter feed</a>, if y&#39;all want to check it out:</p>

<p>Sept 15th: &quot;Folks, if you don&#39;t hear from me tomorrow, here&#39;s what you need to know. It&#39;s your preview. Please share: (img on iPhone) Hillary Clinton was declared the winner of the NV Caucus before the results were ever counted.&quot;</p>

<p>So, this is a history lesson. We have to go back to 2008. @HillaryClinton was ready for her coronation. Then something happened. #DNCLeak</p>

<p>Many saw this moment as the unwinding. @SenatorReid failed to deliver the state to Clinton in 2008. Not to be repeated. </p>

<p>So Clinton suffered a crushing defeat in 2008. But she learned a lesson, the system can be rigged. She learned that from @NVDems. #DNCLeak.</p>

<p>(I have to pause now. I’m back, let’s do this).</p>

<p>Clinton won the caucus but was outmaneuvered in delegates. It was the start of the end in ’08.</p>

<p>So, @HillaryClinton loses in 08. A crushing blow to the elite. But she gained Roby Mook.</p>

<p>Mook knows the keys to the primaries. The voter file. And so… the slow plan begins.</p>

<p>Clinton plays the long game building networks in state parties. Places @dwstweets at the DNC. This is crucial. (DWS replaces Tim Kaine)</p>

<p>So with advice from Mook (theory) @DWStweets pressure state parties to move to database systems. Most migrate to: @NGPVAN (See: DNC)</p>

<p>With @NGPVAN, @TheDemocrats now know everything about you. Combined with loose access to state voter files, you can target down to the house</p>

<p>STEAL AN ELECTION #DNCleak</p>

<p>How do I know? Because @NVDems was right in the middle of the battle. @ngpvan is not in Nevada as of 2012. It&#39;s fragmented.</p>

<p>Sorry, @clarkdems uses @NationBuilder</p>

<p>(here he posts a picture of @jgilliam which reads, “the first @nationbuilder martyr: NVDems bullied clarkdems to stop using nationbuilder. Christine resigns in protest)</p>

<p>From inside @nvdems (picture of an iPhone screen shot chat which reads: “VAN was 3 times the price of NationBuilder- they miraculously dropped the price to $200 a month.” Reply: “Wow,” Response: “Roberta told me she serves on the executive board but I could never independently (screen shot cut off here).</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget, we&#39;ve now installed @DWStweets to make sure the network now encompasses every democrat in the country.</p>

<p>So with threats, bullying and intimidation. @TheDemocrats now have the data they need to pull the strings.</p>

<p>Subsidized by the massive network, @NGPVAN could literally monopolize voter data.</p>

<p>So now. If you are @HillaryClinton and you have @NGPVAN - you know everything about every democrat. Including who WONT vote for you.</p>

<p>So how do you fix that? Simple. Vote Builder. A piece of software that can change the state voter file. And you do that with: @NGPVAN</p>

<p>See @Wikileaks for this.</p>

<p>My phone just got #DDOSd #dncleak</p>

<p>Please. You think I just have one phone at this point? #DNCleak</p>

<p>Back: phone 2 #dncleak</p>

<p>So you are @HillaryClinton and you start to lose to this guy</p>

<p>The first thing you do? Maybe create a fake opportunity to get the data and smear sanders</p>

<p>(Link to Dec. 18th article shot by Kristin Welker, headline, “Sanders staffers breached Clinton voter data.” Read: “After Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign was disciplined by the Democratic National Committee for improperly accessing the Hillary Clinton campaign’s proprietary voter database, the documents obtained and (pic cut off here))</p>

<p>That&#39;s right....@NGPVAN again.</p>

<p>But your efforts STILL DONT WORK! And @BernieSanders is pulling ahead. He&#39;s winning #DNCleak</p>

<p>And it all comes down to: Nevada.</p>

<p>I have to pause again. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll be back.</p>

<p>Ok. Back. We are in the homestretch now. #dncleak</p>

<p>Did I forget to mention. @NGPVAN allows parties to sell access to it? How much? A lot. From my own PRIMARY:</p>

<p>(screenshot of inbox, email reading: “Dan, attached, please find the 2016 VAN agreement for you to complete and return to us. $10,000 of the total $15,000 is payable prior to the Primary Election. If you advance to the General Election, this remaining $5,000 will be due (This information is included in the addendum in the attached agreement) [rest cut off])</p>

<p>So @TheDemocrats created a $machine that tracks you. And they sell you to the highest bidder. They know exactly who you will vote for.</p>

<p>Guess what it tags? Social media, contributions, rallies you attend.</p>

<p>So @TheDemocrats say &quot;there is no way you can have a targeted voter purge.&quot; I ran for congress. There is. #dncleak</p>

<p>So let&#39;s bring it home. Clinton is losing to Sanders. They call Nevada the firewall. The state that stops sanders.</p>

<p>(shows NYT article with headline, “Race in Nevada, Once A Hillary Clinton Firewall, is now Hotly Contested)</p>

<p>Mook meets with donors in New York. They freak. They say &quot;no more money.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is a big one. Polls. Internal. They say 70% of new registrations are for Sanders.</p>

<h1>dncleak Internal freak out memo:</h1>

<p>(Post to pic of memo which reads: “Urgent: Just saw some internals that strongly suggest 70-75% of new regs intend to vote for Sanders. Significant from these demos: </p>

<p>-Male: 18-35
-We expect more 25-35 y/o voters will vote in the caucus than in NV history
-Turnout above 90k will almost certainly mean a Sanders win</p>

<p>So pause. Let it sink in. If @Berniesanders wins Nevada. It’s over.</p>

<p>So how do you stop that? Roby Mook and the ground game.</p>

<p>Clinton learns her lesson from 2008. And now they have the data from @NGPVAN. Oh. And:</p>

<p>(picture of R. Lange)</p>

<p>And @SenatorReid
(picture of Reid)</p>

<p>And @Culinary226
(picture of flier which states, “it’s time to take back our congressional district, CD4.” There are 4 democrats running in the June primary. On February 4, you’ll vote to decide who your union supports. Your vote matters! Bring this leaflet with you to the meeting. Here are your choices [lists 4 candidates with bios: Lucy Flores, Susie Lee, John Ocequiera, Ruben Kihuen])</p>

<p>Having said that. I do have. Dun dun duuuuuuh. Texts from the caucus sites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part II:</p>

<p>So before caucus @Hillary Clinton team says, “whatever you can get away with just do it.” Links to YouTube video, headline, “Hidden cameras capture Clinton campaign staff in Nevada not only skirting…”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhI6bMbhsDE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhI6bMbhsDE</a></p>

<p>So if you need to steal an election. How do you do it? With @NGPVAN and @nvdems looking the other way.</p>

<p>You target at-large casino sites. And you cheat.
Links to YouTube video, headline, “Caught on Tape: Hillary Clinton supporters caught BREAKING the rules. This just happened at a caucus location in NV. Hillary supporters were not registering to caucus…”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ug9hHe_iZg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ug9hHe_iZg</a></p>

<p>(Post of iPhone chat image, which reads: “None of these people are registered and now they left the caucus site. Not one of these people stopped to register.”)</p>

<p>(Second post of iPhone chat image, which reads: “I’m not comfortable with that. We have examples of caucus sites that were not completed. Delegates were not elected.” Response: “We will correct later.”)</p>

<p>(Third post of iPhone chat image, which reads: “entered on site, into a phone.” Response: “It’s a tradition to make nominees non-voting guest delegates like they are one of us. There were some locations where you could not get into the reporting line. We were told to take our boxes in and the data would be entered.” Response: “Well as much as I can’t stand Ralston. You can look back at his reporting and see. Almost all caucus sites were 50:50. 45:45.”)</p>

<p>(Fourth post of iPhone chat image, which reads: “and Hillary Clinton listed as a delegate at state? Wtf?” Response: “All the data I saw as credentials looks like he could have won. There was no process where neutral third parties or both team observers watched the caucus box count.” Response: “right, and it was ultimately entered on site. Into a phone.”)</p>

<p>(Fifth post of some App chat, [possibly Periscope?] which reads: “It was amazing when a Sanders supporter said they were a delegate but were not on the NVDems prepared list they had a receipt. But Clinton people usually didn’t have receipts. I was supposed to report errors in verifying credentials to each campaign for their members. Team Sanders did a great job with their folks. Team Clinton acted like it was just owed to them. The final draw when they started asking for a special list of special friends to be added. I said no and looped back in the other campaign because if one campaign had a special list of friends then the other should get that one, too.”)</p>

<p>You also disqualify legit voters
(Facebook link post to video… which unsurprisingly gave me [transcriptionist] a message, “sorry, this content isn’t available at the moment.” The only hint I [transcriptionist] have is that it reads “demexittime” in link)
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/demexittime/videos/299722847058727/">https://www.facebook.com/demexittime/videos/299722847058727/</a></p>

<p>But none of this matters. Because @NVDems looked the other way. From a party official:
(shot from Google Drive, “But she was reported as the winner before anyone had time to actually report results the data didn’t matter.”)</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to summarize this in a periscope in a few minutes. #nvdemsleak #DNCLeak goodnight.</p>

At the end of the day the people benefiting from these illegal activities have insulated themselves from any wrong doing. Yes they rig votes and registration, among a vast amount of other things, but you will never, and I hope we finally do, see documentation that points directly to them. The Govt as a whole has perfected the strategy of deniability. </p>

<p>How the fuck can you honestly expect things to be done legally 
with how corrupt the FBI and other organizations are?</p>

<p>Not even Trump has the pair to give such an order.</p>

<p>At the debates Trump needs  to threaten Clinton to give up or else he would throw her daughter into jail for accessing top secret information on her server,and he would give her child up for adaptation to a conservative family. But Trump does not have a pair to do that.</p>

<p>The damn FBI director only has his job because of his ties to the Clinton foundation.
Do you think his pals at the FBI or at the CIA will really do an investigation on who created ISIS?</p>
