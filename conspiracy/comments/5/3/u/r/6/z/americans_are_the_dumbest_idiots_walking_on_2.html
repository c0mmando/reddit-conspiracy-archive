       In California, where I live, cold chicken is tax free, but the one from deli is taxed. In Arizona all food is taxed, but bottled drinks are not. In Iowa Big Mac is not taxed, Oregon and some other states don't have sales tax. It's from my experience. Wikipedia provides a better info, probably...

       There are plenty of charitable hospitals. If you are dropped off at a hospital in the US, they HAVE to do everything they humanely can to preserve your life. You're going to get a bill, but you will get the healthcare. As for education, no one is stopping your from educating your self, go to a damn library or now we have the internet... You don't need the state to do it for you. Stop making excuses in life.

       Government doesn't pay for it, people do. The government steals the money and distributes it (usually in a shitty, corrupt, and inefficient way). Why not cut the government out, and go to a charitable hospital were people actually donate to help others? You want to see what socialist healthcare is, go to Venezuela.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the rest of what you said, gee golly, doesn't that just seem like utopia of farts and lollipops. In reality we have examples of how socialized education and healthcare are an utter failure... Stop denying reality.

       Because it's an example of what it actually boils down to. People say for the government to get out of their bodies for abortion or bed room for gay rights, yet they welcome them into their doctors office, which in turn involves getting into their bodies?.... It's insanity. Letting the government dictate what kind of care you can or cannot receive is a very bad idea. Hence, my Venezuela example, or why people from socialist countries come to the US for the care they cannot receive in their own countries..

       Then go move to a socialist country, even though people from socialist countries tell people it fuckin' sucks... The majority here do not want that shit. Our country is on the wrong path (I agree - we need change), we just need to revert back to the Constitution and laws, not throw the baby out with the bath water, like socialists are trying to do.

       As far as healthcare and college goes?  As of right now Britain is having problems with long lines at hospitals and clinics, but that's because as of the past 5 or so years their healthcare hasn't seen the attention it deserves, another thing you can thank Blair for.  But lines aside, I've never met anyone from a European country or Australia that complained about their systems.  I dated an Australian several years ago and went to Australia to meet her family.  They think our healthcare system is a joke.  And compared to theirs, it is!  Their healthcare is leaps and bounds ahead of hours in ease of access and quality care.  Her mom had to have her hip replaced after a car accident.  It cat her $28, and that's only because she wanted cable in her hospital room.  And when she went to therapy they gave her these weird shoes that shifted their weight to make walking easier.  I've been a nurse for years and I know we don't have anything like that here.  And it's not like they are paying out the ass for it either.  America spends faaaaar more than any other country on healthcare.  We blow everyone else out of the water.  Back in the 90's the W.H.O. Did a study of all healthcare systems of every country.  Here's how much we spend compared to everyone else, and this study is more recent but compares a smaller data set, however the info still holds up:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       With all the ridiculous amounts of money we spend, you'd think our healthcare would be of rock star quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact it's an atrocity.  Look where we rank:

       37.  That's us.  Right between Costa Rica and Slovenia.  Do you understand that?  Costa Rica.  A fucking island nation.  Has better healthcare than us.  I'm fucking embarrassed!
      </h1>
      <p>
       Want to know what the top 5 all have in common?  Socialized medicine.  All of em.  Don't believe the lies fed to us by the media about our healthcare vs the rest of the worlds.  We pay far far more for a substantially inferior product.  It's sickening.  And the insurance companies want it this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think you never meet any French or British doctors?  It's because they get paid more over there and they're happy.  We get all these Indian doctors because they aren't paid enough.  They come here and take the jobs American doctors don't want.  But the  Danish, Swiss, Norwegian doctors stay over there because they don't have insurance companies coming between them getting paid and their system is just plain better.  We're being told how great our system is and people believe their lies because we Americans don't know any better.
