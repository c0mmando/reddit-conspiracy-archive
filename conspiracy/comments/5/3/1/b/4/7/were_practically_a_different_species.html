    <div class="md"><p>Say the earth is flat again after reading all this and watching the videos. Thank you for your time I am just trying to lead us back to what we once knew we were.</p>

<p>The earth is flat and here are the proof for anyone to look. It&#39;s flat or concave. I just argue the flat earth because it&#39;s easiest to smash this stupid sphere earth theory.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to copy paste this comment all over it is going to be the master comment of irrefutable proof.</p>

<p>Point 1. This video clearly shows that the sun is a spotlight that spins around the earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_9cFTQg7NE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_9cFTQg7NE</a></p>

<p>If the sun was farther away than they claim this would not happen and the sun would set how you previously thought it did. AKA the sun does not get any smaller and it falls right over the edge of the earth.</p>

<p>Point 2. You can clearly see in pictures that the clouds go behind the sun and the moon. Do a google search look around and use your senses. Here are 2 videos proving the case.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khlU0BDlc9I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khlU0BDlc9I</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXaDP1XOoek">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXaDP1XOoek</a></p>

<p>Point 3. When you go higher and higher in the air the horizon always stays at eye level. That means as you go higher up your point of view goes farther and farther revealing more land and never making you look down. IF the earth was a sphere you would have to. Since it is always at eye level the earth is flat or concave. This argument is for flat but I do agree concave earth could also be possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFj7_1HhiSI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFj7_1HhiSI</a></p>

<p>Point 4. If we live on a sphere then there would always be an equal and opposite amount of sunlight 6 months apart. There is no other possible circumstance. If you have a ball spinning around the ball would have to always have an opposite amount of sunlight. Take the north pole for example that you can see the sun for 24 hours some parts of the year. Yet there is no opposite where there is no sunlight for 24 hours a year. Therefore it is not a ball because there is no opposite. I must remind you it would be impossible to not have the reverse effect because while the north pole sees sun the south pole won&#39;t. Next the south pole should see 24 hours sunlight and the north pole should see none. That is not the case because the earth is flat.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve broken down literally numerous holes in the sphere earth theory you can look at this documentary that will open your eyes to the real world we live in.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHkiZNT3cyE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHkiZNT3cyE</a></p>

<p>Watch all videos and do not dispute anything I have said by bringing up facts about stars, do not bring up fake CGI photos, do not bring up untrue information about the sun and the earth. I hope this has been extremely eye opening because what has been seen cannot be unseen.</p>

<p>I am obviously paid off because I have found the proofs needed to smash the sphere earth belief? lol. I am a person who stands in the light of truth and wishes to spread it. Stop saying I&#39;m this or I&#39;m that and listen to me. The evidence you are looking at is so much. Go outside and look at the clouds in the sky, do you see the clouds curving around the land? No.</p>

<p>Edit: Down votes don&#39;t prove anything. Do you think I am expecting up votes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bringing up facts about lights in the sky doesn&#39;t prove anything. The examples I&#39;m using are perfect real world examples we can easily prove. Everything you say about stars is speculative. You don&#39;t know how far away they are, you don&#39;t know how big they are, you don&#39;t know how they are made, you don&#39;t know anything about them so stop pretending you do. You guys live in fucking fairy land where you are told something and live by it as if it&#39;s the truth. Stay in fairyland idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, how about the last part about clouds. Have you ever drawn clouds before? Have you ever noticed that at a certain point, the bottoms of the clouds seem to become flat and get lower and lower til they pass the horizon?</p>

<p>Never... once.... thought about why that is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it&#39;s because just like as we go higher we can see more horizon. We can only see so far until eventually it becomes so small we can&#39;t see it anymore. And yes just like anything else the farther something gets away the lower and lower it gets to our eyes. The bottom of clouds are flat whoopie fucking doo. Doesn&#39;t prove anything. Clouds go farther and farther away and become smaller and smaller until they are so small they are out of our sight. The bottom of clouds are all flat because the bottom of clouds are all flat. You never see clouds curving around anything they are flat just like the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just explained it to you you&#39;re just too dense. Clouds don&#39;t curve, what the hell do you think it would look like on a flat earth. ROFL, how can you say I haven&#39;t thought about it when I believed the sphere for 90% of my life. You main stream people are so indoctrinated it&#39;s laughable. like literally what the fuck do you think it would look like on a flat earth????????????????? answer it because there is no answer other than what you are looking at right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the flat Earth stuff, I really do.
Looking at Saturn, it is clearly a ball with a tilted ring around it, and the Moon is at the very least a semi-sphere due to its phases. Jupiter&#39;s moons always look full-round, like spheres, unless this appearance is due to the &quot;discs&quot; always facing Earth...</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know what we are looking at when we look up. For all we know we are looking at very small &quot;planets&quot; that are not millions of kilometers away but only thousands. If those planets were only 4000 KM away they would be puny and the whole idea of planets would vanish and be replaced with something else. I think it&#39;s something up there but it&#39;s nothing we can live on. People used to study the stars to know events in real time. I would say that&#39;s what it&#39;s used for. UFO&#39;s are real, we can see video&#39;s of them all the time. Our government is in control of those UFO&#39;s. Maybe they are floating balls of something we don&#39;t know how advanced technology can really get. Anti gravity is real. Maybe Saturn is playing a frequency across the whole world and that&#39;s how the ring is created. It would also explain the hexagon on it&#39;s pole. </p>

<p>The moon is something but for all we know they are just discs projecting light. The moon gives off a light and it isn&#39;t created by reflecting the The sun is a light and the moon is a different sort of light. They are 2-4k kilometers away maximum. They aren&#39;t planets stop pretending other planets like earth exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indubitably.  In fact I&#39;m glad you brought up the focault pendulum. </p>

<p>Do you have any speculation as to why the focault pendulum would behave differently during a solar eclipse?  If the pendulum is demonstrating the rotation of the earth, then why would it make a difference if there was an eclipse or not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[Maurice Allais states that the eclipse effect is related to a gravitational anomaly, that is inexplicable in the framework of the currently admitted theory of gravitation, without giving any explanation of his own.[12] Allais’s explanation for another anomaly (the lunisolar periodicity in variations of the azimuth of a pendulum) is that space evinces certain anisotropic characteristics, which he ascribes to motion through an aether which is partially entrained by planetary bodies. He has presented this hypothesis in his 1997 book L’Anisotropie de l’espace. This explanation has not gained significant traction amongst mainstream scientists.</p>

<p>After analysis of Foucault pendulum data during the solar eclipse of July 11, 1991, L. Savrov suggested that the &quot;pendulum responded to the remanent shock wave at the maximum of the total eclipse phase&quot;](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_effect">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_effect</a>)</p>

Looking at Saturn, it is clearly a ball with a tilted ring around it, and the Moon is at the very least a semi-sphere due to its phases. Jupiter&#39;s moons always look full-round, like spheres, unless this appearance is due to the &quot;discs&quot; always facing Earth...</p>
