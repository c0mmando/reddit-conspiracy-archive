        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s get the &quot;Correct The Record&quot; comment questions out of the way. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Let&#39;s assume that &quot;the nurse&quot; assigned to her for the fact that HRC was diagnosed with pneumonia was not concerned with HRC&#39;s hydration that morning - even though the only real treatment she should be watching over is Clinton&#39;s hydration. </p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s say that HRC also made clear that despite feeling faint, she was not to take the nurses&#39;s orders and sit down upon feeling faint and elevate her legs above head to not cause a scene to lower her chances of Syncope</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s say that even though dehydration syncope begins with a serious migrane level  headache (especially when sick ) HRC was about to &quot;power through&quot;  it /  the man video taping her never got footage of Clinton holding onto her head prior. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The common practice of a dehydrated patient would be to get an IV into them ASAP.  Dehydration and Fainting happen all the time. Probably 10% of all ER visits are from people feeling faint or have actually fainted. </p>

<p>If the claim is that Clinton fainted from dehydration of pneumonia. . </p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that in the rare case of HRC fainting there was an IV at Chelsea&#39;s apartment... because &quot;government&quot;.    </p>

<p>Post fainting you want to look at the heart rate &amp; blood pressure of the subject very carefully.  Before you allow them to leave your care, you have to make sure both are perfect because they rarely go back to normal after fainting. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a 0% chance Clinton would be able to go back to fully hydrated.  You&#39;re going to want to do 2 rounds of IVs.  The first would be .5 to 1 hour with a relatively fast drip rate. The second would take anywhere between 2.5-5 hours.  With likely bathroom breaks in between.   </p>

<p>I could give you the top medical staff in the NFL , NBA, Air Force Medical and they wouldn&#39;t be able to rehydrate HRC ( and put her exact same outfit back on ) within the time frame of that situation.  </p>

<p>Take into count that at the fastest rate, HRC wouldn&#39;t get to Chelsea&#39;s house for 1/2 an hour even with a Police Escort.  So by the time she got back outside from Chelsea&#39;s apartment for the photo op means that unless there was massive malpractice there is no chance HRC would have been allowed outside after the first round of IV due to the fact that she could have easily stumbled / fainted again AFTER it ( no one would risk it). </p>

<p>Here&#39;s more info for anyone interested : </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget that HRC could have gotten a DIVTr, which is a dual IV transfusion at the time. Basically, it&#39;s where one arm gets the hydration IV pushed into her system and the other arm gets O2 saturated blood that&#39;s transfused into her at the same time. This technique has been used for years to boost patients and is similar to what Lance Armstrong was using to gain performance points in his races. </p>

<p>I highly doubt that HRC&#39;s physicians aren&#39;t utilizing a similar method in order to get her back up and on her feet whenever her underlying illness drags her down. The effects are very positive but unfortunately not long lasting as everyone in the mainstream media began to see them wear off after 90 minutes of her meeting with the families. It&#39;s also why we saw her bounce back up later when she met with people outside of Chelsea&#39;s apartment. Why the media isn&#39;t pursuing this is beyond me. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s an unknown procedure, but being a wealthy politician clearly allows a level of secrecy that the common man can&#39;t obtain. Pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am more than a touch curious myself. </p>

<p>Where does the blood come from for someone like Hillary if indeed she is getting that transfusion? How long is donated blood good for before they throw it away, or do they just reuse her blood? Seems like she would need a regular, plentiful source of blood almost on demand. These procedures don&#39;t seem to last long, and she needs many of them to keep up on the campaign trail. Very morbid.</p>

<p>I might be wrong but does it not have to stay cold and fresh to be usable? She doesnt, really have that much to give herself. Where does the rest come from? Are the begging blood banks supplying the soulsucker class with our life force?  Anybody in the oh so wobbly aether have anything on the source? My thinking got dark here.</p>

This is more like seeing real life karma at work. 
I hope every single person that took part in the fraud got paid well. Something about the laws of karma. You can always tell how good any leak is by how long it takes to get noticed. And talked about. Once enough people talk it is no hole. But it sure does look very hollow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can confirm some of this.  </p>

<p>I became severely dehydrated when prepping for a colonoscopy, not only because I wasn&#39;t allowed to drink anything, but because the prep gives you severe diarrhea until your colon is clean as a whistle.  </p>

<p>I developed a terrible migraine on the drive home and asked my friend to pull over.  I got out, feeling like I was about to vomit, but instead fainted.  Medics arrived and first thing put a huge needle into my arm to start re-hydrating me.</p>

<p>Sometimes in forming an argument, you start by <em>assuming</em> something that you are actually trying to disprove, in order to find a logical contradiction - as in this article here.  There&#39;s even a name for this form of reasoning - it&#39;s <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> - and it&#39;s perfectly logically valid, and used all the time in mathematics.</p>
