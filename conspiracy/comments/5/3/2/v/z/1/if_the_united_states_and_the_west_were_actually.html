<p>It&#39;s a structural problem (i.e. centralized hierarchy) which simultaneously enables and compels them, both individually and as a group dynamic, to cause the problems they do.

    <div class="md"><p>Who is a dictator? Assad? You do realize that Assad is more popular in Syria than any President has ever been in America, right? You do know that he is beloved by his people, and that there is no civil war, right? That it is a proxy war funded by America and Israel and Britain, right? Because when you call him a dictator, my mind automatically ignores everything else you say because I know that you are an idiot, and that you have not done your research. Assuming of course you were talking about Syria, maybe you were talking about Libya? In which case, neither was Gaddafi, in fact, Gaddafi was about to release a pan-African currency backed by GOLD and he was going to nationalize his oil to help his people! That is, of course, before we Americans illegally entered his country under false pretenses, and literally assassinated him, and then had his body mutilated on the streets for all to see. That was a message. A message to Assad, and to any other leaders planning on fucking over the Dollar. That is what you get for trying to help your people, so you fucking Trump fans who I see all over this sub who shit all over the Middle East, HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO MODERNIZE WHEN THE CIA WON&#39;T LET THEM???? Does that sound like something a <em>dictator</em> would do to you? Because it doesn&#39;t to me. Take your head out of your ass, and turn off your television, your upper lip will thank you.</p>
