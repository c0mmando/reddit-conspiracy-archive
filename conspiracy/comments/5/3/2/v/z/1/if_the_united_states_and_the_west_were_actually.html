       Yes, but libraries and universities that really do function as educational institutions that foster critical thinking and examine alternative views to neoliberalism rather than, by a substantial degree, reinforce the dominant system. That would go a long way in helping the general public to examine their state-of-affairs both critically and objectively.

       I find it insufficient as it doesn't address the structures of power themselves, which enables the behavior of plutocrats and oligarchs. A common thing that could be noted of so-called "CT's" (for lack of a better term) is their seeming emphasis on the people in power and less on the structures of power themselves (which are in constant state of development). Suppose the "top cabal" were removed. What would be the next move to keep another "cabal" from replacing them?

       Someone mentioned recently a study about a troup of chimps.  The most dominant and violent members had access to meat because they beat the others back.  The meat was tainted so the most dominant and violent member died.

       They were not replaced, and the troop lived a peaceful existence afterwards.

       The so-called "1%" as opposed to us, the so-called "99%." Through workers' self-management the 99% (via cooperatives or union enterprises) could manage much of its economic affairs. If they so desired they could even use alternative currencies like Ithaca Hours for example.

       <em>
        self-management
       </em>
       it's meant that we the ordinary people can manage our own affairs quite well autonomously. Of course history shows that dominant interests will fight against that. That's what the Spanish Civil War and many other conflicts were about. Self-management by the working class was briefly achieved on a wide scale but was crushed in a few short years.

       It's a structural problem (i.e. centralized hierarchy) which simultaneously enables and compels them, both individually and as a group dynamic, to cause the problems they do. That's why decentralized, horizontal direct democracy is a good thing. It's less alienating as it puts everyone on a more equitable footing.

       That is a dumb statement. Wasting money on defense? Do you hear yourself? The biggest thing we spend money on is Medicaid and Social Security. If people want free things, why don't they ask Sweden?

       'Love freedom and  (mock) democracy or I'll kill you'. is the psychopathic leadership's message.

      <p>
       Most of us don't even know what freedom is, so we have no idea whether we have it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Freedom is freedom from government intrusion into our personal lives. We once had a little but that's long gone.

       There is no trace of democracy in the U.S except the vote, and that's rigged.

       Ah yes, lets build libraries so the secret police can arrest anybody borrowing a book, detaining everybody visiting websites criticizing the regime and for them to have a bonfire with all the books not acknowledging the supreme leader as god himself.

       Who is a dictator? Assad? You do realize that Assad is more popular in Syria than any President has ever been in America, right? You do know that he is beloved by his people, and that there is no civil war, right? That it is a proxy war funded by America and Israel and Britain, right? Because when you call him a dictator, my mind automatically ignores everything else you say because I know that you are an idiot, and that you have not done your research. Assuming of course you were talking about Syria, maybe you were talking about Libya? In which case, neither was Gaddafi, in fact, Gaddafi was about to release a pan-African currency backed by GOLD and he was going to nationalize his oil to help his people! That is, of course, before we Americans illegally entered his country under false pretenses, and literally assassinated him, and then had his body mutilated on the streets for all to see. That was a message. A message to Assad, and to any other leaders planning on fucking over the Dollar. That is what you get for trying to help your people, so you fucking Trump fans who I see all over this sub who shit all over the Middle East, HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO MODERNIZE WHEN THE CIA WON'T LET THEM???? Does that sound like something a
       <em>
        dictator
       </em>
       would do to you? Because it doesn't to me. Take your head out of your ass, and turn off your television, your upper lip will thank you.

       What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
