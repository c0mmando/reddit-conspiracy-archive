    <div class="md"><p>Actually no I am free just like others I don&#39;t need to follow commandments like all you bible thumpers. If you all read the bible wrong and then reassure each other you&#39;re reading it right you&#39;d think so. You all have Karma because what I am saying is the truth. It&#39;s sad because you read the bible and are so far from it you think it&#39;s a lie. </p>

<p>Nothing in the world changes</p>

<p>A) We live in a concave universe and it&#39;s undeniable once you understand the flaws in the heliocentric model.</p>

<p>B) Natural law governs the universe but getting beat down for speaking the truth does not mean &quot;you lied again&quot; you guys are pitiful.</p>

<p>C) I do whatever the hell I want because I stand in truth every day it doesn&#39;t matter what you guys think is the truth because I KNOW it&#39;s the truth you guys are just too fucking brain washed to see it, one day jesus will be back and he will tell you I am right. You read the bible wrong jesus is telling you how to act to raise your vibration, jesus is telling you what he knows so that you can enter the kingdom of heaven. You guys obviously do not listen to what he says because when I read the bible he makes that extremely clear.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simple as fuck the truth is literally so simple except they don&#39;t let it get pushed out that we all live within God. </p>

<p>edit: I&#39;ll even add in an edit because I have more to say about you dumb ass people. I am sure you have never read the book of enoch I am sure you haven&#39;t read the emerald tablets? I am sure you have never read an older version of the bible, I&#39;m sure you haven&#39;t figured out every sacred text is written by a different son of God but Jesus&#39; is different because he is a perfect soul and God is going to reincarnate him. Your view of the world is not broad at all. I have read literature of all the greats, Hitler, Tesla, natural healers, I see through the lies perpetuated through history, you guys fail to. You don&#39;t understand the power of God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t matter. That&#39;s how you get to him. Once you find him he doesn&#39;t give a shit. I could live in God land forever don&#39;t worry. I have that shit mapped. God is the spirit and Satan is the material. I have lived in God long enough to see that I need a little material in my world. God owns me but that doesn&#39;t mean I need to shove away Satan. The problem is getting into Satan before you know God. Satan is the material world and if you let the material conquer your mind you will be unhappy. God already saved me and I will never lose him, ever. Doesn&#39;t matter what I do. Getting money and doing whatever it takes is just the name of the game. You are perceiving the bible how churches teach, it&#39;s wrong sorry. I love my neighbors and forgive all, even those who have wronged me. There is nothing anyone could say to knock me off because what I know is too pure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go ahead try to prove anything wrong. I&#39;ll even make it real simple how you get to the father. </p>

<p>Here are the 7 natural laws. </p>

<p><a href="https://gittefalkenberg.wordpress.com/2010/02/28/the-7-natural-laws-of-the-universe/">https://gittefalkenberg.wordpress.com/2010/02/28/the-7-natural-laws-of-the-universe/</a></p>

<p>Everything vibrates.</p>

<p>God vibrates the fastest in the universe and is all knowing. The higher and more positive you get the closer.</p>

<p>First of all have good thoughts because your thoughts vibrate.</p>

<p>Second of all eat good healthy foods because your food affects your beings vibration too.</p>

<p>third of all treat everyone around you as great as you can.</p>

<p>fourth of all search for truth and start to realize the illusion.</p>

<p>People here think I&#39;m nuts yet I know I&#39;ve came to all the same conclusions as Jesus.</p>

<p>The earth is concave, easily provable it&#39;s not a sphere. <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/old-concave-earth-theory/">http://www.wildheretic.com/old-concave-earth-theory/</a></p>

<p>Be a positive being and you get saved from the Satan mentality and get God into your mind. He starts in your heart but will take over if you let him. Once you let him and follow your instincts you&#39;ll come to the exact same revelations as me. I can tell you this stuff but until you realize you won&#39;t see how everything is a mind game. The trick is to make the mind above the world where it belongs and know you are an immortal being.</p>

<p>Argue it I don&#39;t care that&#39;s the truth and there are no holes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, you&#39;ve already reached your conclusion, so why bother? Why bother with the notion that what we perceive to know and understand is a speck of sand on a planet made of sand of an incomparable size. Knowledge is the only true measure of time, from the dawn of thought, awareness, consciousness til the &#39;End&#39; the only way to measure is through what is learned personally and around the world. Even now we&#39;re all so limited and so utterly inconceivably enormously far from God&#39;s understanding/knowledge/concepts/reality/everything. trying to compare God to yourself or any of us wouldn&#39;t even compare to an ant&#39;s understanding of humans, it would be vastly under representing of how far we are from God and what we are now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans go through cycles. We are currently at the last stage before the golden age where all is revealed. I know it because I wouldn&#39;t know this information otherwise at such a young age. We are not ants every single one of us is extremely important. We live in a concave earth, we aren&#39;t a speck of dirt in space we are the only thing there is. We are extremely far from God, as far as you can get actually. God lives inside all of us I am not comparing myself to God god is me and I am him. </p>
