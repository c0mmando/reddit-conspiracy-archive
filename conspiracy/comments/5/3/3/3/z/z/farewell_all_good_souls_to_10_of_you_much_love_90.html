       You've broken several commandments here, so I think you best be on your way now so you can pray hard or do whatever it is you do, freak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you still here?  You lied yet again, and assume to know the will of god, pass judgement on others, etc etc.  People like yourself turn many against faith with your utter hypocrisy and holier than though bullshit.

       Actually no I am free just like others I don't need to follow commandments like all you bible thumpers. If you all read the bible wrong and then reassure each other you're reading it right you'd think so. You all have Karma because what I am saying is the truth. It's sad because you read the bible and are so far from it you think it's a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in the world changes
      </p>
      <p>
       A) We live in a concave universe and it's undeniable once you understand the flaws in the heliocentric model.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Natural law governs the universe but getting beat down for speaking the truth does not mean "you lied again" you guys are pitiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) I do whatever the hell I want because I stand in truth every day it doesn't matter what you guys think is the truth because I KNOW it's the truth you guys are just too fucking brain washed to see it, one day jesus will be back and he will tell you I am right. You read the bible wrong jesus is telling you how to act to raise your vibration, jesus is telling you what he knows so that you can enter the kingdom of heaven. You guys obviously do not listen to what he says because when I read the bible he makes that extremely clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's simple as fuck the truth is literally so simple except they don't let it get pushed out that we all live within God.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: I'll even add in an edit because I have more to say about you dumb ass people. I am sure you have never read the book of enoch I am sure you haven't read the emerald tablets? I am sure you have never read an older version of the bible, I'm sure you haven't figured out every sacred text is written by a different son of God but Jesus' is different because he is a perfect soul and God is going to reincarnate him. Your view of the world is not broad at all. I have read literature of all the greats, Hitler, Tesla, natural healers, I see through the lies perpetuated through history, you guys fail to. You don't understand the power of God.

       lol. I literally believe in all possibility, treating everyone the way they want to be treated and peace among humanity. How about you??? I have to smash these shitty held beliefs to get people there and since even when I fight it with numerous facts proving the sphere earth is a load of shit people don't even watch the videos or read it. So it's all the proof you need I am not the one with my head up my ass. I looked around and saw clearly that 99% of the population lives with their head up their ass.

       It lines up with everything I say and when the spirit lives in you you read things differently. You reading the bible is a lot different than me reading the bible which is why I have come to all the revelations. I only read in the bible what is drawn to me, understand? God lives in us he brings you wherever he wants if you just follow life and don't give in.

       You're dumb Satan lives in lower density where you guys live. Get to the higher mind and you don't want anything this world has to offer. The devil isn't coming you guys are already consumed by him. The battles been on going forever the good team just hasn't decided to show up until recently. Take the precious souls of humanity you guys are brain washed heaven and hell is on earth not when you die.

       Heaven and hell are both on earth it's how you perceive the world. You have a lot to learn. You have been taught by church your beliefs. I am here and I am now. I am the cavalry this world is getting. You guys don't understand yet but one day this world will be left in turmoil and I will still have all the answers. The world can't kill me. I got taken to all the places where you learn and didn't go to places like church where they have people who are paid to tell you lies.

       Satan is the material world. If you aren't grounded in god he'll pull you down to his level. It's worked because although you guys can't see there is actually a level of reality above where you are completely free from suffering of any sort. Free from any questions about the world free from everything. The only thing with getting there is figuring out what you want. Really hard once you've already decided nothing really matters.

       Yes just like others I got PM'd from the gov the other day being told to cease and desist so you can say it's nonsense or whatever. I deleted my old account because I was ordered to. Whether it was a random or not idk but I'd bet it was actually them because the government makes 50% of reddit accounts. I won't be coming back because I think it's becoming crime to talk about what I know. I'd prefer to be free and sit on the knowledge. As a farewell I have left the keys to finding God.

       I appreciate you.. love of God and Jesus, however let me point something out to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark 12:30-31New International Version (NIV)
30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’[a] 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] There is no commandment greater than these.”
      </p>
      <p>
       so.. yeah. Think about what you're saying/doing and realize Loving your neighbor, no matter what, is the key, Love God, Love yourself as God loves you, and love your neighbors as you love yourself, as God would love you both.

       Doesn't matter. That's how you get to him. Once you find him he doesn't give a shit. I could live in God land forever don't worry. I have that shit mapped. God is the spirit and Satan is the material. I have lived in God long enough to see that I need a little material in my world. God owns me but that doesn't mean I need to shove away Satan. The problem is getting into Satan before you know God. Satan is the material world and if you let the material conquer your mind you will be unhappy. God already saved me and I will never lose him, ever. Doesn't matter what I do. Getting money and doing whatever it takes is just the name of the game. You are perceiving the bible how churches teach, it's wrong sorry. I love my neighbors and forgive all, even those who have wronged me. There is nothing anyone could say to knock me off because what I know is too pure.

       Everything vibrates.
      </p>
      <p>
       God vibrates the fastest in the universe and is all knowing. The higher and more positive you get the closer.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all have good thoughts because your thoughts vibrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all eat good healthy foods because your food affects your beings vibration too.
      </p>
      <p>
       third of all treat everyone around you as great as you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       fourth of all search for truth and start to realize the illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       People here think I'm nuts yet I know I've came to all the same conclusions as Jesus.

       Be a positive being and you get saved from the Satan mentality and get God into your mind. He starts in your heart but will take over if you let him. Once you let him and follow your instincts you'll come to the exact same revelations as me. I can tell you this stuff but until you realize you won't see how everything is a mind game. The trick is to make the mind above the world where it belongs and know you are an immortal being.

       Argue it I don't care that's the truth and there are no holes.

       See, you've already reached your conclusion, so why bother? Why bother with the notion that what we perceive to know and understand is a speck of sand on a planet made of sand of an incomparable size. Knowledge is the only true measure of time, from the dawn of thought, awareness, consciousness til the 'End' the only way to measure is through what is learned personally and around the world. Even now we're all so limited and so utterly inconceivably enormously far from God's understanding/knowledge/concepts/reality/everything. trying to compare God to yourself or any of us wouldn't even compare to an ant's understanding of humans, it would be vastly under representing of how far we are from God and what we are now.

       Humans go through cycles. We are currently at the last stage before the golden age where all is revealed. I know it because I wouldn't know this information otherwise at such a young age. We are not ants every single one of us is extremely important. We live in a concave earth, we aren't a speck of dirt in space we are the only thing there is. We are extremely far from God, as far as you can get actually. God lives inside all of us I am not comparing myself to God god is me and I am him.
