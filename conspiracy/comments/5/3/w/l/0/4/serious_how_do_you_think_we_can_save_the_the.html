       Our technology will either empower us or enslave us. We need to make sure it is the former.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to get rid of trust, it is a thing of the past. Decentralization by means of peer-to-peer networks can enable everything from sound money to fair voting. I imagine a society where one can make a living just by voting on matters of the world, and where each individual is irrefutably held to their obligations by a transparent, pseudonymous ledger of accounts where all significant actions can be automatically rewarded or penalized. The world has never been a fair place, but that could change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: To add, being tracked in our current society is a risk to our privacy and unjust, because those who are tracking us are not obliged to be held accountable to the same standards themselves. If everyone was on the same playing field, all being tracked pseudonymously, and all being held accountable in a mathematically irrefutable and trustless way, tracking would be a great thing.

       Upvoted because I like the discussion, but we cannot forget that the ledger
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       tracking, though. We can say it's anonymous, but it can always be de-anonymized (which is the core privacy issue with Bitcoin vs. cash, IMHO).

       That's why I used the word pseudonymous. You may be able to look at a ledger and see that an individual did not hold up to an obligation, but this doesn't mean you will be able to tie a person to that identifier on that ledger, only the person who generated that identifier, or the people he's disclosed this identifier to will know it was him. There's no reason that a person could not assume multiple identifiers to maintain his privacy, if he is contributing to the society he will be rewarded no matter what identifier he generates, as he will cryptographically control the private keys to these identifiers.

       Depending on the ledger, though, you can de-anonymize. Bitcoin's a great example of this. In a situation where everyone takes it, I pay bitcoin at the local bar. How many people do this? How many people do this and also buy a comic book? Sure, I can change my identifier every time, but will I? Can I? That you use he/him to describe the transactions indicates that you need to think about it more deeply.

       The issue is here is it's not a closed loop. The reason you can be identified is because you first have to buy the (Bitcoin in this case) with fiat which normally requires KYC/AML procedures, unless you pay the higher fees for more anonymous methods like cash vending machines. So, since you are registered to the exchange with your identity tied to that identifier (address), it can be linked to you. However, as soon as you send the Bitcoin to another wallet address free of any KYC/AML tied identity, you now have plausible deniability, that address could belong to anyone, or even no one.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course you can change your identifier every time, some wallets even support this, you don't have to put any work into it all, it automatically does it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm getting at here is a bigger picture, a closed loop where there is no need to convert fiat to a cryptocurrency, as the cryptocurrency already runs the world, there is no need for KYC/AML because the entire system is now trustless.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't understand what I'm saying I encourage you to do some more research on blockchains and think about it more deeply.

       You didn't offend me in the least, I'm not sure why you'd get that from my previous comment - but you may have missed my point there about it. When developing a technology, we need to think about all users and its corruption and how it can be corrupted. User could be female, or a whistleblower or an activist, or all three - how does the system protect that user against an attacker or the State or another attacking State?
      </p>

       There's a reason intelligence agencies lurve bitcoin. Think about it for just a little bit, and you'll understand what I'm trying to convey without facilely flipping it to me being offended about something.

       I see what you're saying, and as long as the phony fiat system exists, and the shadow government, then yes, Bitcoin in particular is easy to trace if the Bitcoin user does not know what they are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not advocating for Bitcoin, actually I'd rather see it be replaced by another cryptocurrency with built in scalability and a mining algorithm that is suitable for a more even and decentralized distribution of hash power.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm trying to get at is a future, likely far from now, maybe not in my lifetime, where there is NO state. There is no need for one. There is no need for leaders, only action. Yes I know this sounds like some NWO shit, and maybe it is, but not how you think. The technology governs the world through the actions of the people, there is no need to trust any leader as anyone can vote on any matter. Anyone can put down collateral for a contract and if the criteria is met for it to be satisfied, they are rewarded, if not they lose the collateral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, this isn't going to happen quickly, there first must be a huge catalyst to bring down the current system, or else we will slowly rot away and destroy our planet.

       I just wish there was some way to make it fully anonymous. But it's funny, when you think about it - you want those in power accountable, and those with less power free. How do you reconcile that? And how do you create a cryptocurrency that doesn't put its users in thrall to everyone else?

       Right, that is the tough part. In order for that to happen the entire system would have to crumble, the fiat paper would have to lose all value other than what it's worth for toilet paper. The question is, could we as a society survive that, and from there implement a fair system? We'll probably never know in our lifetime, but it is crazy to think about.

       Even if fiat paper is gone, we still have the essential human problems. I think they're solvable, I just worry that these problems aren't evident to those developing.

       At the same time, in the near-term, we are completely dependent on digital currency - and it's all eminently trackable. I really think a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       take off, but we need to find a way to ensure it's ubiquitous, easy for anyone to use, and
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       protects privacy - and that's really, really hard to do. We know that governments will invest in tech that protects privacy in a way that still allows them access; we know that VCs will invest in tech that...allows them to make money, which often requires government buy-in. I don't know. I wish I had more solutions than bulwarks.

       Honestly, we need to rehash the system we call 'money'. The people on top who control more than their fair portion ad that's why it cannot be currently done. I understand people live and died for money but its initial purpose is motivation buy if we can create a system where everyone gets everything they'll need in their life, we can get the motivation from more people than we think... There will always be busywork so EVERYONE could have a job and they wont be as hard and stupid because that was the past. We are already automating jobs &amp; positions. It will make America 'a thing' again

       This is going to sound facile, but I swear, we're at the stupid point in our society that it just might work: NFL players need to boycott games. Awaken the sleepers. The pyramid keeps getting flashed to us for a reason - there's power at the bottom, we just have to avoid the higher levels' constant attempts to divide us.

       It's sad, but it's all they fucking whine about, so it seems to me that Football Lysistrata might be the only thing to break through. Also, can you imagine, we're at a point where three people are shot by police a day. Say: No more people shot by police or no more football. "Goddamnit, Tom, why'd you shoot that guy? No party at my place Sunday! Enjoy your murdercation

       at this point; it seems it is going to have to get worse before it gets better. the oppressors of today are protected with their status and infrastructure, just like the oppressors throughout history. like history has taught us, something needs to happen to render that status and infrastructure meaningless.

       I see what you're saying, and as long as the phony fiat system exists, and the shadow government, then yes, Bitcoin in particular is easy to trace if the Bitcoin user does not know what they are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not advocating for Bitcoin, actually I'd rather see it be replaced by another cryptocurrency with built in scalability and a mining algorithm that is suitable for a more even and decentralized distribution of hash power.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm trying to get at is a future, likely far from now, maybe not in my lifetime, where there is NO state. There is no need for one. There is no need for leaders, only action. Yes I know this sounds like some NWO shit, and maybe it is, but not how you think. The technology governs the world through the actions of the people, there is no need to trust any leader as anyone can vote on any matter. Anyone can put down collateral for a contract and if the criteria is met for it to be satisfied, they are rewarded, if not they lose the collateral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, this isn't going to happen quickly, there first must be a huge catalyst to bring down the current system, or else we will slowly rot away and destroy our planet.
