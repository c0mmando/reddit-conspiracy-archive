       Many of us are aware of how the federal Reserve operates, and imo it is the biggest scam in operation in the world. On Wednesday, there is an estimated 20% chance they will increase the interest rates to banks, effectively reducing the monetary supply. This deflation has historically caused major drops in stocks and depressions. Of course the rich get richer as we lose our homes and jobs, but what is in store for us tomorrow?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton is in a large part financially backed by the privileged few Wall Street lords who are calling the shots. Is it a delay for after the elections or a problem_solution for tomorrow?

       It's the rate at which banks loan money from their regional FED banks.. Local banks will typically increase their rates for loans to cover the additional costs.. (Pass the hike on to you).. Higher rates also means your local bank is less likely to lend money out, decreasing the money supply.. Therefore the average consumer has less money to spend.. But a decreased money supply can be somewhat good for consumer, prices at the grocer and gas tend to go down as demand decreases due to less money in people's pockets

       It's almost smoke and mirrors. Our money is backed by the fact that the US federal government and the USA are huge, wealthy, and not going to get crushed by a foreign invader or overthrown in a rebellion anytime soon. Could it happen? Yes. Will it? Probably not. So people have faith in the currency. Whereas before 1973 people only had to have faith in gold and silver. That's one of the reasons why the British Pound Sterling stayed strong in the face of seemingly imminent German invasion during WW2 (most of the gold and silver was moved to the US and Canada).

       Is this really fact? I wonder. There are cities/counties (Detroit, San Bernardino, Jefferson County Alabama) and

       that have either declared bankruptcy outright, or have been declared insoilvent... I wonder. Smoke and mirrors indeed.

       What are you implying? When I say wealthy, I mean that the federal government has material wealth. I.e. things that people value, like military hardware, nukes, real estate, buildings, vehicles, etc. State governments and city governments usually do not have anything close to that level of wealth. They also can't do a QE to bail themselves out. There's definitely a smoke and mirrors element to it but people really aren't that dumb. We (the world economy) have managed to make it 40 years because people still believe in the stability of America.

       I'm implying, as I thought you did, that the real status of the U.S.A. (united
       <em>
        states
       </em>
       of america) is vastly underfunded for its reputation. The federal gov has siphoned much of the state's wealth for its own devices.

       The bottom hasn't fallen out. Yet. I was implying more that private industry and citizens hold considerable wealth here. I didn't consider that federal government siphons wealth from the states and redistributes it (poorly), but you are correct. If you look at one of those federal tax dollar maps by state, it might piss you off depending where you live.

       Yes but we aren't talking about nuclear physics over here, it is basic economics.  Even if you don't understand how the FED works, you can still know how the FED works.  So in this case, not knowing how this major government entity works is willful ignorance in this day and age.

       Even if you had a sliver of proof that the FED was "owned" by the Rothschild, it would still be a government entity.  The only difference is it would be backed by private investors.  I'm assuming that is what you were reaching for?

       The 7 member board of governors offer "general guidance". The real decisions are made by the FOMC which includes 5 private bank board members and they do not need to report to or get approval from any government entity.

       I see where it is made up of 7 members of the Federal Reserve Board and 5 of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents.  So you are going to have to prove that all of the Federal Reserve banks are private for that to hold.  Also the Board of Governors appoint these bank presidents and the BoG answer to Congress and can be reprimanded by them as well.

        I

       don't need to prove anything. I'll just tell you how it is and you can make up your own mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing public about the FED is the board of governors elected by congress. They do not answer to congress. Even if they were supposed to, the BoG
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       offers guidance, while the bank presidents make all the decisions (like whether or not to raise rates).
      </p>
      <p>
       The regional bank BoD is made up of 9 members. Only 3 are elected by the BoG. The other 6 are elected by the private sector commercial banks. Typically, of the 3 elected by the BoG, most are from the private sector or non-profits (which is typically just a nice name for a tax sheltered scam).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is arguably ZERO public control in the FED. The only influence the BoG provides to the Fed is allowing them to use the word 'Federal' in their name and confuse 99% of the country to falsely believe that the Federal reserve is anything more than an unconstitutional banking cartel.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Fed was actually public, why the fuck would it loan money to itself at interest?? Would you ever loan yourself money at interest? Do you see how inherently retarded that is?

       Yes, but economics is not really that hard. But TPTB want you to think it is far behind your ken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take for example the Fed policy meetings (I think they are quarterly), after the meeting, Bernanke, and now Yellin release an "official statement" that is so
       <em>
        <strong>
         deliberately convoluted.
        </strong>
       </em>
       This is because they want the average person to hear it and think, "I didn't understand any of that and probably never will...It's too complicated; I might as well leave it to the experts!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's their trap. If you start with basics, say by reading Adam Smith's
       <em>
        Wealth of Nations
       </em>
       , then maybe F.A. Hayek's
       <em>
        Road to Serfdom
       </em>
       , and then perhaps Henry Hazlitt's
       <em>
        Economics in One Lesson
       </em>
       . [Or take any other suggestions from this sub or
       <a href="/r/economics">
        /r/economics
       </a>
       .]
      </p>
      <p>
       But one thing that I wish to emphasize is that what got us into trouble in this country during the 20th century was "Keynesian Monetary Theory" (which were  modified by Milton Friedman). These economic principles are still in effect today and it is this school of economic principles that have landed us in the mess we are in.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it has long been a debate, instead of Keynesian/Friedman economic theory, I advocate following
       <strong>
        The Austrian School of Economics
       </strong>
       , begun by Ludwig Von Mises, and followed by Hayek, Murray Rothbard and many others.  [But you'll have time for that later.]

       Economics isn't really that hard, in terms of learning. But to interpret it in practice, especially in this "modern era", is maddening. To learn theory itself, you are taking out the most important factor there could possibly be: corruption. That aspect alone eviscerates all theory......unless it is secretly a part of a certain theory (which I believe Keynesian Economics definitely includes, as can be seen with Keynes' involvement in the Bretton Woods Conference, and his vehement frustration in the founding of the IMF and the "not right now" decision on his prized Bancor global currency).
      </p>
      <p>
       A worthwhile investigation may be to look into blaq marqets, extortion, bribery, corruption and convenient mur ders/accidents. To see the 'hidden hand' that Adam Smith speaks of is of great importance in this era.

       I'm choosing you to ask this question to for several reasons, not the least of which is your support of Austrian Economics. Lately, I've been encouraging everyone I know to read the first 2 or 3 chapters of
       <em>
        The Creature from Jekyll Island
       </em>
       , as it causes dozens of "a-ha!" moments. But might there be a better, smaller excerpt I can recommend to get someone started on the path of economic literacy?

       I think his main purpose is to drive new people away from conspiracies. His entire personality seems faked and I'm sure he would have been told by someone on his team that he comes off like a ranting lunatic. If he truly cared about and understood this whole mess, he would try to change his tone, and possibly even address his past belligerent behavior. He is the definition of controlled opposition.

       He gets a lot right. He knew the fed wasn't going to raise rates when everyone else was saying they would time after time again. When they finally did it was a pittance. Predicting the future is hard, he does better than anyone else I listen to- plus he describes his reasoning very well.

       Just a brief primer: After the financial meltdown of 2008, the US [and global economy] never really recovered. We've been in a recession since then. (Some say a Depression.) But the Fed has been hiding it. They've done something called "Quantitative Easing," which consists of flooding the financial markets with trillions of new dollars. They hoped that companies would use the money to open new factories and hire new workers. Instead the companies used the cash to start buying their own stock.
      </p>
      <p>
       In most corporations, the CEO [and Board of Directors] have fat bonuses tied to stock valuation. If the stock goes up a nickel, they get a million-dollar bonus. So what these fraudsters did was take money from the Fed, and buy their own stock [thus making it look like it was in demand], driving the price up artificially.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you did this on Ebay, you'd get arrested and charged with fraud. You're not legally allowed to put a product out for sale and then drive up the price by pretending you were a random bidder.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's what the corporations have been doing. Which is why the Stock Market looks robust.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's a Ponzi scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you remove the Quantitative Easing, it would have crashed long ago. (No one in the free market is actually buying these assets.) It's an illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's an illusion the Fed is encouraging to keep consumer confidence up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like how they're lying about the real unemployment rates. They're actually at about 32%. (To put that in context, at the height of the Great Depression, unemployment topped out at 25%.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So they're engaging in all sorts of manipulation to keep you from finding out that the economy crashed back in 2008--and never recovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama is getting criticized for being the only President in history not to have a 3% growth rate. He's claiming publicly that it's 1.1%. But, remove the Quantitative Easing, and it's actually contracted. It's like -2%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantitive Easing works in the short term [and was only supposed to be used for a year.] We're now on Year Eight of it. And all this flooding of the economy with new dollars is diluting the purchasing power of the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't keep doing it forever--or the dollar collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they're in a catch-22. If they keep interest rates at 0% [to allow banks and corporations to get free cash to buy their own stock], then it crashes the bond market. If they crash the bond market, then local governments and municipalities [who depend on issuing bonds to raise revenue for capital projects] are screwed. Because who would want to buy a bond with a 0% yield?
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer: No one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonds exist to make investors money. "Here. I'll loan you $30,000 for a ten year period, and at the end of the 10 year-period, you'll pay it back PLUS the interest."
      </p>
      <p>
       In the new 0% atmosphere, not only are they not getting the interest payment, but they're actually LOSING their capital in the loan (because the rate of inflation will dilute the value of the original $30,000. That is, $30,000 ten years from now will NOT have the same value as $30,000 today--especially as quantitative easing erodes the value of dollars via inflation.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Result: No one is getting bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consequence: Cities don't get cash infusions to build new roads, or construct new schools.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Fed HAS to raise the interest rate at some point [or else collapse the bond market]. If they do that, however, it'll shut off the tap of free money to the banks and corporations--which will remove the false-front off the weakened economy as these institutions can no longer buy their own stock and prop up the stock market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the Fed painted itself into a corner.
      </p>

       <li>
        Footnote: Here's a little secret. Quantitative Easing only works if you're the only country doing it. Problem for the US? All the central banks around the world started doing it, too. It's like an actor wearing lifts to look taller--and all his co-stars showing up in lifts the next day. If everyone is wearing them, no one has an advantage. That's why Quantitative Easing [which was only supposed to last for a year in America] has failed after 8 years. Every nation on Earth is de-valuing their currency at the same time, because they all got knocked in 2008. See a Central Banker talk about it here. Money-quote: "You know Kyle, quantitative easing only works when you're the only country doing it."

       the feds bought all the toxic assets from the banks. trillions $ of under water mortgages to save the banks. it's important to understand that in this case they didn't just print money they actual bought an asset. given enough time the asset will eventually go up and the feds will sell it and give the treasury the money. the feds could lose money for 100 years and it wouldn't matter. they can't go out of business.

       Excellent point.
      </p>
      <p>
       But consider: The housing bubble was predicated on the mistaken notion that housing prices would go up and up and up--and never lose their value. Here's why that's wrong: demographics. In aging countries [like those in the West] Baby Boomers are transitioning over into retirement. Many are downsizing and putting their large houses on the market (now that their children are adults and moved away). Others are just dying--which also places houses on the market. As all these houses flood the market, the scarcity of housing goes down. Which drives prices down. In other words, aging populations are a deflationary environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This happened in Japan in the 1990s. Their real estate market all these decades later never recovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning: Those mortgages that the Fed bought to help the banks will never have any value. They're toxic. Worthless. And they'll continue to be worthless--because the deflationary pressures shaping up around America are not going to allow them to rise in value. As the years pass [and America's population ages more and more and more--the price of houses will go down and down and down]. It's a question of supply and demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of supply = lower price. (Currently, Baby Boomers in America number around 70 million--or about a quarter of the total US population.) The average age of a white American is now 56.
       <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/26/census-data-average-age-of-whites-is-56-9-for-hispanics/">
        http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/26/census-data-average-age-of-whites-is-56-9-for-hispanics/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So we're going to be in a deflationary period for decades. (Just like Japan. Just like Western Europe.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Deflation is actually good for young people. Because as prices come down, they can afford to buy a house--and enter the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why booms and busts are actually good things. Lowered prices = more people able to buy in when the price is low.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the Fed keeping the prices artificially high, they're pricing Millennials out. (That's why you see articles about how Millennials are still living at home with their parents at age 32.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This distortion in the economy will have devastating effects going forward. We NEED these people to buy in to the system to make it work, long-term. But they're being priced out--not just in houses but in stocks as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Fed manipulates the system to keep prices permanently high it screws the next generation--and the overall economy as we move forward. (This is how bubbles come into existence--and how they're always the result of central bank manipulation.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short: No, the subprime mortgages the Fed bought from all these private lenders and hedgefunds will never recover their value--not in our lifetimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side-note: It isn't just the Fed gaming the system to help their friends. There's another player.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The Exchange Stabilization Fund.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       They're doing what you described, too--except on a much larger scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have noticed all these worthless stocks being bought up by shadowy front companies. It's the Exchange Stabilization Fund trying to prop up the stock market. They're buying up all sorts of assets across the economy, to help keep the spot-price of these collapsing assets up.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're also working to suppress the price of gold. (Weak gold means a stronger dollar.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the ESF exists to protect the dollar. Anything that threatens the dollar will be dealt with with extreme prejudice. These are the "economic hitmen" that John Perkins wrote about. The shadowy people behind the scenes who start wars and depose leaders in foreign countries to defend the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have this massive slush fund, which exists outside the official economy--and all used to manipulate the financial world behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's why we're at risk: Currently there's a derivatives bubble that's currently at $2 quadrillion dollars. That's 22 times the size of all global GDP combined. An investment bank like Goldman Sachs, for instance, is worth $900 billion, but is overleveraged in derivatives to the tune of $54 trillion. All the other big banks are the same: Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Deutschebank, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the Exchange Stabilization Fund nor the Federal Reserve has enough money to bail them out this time. It's gone WAYYYYyyy past the point of no return.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Just in case people don't know: The Fed has about $4 trillion in assets. The derivatives bubble is $2
       <em>
        quadrillion
       </em>
       .)
      </p>
      <p>
       There's literally not enough money on Planet Earth to save them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just reading an article about the guy who was portrayed in the movie "The Big Short". It ends with this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Asked to name the next big short, Eisman initially declined. “I’m not in such a rush to do it again,” he said. “It took years off my life.” Then he relented, saying, “The only big short out there is when the world loses confidence in Quantitative Easing.” Predictably, Eisman did not offer any ideas on how to profit when his prediction is - again - proven to be right, since the collapse of the central bank model will mean all fiat-denominated conventional finance as we know it will come to an end, and force the world to revert to "traditional" hard assets, such as gold.

       The housing market would have always gone up just fine as assumed. It was the bed rock of our economy. But when bankers started securitizing/bundling loans that insentivized the bankers to selling lots of loans to people who couldn't afford them. And when reality hit.  boom. Bubble burst. But population growth over the long haul will solve this problem. And again, it doesn't matter if it is in our lifetime or not. The fed exists outside of any lifetime. So they are free to carry the debt forever. It's quite ingenious of the bankers to create an entity that counter balances whatever they need all approved by the government.

       Derivatives are a zero sum game so how do they become a bubble? You say GS is leveraged, does that mean they're borrowing money from other banks to buy these derivatives? And if so, how is that debt not subtracted from their worth?

       You probably already know this (but for those who don't): A derivatives contract is just like an insurance contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's use oil as an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       An energy company might know that they're going to be using a lot of oil over a coming year. But oil shifts in price on a daily basis. That's annoying for their accounting. So Energy Company X can go to Goldman Sachs and ask them to negotiate a set price with an oil producer (so that they can build this stable price into their expenditure projections).
      </p>
      <p>
       Goldman Sachs will then go to, say, Saudi Arabia and negotiate a deal for a set price. Let's imagine they negotiate it for $100 a barrel.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter where the price goes, Goldman Sachs (as the guarantor of the contract) has to backstop the transaction and make good on the settlement.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Energy Company X [no matter where the price goes] will always
       <em>
        contractually
       </em>
       get their set price. Saudi Arabia, likewise, will also always get their set price. The only party who isn't guaranteed a set-price is the investment bank issuing the contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       This works well when prices are high. But what if oil suddenly crashes in value (as has actually happened)?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if oil falls from $100 a barrel to $20 per barrel?
      </p>
      <p>
       That means that Goldman Sachs is now on the hook for $80 for every barrel. (They have to absorb that cost.)
      </p>
      <p>
       They lose money with every transaction. With every barrel of oil sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand what went wrong we have to go to the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan brought down the Soviet Union by using economic warfare. Most people think that the arms race brought them down. But I was watching a Soviet analyst say, "No, it was oil." Basically, Reagan knew that the Soviet Union relied on its oil sales. As a result, he went to Saudi Arabia and got OPEC to artificially collapse the price of oil. This bankrupted the Soviets, hastening their collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast-forward to 2015. As tensions escalated between the US and an emerging Russia, some genius had the brilliant idea to try a repeat of the Reagan strategy (to weaken Putin). Right on cue, meetings were held with OPEC and the oil prices dropped.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem this time, though?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike the 1980s, derivatives contracts are now legal. (Once seen as too risky to be permitted, they were banned in the 1980s. But under George W. Bush, and loosened regulations, they now became legal.) So now when the price of oil dropped, it took down the entire financial system with it (as collateral damage).
      </p>
      <p>
       Oops!
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, a player like Goldman Sachs [that is worth $900 billion] now
       <em>
        owes
       </em>
       54 trillion--in derivatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no mathematical way for them to be able to settle their debts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's even worse when you realize that all the other big players [like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Deutschebank, etc.] are also insolvent, with vastly more debts than assets. And all due to derivatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the central banks have the cash to bail them out--like they did in 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the systemic problems that caused that crisis then were addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And globalism made things worse, because there's no port in a storm. In other words, we're all tied into the same financial grid (for the first time in human history). Think of a submarine, with airlocks. If a room floods, you can close a door, spin the valve on the airlock--and boom: The flooding is isolated to a single room and the sub survives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine a system where all the airlocks are removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there are no longer separate compartments and there is no longer a way to isolate danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       That removal of the airlocks is better known as "globalism".
      </p>
      <p>
       No more borders. No more boundaries. And [unfortunately] no more way to isolate a contagion.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said: This is new to human history. All the nations of the Earth were never on one grid. In 1900, if Great Britain collapsed, investors could flee to the US and get a stable currency there. If the Ottoman Empire collapsed, Japan was totally fine [because it wasn't on the same grid].
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that they're all tied in together, the collapse of the major Western investment banks will take down all the world's central banks with them--and destabilize the respective countries who will be caught in the economic tsunami.

        So the globalists, recognizing the resolve of the peoples of the world to “emerge rapidly and conclusively from the era of colonialism,” have graciously provided them with a mechanism to do so: the BRICS alliance. And when the G20-connected BRICS emerge as victors over the “insane” G20-connected Western powers, the peoples’ longsuffering desire will find satisfaction. They will finally be free from the uncomfortable grip of the banksters’ Left Hand so they can rest more comfortably in the snug embrace of the banksters’ Right Hand.

       I think we're gonna see that QE money make its way in the general economy. Right now the banks are keeping trillions stashed away at the FED and most of the rest is in the stock market.

       "By 2020, business debt likely will climb to $75 trillion from its current $51 trillion level, according to S&amp;P Global Ratings. Under normal conditions, that wouldn't be a major problem so long as credit quality stays high, interest rates and inflation remain low, and there are economic growth persists. However, the alternative is less pleasant should those conditions not persist. Should interest rates rise and economic conditions worsen, corporate America could be facing a major problem as it seeks to manage that debt. Rolling over bonds would become more difficult should inflation gain and rates raise, while a slowing economy would worsen business conditions and make paying off the debt more difficult.
In that case, a 'Crexit,' or withdrawal by lenders from the credit markets, could occur and lead to a sudden tightening of conditions that could trigger another financial scare. A worst-case scenario would be a series of major negative surprises sparking a crisis of confidence around the globe, S&amp;P said in the report. 'These unforeseen events could quickly destabilize the market, pushing investors and lenders to exit riskier positions ('Crexit' scenario). If mishandled, this could result in credit growth collapsing as it did during the global financial crisis.'

       Interest rates may not be raised tomorrow but they will most likely be raised by the end of the year. According to

       It won't be a depression.  Stocks will overreact because that is what the stock market does.  People will sell stocks because they think others will sell too.  There might be a small recession but things will bounce back in time.  They've been debating on doing this for over a year now and eventually it is going to happen.

       That's a really long answer that could probably be answered better by someone with more knowledge of the FED than I.
       <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2015/09/17/5-reasons-why-the-fed-should-have-raised-interest-rates/#704674ed580c">

       is an article written a year ago and I mainly agree with his points on 1,2, and 5.  The FED is basically there to keep America in a happy medium between rapid growth and depression.  It's like a wave and they try to stop from going to low or too high.  Too low and shit hits the fan(last major depression), too high and bubbles are created(Tech bubble in early 2000's).  The FED has basically been offering very cheap interest rates, which in turn helps out the rich.  Some have even blamed these low interest rates for the large gap between the poor and the rich.  The article I linked touches on it some with small businesses but it affects people too.

       The problem is they've been using this same form of resource to boost the economy for a while now and people having been warning since the beginning that it can have ramifications. For instance hyper inflation has been one of the worries about the low interest rates.   Since the fed lowers interest rates by putting more money into circulation by buying treasury bonds, people are worried this could cause massive amount of inflation in a short time.  If the fed were to raise interest rates, they would do so by selling treasury bonds and make the dollar less available.

       Why haven't we seen this yet?
I mean, the first two metrics I found suggest that inflation is lower than we'd like.

       Look up quantitative easing and hyper inflation.  It's debated if QE leads to hyper inflation or if it is just a scare tactic.  Either way, it has been warned and inflation is pretty regular right now.  That's what scares some people.  Like you pointed out inflation is lower than we'd like but it should be higher, maybe not hyper inflation levels but at least preferred inflation levels.  Some economist believe it'll be like a snapping of a twig.  One minute everything is fine, then snap and everything is tumbling down.  You are starting to go towards economic theory where there isn't really a right and wrong, just two sides arguing over it.

       I'm genuinely curious about Quantitative Easing (QE)... It's hard not to believe that pumping $80 billion in new cash a month doesn't increase the chance at hyper inflation... If you have any reading material on the subject I'd like to check it out..
      </p>
      <p>
       I know we were all kids once, and we all said "why can't the government just print more money?" And our teachers and professors gave us the standard inflation answer.. Well that's essentially what QE is..

       Exactly.  And I don't really have any reading material on it at the moment.  Usually when I'm curious about something I'll open just open up two tabs and have an arguments for (curious subject here) and the other tab will be arguments against.  I know I have read some articles about it on forbes before.  It's a very interesting topic.  Might be able to find
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Economics/search?q=quantitative+easing&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">
        something
       </a>
       if you search through r/economics.  But I can't speak of if any of these are good or not.  Definitely an interesting subject though.

       IMO yes.  It is completely possible that this decision could lead to a long list of things fucked up on that leads to a future depression, but it is going to take more than just this.  I'd be willing to bet the stock market has been shorting bank stocks every time the FED meets waiting on this to happen so they can make a quick buck.  Eventually it will happen, people will act like it is worse than it really is, everything will bounce back.

       What would our economy be like if the only thing the Fed or treasury or whoever did was to keep the amount of money in circulation constant year after year?

       This is a mind-boggling question that can give you a wide array of answers based on the Butterfly Effect such a change would cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't tell you what the economy would be "like", but I can tell you how different some things would be. For instance, banks could not lend in the same fashion whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, banks can lend
       <strong>
        WAY
       </strong>
       more money out than what they have. Which means they're using the money they're forecasting themselves to make off of future loan payments to lend out to consumers. When someone defaults on a loan, the result is not only that the bank doesn't get paid back, but that there's now more money out there in the economy than there was before.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a world with a consistent money supply, banks would likely have to have the capital in reserves before lending it, which would make them a lot more cautious in handing it out. Which would in turn make the citizenry more responsible in their borrowing habits. Why? Because it would result in a direct loss for the bank. Right now, loans that go unpaid fall on the
       <em>
        American taxpayer
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Forcing the Federal Reserve to enforce a consistent money supply would defeat its own purpose as a for-profit bank with investors, so it's a completely different model. To do what you're asking would require an actual federal (as in, governmental) institution that is transparent in all its actions. We can only dream...

       if they kept to the intentions of the writers of the constitution we would be being issued gold and/or silver coins by the FED or 100% gold/silver backed notes (like the old US dollars, redeemable in precious metal at your local banks). This would, however, stop the scam of fractional reserve banking and usury.

       No.  The Fed is politically motivated... They will NOT dare raise rates until Jan. 2017 if Trump is elected.  They may hold off even longer if HRC wins...

       20% chance they raise rates apparently, its quite likely they know the election results already but I do see a lot of value in postponing it if they wish to start Trump off with a recession, or have Hillary 'cure' it.

       Hillary can't "cure" it. The world is already getting skeptical of the dollar as it is. What WILL happen is that if Trump wins they will turn their controlled media dogs on him, and blame him for the collapse they have been causing. Possibly even trying to organize a revolution to impeach him or something. If Hillary wins there will still be a collapse but they will make endless excuses, and ask everyone to calm down. Then they will probably blame the Russians an say war is the answer.

       Traditionally if the incumbent party leaves with a strong economy the votes sway in favor of the new party member from the same line. If the economy fails it would empower Trump with a position to stand upon, I need more popcorn.

       The argument against the idea of having the FED is like the argument against having a gas pedal and brakes on a car. sure you can get to point a to point b without problems but speeding out of control or moving at a snail's pace without influence can be its own special hell. Audit the Fed is another movement that on paper sounds reasonable but when you realise the politics you are opening on the valve of fiat money you are basically letting the monkeys run the zoo. Is there corruption in the Fed? absolutely, any system with humans will find a way to benefit on things. the last time the rates have moved up was a decade ago. we have been living on the fat of the hog for way too long and low interest rates dooms savings and all bonds whether it be for building the new school down the road or a high rise for big wigs. prices are high and demand is high while unemployment has finally dropped to a manageable %, there is no better time to raise rates take a hit to the chin but keep the GDP from min/maxing to something ridiculous. you can hate things but when you hate things you don't understand your no better then a mob at Frankenstein's door.

       The data you speak of (unemployment rate, GDP %) is completely fabricated. It simply can't be trusted. You can only accept it as part of the casino game being played. But, when you really know the truth, why would you really want to play?
      </p>
      <p>
       I fully agree with you though, based on the (fraudulent) data, the Fed should've raised rates in the July meeting. Instead they waxed on about BREXIT impact and a lower than anticipated (LOWER!) level of inflation and kept rates the same, even when the BIS gave the hint that maybe they should start raising a quarter point or more before year end, so they have the option to ease/go NIRP in the future (2017/2018). Yet they did nothing. It will certainly be interesting tomorrow to see what Yellen or Fischer say.

       yes i understand how you could think the data could be weighted favor or corrupted and i can't argue to prove that wrong but the thing is that the market treats and reacts to it as fact so it in turns becomes it no matter how sudo the data is. the problem is that the game we play is intrinsic to our day to day unless you live on a paid off farm and press your own shells. these numbers regardless of how real they are affect how much you pay into SS and medicare, retirement funds and loans, your savings and your debts, to simply turtle your head bc the system is flawed accomplishes nothing but to wise up, play the game with the rising and falling of interest knowing the breathing cycle of the beast and maybe get yourself enough money to get that self sustaining deed free farm house...

       the argument against the fed is nothing like breaks/gas on a car. Free markets have done fine for thousands of years, whereas central banks have always failed. How is it a good thing that we surrender so much to give these people the ability to print money, manufacture depressions/booms/busts? They have done anything but stabilize the economy. You should throw your pitchforks down and leave Frankenstein alone.

       "Free markets have done fine for thousands of years." Yes before the 1900s the market had predictable ebbs and flows bc agriculture was the name of the game and the fall came every year. after industrialisation however the market became predatory. banks speculated rashly on copper and created such futility that they put themselves out of business. Without halo investors propping up the market to stem the fear out of the market, chaos would burn the whole thing down. There is a reason why only a handful of countries don't have central banks and its because there needs to be a lender of last resort, the markets today are too large to be propped up by a J.P Morgan or other halo investors at their time. what are we surrendering are massive inflation and deflations quarter to quarter. you can argue the construction of the boom/bust diagram but the fact of the matter is central banks mimic what naturally occurs just at slower rates and longer frequencies.

       They can, but this damages Obama's legacy. They'll want to save that kind of move for closer to the election, if they try it. Doing so now benefits Trump because of how he's phrased his attacks on Obama's economy.

       When I hear about rising interest rates I partly think, "it's about damn time." The US hasn't kept interest rates this low, for so long, in... decades? Maybe even a century? Hell it's been almost a decade itself of keeping rates near 0%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Market-crashing, depression-inducing deflation only happens when it's too dramatic and too soon, sort of like when Volcker spiked rates to 20% in the late 70s/early 80s. What we're talking is a fraction of a percent, and Yellen's been giving the market plenty of a heads up that it shouldn't shock the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       A rise in interest rates reins in cheap money that cause serious distortions. Right now, people can't retire because they aren't generating anything on their savings due to low interest rates. And if they ain't retiring, they're in the workforce... which means they're not handing over those jobs to those recent college grads desperate for work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Low rates also cause people to dump money into businesses that may not deserve it, but because there aren't viable alternatives, then they do it anyway. Lots of value investors are sitting out of the markets because they see everything as being way overpriced... and so long as the Fed is artificially propping up markets by keeping rates so low, then it's understandable. When this is kept up for too long, what we have is a system equivalent to banks lending money for a home to the part-time worker with bad credit. So, stock prices will drop but that's not necessarily a bad thing. They could drop because they're overvalued, and if the price falls, that's not always a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Low rates mean savings decrease: people would rather spend what they have and try to generate money elsewhere, than park it in their savings where it ain't making them money. While it seems like a good thing that people would spend money on goods and services (thus stimulating the economy), that's only good in the short-term. Otherwise you get into a debt-based economic system which has problems. Consumers should have healthy levels of savings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, these are a few reasons why I'm not at all panicking about the rise in interest rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: not to mention, the dollar is going to become even stronger, and thus more attractive. We could get a good chunk of foreign direct investment coming our way. American-made products will become more attractive to buyers, too, because imports will become more expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soooo... lots of ways for an economy to benefit from rising interest rates.

       Theyre not going to hike rates yet, they had saod they wanted to going back to June. I believe they ruled a September rate hike out last month but may look to it late this year or early next. Recipe for distaster. We are fucked.
      </p>

       They want rates to be at 3.5 which wont happen, currently under 1%.

       They'll leave the interest rate as it is -- or lower it -- thus avoiding crisis. However, on September 22, TPTB will either cause an enormous natural disaster or do a huge false flag attack against targets in the West. And that will in turn cause Deutsche Bank and the other TBTF banks to collapse, ushering in a big, global war, leading us to some kind of "The Road"-like scenario for the next seven years, before the NWO is implemented in 2023.

       the federal reserve is LITERALLY the mega conspiracy machine, perhaps the biggest, most important one in the world. It was designed in secret, under false pretenses, operates in secret, and is controlled by the most powerful people in the world.

       I'm willing to bet that a good majority of Americans would have a much more clear understanding of economics by simply reading some of the two- or three-paragraph posts in this thread. No, you won't understand everything without time and devotion, but you can learn enough to get what's wrong with it in a fairly simple conversation. Many commenters here have proven that.

       The problem is they've been using this same form of resource to boost the economy for a while now and people having been warning since the beginning that it can have ramifications. For instance hyper inflation has been one of the worries about the low interest rates.   Since the fed lowers interest rates by putting more money into circulation by buying treasury bonds, people are worried this could cause massive amount of inflation in a short time.  If the fed were to raise interest rates, they would do so by selling treasury bonds and make the dollar less available.

       This is a mind-boggling question that can give you a wide array of answers based on the Butterfly Effect such a change would cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't tell you what the economy would be "like", but I can tell you how different some things would be. For instance, banks could not lend in the same fashion whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, banks can lend
       <strong>
        WAY
       </strong>
       more money out than what they have. Which means they're using the money they're forecasting themselves to make off of future loan payments to lend out to consumers. When someone defaults on a loan, the result is not only that the bank doesn't get paid back, but that there's now more money out there in the economy than there was before.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a world with a consistent money supply, banks would likely have to have the capital in reserves before lending it, which would make them a lot more cautious in handing it out. Which would in turn make the citizenry more responsible in their borrowing habits. Why? Because it would result in a direct loss for the bank. Right now, loans that go unpaid fall on the
       <em>
        American taxpayer
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Forcing the Federal Reserve to enforce a consistent money supply would defeat its own purpose as a for-profit bank with investors, so it's a completely different model. To do what you're asking would require an actual federal (as in, governmental) institution that is transparent in all its actions. We can only dream...

       if they kept to the intentions of the writers of the constitution we would be being issued gold and/or silver coins by the FED or 100% gold/silver backed notes (like the old US dollars, redeemable in precious metal at your local banks). This would, however, stop the scam of fractional reserve banking and usury.
