    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been diagnosed bipolar, and this is a question that has sat festering in my mind for many, many years. I recently went off my meds again, and holy shit, it certainly does feel like I have a mental disorder.</p>

<p>I could write a 9,000-line post about this topic, but here&#39;s my current (probably controversial) take:</p>

<p>In order to get high enough up in the medical field that you&#39;re responsible for deciding what is defined as a &quot;mental disorder&quot;, not only do you have to be able to study and focus on the same field of work for many, many years, but you have to have the ability to network and grow a high social standing among your peers. The symptoms of almost every mental illness in the book are just about guaranteed to keep you from having at least one, if not both, of those two key traits.</p>

<p>Those who have reached the top of their field feel pretty good about themselves, and have plenty of reasons to believe they are superior intellectuals. As far as they&#39;re concerned, everyone should be able to put their head down and achieve similar success, because they did it, so how hard can it really be?</p>

<p>But then they&#39;re faced with the mysteries of guys like me...guys who had all the mental potential in the world, but couldn&#39;t even get to senior year of high school without facing an existential crisis, flunking, and then dropping out. At the time, had you asked me what happened, I&#39;d tell you that nothing in school felt right, I didn&#39;t see the point in going. I knew I was smarter than other kids, but couldn&#39;t stand watching them have more success because of how much extra time they spent at school, or how much they kissed ass.</p>

<p>Doctors would sure seem pretty foolish if they just said they don&#39;t know why some people act so different and don&#39;t fit into the school/job structure. So they developed a set of &quot;mental illnesses&quot; which each of these subjects must fall into. The ones who are sad all day get sorted into one drawer, those who are hyper AND sad go into another, and those who can&#39;t focus on pointless, useless, repetitive homework go into another.</p>

<p>So now, there&#39;s a medical explanation for why certain people don&#39;t feel comfortable in our American capitalist system. When in reality, there&#39;s actually a lot wrong with the American capitalist system, and some people just don&#39;t want to have to be a part of it.</p>

<p>I, as someone who has somehow skirted the system (so far...anything can happen on any given day for me), can just as easily write a journal that has a chapter dedicated to &quot;Blind Puppy Trust Disorder&quot;. Those with this illness suffer from a lack of independent thought, an instilled trust of authority, and a cemented belief that the opinions of others are invalidated when contradicted by their own. Side effects include racking up six digits of student debt, losing years off your life to all-night cram sessions, and over-prescribing expensive, unproven drugs to patients after short office visits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most meds they give you for bipolar you can&#39;t quit cold turkey, you have to taper off; not doing this can have very, very serious mental side effects for some people (including depression, brain zaps, homicidal/suicidal ideation, auditory/visual hallucinations, etc.) - it&#39;s irresponsible (honestly, I think criminal) for doctors not to tell patients this when they start people on it. And GPs should NOT be prescribing this shit. To whit: The reason you go batshit when you stop taking them is not because you were always crazy, you&#39;re having an &quot;adverse drug reaction caused by withdrawal.&quot; They have a fancy name for it to make it sound better than &quot;withdrawal:&quot; <em>Discontinuation Syndrome.</em> It&#39;s withdrawal, no matter how they try to pretty it up to sell more drugs.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s how the scam works - you take a medication for long enough to get hooked on it (&quot;You won&#39;t know if it helps for two to three weeks!&quot;) at which point, if you stop, you get crazy mental side effects (&quot;Oh, damn, I must really be crazy, better keep taking the drugs!&quot;), so you go back on them. And for some poor people, they either go cold turkey or drink alcohol or grapefruit juice or take too many by accident - and have a real psychotic break. Lives have absolutely been ruined, are ruined every day - and no one seems to give a fuck. Keep the money train rolling.</p>

<p>(Another thing, always read the drug&#39;s liner notes and take them seriously: If the drug is liver metabolized, do not drink. If the drug is kidney-metabolized, no grapefruit. Even if the notes say a side effect is &quot;rare&quot; - believe and understand that you could be affected.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much appreciate your reply. I neglected to mention in the post that I weaned myself off of my meds over a very long period - literally about 4 months.</p>

<p>I was on 50mg of sertraline (Zoloft) and 50mg of lamotrigine (Lamictal). I started taking 2/3rds of the sertraline and maintained that for over 2 months. Then, for over another month, I dropped to 1/3rd of the sertraline. That is when the brain zaps started, along with some general unease, but these tapered off.</p>

<p>After stopping the sertraline altogether, I chopped the lamotrigine pills in half and took those for another week before stopping. So, I spent a really long time slowing down on the SSRI, but kind of a quick stoppage on the anti-psychotic, which I didn&#39;t really notice much from.</p>

<p>This all ended roughly 2 months ago. I felt pretty darn good up until the past couple days, but in retrospect, I was certainly in a manic state. This wave is unlike anything I&#39;ve felt since before being medicated though, and it blows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man. My doctor prescribed a different anti-psychotic for me but I&#39;m not bothering this time. However, he also gave me a pair of big orange goggles that blocks blue light, helping melatonin production at night and letting me sleep better. It&#39;s helped a little - in studies, bipolar patients seem to be more sensitive to light patterns than others. So I&#39;ll just stick to that for now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty good with vitamins, diet could be better, but I hold the belief that a serious concussion I had when I was 7 has something to do with all of this. I followed an eerily similar path of scholastic deterioration to some childhood CTE sufferers I&#39;ve read about recently.</p>

<p>The worst I suffered was with OCD, which developed in full by the time I was 9. My mom identified the OCD really early on, though, and I got through it over the next several years without even knowing meds were available for it. I still have some small habits (I&#39;ll touch things a few times for no damn reason), but really, it&#39;s gone. I just tend to wonder if the same brain malady is responsible for all of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My biggest argument against psychiatry  would be the lack of diversity.   A great surgeon is probably not also a great plumber, or a great chef.   It takes many different types of people to make up a society.   </p>

<p>So having extensive credentials in one doctrine (psychology) still doesn&#39;t necessarily make one person an expert in someone else&#39;s life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I don&#39;t understand is why a primary care physician is the one calling the shots on most mental disorders. They should only be dealing with things they can prove, or have a lot of historical data to reference. They shouldn&#39;t be in the business of diagnosing you with something that falls in this wide, gray spectrum, with no record of what a successful cure even looks like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheers...I&#39;m fortunate to have a supportive family. There&#39;s definitely others who need more help than I do.</p>

<p>While there&#39;s rough patches, sympathy feels unnecessary as I also get to access the creative band of the universe&#39;s spectrum. Channeling it gets me those manic highs that very few people can relate to.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in another comment, I conquered OCD when I was younger...now THAT was suffering. There was nothing beneficial to having that type of anxiety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bipolar? Check.
Intellectual yet a second year college dropout? Check.
Need meds to be productive (read: survive) in capitalist society? Check.
Have a strong spiritual connection to the world that has the potential to become overwhelming (leading to mania and psychosis, i.e. delusions that I&#39;m God or Jesus) without meds, and is strongly suppressed by meds which leads to a suicidal depression due to not being able to &quot;feel&quot; God in my life anymore? Check.
Have had since maturity an intuitive knowledge that the capitalist system is flawed, and therefore struggle to be a successful participant? Check.
Able to bypass the spiritual suppression of the meds through a dedicated practice of daily meditation? Check.
Have a strong feeling in my heart that this &quot;mental illness&quot; is not a curse, as our Western society views it, but a blessing and that those blessed are destined to change the world, but are born into a system designed to break them down and make them lose their minds because they are never properly taught how to harness their power?
Mother fuckin&#39; check.
PM me, bro. I rarely get the chance to talk to bipolar intellectuals.

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO, you are hitting upon probably the biggest conspiracy ongoing in the United States today (for this, you&#39;re going to get downvoted to hell, and I&#39;m sorry for it, but that&#39;s the price of truth-telling around here), and from it spawns so many others.</p>

<p>Terrorism, police brutality/shootings, murders, mass shootings, the military suicide epidemic, &quot;targeted individuals,&quot; and so on - who was on or withdrawing from what at the time? Hell, even crazy stories like the killer whales actually killing (on high doses of meds - how do they determine the right dose?), that chimp that ate that lady&#39;s face (Xanax).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great point. Imagine not ever knowing of television/media and how few negative vibrations you&#39;d be receiving. To never know of a &quot;terrorist attack&quot;, or a war, or the stock market, discussions of racism, etc. How many symptoms of mental illness would still be present?</p>

<p>I for one believe that although a tendency to experience symptoms of a disorder are stronger in some than in others, that the real causes for them are littered about our society in little packets that our brains are too simple to put together and see the whole picture for. And most of them are pushed on to us, in hopes that we develop this schism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was prescribed a slew of prescription drugs for treating anxiety and depression. When those fucked me up all right and proper (increase in previous symptoms, suicidal thoughts, memory loss, weight gain, was basically a zombie) and I told them I need to get off these medications, I was then diagnosed bipolar. I made the mistake of believing them once more and was on anti - psychotics for almost a year which essentially ruined my mind and body (further zombified, gained 80 pounds in under 10 months).</p>

<p>I was officially done when I switched doctors yet again and I called her out on blatantly lying to me about the symptoms and side effects of a medication she had been pushing on me for the previous three appointments. I tried as safely as I could to ween myself off of the drugs but the withdrawals were still awful and it feels as though I won&#39;t be able to recover from them even 10 months after stopping them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was prescribed resperidone for my ADHD. I found out, after taking that and adderall for nearly 8 years, that it it&#39;s an antipsychotic drug. Like literally, I was having trouble focusing in a boring ass class and they put me on that shit? I stopped taking it after reducing the dose and I was having &quot;brain zaps&quot;, I was either super cold of sweating my ass off, I had involuntary movements in my legs and arms, and severe diarrhea. It&#39;s nearly 2 months later, and I <em>still</em> have severe diarrhead. I&#39;m talking so bad that it&#39;s like I pissed brown out my asshole. <em>I still have this after two months.</em></p>

<p>You wanna know what&#39;s ironic about me taking adderall for restlessness? <a href="http://prntscr.com/ck95qd">It&#39;s the FUCKING SIDE EFFECT of taking adderall</a>. I can&#39;t even anymore. Literally almost every problem I had is in side effect list. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Mnd1inA.jpg">I swear doctors are autistic and can only recite information</a></p>

<p>It turns out those behavioral problems went away with age and by the time I was 17 I had zero problems at all and they attributed it to drugs that don&#39;t work, which worked after they reduced the dose. I&#39;m off of them and I feel so much better than before and I don&#39;t drive people away.</p>

<p>Problems I had included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nervousness</p></li>
<li><p>Restlessness</p></li>
<li><p>excitability</p></li>
<li><p>headaches</p></li>
<li><p>anxiety</p></li>
<li><p>agitation</p></li>
<li><p>sleep problems</p></li>
</ul>

<p>TLDR: The drugs I was taking caused most of my behavioral problems and got worse when they upped the dose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any good psychiatrist puts people through extensive testing to validate a mental illness.  All three of my kids had something very obviously wrong with them.  All three on the autism spectrum of some variance with other diagnosed problems that I really don&#39;t want to state on a public forum. </p>

<p>Needless to say, their problems were obvious early on and started out a &quot;no medicine&quot; parent and worked with a behavioral analyst who didn&#39;t believe in medication as well for several years before finally returning to the psychiatrist.  I can say with 100% certainty that not a single symptom was caused by the medication.  They were all there well before we ever put them on a single medication. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak for any others mental illnesses.  But my kids didn&#39;t just show symptoms around certain people. If anything, being around someone didn&#39;t really make a difference.  If you watch them when they didn&#39;t think you were there, they acted the same.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Three children all on the autism spectrum? Any inclination why that might have happened? Seems like a very long shot for it to be pure chance... My condolences for any struggles your family has endured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say for sure.  But looking through my families history, it seems we have a lot of it.  Found out many of my cousins had kids with various conditions on the autism spectrum too, including one who was never vaccinated.  Which leads me to believe that autism is likely more genetic than previously thought, at least in some people.  On my wifes side, we don&#39;t know because both her parents were adopted and don&#39;t know their families. </p>

<p>As for struggles, well, all that is really a drop in the bucket.  Last year my middle child had a rare stroke resulting in complete paralysis and requiring a ventilator to brief.  Didn&#39;t effect any of his higher brain function.  Location was dead center of his medula with no prior risk factors.  Only 20 kids in 10 years have suffered the same type of stroke.  THAT was the struggle of my lifetime.  But now? Pancakes.  It changed my outlook on life.  For the better.  Just wish I could have seen life like this without a catastrophe happening.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was prescribed resperidone for my ADHD. I found out, after taking that and adderall for nearly 8 years, that it it&#39;s an antipsychotic drug. Like literally, I was having trouble focusing in a boring ass class and they put me on that shit? I stopped taking it after reducing the dose and I was having &quot;brain zaps&quot;, I was either super cold of sweating my ass off, I had involuntary movements in my legs and arms, and severe diarrhea. It&#39;s nearly 2 months later, and I <em>still</em> have severe diarrhead. I&#39;m talking so bad that it&#39;s like I pissed brown out my asshole. <em>I still have this after two months.</em></p>

<p>You wanna know what&#39;s ironic about me taking adderall for restlessness? <a href="http://prntscr.com/ck95qd">It&#39;s the FUCKING SIDE EFFECT of taking adderall</a>. I can&#39;t even anymore. Literally almost every problem I had is in side effect list. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Mnd1inA.jpg">I swear doctors are autistic and can only recite information</a></p>

<p>It turns out those behavioral problems went away with age and by the time I was 17 I had zero problems at all and they attributed it to drugs that don&#39;t work, which worked after they reduced the dose. I&#39;m off of them and I feel so much better than before and I don&#39;t drive people away.</p>

<p>Problems I had included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nervousness</p></li>
<li><p>Restlessness</p></li>
<li><p>excitability</p></li>
<li><p>headaches</p></li>
<li><p>anxiety</p></li>
<li><p>agitation</p></li>
<li><p>sleep problems</p></li>
</ul>

<p>TLDR: The drugs I was taking caused most of my behavioral problems and got worse when they upped the dose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much appreciate your reply. I neglected to mention in the post that I weaned myself off of my meds over a very long period - literally about 4 months.</p>

<p>I was on 50mg of sertraline (Zoloft) and 50mg of lamotrigine (Lamictal). I started taking 2/3rds of the sertraline and maintained that for over 2 months. Then, for over another month, I dropped to 1/3rd of the sertraline. That is when the brain zaps started, along with some general unease, but these tapered off.</p>

<p>After stopping the sertraline altogether, I chopped the lamotrigine pills in half and took those for another week before stopping. So, I spent a really long time slowing down on the SSRI, but kind of a quick stoppage on the anti-psychotic, which I didn&#39;t really notice much from.</p>

<p>This all ended roughly 2 months ago. I felt pretty darn good up until the past couple days, but in retrospect, I was certainly in a manic state. This wave is unlike anything I&#39;ve felt since before being medicated though, and it blows.</p>
