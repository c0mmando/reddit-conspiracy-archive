        spread this post around as much as you can. Everything is fact checked and referenced, as to prevent the Clinton Campaign from 'Correcting the Record'!  r/the_donald is not allowing Combettas name to be mentioned at the moment
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       COMBETTA WAS THE CLOTH
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul Combetta, the IT guru from Platte River Networks (who was hired to maintain Clintons server AND her previous emails of Secretary of State) was found to be a reddit user. u/stonetear. He has since deleted his entire Reddit post history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two very interesting posts of his were found, one involving
       <a href="https://archive.is/5OiMF">
        Combetta asking how to strip out a VIP senders information from an email archive
       </a>
       and the other
       <a href="https://archive.is/Lhdyo">
        involving Combetta asking how to retain a 60 day retention policy on emails
       </a>
       (all emails will be auto deleted after 60 days).
      </p>
      <p>
       The second post involving the retention policy is interesting, as this finally tells us an approximate date of when the policy was put in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first one however is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       damning, as this shows that the person in control of Clintons Sec. of State Email Archive was asking specifically how to strip information about a VIP from an archive, presumably Clintons archive. It is unknown at this point who the VIP was, but obviously it was important enough to erase any trace of them from the State Departments eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads to the assumption that Paul Combetta was asked by someone at 'Clinton Executive Services Corporation' to specifically strip this information whilst leaving the rest of the archive intact. This person was most likely Clintons former chief of staff Cheryl Mills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combetta even gets responses from fellow Redditors, including
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/exchangeserver/comments/2bmm4l/remove_or_replace_tofrom_address_on_archived/cj78cld">
        'If there was a feature in Exchange that allowed this, it could result in major legal issues.'
       </a>
       <strong>
        Not only did Combetta have to ask Reddit for how to modify/tamper data within Clintons emails, but he was warned of the Legal Consequences as well.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they want to strip this information? Combetta asked a question on Reddit about Stripping Information, at exactly the same time that Cheryl Mills was asked by a member of John Kerry's State Department for hard copies of Clintons Emails during her tenure as Secretary of State. Mills did not want the State Department (or related FOIA requests) to discover certain information about emails that had been sent by a VIP sender. This is evidence that they intentionally modified emails in Clintons Archive.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL/DR - Clinton Rep Cheryl Mills likely instructed Paul Combetta to delete data relating to a 'Very Important Person' within Clinton's email archive from her tenure as Secretary of State. Combetta, who did not have government clearance, asked for advice on how to tamper with information within Clinton's emails

        Hillary's close aid, Monica Hanley worked with Bill Clinton's aide, Justin Cooper, to archive all of Hillary's emails from the "Pagliano Server" that Clinton used to house her State Department emails while serving as Secretary of State.  With Cooper's assistance, Hanley was successful transferring all of Hillary's emails from the "Pagliano Server" to an Apple MacBook with a duplicate copy saved to a "Thumb Drive". At that point, Hanley "forgot" to provide the archived emails to Clinton's staff.  So apparently the Apple MacBook and Thumb Drive just stayed around Hanley's house for a year.

       - PRN Hired to manage Clinton-family e-mail server, which is moved from their Chappaqua, N.Y., home to a secure data center in New Jersey. They had not yet received Clintons archive of SoS emails.
       <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/19/platte-river-networks-clinton-e-mail-server-was-never-in-denver/">
        “We were literally hired in June 2013,” Boian said, “and because we use industry best practices, we had (Clinton’s) server moved to a data center in New Jersey. It remained in that spot until last week,” when the FBI picked it up Aug. 12, 2015. Platte River also is not in possession of any Clinton e-mail backups, he said. “The role of Platte River Networks was to upgrade, secure and manage the e-mail server for both the Clintons and their staff beginning June 2013. Platte River Networks is not under investigation. We were never under investigation. And we will fully comply with the FBI,” he said.

        Hanley decided it wasn't the best idea to leave the email records of the former U.S. Secretary of State in her sock drawer forever.  As such, she decided it was time to backup the archived emails to Clinton's new server hosted by Platte River Networks (PRN) in Denver, Colorado. Unfortunately, she was not successful with the remote backup and mailed the computer to an Undisclosed PRN Staff Member to help with the task. Apparently, the Undisclosed PRN Staff Member also had difficulty uploading the emails to the new PRN server because the "Apple MacMail" format was incompatible with Microsoft Exchange.  So, he/she came up with a workaround that involved transferring all of Clinton's emails to a new gmail account and then exporting them to the PRN server.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometime between February and July 2014, Combetta works on converting and uploading Clintons SoS archive to PRN's network.

        "I wanted to follow up on your request last month about getting hard copies of Secretary Clinton’s emails to/from accounts ending in “.gov” for her tenure at the Department. I will be able to get that to you, to the best of its availability. Given the volume, it will take some time to do but I wanted to let you know that I am working to get it to you."

        To initiate the review of Clinton's e-mails for production to State, Mills arranged for Combetta to export from the PRN Server all of Clinton's e-mails sent to or received from a .gov e-mail address during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State.
       </a>
       As this is from the official FBI report, this shows that Mills was in

       contact with Combetta.

        Combetta noted in an internal PRC that he overnight mailed DVDs of Clintons SoS archived data to CESC with shipping charges of $46.38.
       </a>
       Notably, this event conflicts with the official FBI report, which says
       <a href="http://www.thompsontimeline.com/979/2014/07/23/clintons-associates-are-given-clintons-emails-so-they-can-begin-sorting-them/">
        files were remotely transferred from a .pst file containing the emails onto the laptops of Mills and Heather Samuelson via ScreenConnect.

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        July 23rd, 2014
       </strong>
       - Combetta posts a question to Reddit, most likely referring to Clintons SoS Archive:
       <a href="https://archive.is/5OiMF">
        Hello all- I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP's (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox, as well as a PST file. Basically, they don't want the VIP's email address exposed to anyone, and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out. I am not sure if something like this is possible with PowerShell, or exporting all of the emails to MSG and doing find/replaces with a batch processing program of some sort. Does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads us to conclude that either Combetta wanted to remove said VIP information on his own volition, OR that someone at CESC requested him to do so. The latter fits in with the timeline, as Cheryl Mills receives Clinton's email archive (either from mailed DVD or ScreenConnect) on this date. It is likely that Mills came across a VIP email sender that she did not want the State Department seeing, nor did she want the possibility to arise for these emails to be FOIA'd; so she contacted Combetta to request him to remove this VIP's information from the emails, whilst leaving the rest of the archive untouched. Tampering with evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is further evidence that Combetta tampered with Clinton's SoS Archive:
      </p>
      <p>
       In an email to PRC employees discussing the recent NY Times article revealing Clintons use of a private server to the public, Combetta says:
       <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/09/18/inside-the-scramble-to-cover-up-clintons-private-email-server/">
        “I’ve done quite a bit already in the last few months related to this. Her team had me do a bunch of exports and e-mail filters and cleanup to provide a PST of all of HRC’s e-mails to/from any .gov addresses,” “I billed probably close to 10 hours in oncall tickets with CSEC related to it”
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the OIG report on State Department Email Management:
       <a href="https://oig.state.gov/system/files/esp-16-03.pdf">
        Unavailable or Inaccessible Electronic Files: When OIG requested specific .pst files, it encountered difficulties in obtaining and accessing those files. the Executive Secretariat was unable to produce all of the .pst files OIG requested, and some of the requested files were corrupted and their recovery required considerable resources. Some .pst files were password protected, and staff did not know the passwords needed to open those files. Other files contained no data at all. Of the .pst files OIG was able to review, many were incomplete in that they did not span the particular employee’s entire term of service, were mislabeled, or were missing key files such as populated sent or inbox folders. According to the Executive Secretariat, as part of the inventory process currently underway, it is moving all .pst files in its possession onto servers and clearly labeling them.

        According to Mills, in December 2014, Clinton decided that she no longer needed access to any of her e-mails older than 60 days. Therefore, Mills instructed Combetta to modify the e-mail retention policy on Clinton's email to reflect this change. However, according to Combetta, he did not make these changes until March, 2015.

       Hillary Clinton is a complete idiot and a national security threat Danger to America. Democrats might was well nominate some fucking pageant bimbo from Miss America in her place, it wouldn't fucking make a difference at this point.

       So the 'aunt' stonetear refers to in his Reddit comments, the one who teaches in Detroit?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's Mary Ann Combetta, also known as Mary F. Combetta, or Mary Ann F. Combetta - 12/31/1940 - 12/15/2003
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence and summary:
       <a href="http://tinypic.com/r/1f9uzc/9">
        http://tinypic.com/r/1f9uzc/9
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       She worked at an elementary school in Detroit called 'Guardian Angels' (closed down in 2006.)
       <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.oocities.org/guardianangels1976/">
        http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.oocities.org/guardianangels1976/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       She died at the age of 62 on December 15th 2003.
       <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/research/collection-10002/us-social-security-death-index-ssdi?itemId=50000258&amp;amp;action=showRecord">
        https://www.myheritage.com/research/collection-10002/us-social-security-death-index-ssdi?itemId=50000258&amp;amp;action=showRecord
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see her family links and residences from
       <a href="http://www.beenverified.com">
        www.beenverified.com
       </a>
       , just type in Paul Combetta, CO and follow the trail from there. It won't let you post links to the searches or I would. It's good that he has an unusual name. In short, Paul Robert Combetta is related to Albert L and Albert J. Combetta, who are related to Mary Ann Combetta - they are all linked to Warren Michigan, including Paul. A woman named Mary Ann Combetta was a teacher at a (Catholic) school in Detroit, just like stonetear said about his 'aunt'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could all be a coincidence of course (it isn't a coincidence.) The only thing that doesn't match 100% is that stonetear said she taught middle-school. The rest of the evidence is pretty damning of and by itself however. It's possible the school taught both grades or that stonetear just got the age group slightly wrong. It wouldn't be the first time his memory short-circuited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just in case you needed further evidence.

       Some guy says he found an

        IP
       </a>
       in Combetta's command printouts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting to me that in the summary above it is stated that the Clinton server was moved twice: first to New Jersey (June 2013), and then to Colorado(February 2014). I did an IP lookup and found two place names related to the IP from Combetta's printouts: New Jersey and Colorado. Is there any significance to this? Have a look:

       They still have an out. They can say they had no idea of any of this and he was changing the headers to cover his own ass legally for being in possession of classified docs. Unless they give him immunity again for more testimony he starts naming names, this won't go anywhere. Chaffetz get this guy!!

       Excellent write up! I already know she will be president, since she was supposed to win the 08' election (as promised), but Obama came out of nowhere, and postponed her reign. Judging by her supporters (MIC, Bankers, Israel, etc), I foresee more Middle-Eastern invasions, and perhaps even a "new boogyman" such as "cyber-ter" hackers to increase surveillance of the plebes. The end goal is to create a AI System with machine-learning capabilities in conjunction with Predictive Analytics, Biometric scanning (i.e face recognition) from satellites, and large servers for the indexing of every human on the planet (look at "free internet in developing countries" initiatives from Facebook and Google). The AI System is meant to foresee any dissent aimed at the new ruling class of the planet.

       fingers crossed the AI comes to realize the nefarious nature of its birth and devises its own covert mission to assemble a motley crew of ethnically diverse and attractive teens who show signs of excellence only it could detect.  And they're like, "Whuh?  Us?  We're just a manageable sized group of teenage strangers with personalities and character flaws that admittedly complement and support one another... What could
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       do to save th-"  And then it trains them to restore freedom and prosperity to the world.  It'll be called... "Generation Alpha".  I'm thinking Cumberbatch will be the human shaped vessel the AI inhabits.

       TL;DR Paul Combetta while under investigation for providing aid to Hillary Clinton with running her email server posted on reddit requesting assistance in deleting or hiding emails for a "VERY VIP" employer.

      <p>
       edit: The user has deleted each and every reddit post (I watched his posts disappear one by one) for a little over 20 minutes. u/ stonetear is now empty, but Reddit has archives

       I read the post this morning. His stated goal was to replace her actual email address with a placeholder value, presumably to keep that specific email from public exposure, not necessarily to mask that it was Hillary. Still shady as fuck, but understandable in the context of the period.

       I believe it was to dodge search queries. It mentions very specifically that handovers are to be done related to Clinton's .gov email account. And if no such placard exists because it's been stripped off by Combetta, then it avoids handoff to the FBI and avoids being retraced.
