<p>Doctors aren&#39;t evil corporate powers, they&#39;re just kids that grew up interested in health and go on to study the Field. They are in it for something more than just money.
Yes mistakes were made and many obscene things happened in the.medical past. But lets not forget that all those events listed occurred when black people still didn&#39;t have the vote...</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, and that is my whole point. We need open discussion and truthful investigation into the issue. We have been intentionally polarized into Pro-Vaccine and anti vax, no grey areas allowed. Why? Because when the pharmaceutical companies say jump they want people to jump, rather than asking pertinent and valid questions. They don&#39;t like questions, and have engineered the public ignorance and witch hunting phenomenon to deal with those that have completely valid reasons to question their methods, manufacturing process, and ingredients. People have a right to know and to question.</p>

<p>Yes, its called &quot;an understanding of both sides of an issue&quot;.  I used that to &quot;form my decisions about the topic at hand&quot;. Have you ever heard about that process?  Anyone that understands science or accumulation of knowledge would agree that&#39;s how its done. You, on the other hand, have educated yourself in the issue how? Exactly. Trolling people on the internet and being intentionally obtuse doesn&#39;t really educate you much, other than learning how to be a bigger piece of crap than you were yesterday. I&#39;m not wasting any more time on a government apologist whom doesn&#39;t even understand what merits his perceived side of the issue even has, let alone the opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, hey! Do you remember when the vaccine industry injected over 98 MILLION Americans with a polio vaccine which was contaminated with SV - 40 virus? You know, that monkey virus that has been scientifically proven to cause cancer in a wide variety of mammals? That was awesome! What a fantastic occurrence in the timeline of an industry that most people just follow unquestioningly. People tell me I&#39;m stupid, but most of them are entirely ignorant and just following the crowd like grade school kids.</p>

<p>So, sorry to rain on your idiot troll parade, but wanting this to not be true won&#39;t change reality one bit. Always cracks me up when ignorant fools like you  go around calling people &quot;dumb&quot;.</p>

<p>Doctors aren&#39;t evil corporate powers, they&#39;re just kids that grew up interested in health and go on to study the Field. They are in it for something more than just money.
Yes mistakes were made and many obscene things happened in the.medical past. But lets not forget that all those events listed occurred when black people still didn&#39;t have the vote...</p>
