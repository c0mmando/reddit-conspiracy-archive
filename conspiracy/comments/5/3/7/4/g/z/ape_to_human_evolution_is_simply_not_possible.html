       The difference between the Y-chromosomes of Humans and Chimpanzees, proves that evolution from apes to humans is not plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.scienceagainstevolution.org/images/v14i5g1.jpg">

      </p>
      <p>
       The Human Y chromosome contains double the number genes than on the
       <a href="http://www.icr.org/article/new-chromosome-research-undermines/">
        Chimpanzee Y chromosome.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In other words, the chimp was lacking approximately half of the genes found on a human Y chromosome.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The human Y chromosome has twice as many genes as the Chimpanzee Y chromosome.  Humans have 41 more genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that in order for the ape Y chromosome to evolve into the human Y chromosome, apes had to add 41 genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for apes to add genes, they would have to have a genetic mechanism to generate new genes and insert them into their chromosomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But apes do not have any "gene generating system."
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor do apes have a "gene insertion system."
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that "ape to human evolution" theory is missing the genetic mechanisms necessary for evolution to actually take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is
       <strong>
        ABSOLUTE CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE

       Nobody claims humans evolved from chimpanzees (or apes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chimpanzees and humans evolved from a common ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we go far enough back in time, humans and bananas also have a common ancestor, but evolution doesn't claim we evolved from bananas.

       I love it when a religious person tells me they do not believe in evolution and I ask them "What is evolution?".  I get a blank stare.  They do not know what evolution is.  They were just told to not believe in it.

       Has any biologist ever made the claim that humans evolved from apes? I have very limited knowledge in this field but I've always been under the impression that we evolved from Australopithicus or Homo Erectus or something and chimpanzees and such co-evolved from one of our primate ancestors. Am I misunderstanding your use of the word 'ape'?

       The Hominidae, whose members are known as great apes or hominids, are a taxonomic family of primates that includes seven extant species in four genera: Pongo, the Bornean and Sumatran orangutan; Gorilla, the eastern and western gorilla; Pan, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo; and Homo, the human and near-human ancestors and relatives (e.g., the Neanderthal).

       This would all be great (if I were true) if chimps and apes today were the animals we evolved from.   You Have to understand humans aren't the only species to evolve.  And it is possible to evolve  in more than one direction.

       No, what I mean is the apes and chimps we know today are not the same as the apes and chimps we evolved from.  Apes today and the apes we evolved from couldn't even reproduce with each other.  That's how different they are.

       When you really get into the meat and fat of evolution it's hard to understand.  I still don't quite get it either, but I'm pretty sure it's the way things work and it's a brilliant system designed by a very smart creator.

       Check out the aqustic ape theory. Might make human evolution more understandable. If you're not a religious fundamentalist that is.

       I read about a tribe living on an island that did lots of diving for food gathering and that had a different gene that removed the correction error humans normally have when looking under water. The could see shapes just about as good under water as above.

       It's ironic that in the end, the modern science-enthusiast is no less rigid in his thinking than the religious zealot, I see it everywhere, bold claims of objectivity yet when it comes to defending their scientific claims, all notions of scientific rigor are immediately dropped and bold, loud ad-hominems are tossed. The reason is because the modern science-enthusiast is no less religious, he is just indoctrinated into a different religion, the doctrine of scientism. The belief that modern science is so fundamentally correct that there is no use in questioning the commonly accepted dogma. No use in questioning it, even though it is so clearly outrageous and unscientific, and even though physics should be a complete laughing stock to anyone who could focus on the gibberish long enough to realize that it so clearly has traversed into the realm of sorcery. Remember physics is supposed to provide a mechanical, physical explanation of the phenomena around us. They have abandoned all but the faintest notion of such a definition, because nothing is physical about physics today. But when you question it, you are made to sound like the loon, when it is my job to question it. It is everyone's job to question science, because it should only be considered as fact when it can stand up to opposition.

       Well put. I believe in science and scientific methods but modern science has little to do with that. Otherwise there would be physicists marching on the street protesting the ludicrous 9/11 investigation. Science is bought and corrupted beyond repair.

       I don't believe humans evolved at all. We are out of place. We don't fit into any natural selection category. If we had to evolve, we are pretty fucking low on food chain. We get owned standing toe to toe with any apex predator. All we do is destroy the natural world, animals that evolved on this planet all fit into some niche in the food chain and live in a symbiotic relationship with other animals.

       As for humans, I am more of the ancient astronaut or alien intervention theories.

       That isn't all we do; my observation is that, in their natural state, people love nature, and want to care for it. All that changes when they are frightened though, and they become slaves to the monstrous; that's why we have the terror state.

      <p>
       The Hominidae, whose members are known as great apes or hominids, are a taxonomic family of primates that includes seven extant species in four genera: Pongo, the Bornean and Sumatran orangutan; Gorilla, the eastern and western gorilla; Pan, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo; and Homo, the human and near-human ancestors and relatives (e.g., the Neanderthal).

       Which conspiracies do you believe? If you take the red pill, the rabbit hole goes deep. Evolution is a lie created by the global elite. I'm not religious at all. I believed in evolution until spending time in this sub. It's up to you to go down the rabbit hole though. It takes steps to get to evolution. Once you see just how much is a lie, the issue of evolution being a lie is actually pretty easy to understand. For example when you realize that Sandy Hook was a lie, it is easy to see that the Boston Bombing was a lie. Once you see that the Boston Bombing was a lie, it's easy to see that all of the school/church shootings are a lie. Once you can spot the false flags...then you look at 9/11 and your mind gets blown wide open. Then JFK. Then the moon. Then NASA. Then Vaccines. GMO's. Flouride.
      </p>
      <p>
       FUCK!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have a nervous breakdown and leave the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you come back. Because you think it can't get any worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are so fucking wrong! The rabbit hole just keeps going. And shit get's insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution being a lie is not the bottom of the rabbit hole. It gets scary.

       But you only believe that because you were told it a million times. You were told only crazy people don't believe in evolution. I can't prove to you that evolution is real and you can't prove to me it isn't. We really on TPTB to spoon feed us information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I realize this is a futile conversation. You aren't even CLOSE to being able to contemplate a world were evolution and NASA and Flouride and Vaccines are lies.

       But evolution is definitely provable. Give me a few hours to get to a computer and we can discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mean time, give me some links showing me that evolution is falsified. You're saying evolution is a lie, well, Citation needed.

       You don't understand the foundation of this argument. I completely see your perspective. I'm an engineer. Mid 30s. Been a believer in evolution my entire life. I see your side. You don't see mine. I can't provide proof. But neither can you. You absolutely can't. The scientific method is pure but science is full of lies.

       For example, do believe politics is real? Well it isn't. It's all a show. Same with science.

       I completely understand how you see my side and I don't see yours. Which is why I asked for links. Do you just think "government says it's true" is enough to disbelieve it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also currently reading an anti-evolution book. It's a joke. I can poke holes in all of his arguments.

       The grand conspiracy man. I have come to believe that everything we are told is a lie. By a sinister evil satanic cult race of psychopaths that have been in control of humanity for ages. I'm not the kind of guy that is trying to convince others with the literally thousands of links that lead me to this place. I'd start at sandy hook. That's a big lie man. And obvious as hell. Boston too. Huge lie. Obvious as hell. 9/11. Enormous lie. Obvious as fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each step gets you closer and closer. Each step is easy because of the steps before it. I don't think I can convince you that the world is flat. But I'm pretty sure you can see Boston was fake. Go look at Sandy Hook and Boston.

       I know that Boston, Sandy hook and 911 were false flags. The earth is not flat. I'd love to see this one.

       But you just saying I don't believe it because the government  says it doesn't really tell me anything.

       Okay. So you know that high ranking members of the United States government were planners and conspirators to 9/11.

       That's pretty sick, right? Pretty audacious? Pretty ballsy? Almost unthinkable?

       Next step in the rabbit hole might be NASA. Start with the moon landing. Obviously faked.

       JFK.

       Then just keep going.

       Eventually you realize that the global elite psychopath cult is real. Call them the illuminati (because that is what they are).

       Once you realize they control everything, then you question everything.

       I love it when a religious person tells me they do not believe in evolution and I ask them "What is evolution?".  I get a blank stare.  They do not know what evolution is.  They were just told to not believe in it.

       That isn't all we do; my observation is that, in their natural state, people love nature, and want to care for it. All that changes when they are frightened though, and they become slaves to the monstrous; that's why we have the terror state.
