       Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post. It's not so much a conspiracy but more my personal experience on the matter. I've done some research and as always there's mixed opinions on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the last year my girlfriend (whom I share a house with) and several other of my friends are convinced that this is the only explanation for the amount of times we've received an ad on Facebook several minutes after talking about that exact topic with our phones in our presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has happened at least 20 times since July, so much so that we've all abandoned the fb apps and messenger and reverted to the basic mobile site, yet it's still happening. Before anyone says anything along the lines of 'you've probably searched it in the past', we're talking about really obscure and things that we've never even heard of before that particular conversation that then suddenly appears afterwards. Most recently (yesterday) I was in a meeting with my CS lecturer, where he introduced me to a obscure statistical analysis package which I'd never heard of and definitely haven't searched anything related to it before, and on the bus ride back I had an ad thrust in my face for that EXACT package I'd hadn't heard of 10 minutes prior, except I had my phone out at the time to check my work rota to arrange the next meeting. This kind of thing happens almost weekly.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's going on here? We don't receive any ads related to our conversations when we keep our phones and all tech out of the room, however when it's in the room we get ads related to our conversations. Seems far too coincidental.

       This isn't a conspiracy, though. It's actually very well-documented... in the terms of service or EULA of every piece of software or tech.

       Forgive me, I was going to post this in a few other subs but it violated certain community guidelines. Where should I post this? Also I'm aware it's in the ToS, however Facebook has gone on record stating that they do not use it in that manner for ad placement.

       Yes, they most definitely can. Apps such as Siri are listening 24/7 because that's the only way the work. Facebook probably takes it to the next level. They probably have everyone's faces and voices mapped out and have consistent access to anyone's device, thus they are able to track anyone anywhere, even through other peoples phones. They then sell some of the information to advertisers for plausible deniability and then use the real juicy stuff for mass social engineering in tandem with the military industrial complex.

       Some family members and myself were sat around the dinner table, discussing conferencing and how it has changed in the past few years. How commonplace it was to now video call.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason or other, everyone else thought we could improve on the technology with a device that sits in the center of a table, uses clear speakers and creates a holographic image of the person at the table with you. I dismissed the idea, but suggested a good name would be the "Holo-Cube".
      </p>
      <p>
       The next day facebook was advertising a product with that exact name that was in no way related to any product I had searched in the past, so there was no other basis for them to show me that ad aside from having been listening.

       For what its worth. It has been happening to me for about 3 years and I do not have Facebook on my phone. I am pretty sure it has been from my Amazon app.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically, I've talked about something and then within the following day will receive an email from Amazon with links to items without ever having searched for them. It has happened WAY too many times to be a coincidence.

       I do have the Google app as well as Google maps on my phone. It could certainly be google.  Although, I haven't noticed target adds except for the emails I get directly from Amazon.

       Something similar has been happening to me and now its just getting weird.  I'm always on my phone looking for information. (mostly for Monster Hunter) but I always use the Google Bar app thing to search shit. For instance, I see what item I need for something, type in the first two or three letters, and the EXACT THING I'm thinking of us always the first option. 
I don't know if this is a coincidence or not, but my mom mentioned something, I type in the first letter or two and the EXACT THING she said, what I'm searching, is the first option. How can the phone know? It's like it's always watching.

       They certainly do it for TV too!  I will casually mention to my wife that we should take a trip to Mexico and bam.  Next ad is for a trip to a Resort.  Or, I'll even be craving pistachios, and behind home plate of the game is an ad for my pistachio brand.  It's creepy.  The thing is, my upstairs TV isn't a smart TV, and my phone can be in the next room.  So how are they mining this information??

       Depending on how good the mic on your phone is, it's possible it could pick up a conversation in thee next room.  On the listeners end they use programs like echo cancellation, noise suppression and audio equalizers to fine tune the sounds.
       <br/>
       But I can't explain the ads that target things you've only thought, not vocalized or searched for.

       We know that Facebook records audio when it's active, but what I want to know is how they could possibly process all the data and create any useful information ? 
And how do they create a transcript of your conversation that's accurate enough you can be targeted with very specific ads ?

       Two of my most recent examples of this happening
      </p>
      <p>
       -Went shopping at Burkes to buy a bra. Bought some brand I have never heard of before. Payed with cash. Got in the car, checked Twitter, and bam. There's that brand. (I forgot the brand name)
-Was sitting in the living room with a friend, she said something about how someone was bringing us Chick Fil A for dinner that night. Shortly after that, I was on the Trivia Crack app, (yes, Trivia Crack) and there's an ad for Chick Fil A.
      </p>
      <p>
       It happens too often for that to not be the case.

       Funny thing... last week I was singing in the shower and came up with a new (silly) version of "Hey hey, we're the Monkees..." (different tune). Afterward, I sang it into my Evernote app to remember it. 30 minutes later I got an email from Amazon telling me of a special deal on a Monkees boxed set.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I've not bought any oldies on Amazon or anything to warrant this email.

       My GF got a bearded dragon (a lizard). I've never owned such a thing before in my life - in fact, it's way out of my norm. I'm a cat person, and once I had birds in the distant past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we got him, we were discussing how to keep him warm and I was mentioning that they had those electric heater pads you put under their tank. I had never shopped for anything like this before.  I opened up Amazon on my PC and, lo and behold, it was the first thing on my suggested items list.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can think of two possibilities here: either her texting with her friend about bringing over the lizard was monitored, or one of our devices was listening to our conversations.  There are no coincidences. I have never in my life had an animal like this one and never would have, except for a random chain of events that led him to being given to us because of someone that I have never met in person needing to move.
      </p>

       For the record, I have an android and I don't have FB installed on my phone. She has an iphone and she does have the FB app installed.

       Hackers are looking for this. We sandbox phones and devices, record the SSL certificates and the handshakes, and we snoop on the traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Portable devices don't have the horsepower needed or the memory to do real time, on device speech to text. The audio itself must be transmitted to a server which decodes it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes the attack surface very predictable.
      </p>
      <p>
       On home devices, you could tie up a processor and fit the data files necessary to do this on the fly, locally... to just send the translated text. For this, too, sand-boxing is an effective way to detect the malfeasance.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no widespread airgapping technology, so for now... everything you send to siri or everything you google is potentially public. I haven't heard of anyone catching a Television sending audio or video data, except as the terms and conditions permit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check the terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot sneak this into a device without hackers detecting it. However, lots of devices have agreements which allow them to do this... but typically not cell phones.
