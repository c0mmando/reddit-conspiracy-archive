       I just posted more comments, it's an NP reddit so there is no participation. In all honesty this post is way too deep for most people. If you know people who would entertain these thoughts and do not like the slave life I suggest you send it to them. I have done hard shadow work to see a lot of this world is illusion including the way people treat each other. I wish to share this knowledge with as many people as possible because it is the way to be saved. I believe Satan is going to get here on october fourth and from that time we will have 3.5-7 years to save as many people as possible. As you can see people are extremely brain washed if that is the truth. If that is the truth you will likely see about 80-90% of the population going to hell. I believe our reality is entirely inter changeable and once they leave we will recreate it and either enter a new reality we refer to as heaven, or we will inherit the earth and be able to do whatever we wish. I also just wrote massive write ups in the comments I suggest you read them as well. Thank you for the kind words my friend.

       He may not be but I know people are saying since 9/11 is depicted in back to the future there is a second date that is 10/4. From my occult research I would say it would be that number because it's also from the movie and has not come up yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the military and others use "10/4 over and out" which does not seem to have an origin other than it was invented. Occult knowledge leads me to believe they are leaving hints. The bible also leads me to believe. I believe 2012 is when the fake reality began. I am not sure if I am also a victim to the false reality or if this is all there is. Cern is going to open portals and apparently judging from my research they have been able to pull demons to our dimension from other dimensions. Physical form demons not just the alien entities that currently exist here. It is speculation but judging from how much deception is currently on going I would assume something massive with the deception and Aliens is coming very soon.

       Edit: For the record too all I had a very good paying job straight out of high school. Kept it for over a year but then gave up to move on. Just because I have experienced life differently and am able to see through the lies perpetuated by society people who are discontent will always try to bring you down. It's fine you can read his words and see how empty they are. Smoke weed all you want, rest assured I am not delusional because I haven't taken any drugs in over a month. Drugs are very useful for doing shadow work just don't think you're crazy for whatever reason. I have always held a grip of the world and myself. For that reason even though I have changed my character I am still the same person and people who have known me my whole life can talk to me and not know what I have done.

       lol. Your words don't affect me. I have never gone a psychotic break down thank you. I also didn't lose my job I quit. I also am happy nearly 100% of the time. And not the fake happiness you believe you have. I have true happiness where I believe everything around me to be already perfect. I wish more people to see the light. Where the light shines there must be darkness, you're the darkness to my light it's okay. :) everything is Gods creation and you are just here so that people like yourself can have someone to relate to. The kingdom of heaven is not for all.

       If you open that video straight away if you look on the globe you can see there is a continent beside australia. It just so happens the Carnac stones point there. It also so happens if it's a real place it's been deleted from every map known to man. Malaysia flight could have also gone missing and flown to that location.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like a triple coincidence.

       It really intrigued me to see a globe with a piece of land exactly where I had plotted this information a month earlier.

       See in the globe at the very start of the video there is a piece of land directly to the left of australia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then look at the picture of the last comment. Everything points to there being a continent there hidden away. :) no problemo further explanation available to any person any age any level of comprehension I will do my very best to explain anything I can :)

       In an episode of ancient aliens they claimed the carnac stones pointed to a land where the prophets went to the Gods. Apparently the land has been hidden away forever but hints are left for prophets to find. Since it's end times all truth is coming to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I am suggesting there is land exactly where it is showing. Since the government is in control of everything it is possible it's all being hidden away.
