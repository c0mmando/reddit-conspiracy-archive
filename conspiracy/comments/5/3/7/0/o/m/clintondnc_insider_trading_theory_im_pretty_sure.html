       It's well-known that there's a folder in the Guccifer 2.0 leaks titled, "CNBC," which is filled with info on stocks and equities. I'm thinking here's what happened:
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton knew
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what she was going to say during CNBC interviews to affect stocks in the DNC portfolio. That's why the folder is named 'CNBC,' because it correlates with her media speeches to them. As
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeASr3fTx5k">
        she pointed out here
       </a>
       , "words [of running candidates or presidents] have the power to move markets." She said this in criticism of Trump talking about Fed rates... but I think she talks about it in part because she uses it to her advantage all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to be trying to correlate the stocks in the folders with her CNBC interviews and see if anything matches up. I haven't opened the file yet (just learned how to dl the DNC leaked documents), but I'm thinking there's something there.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, there's already been sneaking suspicion that her words are promoting insider trading, as evident by a Wall Street Bets observation
       <em>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4zflck/i_wish_i_was_hillary_clintons_official_tweeter/">
         here
        </a>
       </em>
       , in which someone (or some organization, perhaps) became $56k richer on what looked to be a long-shot, highly improbable short. It was also noted
       <em>
        <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/24/biotech-gains-amid-buyout-chatter-upbeat-clinical-trial-results.html">
         here
        </a>
       </em>
       that her speech on EpiPens had an immediate effect on the biotech market.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if my hunch is correct, I think she uses her speeches to the media as a quick way to infuse cash to her campaign. Technically, all she has to do is make a strongly worded speech and
       <em>
        boom
       </em>
       , instant money that looks totally legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll see what I can find out, and hopefully y'all will investigate with me. Happy hunting!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Thanks for the gold! I'll try not to let you down in my hunt!

       Yes, this is the type of dot connecting that needs to happen. Excellent work. If I had a computer I could crash on a separate wifi network I'd download and give it a shot myself, but the security implications of bringing that file into my home network is too much for me.

       Please go through this and document any correlations you find - this is important work!

       Just do it on a Linux distro on a thumbdrive or CD so that nothing gets written to your disk drive. Your ISP and FB sells you out to the Feds anyway, and supposedly the NSA is capturing all internet traffic.

       Hm, the first thing I notice that's unusual is that these files were made July 5th, but they relate to Sept 5-23rd's earnings of various companies. This means they put in their bets, on these specific stocks, quite early in the game. She'd cinched her nomination by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next thing I realized is that CNBC has programming almost entirely dedicated to financial markets. That's... interesting. I didn't know that (but to others it might've been obvious, I guess).
      </p>
      <p>
       Third point: these are weird, unconventional stocks. Burlington Coat Factory? Natuzzi? Cracker Barrel? These are strange bets. We're not exactly talking standard blue chips like Coke and Microsoft, here....
      </p>
      <p>
       Last point: There's B, D, A in the column of "Time" with one "U". I can't figure out what these are, except maybe "before, during, after" or, "buy, drop, ?" Are these letters some common finance lingo terms that I'm just not getting?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to bed (different time zone for me), but it looks like I'll have a fun filled day of watching CNBC tapes tomorrow and seeing if they make any sense when compared to this spreadsheet. Oh, and Clinton tweets, speeches, posts, etc.

       Immediately stocks in the guccifer dox:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        construction firm stocks like halliburton, fluor daniel, increase 3 points
       </li>
       <li>
        mcdonalds stock increases 1.2 points
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       If anything it says to me that the stock market is a tightly coupled echo chamber, casino, and shitshow of musical chairs,  and you'd be best to stay out of it unless you're making money with mostly other peoples money.

       oh, password for this is (GuCCif3r_2.0).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're looking at this wondering what the hell a magnet link is--like I was yesterday--here are steps: download uTorrent and TheUnarchiver (you can use 7zx but this might be more useful because it handles many other formats).
      </p>
      <p>
       In uTorrent, go to File&lt;Open Torrent from URL. Then copy and paste that giant magnet link into it. It'll download. Then, if it doesn't ask you for a password immediately, you'll need to right-click and make sure you "open with" the correct program, UnArchive or 7xz. This might be common sense but I stupidly wondered why it wasn't opening when I just kept clicking on it (I'm not a tech savvy person, as you might've gathered).
      </p>
      <p>
       When I did it this way, however, the files were corrupted probably because of my pisspoor internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible to get it by downloading it from here: mega.nz/#!uwBGyCoQ

       But I absolutely love your theory and it actually makes a LOT of sense with what I've found in regards to her email server.  I'm an IT Manager by trade, and have set up dozens of email servers like the one she has, and her explanations are complete bullshit.

       I always had a hunch it was related to the Clinton Foundation, and your hunch fits in perfectly.

       I'm working one day at a time, starting with the first day of the file, and it's curious that on September 5th they listed 2 Johannesburg, South Africa stocks. The Clinton Foundation is very much involved in this region. One of the stocks received an abnormally high jump during this week in Sept and I haven't looked at the other yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll keep you posted if I can find anything else concerning these stocks--I haven't yet looked at news coverage, so there's a lot more to this story.

       Funny thing that may or may not be related re:Epipen, just another little crumb - the CEO is WV Gov Joe Manchin's daughter. Joe Manchin and Clinton embraced at the 9/11 ceremony.
