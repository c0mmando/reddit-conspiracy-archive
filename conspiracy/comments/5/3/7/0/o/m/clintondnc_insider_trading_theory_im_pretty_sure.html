        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s well-known that there&#39;s a folder in the Guccifer 2.0 leaks titled, &quot;CNBC,&quot; which is filled with info on stocks and equities. I&#39;m thinking here&#39;s what happened:</p>

<p>Clinton knew <em>exactly</em> what she was going to say during CNBC interviews to affect stocks in the DNC portfolio. That&#39;s why the folder is named &#39;CNBC,&#39; because it correlates with her media speeches to them. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeASr3fTx5k">she pointed out here</a>, &quot;words [of running candidates or presidents] have the power to move markets.&quot; She said this in criticism of Trump talking about Fed rates... but I think she talks about it in part because she uses it to her advantage all the time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to be trying to correlate the stocks in the folders with her CNBC interviews and see if anything matches up. I haven&#39;t opened the file yet (just learned how to dl the DNC leaked documents), but I&#39;m thinking there&#39;s something there.</p>

<p>To be clear, there&#39;s already been sneaking suspicion that her words are promoting insider trading, as evident by a Wall Street Bets observation <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/4zflck/i_wish_i_was_hillary_clintons_official_tweeter/">here</a></em>, in which someone (or some organization, perhaps) became $56k richer on what looked to be a long-shot, highly improbable short. It was also noted <em><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/24/biotech-gains-amid-buyout-chatter-upbeat-clinical-trial-results.html">here</a></em> that her speech on EpiPens had an immediate effect on the biotech market. </p>

<p>So if my hunch is correct, I think she uses her speeches to the media as a quick way to infuse cash to her campaign. Technically, all she has to do is make a strongly worded speech and <em>boom</em>, instant money that looks totally legal.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll see what I can find out, and hopefully y&#39;all will investigate with me. Happy hunting!</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold! I&#39;ll try not to let you down in my hunt!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm, the first thing I notice that&#39;s unusual is that these files were made July 5th, but they relate to Sept 5-23rd&#39;s earnings of various companies. This means they put in their bets, on these specific stocks, quite early in the game. She&#39;d cinched her nomination by now.</p>

<p>Next thing I realized is that CNBC has programming almost entirely dedicated to financial markets. That&#39;s... interesting. I didn&#39;t know that (but to others it might&#39;ve been obvious, I guess).</p>

<p>Third point: these are weird, unconventional stocks. Burlington Coat Factory? Natuzzi? Cracker Barrel? These are strange bets. We&#39;re not exactly talking standard blue chips like Coke and Microsoft, here....</p>

<p>Last point: There&#39;s B, D, A in the column of &quot;Time&quot; with one &quot;U&quot;. I can&#39;t figure out what these are, except maybe &quot;before, during, after&quot; or, &quot;buy, drop, ?&quot; Are these letters some common finance lingo terms that I&#39;m just not getting? </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to bed (different time zone for me), but it looks like I&#39;ll have a fun filled day of watching CNBC tapes tomorrow and seeing if they make any sense when compared to this spreadsheet. Oh, and Clinton tweets, speeches, posts, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh, password for this is (GuCCif3r_2.0).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking at this wondering what the hell a magnet link is--like I was yesterday--here are steps: download uTorrent and TheUnarchiver (you can use 7zx but this might be more useful because it handles many other formats).</p>

<p>In uTorrent, go to File&lt;Open Torrent from URL. Then copy and paste that giant magnet link into it. It&#39;ll download. Then, if it doesn&#39;t ask you for a password immediately, you&#39;ll need to right-click and make sure you &quot;open with&quot; the correct program, UnArchive or 7xz. This might be common sense but I stupidly wondered why it wasn&#39;t opening when I just kept clicking on it (I&#39;m not a tech savvy person, as you might&#39;ve gathered).</p>

<p>When I did it this way, however, the files were corrupted probably because of my pisspoor internet. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to get it by downloading it from here: mega.nz/#!uwBGyCoQ   </p>
