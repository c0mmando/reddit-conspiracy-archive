    <div class="md"><p>Back in the 90s, two separate &quot;feel good&quot; pieces on the nightly news.</p>

<p>The first was a story about a stray cat that started living at an elementary school. It came to school every day, hung around the classroom, then left the afternoon. Eventually the kids named it Room 8 after the classroom he visited. Also, every summer the cat would vanish, and return to the school the next year. </p>

<p>The news piece showed the school, the cat, everything. The only problem? The story was copied from a <a href="http://www.room8cats.org/index.cfm/felinaria/room8/">real story and children&#39;s book</a> from the 50&#39;s. Exact same story, same cat name, everything. </p>

<p>The other was a piece about a terminally ill kid who sent out a request for Christmas cards from strangers, and received hundreds of them. I had the newspaper clipping from when he died the previous year. </p>

<p>The game feel-good pieces still bother me more than faked &quot;real&quot; news for some reason.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re missing the point by thinking about &quot;what it is covering up&quot;.</p>

<p>Instead, assume that there isn&#39;t anything to be covered up for a minute. Imagine what it would mean if mass programming were simply faked for the purpose of showing people a fake story told simply to make them feel good. </p>

<p>The idea of manipulation on that scale is far more frightening to me than something simply being covered up.</p>

<p>The Romans split the jesuits in half by scribbling up a bunch of fake stuff and saying it was the word of god.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why they have to hire cass sunstein to harass us all online.  They are desperate now to shut us down.  To continually insert conspiracy theories and antisemites (it&#39;s the JEWS) in our midst so that casual observers / tourists will be scared and leave.  Turns out, though, Israeli intelligence was indeed involved in 911.  But they&#39;ve brainwashed the public from even being able to say that.  However, they&#39;ve gone overboard and overdone it and now people are seeing the censorship and oppressoin and they aren&#39;t putting up with it, as it&#39;s deeply anti-american to disallow even assholes to talk.</p>

<p>Benjamin &quot;Netanyahu&quot;&#39;s real name is Benjamin Milikovsky - so when people say: Jews are 1-2% of dour population and OBVIOUSLY over represented in places of power - it&#39;s not anti Semitic. They aren&#39;t Semites. It&#39;s anti evil corruption. And it IS evil. Because they kill for their power.

And we believe this by backtracing COG plans which were the real reason as this plan is still being abused by obama on behalf of neoliberal 1% as of 2012 powershift in washington </p>

<p>Kennedy had to die that day. First they had a few snipers that tried to take him out from behind and from the sides. The last resort was to stop the car and have him shot from close distance. That made it a tad bit harder to use Oswald as a patsy, but they pulled it off with all hands helping in the machine.</p>

Another is called &quot;Evidence of Revision&quot; part 1, and also Dark Legacy George Bush and the murder of JFK.

<p>and this documentary is called Hypothesis:
<a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/hypothesis/">http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/hypothesis/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s very, very good as well.  It&#39;s about a respected scientist and college professor being fired for discovering the nano thermite particles.  Do not believe the hologram or nuclear 9/11 people.  That is disinfo designed to poison the well, so that someone newly investigating this mass murder on american soil will go away confused and stop believing it could be a conspiracy.</p>

<p>What you will find when you&#39;ve looked for yourself will cause you sleepless nights, it will enrage you.  But you will know the truth.  That truth once you broaden this knowledge even further is that another country runs this country.  Seems absurd, doesn&#39;t it?  Well, if you pursue the truth, you will face this reality.  I&#39;ll leave it at that. (PS, there&#39;s also disinfo about this, where people will try to tell you some mysterious black pope runs everything.  That&#39;s horseshit. Suffice it to say, misdirection is employed whenever someone gets near the truth.  I&#39;ve really seen this at work, many times now.)</p>

<p>These are not necessarily in any order, but I would probably start with The New Pearl Harbor.  There are many others now, that are very, very good.  Try, &quot;Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick&quot; as well, but it begins with JFK.  It&#39;s &quot;must viewing&quot; though.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Popular theories about what destroyed the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001 are:</p>

<p>1 Fires from jet fuel and office materials weakened steel in the upper floors and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>2 Conventional controlled demolition blew out supports at the base and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>3 Thermite cut steel columns on virtually every floor and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>4 Conventional explosives blew the buildings up</p>

<p>5 Mini-nukes blew the buildings up</p>

<p>Theories 1, 2 and 3 rely on gravity to bring the buildings down while the last two blow them up. Popular theories, yes, and dead wrong.
Five facts scientifically documented in Ph.D. engineer Judy Wood’s comprehensive textbook (Where Did The Towers Go?) prove the popular theories false beyond any doubt whatsoever. Yes, I know it’s amazing. Who’d a thunk it’d be this easy?</p>

<p>THE FACTS:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>DEBRIS: What debris? There was so little debris from each 110-story building that there was no “pile” or “stack.” Rubble totaled less than a story. It was a football field as a survivor who emerged from Stairwell B, North Tower, exclaimed. No computers, toilets, and only one small piece from one Steelcase file cabinet were found. Some steel and mostly dust remained. Lack of debris on the ground from quarter-mile-high twin towers whispers “no collapse.” See Chapter 9.</p></li>
<li><p>BATHTUB: A bathtub or slurry wall surrounded 70 feet of WTC subbasements to prevent the Hudson River from flooding the WTC and downtown. If each 500,000-ton tower had slammed into the bathtub in 10 seconds or less, the protective wall would collapse. Did not happen. Upshot? Collapses did not happen. See Chapter 5.</p></li>
<li><p>SEISMIC IMPACT: “Had the towers collapsed, foundation bedrock would have experienced tremendous force hammering on it throughout the ‘collapse,’” writes Dr. Wood. Seismic instruments registered disturbances far too short in duration and far too small to record tower collapses. This was true of both the twin towers and 47-story WTC7. Again, no evidence of collapses. See Chapter 6.</p></li>
<li><p>SOUND: There were no loud explosions, as established by videos, witnesses, and the official report of NIST. Nor were there loud screeches and screams from massive metal falling, colliding, scraping and collapsing on metal. See Chapter 6.</p></li>
<li><p>DUST: Photos, videos and witness testimony show the towers turned to powder in mid-air. Tim McGinn, NYPD, said, “I was standing there for a couple of seconds thinking where the f**k is the tower? I simply couldn’t comprehend it.” The dust rollout was so enormous and thick it blocked out sunlight and left an inch or more of dust covering downtown. Much of it wafted into the upper atmosphere. The volume was incredible. Particles from dust samples were smaller than red blood cells and about the size of DNA. As for toxicity, researchers said the dust “recorded the highest levels we have ever seen in over 7,000 measurements we have made of very fine air pollution throughout the world, including Kuwait and China.” See Chapters 8, 9, 14-16.</p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>Finding out that my brother was followed and arrested by federal agents for something he didn&#39;t do in 2013, and is still being held in federal solitary confinement after the government seized his freelance political journals about things he questioned regarding China/Brazil and US/Syria at the time. 
After his arrest, it became known China and Brazil were shaking up the economic world with financial agreements, and Obama talked about bombing Syria before U.S. changes were made regarding the freelance journalists that were not employed by recognized media outlets.
When this became national news, federal investigators moved my brother to other federal facilities around the country where he was forced to take medications for mental illnesses that he never previously had, but was suddenly diagnosed with by federal employees- several months after being alone in solitary federal confinement and waking up with black eyes in corridors with missing security camera footage.</p>

<p><em>Everything Is Rigged: The Biggest Price-Fixing Scandal Ever
The Illuminati were amateurs. The second huge financial scandal of the year reveals the real international conspiracy: There&#39;s no price the big banks can&#39;t fix</em> by Matt Taibbi on April 25th 2013.</p>

<p><em>Conspiracy theorists of the world, believers in the hidden hands of the Rothschilds and the Masons and the Illuminati, we skeptics owe you an apology. You were right. The players may be a little different, but your basic premise is correct: The world is a rigged game. We found this out in recent months, when a series of related corruption stories spilled out of the financial sector, suggesting the world&#39;s largest banks may be fixing the prices of, well, just about everything.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>They pulled building 7 from the narrative because it would make too much sense. 4 planes took off, two into both towers, one into the pentagon supposedly, one into Somerset county PA. The one that was supposed to hit building 7 never reached its target. But because it was a controlled demolition it came down on schedule.  Speculation but when I saw that and every other inconsistency I just think we should look more into it.  The Wikipedia article states the target was unknown after the plane was hijacked. 4 plane hijackings and 4 buildings destroyed yet no mention of building 7 is a huge red flag</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve heard that idea. I think that practically, it matters little to me what the exact method was that was used. At least at this point; that might change in the future. But yeah, the way the WTC was built, it seemed an extremely sturdy building. I have basically zero technological knowledge so I don&#39;t know what would and wouldn&#39;t require nuclear energy, or how it would even work. But yeah, all the cases of cancer are very suspicious. I did some research on the cancer effects of asbestos, and I realized it puts you in murky territory, because as soon as you make it clear you understand asbestos can cause cancer to some extent, it&#39;s hard to make the case that you find it unlikely it was actually the cause. As far as I know though the effects of asbestos typically take decades to materlialize: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos#Health_impact">There is also a long latency period (the time taken between harmful contact and emergence of the actual resulting illness) of about 12 to 20 years,[99] and potentially up to 40 years.</a></p>

<p>But then, in 2006, the Flight 93 film came out. I didn&#39;t see it, but it came up in conversation with a friend. She said something to the effect of &quot;It&#39;s nice they&#39;re pretending the people on that flight saved the day, when they probably just shot it down.&quot; I&#39;m not sure why, but that one statement flipped a switch in my head, and I realized how much bullshit I was potentially being fed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Reports that say that something hasn&#39;t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns- the ones we don&#39;t know we don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>― Donald Rumsfeld</p>

<p>Just because it hasn&#39;t happened before, doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;d like to also just mention. I don&#39;t know if what happened to the towers was planted explosives by aliens, the Bush Administration, or even just a series of unfortunate events. I wasn&#39;t there man. My comment was specifically about a 8th grader knowing advanced engineering.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh, the OP said it, not me.  And I didn&#39;t say I knew more than structural engineers (though there are hundreds of those who think that the tower was brought down), all I said was that to me, it didn&#39;t look like any fire I&#39;ve ever seen.  And &quot;Just because it hasn&#39;t happened before, doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t happen.&quot; is a bit of a stretch when talking about something as measured and studied as this buildings and structural integrity.</p>

Men are disposable whereas women are not - one man can produce unlimited babies per year, a women can only produce one. So, evolutionarily speaking, women are designed to play it safe.

</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s funny is if you consider the original, establishment narrative of 9/11 to be a conspiracy theory (see 9/11 a conspiracy theory by james corbett), then this quote actually is very provocative, because Bush is telling us that we <em>should be fighting for 9/11 justice</em> and has confirmed our 15 yrs of effort, validating us.  </p>

<p><em>He&#39;s telling us to ignore the state&#39;s conspiracy theory, which are made of lies that shift attention from the guilty and who are the real terrorists and always have been (see right sidebar, list of confirmed conspiracies and you&#39;ll get an idea who does the most (right wing) terror in the world).</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brussels, the morning I watched it unfold I was puzzled why they were sending out photoshopped footage of the airport camera with a blast from the 2011 Moscow bombings super imposed on it, coincidentally I also watched them tweet that exact Moscow bombing footage before their other &#39;footage&#39; tweet and then claimed it was a mistake as they put out material from their &#39;archive&#39;</p>

<p>I thought I was dreaming until an article confirmed what I saw and so the rabbit hole begun</p>

<p>Article on it here by the way: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brussels-explosions-video-purporting-to-show-zaventem-airport-blast-was-shot-in-2011-a6945501.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brussels-explosions-video-purporting-to-show-zaventem-airport-blast-was-shot-in-2011-a6945501.html</a></p>

<p>By the way, the time they tweeted that out was before even the police had gotten their hands on this &#39;footage&#39; something the police themselves even found out of the ordinary</p>

<p>So they get this footage before the police and decide to Photoshop a blast onto it, yeah go figure, I&#39;m no Photoshop expert but I don&#39;t think you can Photoshop that fast either</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Florida Republican Straw Poll in 2008.. Crowd was completely dominated by Ron Paul supporters - more than 600 strong.. Romney&#39;s campaign was 2nd with maybe 25. CNN put zero cameras on the Ron Paul people and made the Romney crowd look like he had support. Romneys people purchased tons of tickets and spent the whole event voting over and over.. CNN reported easy win for Romney and never reported 2nd place and just said McCain made a strong showing.. Despite him hardly having any support.</p>

<p>I was there.. Saw it.. And I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist if I say what I saw or show my pictures and video of it..</p>

<p>It definitely woke me up.</p>

Some desperately cling to the official narrative for catastrophic events like that because letting go would shatter their worldview. I was one of those people. 
Grateful to the good folks who helped me painstakingly dismantle that false paradigm. Spread the word where you can...nicely. It is often much later before the sum of influences (yours and others) adds up for those you inform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is so traumatic for people to accept 9/11 is a lie... If 9/11 is untrue, then what ELSE is untrue? You have to revisit everything you&#39;ve ever been taught, seen on TV, etc... For me I even looked into flat earth theory, etc., as I had no idea what was true or not anymore. So, I think their subconscious mind predicts this and makes them reject the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, and then the conscious mind does &#39;mental gymanistics&#39; to rationalise it. I was debating with a friend and he said an airliner must be able to fly at sea level at 550mph because it is able to take off from sea level. It makes no actual sense but the rejection itself is emotional, immutable and prejudged, and the words are just the mind&#39;s way of trying to justify it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Copying from an old comment I made because I&#39;m lazy:</p>

<p>In 2001, about a week before 9/11, I was home sick from work and watched the ATF shoot into the wrong house, then burn a house down with a man still inside, live on CNN. Someone&#39;s compiled a bunch of info about the incident <a href="http://www.greatdreams.com/atf_8-31-2001.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is commonplace now (almost like a playbook: Whoops, he didn&#39;t shoot at us, we shot our own guy, shhh, don&#39;t tell anyone! Whoops, we shot the dog! Whoops, shot into the wrong house! Whoops, we used the wrong flash-bangs, we TOTALLY meant to use the cold ones! Oh well, guess we&#39;ve got a fire now! We call it &quot;the Dorner&quot;), but it wasn&#39;t then. I was fascinated by it, as none of the stories made any sense, and they specifically sprayed water on neighboring houses, while they burned down this house.</p>

<p>What kept me from forgetting this incident, though, was how quickly news stories were scrubbed from the Internet afterwards. I mean, this happened on live TV, in the middle of the day, stories were all over the Web. A week later, describing it to a friend, I went to look for an article to cite - I could find a single article, deleted - but not scrubbed from Google cache. (15 years later, we now have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Beck_Shootout">Wikipedia article</a> about it; the ATF officer next to the much-loved motorcycle officer who was shot during the operation committed suicide ten years later.)</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t wholly understand the significance of the event, and I doubt I ever will -- but I feel like it was a turning point, and it definitely woke me up.</p>

<p>[Note from now: After writing this way back when, I went digging again found a memoriam page for the motorcycle officer that was shot - one of the comments insinuated that he <em>was</em> killed by sniper fire. The officer was well-loved; people are still leaving comments on his memoriam page 15 years later.]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the 2004 Democratic primaries, when Howard Dean&#39;s campaign was doing well and he had just won Iowa. Dean gave an enthusiastic, spirited speech, telling his audience they were going to continue to win primary after primary. Then he let out an strange sounding but enthusiastic yell, now commonly known as the &quot;Dean scream.&quot; </p>

<p>Over the next few days the U.S. media played the clip of that speech nonstop, declaring the Dean campaign to be over. Of course the American public listened to the talking heads on their television,  Dean&#39;s poll numbers dropped, and eventually he dropped out of the race.</p>

<p>The events of 9-11-2001, the subsequent search for non-existent WMD&#39;s in Iraq, and the unjustifiable war that followed had me thinking the Bush administration was incompetent and corrupt. But the way the media jumped on a single &quot;Whoooop!&quot; declaring a presidential campaign to over made me see the media was part of a system designed to manipulate, deceive, and control the American people. This realization is what inspired my insatiable thirst for the truth.</p>

<p>Edit: added the missing word, campaign.</p>

<p>JFK (Everything is a rich man&#39;s trick)</p>

<p>9/11</p>

<p>Charlie Hebdo (Fake murder of police officer laying on the street)</p>

<p>Sandy Hook (Wolfgang Halbig has really had to go through hell for his efforts to get answers to simple questions)</p>

<p>2005 London bombings (Mainly due to the slip-up of a former Mossad agent)</p>

<p>The murder of swedish prime minister Olof Palme (Excellent book: Coup d&#39;etat in Slow Motion” / &#39;Statskupp i Slowmotion.  Massive coverup and a fake/deceptive/fraudulent, still on-going investigation)</p>

<p>Also, the Ukraine coup and the war in Syria have been quite eye opening.</p>

<p>Somewhat related to Ukraine; the MH17 shoot-down. I was listening to an interview with Udo Ulfkotte (in german) and he said something like: &quot;The media in the west started to report that the Russians had shot it down before the fuselage had even hit the ground&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Learned about NATO in middle school from our Pearson Education textbooks, how great it was for the market and all that feel-good shit. Next year when I did a paper on it I found a bunch of prominent economists who formerly advocated for the formation of NATO saying that it was a mistake. First time I was ever went back and skeptically thought about the things I was taught in school; doubly so after I realized that all the information I had ever learned came from one source.</p>

<p>That is so fucking scary to me. </p>

<p>I thought it was ridiculous that while I lived in Missouri my teachers and textbooks stressed that the civil war had started because of State Vs. Federal rights...and it took me awhile to see it was clearly and obviously slavery, just the right to own slaves. </p>

<p>Blows my mind that years later kids still learn about that tragedy with rose colored glasses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The instant you realize that all you&#39;ve ever been taught came from the same place, it&#39;s over. It&#39;s a scary, world-shattering experience. It&#39;s no wonder that people don&#39;t want to pay attention when we&#39;re conditioned from a young age to just trust the textbooks.</p>

<p>I remember the second thing that befuddled me... We were taught that Hitler committed suicide in his bunker with his wife towards the end of April. Fair enough, I might have too. But there was no mention of any of the controversy around it - at the time, no one believed he was dead because the source was a lone radio broadcast by the German government. No body was ever found, the FBI and POTUS never believed he was dead either. And on top of all that, Russia claimed to have a skull fragment from his body, complete with a bullet hole, some 20 years later, but DNA testing showed that it was a woman&#39;s. Why not mention all of that shit? It&#39;s obviously not as cut-and-dry as they stated it to be. They could have even said something to the effect of &quot;Official reports indicate that Hitler and his wife committed suicide in their bunker, however this was never confirmed by Allied forces. Here&#39;s what we know...&quot; Instead, it&#39;s a matter-of-fact statement. And they&#39;re everywhere in the textbooks and in the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly is preposterous about it? The idea that enough thermite came out of the buildings to burn all those cars yet didn&#39;t land on any people that were out there in the streets is preposterous to me. I am not discounting use of thermite in the buildings, but seriously can&#39;t imagine nor understand how it would ignite cars without people being caught up in the mix and mentioning the insane fire rain to the reporters that were so eager to sensationalize everyone&#39;s experience. I have yet to see any conventional explanation for all those burned cars that is satisfactory. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with a lot of things Judy Wood has to say, and I do NOT believe the towers were brought down by energy weapons. I do, however, think there is enough evidence for strange forces at work that has not been explained. Perhaps the energy technology was being used concurrently in order to accomplish a different, but related goal.</p>

<p>Yeah it&#39;s easy to point out the flaws of our corrupt system. But what&#39;s your answer? Collectivism? Get the fuck out of here you must not know shit about history or human behavior.  Collectivism MUST include slavery - because you the individual is less important than the group.  You don&#39;t get to make decisions. The group supersedes you - and who is &quot;the group&quot; usually a military.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since my dad worked on the U-2 project in the 50&#39;s he would always have a good laugh at the news media discussing UFOs which were covering up for the spy plane overflights.  But he would never discuss the unrelated military craft that were already 20 years advanced he was always working around.  Then it came to fruition in 1986 when an F-117 crashed in California, media covered it up but there were too many witnesses. Military had to admit we had them flying for over a decade already.</p>

<p>Then the ball buster was &quot;the falcon and the snowman&quot; movie which my dad refuses to watch &quot;because it is unamerican&quot; and today wonders where and why our country went wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For years, my argument against any &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; involving the government was that the government was far too incompetent at a whole to pull off large conspiracies without leaving breadcrumbs of evidence behind. My point stands, but I was simply ignoring the facts; I was stepping over half loaves and ham sandwiches expecting breadcrumbs. They are incompetent, but most people don&#39;t care. They just believe the bullshit they are fed and never question for themselves. Once I started questioning everything openly, down the rabbit hole I have gone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>There&#39;s no such thing as crack babies</strong>.</p>

<p>Seriously. When I was an impressionable kid in the late 80&#39;s, TIME magazine (the apex of American print propaganda) issued their &quot;Crack Babies&quot; cover.</p>

<p>The &quot;crack scare&quot; was born. We were told if you have one puff you have a 1 in 3 chance of dying and that the black community were causing unmeasurable harm to their unborn babies. It was all over the &quot;news&quot;, the talk of school, everywhere. &quot;Just say no to Drugs&quot;, &quot;This is your brain, this is your brain on Drugs&quot;m etc etc. If you do drugs, you&#39;re bad!</p>

<p>Skip ahead to my early 20&#39;s. I hear a Story on CBC about the guy who actually wrote the &quot;crack baby&quot; study for the government quoted in TIME. He was screaming &quot;There is no such thing as crack babies!, They lied, They used me!&quot; The picture of the &quot;crack baby&quot; on the cover was spurious.</p>

<p>He said right from the start he was finding that there was no significant permanent effect from being exposed to crack in utero. That babies were born addicted, but after a period of recovery, they seemed essentially normal. He had spent the following 2 decades trying to explainn to the public that the Government and TIME had completely &quot;misinterpreted&quot; his findings.</p>

<p>The Proof? The proof is in the pudding. It&#39;s had been 20 years since the TIME edition was published and the doctor was able to actually do a longitudinal study on these kids.</p>

<p>With the exception of the kids who grow up in &quot;crack houses&quot; who are obviously neglected, simply being exposed to it in utero isn&#39;t near as bad as the public was scammed into believing.  The &quot;crack baby&quot; kids have grown up to be as normal, productive and average as anybody else with similar opportunities.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t understand how/why TIME would get it so &quot;wrong&quot;.</p>

<p>The enlightenment began. I&#39;ve been a skeptical person ever since. I watched in real time as Bush lied about WMD and i watched in real time as 9/11 was imposed upon us. Awake the entire time.</p>

<p>It came out in the Ellesberg papers that the purpose of the war on drugs was to &quot;criminalize hippies and black culture&quot;. It&#39;s divide and conquer.</p>

<p>Noam Chompsky says TIME is &quot;the apex of American print propaganda&quot;. It was TIME who engineered the public outcry that ended the Vietnam war. The government couldn&#39;t just &quot;pull out&quot;, they had to have it look like it was the will of the people, that they would &quot;give in&quot; to the public. Hint: they won&#39;t, they haven&#39;t, it&#39;s all socially engineered.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/05/28/crack-babies-dont-necessarily-turn-into-troubled-teens/">They even printed a retraction in 2013!</a></p>

I was in college at the time. One of my room mates had a pen pal that lived in Kuwait. In her letters she was saying there was going to be a war soon because  Kuwait was side slant drilling into Iraq oil fields and stealing their oil.  When Bush got on the news running off at the mouth about unchecked aggression I knew it was all bullshit.<br/>
I had known our goverment did some shady shit before this but this was the one that finally drove home just how corrupt it really was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hanging chads deal that put a coke-head into office. Then followed by 9/11, which just went to cement that vibe of &quot;something ain&#39;t right.&quot; Then all the unconstitutional shit that managed to sail through in the Patriot Act.</p>

<p>Of course that got me to look at the bigger picture. Both parties are pretty complicit, and least goes back to JFK. Although the Eisenhower speech about the MIC is probably the earliest clue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i was bullied since middle school. or maybe even earlier.</p>

<p>and then i suspect the teachers were involved. orchestrating it from behind stage?</p>

<p>even my family was stupid and crazy. and almost everyone else, i guess. even though i did nothing wrong.
i was just a regular teenager.</p>

<p>and after i dropped out of college in 2008, i said to myself: fuck you all motherfucking losers! im smarter than all of you! you fucking cowards! im going berserk-jihadi-neo-nazi mode now!</p>

<p>and if i find out who is responsible for all of this, there will be no mercy. you unworthy belials you, all of you!</p>

<p>there was also some terrorist bombing act which put me in a difficult position. and that was it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome, then, my friend. I know, it&#39;s crazy thinking about how all your life you could be so blind to something so obviously fake. I get so mad at people who don&#39;t see it, I want them so badly to see what is so fucking obvious, but they never do. I guess everyone is on their own timeline, but I can&#39;t understand why a rational person can&#39;t see evidence and just connect the dots. They always go to <a href="http://www.im-right.com">www.im-right.com</a> and find out the debunker&#39;s response and then repeat it back at me as if it has any merit.</p>

<p>Can you elaborate on what you mean by this?  I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m embarrassingly ignorant when it comes to taxes.  How do you get away with not filing?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Larry Flint. Him. The free speech fix we got from him gets a big thumbs up. But to live like a king off of the debasement of others is prolly gonna not be so good for him in the looooong run. Not that he hasn&#39;t had a serious knockdown already. Preying on the desperate and selling dignity. Just not ok.</p>
