       Glad to hear your disagreement. I don't believe in fairytales either, all -isms included.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since capitalism currently isn't much more than a thinly disguised corporatocracy and all -isms together ended up destroying our own planet, I just think it's time to try something new.

       We don't have capitalism, we have crony capitalism, border line fascism. The answer is Free Market Capitalism, the constitution, and laws.

       Nobody wants to take your free market away, but you can't really have a free market when the current market is legally monopolized thanks to lobbied politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gary Johnson -while a better candidate than both other candidates- is too soft on the establishment for my liking. I like that Stein calls things as she sees them.

       lol, so you want to give the government more power and control? Logic at [10]. Stein is a socialist/communist, that's taking away Free Markets... and before you say Democratic-Socialism, that is still the government colluding/in bed with corporations, ie: what we have now.

       I never said he was, just choice. Hence competition. Take away choice and competition there really is not incentive to innovate. Stagnate products, that are over priced. USSR would be an example of this.

       Why? Are there not choices in providers? I wish there were more, but there still are choices. Get rid of rules and regulations and you would see more, ie: getting the government the fuck out of the private sector.

       No choice of provider where I live in SoCal. It's Time Warner Cable all the way down, unless you want shotgunned 56k speeds from the late 90's...

       They bought out RoadRunner and are now being bought out by some other buffoons named Charter who are higher up on the food chain.

       It was good when AT&amp;T was split up because it created some awesome competition, but those same companies have re-merged after newer laws and regulations and acquisitions. There was a time when U.S. government did not pander to big business, but now they turn a blind eye. Shit's rigged from the inside out yo.

       Exactly. So why more government? Get them the fuck out. Buy outs will happen, but government incubates their lives via lobbying. People are not understanding basic principles... It truly saddens me. It's not the private industry, but the government in cahoots with private industry. Regulations, rules, stipulations, etc etc, create monopolies. Why people cannot see that, is beyond me... Less is more..

       It is entirely. You are saying that people shouldn't complain about capitalism because they use products created by companies. It would be like if I say that you can't complain about socialism because you use public roads. There is no choice in the matter.

        Why? Are there not choices in providers? I wish there were more, but there still are choices. Get rid of rules and regulations and you would see more, ie: getting the government the fuck out of the private sector.

      <p>
       No we wouldn't. We would see less. Do you think it is easy to start up a telecom company? Big companies would buy out their competitors. Just like the attempted Sprint Verizon merger. Why do you think regulations exist? Would you like to go back to a time where the Rockefellers owned 90% of the oil industry?

       Not my fault the majority of Americans are dumb. If only two candidates have a chance at winning, I will vote for the lesser evil. At least it's better than living in Russia where Putin is effectively a dictator.

       but you think power will not consolidate and corrupt in a free market?  Economies of scale will prevent competition especially in a global market.  International corporations will be able to squash any competition that arises and will be able to suffer short term losses or just buy out competition directly.

       Not a true free market, no. Buyers need to vote with their wallets and politicians need to stay the fuck out. If they don't, they get thrown the fuck out. We just do not have a healthy society were people are proactive or values principles this nation was built on.

       I'm not a globalist, nor do I believe in consumerism. So, get rid of those two and many of our problems will be solved. Not just the US, but the world. Globalism is what allows corporations to run amok and rape us and the planet.

       No, the sub as a whole should not endorse any candidate.  We all have our own opinions here and I'm sure everyone will vote for who they think will do the best job if they do decide to vote.

       If she were a real candidate and not just some placation, she'd have my vote, but it's a two party system
       <em>
        until the next revolution

       , so learn to ignore elections or jump one of the two bandwagons. Also, I've seen her speak, in person, on a couple of occasions and she's really intelligent, but something is off...if she had more airtime I think more people would be mentioning that she might be mentally unstable. Her pause face is a forced smile that begins with her neck muscles...like she can only smile if she clinches her neck or something.

       To ensure it we just have to congregate past the voting space to prove the vote. You vote then go to the arrange spot(s) and wait until an hour (or more) after the vote closes. Call the media and use social networks to get the plan out and to prove the vote.

       We do have the Anonymous Humanity Party we can vote for, although at times I think that it might be a ploy to round us all up and actually put us in FEMA camps. Maybe not though, maybe internment camps would be fun and we'd learn to work together, and we'd finally all relax  and learn to get along when the dust settles.
