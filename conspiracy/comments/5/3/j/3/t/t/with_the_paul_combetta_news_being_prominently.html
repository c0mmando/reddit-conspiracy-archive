<p>It was written originally as the Gentleman&#39;s Guide, but some tart cherry got triggered and changed the title to &quot;gentle person&quot; to fix some imaginary offense that the word gentle<strong>man</strong> produces in women.</p>

<p>Besides the annoying nature of people editing titles and descriptions to remove masculine pronouns, I built the original unedited &quot;Gentleman&#39;s Guide&quot; directly into our wiki with added features such as page anchors so you can link to specify paragraphs within the work.</p>

<p>After allied bombing of critical infrastructure and whatnot there was a shortage of food and medicine being produced and delivered.

    <div class="md"><p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<p>Adolf Hitler - The Man Who Fought The Banks (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=froTxqKSqc4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=froTxqKSqc4</a>)</p>

<p>Haavara Agreement (&quot;Transfer Agreement&quot;) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement</a>)</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s essential to note that the majority of gassing locations were debunked by mainstream western historians in the 60&#39;s. In the 40&#39;s there were 10+ locations in Germany, Austria and Belgium (<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/2unh6d/locations_where_poison_gases_were_allegedly_used/coaisk7">https://np.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/2unh6d/locations_where_poison_gases_were_allegedly_used/coaisk7</a>) where it was claimed that the Nazis gassed people, and there were witnesses and even Nazi &quot;confessors&quot; who swore this was true. Today, there are but six gassing locations, and all are in Poland. Importantly, the Soviets would not allow western inspection of the Polish camps in the 60&#39;s. In other words, the current allegations of &quot;Nazi gas chambers&quot; rely entirely on Soviet claims from the 1940&#39;s.</p>

<p>You may, for example, wish to look into the initial Soviet claims after capturing Auschwitz (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/auschwitz-walendy">https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/auschwitz-walendy</a>), where they said they discovered an electrocution conveyor belt, blast furnace, and placed the &quot;gas chambers&quot; on the opposite side of the camp as is now believed. Similarly, at Nuremberg, 19 months after capturing Belzec, the Soviets were still claiming that electrocution was the method of killing there (<a href="http://winstonsmithministryoftruth.blogspot.com/2010/06/electrocuted-to-ashes-at-belzec.html">http://winstonsmithministryoftruth.blogspot.com/2010/06/electrocuted-to-ashes-at-belzec.html</a>). Then there are the infamous &quot;steam chambers&quot; of Treblinka, the human soap and lampshades, shrunken heads, etc -- an enormous number of erroneous and debunked claims which are always omitted by the Holocaust industry.</p>

<p>Similarly, the footage and pictures of dead bodies in the western camps (since debunked as &quot;extermination camps&quot;) are repetitively shown without informing the viewer that they were the result of disease in the last weeks and months of the war, as supplies dwindled with the collapse of the German state under the barrage of Allied bombing. US Army doctors confirmed this at the time (see the article on the liberation of the camps(<a href="http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml).">http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml).</a>)</p>

<p>Next, regarding links: there&#39;s a giant cache of material at the <a href="/r/holocaust/wiki">/r/holocaust/wiki</a>. I&#39;d recommend starting with a few short videos by a French historian who is about to go back to prison a second time for his research:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vincent Reynouard: Holocaust? What They Hide From You (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjqf-vNq6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjqf-vNq6I</a>) (30min)</li>
<li>Vincent Reynouard: Argument 1 - Nothing proven at Nuremberg (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChaMQFkqXyw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChaMQFkqXyw</a>) (9min)</li>
<li>Vincent Reynouard: Argument 2 - The dishonesty of the official historians (<a href="https://vimeo.com/90766157">https://vimeo.com/90766157</a>) (9min)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another good introductory video is about the use of the western camps by US psychological warfare units:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dean Irebodd: Buchenwald - A Dumb Dumb Portrayal of Evil (2009) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVZ_5yWmBRk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVZ_5yWmBRk</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>This video by Jewish revisionist David Cole is a classic which many credit with opening their eyes to the dishonest presentation of Auschwitz:</p>

<ul>
<li>David Cole Visits Auschwitz (1992) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHzWo79dCHs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHzWo79dCHs</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few articles which are essential introductory reading:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;Extermination&#39; Camp Propaganda Myths (<a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/1170/">http://codoh.com/library/document/1170/</a>)</li>
<li>Liberation of the Camps: Fact vs Fiction (<a href="http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml">http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml</a>)</li>
<li>The Nuremberg Trials and the Holocaust (<a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/2369/">http://codoh.com/library/document/2369/</a>)</li>
<li>Eye Witness Testimony of Gassings (<a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/969/">http://codoh.com/library/document/969/</a>)</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, right and follow me here.</p>

<p>How did you decide that those two topics were clearly, obviously, wrong?</p>

<p>You used empirical facts right?  Naturally the supporters of the conspiracies you reject have all manner of spooky youtube videos where they rattle off claims at high speed, mock facts counter to their narrative, and so on.  But you looked at the facts and observed that their pet conspiracy was wrong.  You weren&#39;t emotionally invested in those conspiracies so you were able to do that.</p>

<p>Now, and I know this is not an easy thing, consider that <strong>YOUR</strong> pet conspiracies are, to a person not emotionally invested in them, equally obviously and blatantly counterfactual.  Consider that all you have for <strong>YOUR</strong> pet conspiracy theory is the same sort of spooky youtube video stuff they do.</p>

<p>Apply your standards evenly and you&#39;ll find that your pet conspiracy theory is no more workable, no more plausible, no more factually supported, than the ones you reject.</p>

<p>Seriously, by what standards can you claim their conspiracy theories are obvious faleshoods but your pet conspiracy is not?</p>

<p>I can prove that the Earth isn&#39;t flat, and I don&#39;t need to go into space to do it.  If I go to different places on the planet, I can record the differences in lattitude, and those would not exist if the Earth was a two dimensional object.</p>

<p>I have also seen proven, to my own satisfaction at least, that the World Trade Center fell as a result of controlled demolition involving a derivative of thermite.  I have studied the footage of numerous uses of thermite in other contexts, not directly related to the WTC, and in every case I have seen secondary effects, (spark cascades, molten metal, the audio profile of explosions etc) which is completely consistent with what was reported by multiple eyewitnesses during the event.</p>

<p>The only major conspiracy towards which I would be willing to acknowledge emotional bias, would be the Holocaust; and that is primarily because I sincerely and genuinely believe, that Adolf Hitler was literally a physically incarnate demon from Hell.  I am not going to allow myself to be moved from that position, no matter what any of his apologists or revisionists try and claim, because I know what they want.  They want a scenario where the world is in a state of perpetual war, purely for its&#39; own sake, because they believe that war is the only possible catalyst for any form of forward progress, whether it be social, scientific, or economic.</p>

<p>I have studied fascism first hand on 4chan.  I was there for three years, and they have irreperably damaged me already with their unspeakably inhuman perspective.  I refuse to allow them to damage me, or if possible, anyone else, any further.  Anyone who is any form of positive or sympathetic advocate for Adolf Hitler <strong><em>must</em></strong> be stopped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, see, the problem is that the flat Earthers can, and do, say exactly the same things you do.  They have &quot;seen proven, to [their] own satisfaction at least, that [the Earth is flat].&quot;  They too have studied footage of numerous things that they claim are consistent with a flat Earth.</p>

<p>So, on what grounds do we actually settle things?  On what grounds to you justify your belief in your pet conspiracy while claiming that theirs is clearly and obviously delusional?  They use <strong>EXACTLY</strong> the same criteria for theirs that you do for yours, namely uninformed, non-expert opinion guided by other conspiracy theorists until they feel confident in their position.</p>

<p>Since you&#39;ve rejected reality and the standards of evidence used by everyone else to settle questions of fact, how do you propose to justify denying their conspiracy while embracing yours?  The only tools and standards I&#39;m aware of that let us settle such questions have been rejected by you.  If truth is just a matter of opinion, if all real world sources of information are tainted and inadmissible, what is left other than your own vague gut feelings?</p>

<p>And, like yours, their conspiracy requires that an absurd number of people be involved in the conspiracy and yet no leaks ever happen (in a world that can&#39;t keep a presidential blowjob secret) and depends on the conspirators being diabolically clever and yet making mistakes that are mindbogglingly obvious.</p>

<p>It also depends on literally every single expert in the field being involved in the conspiracy because the experts all reached a different conclusion than you conspiracy types have.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the question of how well supported your alternative explanation is.  You&#39;ve sifted, inexpertly and with only the knowledge you gained via tainted channels, through mountains of evidence and found a few things you don&#39;t understand.  Therefore, <strong>CONSPIRACY</strong>!!!  But if you subjected your idea of what &quot;really happened&quot; to even 1/100th of the scrutiny that you put the real facts through your explanation would fall apart instantly.</p>

<p>You require, in other words, different standards of evidence.  You demand that the truth be dismissed entirely if even the tiniest of details doesn&#39;t instantly make sense to your own uneducated mind, but you simultaneously demand that your made up version of things be accepted despite having the most outrageous failures to be even internally self consistent much less match any observable facts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only major conspiracy towards which I would be willing to acknowledge emotional bias</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t acknowledge it doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist.  If nothing else you have the emotion of smug superiority due to imagining that you are part of the (oppressed) elite few who know the truth while the rest of the world wallows in ignorance.  That&#39;s a powerful attractive thing to many people.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve also got the emotional appeal of finding a single enemy to blame rather than the uncomfortable fact of a world where often shit just happens kind of randomly.  Most people aren&#39;t comfortable with randomness and find the idea that an enemy is directing their woes much more comforting than the idea that they have problems due to a huge interconnected set of essentially random events.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And we&#39;re back to emotional appeal.  You don&#39;t want to be even tangentially related to Hitler, therefore you want to pretend that he was non-human.  You don&#39;t want to believe that people can do extremely bad things, therefore you want to believe that humanity only does that stuff when under literal demonic influence and that absent that tainting other then humanity is super duper great.</p>

<p>The same biases that are leading you to factually incorrect conclusions about 9/11 are leading you to accept the truth for the wrong reasons about the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Same bias, just in one case denying the truth while in the other accepting it.  In neither case are <strong>FACTS</strong> the important part, just your bias and emotional involvement.</p>

<p>They filmed it and you don&#39;t believe it. THE NAZIS FILMED IT THEMSELVES.</p>

<p>I mean jfc dude, eventually you reach a point where there is just so much physical evidence that you just disregard or assume &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;acted&quot; that you really can&#39;t expect people to take you seriously.</p>

<p>I mean, flat earth, what do you want as proof that the earth is a sphere?</p>

<p>Photographic evidence? You&#39;d just arbitrarily call it a fake.</p>

<p>Mathematic evidence? You&#39;d just say math doesn&#39;t work like it should and the sun is different than what it really is.</p>

<p>Experimental evidence you can try yourself at home? Let&#39;s say you place 3 sticks ponting straight up, all of them measuring 1m in 3 different places of the world, let&#39;s say Atlanta, Sacramento and Olympia, then you connect with two friends via skype and you all go measure the shadows of your stick. If the earth is flat and the sun is hovering at a close distance over it, you should be able to prove it mathematically and it would be impossible to disprove.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t work like that and you already know it, you would just claim light is affected by some electromagnetic force and curving or some shit like that.</p>

<p>This is why you make people look bad, you assumed something without proof and believing others had been fooled, made you feel special and different, then you clinged to the idea that what you believed was reality and someting or someone invented a whole lot of proof in order to make you thing otherwise. Spoiler Alert: If you really believe the earth is flat you were fooled really hard.</p>

<p>jfc, Ockham&#39;s razor slices trought every single argument you could make against the current model of our planet it&#39;s just ridiculous people keep believing that crap.</p>

<p>Jfc the nazis straight out accepted the holocaust happened, people took photos of it for the sole reason they knew the world had to know what happened there and people just chose to disregard evidence. Ffs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is so much proof it happened discussing this topic is stupid really.</p>

<p>Evidence exists. You choose not to believe it, but your beliefs are based on sentiment and not on evidence.</p>

<p>Evidence is not something you can arbitrarily decide is valid or not. There is just so much evidence I&#39;m not even going to link any because you can just google it yourself.</p>

<p>If you hate Jews I don&#39;t care, they can lie just like anyone else, but it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt that at least 4.5 Jews died in a genocide program under the nazi regime. The nazis were proud of it and nobody denied it. Civilian Germans knew what was happening. It&#39;s an enormous event that marked history. It&#39;s as if you denied that NK is a dictatorship and claimed people love it there and that there is no human rights abuse going on there. You are not denying bad history. </p>

<p>You are denying facts based on sentiment.</p>

<p>That is dumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t even present any evidence because there is none. The stupid stories about lampshades and gassings are all fake and retarded. There is no documentation or any intercepted communication about any plan for a genocide whatsoever. By the Red Cross&#39;s estimate only about 200,000 Jews died. Looking at the World Almanac census data from the time, there were not even 6 million Jews in Europe at the time and no significant change in the world jewish population before and after the war. </p>

<p>Even the official death count at Auschwitz has decreased over the years. It&#39;s so stupid only a gullible over emotional person can believe any of it. Auschwitz had a fucking soccer team and a swimming pool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol the gas chambers were for fumigating clothes to combat the lice outbreak and prevent typhus.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no physical way they could have been used for homicide.</p>

<p>No autopsies of any bodies revealed gassing. Bodies turn blue when poisoned with cyanide.</p>

<p>I believe the rest of the quote says &quot;...in Europe,&quot; of course Judea had already declared war on Germany at this point so Hitler had every reason to say this. This still doesn&#39;t substantiate any genocide plans. There would be detailed documents and plans outlining the specifics of a mass genocide. There are none.</p>

<p>There is no physical evidence. All the evidence there is is terrible.  Even soil samples from the camps by geologists revealed no mass graves below, they even confirmed that the soil had been untouched. It&#39;s a fantasy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not the questioning of the official narrative that people hate, its that white supremacists or unironic Nazis just want to portray the Nazis as some sort of tragic heroes. So they deny everything and say the Nazis were good guys trying to save the world. Its intellectually dishonest, same as flat earth, and the cherry on top is that it makes this sub look like shit. I don&#39;t think looking the sub look bad is a legit argument to not discuss something, but plenty of posters have seen shills come in here to push some narrative. For whats it worth I do not fully believe the official narrative, there&#39;s just way too much politics surrounding the subject, and too much to gain, for corruption not to worm its way in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For example, Trump&#39;s family had vineyards not 20 min by foot to the epicenter of the Nazi SS Movment and Rosicrucian (Alchemical / Protestant) Movement centuries previously.  Heidelberg.  They were from Kallstadt.  The story was that Trumps grandada was too weak to work in the vineyards (too weak to move a bunch of grapes, really?), and so his mom gave him some money to kickstart a new life in america as a barber.  She was ostensibly a consciencious objector to burgeoning nazi germany and didn&#39;t want him drafted.   So he goes to america.  After five years grandad barber was able to buy a restaurant chain, then ten years later, a hotel chain.  Of course, this makes sense because anyone working at great clips for five years can easily go out and buy a successful restaurant chain and in a few years buy embassy suites, like the whole thing.  No silent partners or secret socieites needed. /s</p>

<p>also, hillary and trump are very remote cousins, going back to, you guessed it warwickshire, england; whose castle grounds are used yearly to host the most famous international wiccan / witch meetup</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even without framing the issue as &quot;the whole election system is a conspiracy by The Man in order to keep you down&quot;, there&#39;s really no place on this sub for election coverage. If it&#39;s not about a conspiracy, what&#39;s it doing on r/conspiracy? Is this sub supposed to be a dumping ground for anything and everything which you <em>think</em> is &quot;anti-establishment&quot;? (&quot;Vote Trump.

<p>Now, a post laying out the connections between Hillary and Rothschild, or Trump and Ghouliani, while not <em>strong</em>, still make sense being here. They&#39;re talking about links between <em>conspirators</em>. That&#39;s fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I concede your point. However, you&#39;re still talking about a conspiracy to hide the fact that Hillary has health issues. There <em>truly</em> was/(is?) a conspiracy to hide that, and in today&#39;s vernacular, without sufficient <em>open</em> evidence, it would be regarded as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;.</p>

<p>American &quot;infotainment news product&quot; is a joke. It&#39;s deplorable that in the time we live in, one needs to read a &quot;conspiracy&quot; forum to find out what&#39;s <em>really</em> going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>couldn&#39;t have put it better myself. its a true shame indeed. anyone with the slightest ability to think for themselves can see what a farce the corporate media is. TPTB learned a very hard lesson with the vietnam war. All the talking heads in d.c. would say the war was going well, but the nightly news showed a completely different situation. Thats why alot of citizens were against the war towards the end. Actual, legitimate, nightly news put the lies and carnage right in everyones faces. They learned if you can control the media, you can control the mind of the unwashed masses. They dont want to repeat that lesson. But now anyone who is a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; can be easily dismissed because as soon as most people hear the words &quot;conspiracy&quot; and &quot;theory&quot; they think its all in the same category as flat earth or lizard people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a dumb ass and I&#39;m arguing the existence of God. If you read what I say and are interested in philosophy you can piece together major keys of the world. I&#39;m enlightened and many more are. They are just like me but they don&#39;t want to face all the scrutiny from people like you. I call you a dumb ass from the high lord himself cause they tell you to seek higher knowledge. I am at the pillars of the highest knowledge known to man. If you don&#39;t build up to it it sounds retarded I know. But that&#39;s why some people get it and other people are left in the dark. It&#39;s not for the faint hearted. It&#39;s for people who don&#39;t have a massive ego. You have a massive ego because as you can see you feel the need to talk down to others. Personally I only talk down to people by calling them a dumb ass, you are. I wouldn&#39;t call you a dumb ass if you left me alone and let people shift through the ideas themselves. They are very big ideas not small ideas. If you fit them together you get a piece of heaven. If you do the soul work you get a piece of heaven. Get enough pieces and you have a really good idea what&#39;s going on in the world. People are not completed like I am yet, it doesn&#39;t bother me to listen to lesser people talk down to me. I accumulated knowledge from everything I could think of and I&#39;m trying to make a smaller bridge for people to understand it. </p>

<p>See this, 2012 was the half way point but I&#39;m saying this awakening hit me and when it&#39;s done and over you&#39;re going to see the entire earth change. I am a chosen one and it doesn&#39;t bother me to hear the unchosen talk shit. You&#39;ll see in the future how everything I am saying pieced together and how I was only doing Gods work of trying to bring others with me. It really doesn&#39;t bother me if I was the only one because from here it&#39;s a waiting game. Bye bye world I have already beat you all so I wish you all luck. If you&#39;re smart you&#39;d read what I say with a very keen mind. If you&#39;re dumb you will ignore it or laugh at what I&#39;m saying. This guy&#39;s trying to lead you off your path of divinity. I&#39;m trying to show you. I&#39;m glad the mods are watching out for me TBH I love you mods. </p>

No mercy on that day, until that day I will keep talking because I believe everyone should have the opportunity to at least start the path or see the path to some extent. Time is running out. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a maltese I&#39;m a pitbull off his leash all this peace talk can cease. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man the fact that you are disputing my evidence and making me look dumb would mean you are a shill. Shills slant conversations and derail them. I&#39;m not derailing shit I&#39;m trying to show people the truth about the world. You on the other hand are trying to derail ME. You are a shill! Like everything is backwards in this world. Here&#39;s a good image anyone wondering what shills do. Please show me any instance of me doing any of these things. This guy is doing them right now. For all I know he&#39;s part of this conspiracy of people targeting me trying to discredit everything I say. It&#39;s too real if you follow what I&#39;m saying it blows the entire world out of the water. You trying to discredit me means nothing. If you&#39;re a shill you&#39;re doing a shitty job. If you&#39;re an actual person, back to point one, you are an idiot lol. Do some fasting it grows brain cells, you&#39;re lacking. </p>

<p>I am seriously teaching you all everything decode reality properly is the name of the game. Renew your eyes, new eyes new ears. Listening to me is crazy I am seriously trying to make you lose yourself because your identity is what&#39;s holding humanity down. Have an identity but stop holding your beliefs as if they&#39;re a part of you. </p>

There is plenty of knowledge that proves Satan is real and God is real and that the entire world is in a big deceptive matrix for their minds.

<p>So because of one or two commenters, you&#39;re calling out thousands of redditors - there&#39;s a great philosophical mind!</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying this &quot;from God&quot;, but I guarantee no matter what religion you partake in, the One Creator would rather not want to be spoken on behalf of by some random self-important person calling everyone else ignorant.</p>

<p>All due respect, the irony in your so called argunents are surprising. The truth is, you will see what you want to see in your research. If you focus on negative apocalyptic events, then that will be your future reality. If you focus on not trying to preach and get people bowing down to your feet, staying humble and offering positive thoughts, service to others (etc.) then that&#39;s what you&#39;ll get back in return from the universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s two examples of amateur astrophotography which clearly demonstrate the rotation of Mars. </p>

<p>The first is by <a href="http://www.damianpeach.com/mars1314.htm">Damian Peach</a> and the second by <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/online-gallery/rotation-mars-0507-06062016/">David Durate</a>. David even helpfully lists his equipment - Celestron 8&quot; SCT, Meade 3x Telextender and Expanse 120 Camera.</p>

<p>As for your second point. The Earth rotates too slowly to be detected by cheap mechanical gyroscopes.  Static friction in the bearings and  imperfect balancing prevents that. Only expensive military-grade gyroscopes, ring laser gyroscopes, and other special high-sensitivity gyroscopes are sensitive enough to measure such slow rotations.</p>

<p>Yes, mechanical gyroscopes used in aircraft are precise enough to be effected by the Earth&#39;s rotation. That combined with friction and imperfect balancing require and aircraft&#39;s gyros to be periodically reset by its compass. </p>

<p>If I were to buy a gyro however, and try demonstrate the Earth&#39;s rotation at home it would not be accurate enough.</p>

<p>They won&#39;t look like anything you&#39;ve seen through a telescope. Images this detailed from small scopes are recorded via CCD and processed by computer before they look like that. </p>

<p>We can reason through observation of celestial objects that the Earth shares many properties such as seasons, a day night cycle, poles and so on. The simplest explanation for why the Earth shares these properties is because it too is a spherical (oblate spheroid to be precise) celestial body orbiting the Sun. </p>

<p>We can now even observe celestial bodies orbiting other stars, minimum estimates for extrasolar planets start at 100 billion! </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if the type of precision engineered gyro found in a commercial airliner would be affected by the Earth&#39;s rotation on a table. The conditions on the table aren&#39;t comparable to those at altitude. Both latitude and altitude have an effect on apparent gravity, experimental conditions you could not replicate on a motionless table at ground level. </p>

<p>The Earth is a motionless flat plane under a steel dome with a reflective oxide coating, the the Sun, Moon, Black-Sun, stars and planets are all under the dome. That being said the gyroscope doesn&#39;t react to the Earth rotating because it&#39;s motionless i.e. not rotating. I can back this claim with additional empirical evidence in the form Airy&#39;s Failure experiment that proves it&#39;s the stars are in motion and the Earth is not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was fake then why didn&#39;t the nazis deny it?</p>

<p>They filmed it and you don&#39;t believe it. THE NAZIS FILMED IT THEMSELVES.</p>

<p>I mean jfc dude, eventually you reach a point where there is just so much physical evidence that you just disregard or assume &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;acted&quot; that you really can&#39;t expect people to take you seriously.</p>

<p>I mean, flat earth, what do you want as proof that the earth is a sphere?</p>

<p>Photographic evidence? You&#39;d just arbitrarily call it a fake.</p>

<p>Mathematic evidence? You&#39;d just say math doesn&#39;t work like it should and the sun is different than what it really is.</p>

<p>Experimental evidence you can try yourself at home? Let&#39;s say you place 3 sticks ponting straight up, all of them measuring 1m in 3 different places of the world, let&#39;s say Atlanta, Sacramento and Olympia, then you connect with two friends via skype and you all go measure the shadows of your stick. If the earth is flat and the sun is hovering at a close distance over it, you should be able to prove it mathematically and it would be impossible to disprove.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t work like that and you already know it, you would just claim light is affected by some electromagnetic force and curving or some shit like that.</p>

<p>This is why you make people look bad, you assumed something without proof and believing others had been fooled, made you feel special and different, then you clinged to the idea that what you believed was reality and someting or someone invented a whole lot of proof in order to make you thing otherwise. Spoiler Alert: If you really believe the earth is flat you were fooled really hard.</p>

<p>jfc, Ockham&#39;s razor slices trought every single argument you could make against the current model of our planet it&#39;s just ridiculous people keep believing that crap.</p>

<p>Jfc the nazis straight out accepted the holocaust happened, people took photos of it for the sole reason they knew the world had to know what happened there and people just chose to disregard evidence. Ffs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>rolls eyes</em> The images show that Mars <strong>rotates</strong>, which you claim it does not. You have exactly zero proof that Mars is a &quot;gas filled electrified sphere&quot; or whatever other nonsense you were just spouting. </p>

<p>Those of us in reality realize that not only is Mars a sphere and that it exists, we also realize that we&#39;ve landed robots on it, and conducted significant research. Research that those of your ilk can&#39;t even begin to address. </p>
