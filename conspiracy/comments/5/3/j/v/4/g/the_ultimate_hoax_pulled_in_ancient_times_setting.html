       As an atheist that loves to debate Christians, I love to tell them "since you make the claim God exists, I reject that claim until evidence proves otherwise. I don't assert there is no God, I just reject the claim there
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is I follow that same standard for my claims. If I say there is no God, I must prove that claim. Just like if you claim Jesus did not exist, you must prove that claim with evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And my opinion? Jesus likely existed but not in the context Christians give him. I highly doubt he was responsible for all of his miracles given that they're physically impossible or illogical. He was likely just a normal dude who preached enlightenment and other things and people turned his ideologies into a religion.

       More context to that quote? Not really grasping what you're trying to convey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, I agree, Hitchens was the man. Dawkins less so, but he has a lot of good arguments. His delivery often needs work though. It sucks, but a lot of people won't listen once you start sounding like an ass and condescending. I actually got down voted the worst I've ever been in this sub for posting a Sam Harris video.

       The thing is the "Jesus design", or as I like to call it, the "Oosian design" has been around in various characters across the planet, a whole bunch of times.  Zeus, Horus, Dionysus, Jesus, etc. (it's a rather compellingly long list, where the names all end in, arguably, an "oos" phoneme).  This story has the same design points over and over.  And it crosses cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if this thesis is correct, similar to the ones that Michael Tsarion and Jordan Maxwell present, then what you're proposing is that the same archetype is used by some group to identify/mark an epoch change?  That's somewhat inconceivable, but not completely so.   Perhaps this archetype has been hijacked by certain narrative pushers.  I think this is more likely.  Or perhaps this archetype is a naturally occurring phenomenon.  Or perhaps it's a joke aliens pull on us.
      </p>
      <p>
       And anyway, even if some group can create a fake individual to lionize as a sungod, what difference does it make?  Surely one obvious lesson in today's world is that logic is a useful device in the discernment of truth.  So rather than listen to whatever the Hero du Jour is, maybe we should be growing our knowledge set in ways that we can have faith in and which is most useful to us.  Get there at our own pace rather than accepting potentially false programs that we'll have to collectively remove for a few thousand years hence.

       It seems to me emperor Constantine co-opted the christian church (around 300AD) precisely as a form of control to keep the remains of the empire together and under the influence of Rome's elites (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great
       </a>
       ). The power of the empire/church split between East and West in the great schism. Later of course the power of the church was further splintered by the likes of Martin Luther and Henry VIII etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly Vladimir the Great is recorded as having actively selected orthodox christianity for early Russia when he auditioned representatives of judaism, roman catholicicism, islam and orthodox christianity. He basically went shopping for a religion to control the masses and chose a form of christianity: 
"The Primary Chronicle reports that, in the year 986, Vladimir met with representatives from several religions. The result is amusingly described in the following apocryphal anecdote. Upon the meeting with Muslim Bulgarians of the Volga, Vladimir found their religion unsuitable due to its requirement to circumcise and taboos against alcoholic beverages and pork; supposedly, Vladimir said on that occasion: "Drinking is the joy of the Rus', we can't go without it." He also consulted with Jewish envoys (who may or may not have been Khazars), questioned them about their religion but ultimately rejected it, saying that their loss of Jerusalem was evidence of their having been abandoned by God.[7]
      </p>
      <p>
       In the year 987, as the result of a consultation with his boyars, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. Of the Muslim Bulgarians of the Volga the envoys reported there is no joy among them; only sorrow and a great stench. In the gloomy churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at Hagia Sophia, where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: "We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth," they reported, "nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it."[8]" -

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And christianity's new testament itself was edited and put together by religious elites here:

       i have to think the original christianity - gnostic christianity - was dedicated to the
       <strong>
        cross
       </strong>
       from descending kali to ascending kali -- arguably the most important date in all of human history. and all this pseudo-christian mythology was spun up to conceal this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       one implication is that the year is actually closer to 1016 than 2016.

       I think he existed, but I'm not going to claim certainty about too many of the details.  Two thousand years is a long time to be able to change things, especially given that Catholicism had exclusive access for most of that time.

       You're welcome! It's an interesting theory I came across. It could explain the "missing" years of Jesus. Cleopatra sent him off to the East to protect him, there he studied among elders and spiritual leaders (so the theory proposes).

       It's very compelling &amp; it throws a new (to me) light on so many traditions that haven't previously made any sense. Palm Sunday, for example: How does some rando carpenter's kid get welcomed into Rome with such honors, only to be hung out to dry shortly after? It's always smacked of political intrigue &amp; your theory ties it up pretty neatly.

       Human virgin births, the purest human can reach different levels of conciousness. I believe mary was and achieved that level and was able to interdimensionally mate with some sort of advanced life form thus creating jesus. They didnt know how to react to a hyrbid at the time so thats why they killed him. He didnt die for three days then come back. He was able to meditate and experience an out of body projection then came back to his physical body 3 days later
