       There is no actual smoking gun that shows HRC specifically ordering anyone to attempt to delete emails after they were subpoenaed. She can just say "I told my aides/assistants to take care of things. It isn't my fault they broke the law or tried to tamper with emails before handing them over."

       She has been directly linked to more damning evidence than this and nothing has happened to her.  Sadly she is reaching the realm of "Untouchable"...even with this I don't think she can be directly linked to it.  I'm skeptical that this will even reach MSM.

       I think the only possible way that Hillary could be charged and prosecuted would be if there was another viable path for the shadow government, to whom she is beholden, to maintain control of the executive branch of government in 2016. If they thought that sacrificing her as a show to the public and nominating a different puppet to the position was a more viable path to win the election in 2016, I have no doubt they would. Traditionally, both candidates are nominees of these people, so it doesn't necessarily matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've gone all in with Hillary. I'm sure they saw polling from two years out showing the substantial advantage the democrats had in 2016 and hedged that margin of victory on running a less attractive candidate that is more beholden to their agenda. They also likely predicted that Jeb! or another establishment candidate would be nominated by the GOP. The media and Clinton surrogates are currently sacrificing all their credibility in a blatant and pathetic attempt to push her in to the White House. I'm honestly scared to see what they'll do when that avenue fails. Fortunately, it appears that Trump has out flanked them on combating 'terrorism', so a false flag terror event would work against them.

       She'll be safe until Trump gets in. Maybe then they'll go after her for real. obama is definitely covering for her. BTW, anyone with any objectivity whatsoever can see clearly she won't be elected.

       Off the top of my head:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Her email will have another turn in the media cycle.
       </li>
       <li>
        The story reinforces that they have something to hide. The deleting of reddit comments show that this is something that they prefered us not knowing about.
       </li>
       <li>
        The specifics about the immunity deal will come to the spotlight. The FBI will have to answer if his comments is covered since it indicates that this is not only about destroying government records (which was known) but first also trying to hide them (new information).
       </li>
       <li>
        It also reflect poorly on the competence level Hillary relied on her electronic communication that he had to ask how to do things and couldn't independently draw the conclusion that what he tried to do (hide the emails) wouldn't work.
       </li>
       <li>
        It also opens up the possibility that the emails are still archived somewhere since they clearly didn't want them destroyed in the first place.
       </li>

       Trump is her friend though, I have a feeling he wouldn't get her prosecuted because of that alone. Does Trump himself ever say "Clinton deserves to be in prison" or "she's a criminal"? Does Trump himself ever say "Lock her up"? He's hinted a few times that the people might assassinate her for what she's done, but I don't think I've seen him say "I'll make sure the DOJ prosecutes."

       nope.  anyone you vote for is going to be a puppet for the corporations.  that was a poor shot at deflecting, sorry it worked almost as well as our election process.  care to continue?

       You do realize I only said that because that what you did, you just called someone who don't agree with you a shill, so I did that to you, then you proceed to explain to me how your opinion doesn't make you a shill. Congratulations, you just played yourself.

       Nothing yet. The story lacks many critical details, but everyone is jumping to conclusions. There is a pretty good chance that once again, reddit has ruined someone's life with an inept "investigation". Maybe Clinton didn't know. Maybe the information he was getting rid of was inconsequential to the investigation. Maybe the VIP wasn't Clinton at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might say that that's unlikely, but until there is some solid evidence, we should maintain open minds. Not all that glisters is gold.

       You're joking right? The person in question is ALREADY KNOWN to have deleted emails for her. The connection to his reddit account (and that's 100% definitely his reddit account) just makes it clear to us that he was instructed to obstruct justice on behalf of his client, and deductive reasoning makes it pretty clear that the client in question was Clinton. Even if he was asking because he was obstructing justice for another client, we already know that this guy literally deleted emails for her. There's no question as to that.

       in jail or anything, but these two successive hits to her momentum may mean Trump is going to be the next President. Her health scare just hurt her public image badly. This might be the straw that breaks her back.

       I'd be surprised if anything came of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who start with the presumption Hillary did something illegal jump on some screen shots that supposedly show something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't even get them to explain what was so bad about him deleting things (assuming you prove it's the guy and it was Hillary's archive he was trying to alter). I think they assume any alteration would be a crime, but I don't know why they think that. The redactions might be required by law, they might not have happened, they may have been pursuant to the subpoena....

       It's just as stupid as people who kept obsessing about how a Sec. of  State was going to be charged under the Espionage Act for a few emails sent to others in the State Department not using the proper protocol.

       What if he was removing privileged and not classified info? Attorney-client or executive privilege? What if he didn't actually redact? What if he did this awful thing but thought he was acting according to law? What if his boss was under an innocent misunderstanding? What if this got sorted out later? What if an agreement had already been reach between Clinton or State Dept or committtee lawyers? And there are just logical issues with the whole thing--why would HRC remove her own email or name from emails she was producing as her own?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I can (and have in other posts) gone on with further issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       While this might be what you think it is, it's more likely to be something completely benign and/or unrelated.
