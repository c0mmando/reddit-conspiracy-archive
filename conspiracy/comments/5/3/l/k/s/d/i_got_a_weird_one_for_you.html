       I work as a substitute teacher in California currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when the teacher needed the class to be quiet and the teacher would shhhh and throw up a peace sign and everybody would follow suit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well i threw up that signal today in class.  This is the second school i tried this with the same result.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, they knew what to do.  Excepf they didnt do the peace sign.  They did the sign of the devil!  They didn't call it that, and i forget what they called it, but they did it all the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF!!!  WHY??? HOWWW?
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking creepy!!! Why are our children now using the sign of the devil to be quiet???

       What is your point?  The odd thing is when I was a child we did the peace sign to get everyone to be quiet, and now they are using the sign of the beast.  Why?  Does it really matter?  That depends on your outlook.  But I want to know why we changed from the peace sign to the sign of the devil.

       My point is pretty much asking why you care what kind of hand signal the kids are throwing up as long as its not gang-related.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously you have a predetermined notion that this hand signal is the 'sign of the beast'.  What hand signal is it?  Can you link a picture?  Because google brings up at least two different ones.

       Over my life I've hard that also called the I love you sign and a sign for rock music fans. What makes it the sign of the devil and not what I said? What happened all those times I did it? What happens if I do it now? What makes you think the devil exists in the first place?

       They didn't actually have their thumb extended, like the picture I have linked.  The symbol they made is best known as the sign of the devil.  Someone taught that to them, in public elementary school
      </p>
      <p>
       You would better believe if I was a real teacher I would teach them the peace sign as well and I would follow that rabbit hole as far as I could in regards to teaching children teh sign of the devil to shut the fuck up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe shutting the fuck up is the devil?

       If you were in a Latin American country, that's the cuckold sign, not devil sign. It's also known as the horns sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Wikipedia, it's also first seen in Buddhism, not Christianity so wouldn't it be the sign of Buddha?

       No, I'm dead serious.  Why are children in public schools using the sign of devil?  I didn't do that.  It's fucking creepy.

       The creepy thing isn't the sign of the devil, per se, but why it changed to that from the peace sign.

       Actually, NM, the sign of the devil done by children ritually IS creepy!  Who taught them to do this and why?

       How do you know? You ever meet the devil (I did)? Surely it doesn't care about hand signs. Was worried about others things, things I talk about...  What do you know about evil spirits, death, alchemy, and the under world? I've seen it, lived it.. I'd love to hear how throwing up some hand signs means anything. You have a child like understanding, of the truly dark.. I'll wait... I could tell you experiences, that will probably keep you up at night. Conjuring demons, and possession...

       Maybe ask the kids where they learned that from the next time you sub and it happens again.

       Good idea.  The first time i mentioned to the aid there that that was the sign of the devil and she just shrugged.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just weird because we def didn't make that symbol.  Next time I will ask them where they learned that.  The answer is probably just there teacher, so I'll have to ask a teacher why THEY were told to do that and by whom

       they called it bull horns or something benign like that (it wasn't actually bull horns)
      </p>

       it was something kiddy and lame, what they called it isn't important imo

       With the thumb, it's "I love you" in sign language - tuck the thumb, and you've got the devil's horn.

       Now, why the school's trained the kids to sign "I love you" to subs, I have no idea...kind of twisted. ;)

       sorry, the thumb wasn't actually out.  I just wanted to include a picture of Obama doing it just because.  It WAS the sign of the devil.  Two seperate elementary schools.  I will continue to research.

       It is weird, I haven't noticed how many times this hand signal has been used by politicians until I googled it. Thanks for sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is one of Obama using it:

       And bush (from tx, we also do use it to signal University of Texas for the longhorns...) :
