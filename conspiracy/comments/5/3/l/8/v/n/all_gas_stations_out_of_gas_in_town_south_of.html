        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s starting to look like the 70s oil crisis up in here.  This is Hendersonville, NC.  All gas stations roped off or bags over the pump handles.  No gas for anyone.</p>

<p>Now this was a minor inconvenience for myself as I was able to make it home.</p>

<p>But I stopped into 5 gas stations, and noticed people panicking, on cellphones, some cars marooned at the pump.  Out-of-town plates, their travel plans absolutely ruined.  </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t in a position to help.  I felt terrible for them.  </p>

<p>There was an asian lady with glasses in a VW with NY plates who was practically in tears.  It gave me a <em>terrible</em> feeling both for her and for all the others that were milling around desperate.  I was hoping that maybe the triangle gas station or marathon would be open as those are clearly masonry affiliated local chains (ie: would by privilege get the reup of gas from trucks first) but no, even they were affected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting that the Petrodollar wiki now redirects to Petrodollar recycling.</p>

<p>Here is the original entry for &quot;Petrodollar recycling&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between the years of 1973 and 1980 US debt grew dramatically due to the high cost of oil during the OPEC oil embargo. As enourmous amounts of money flowed into oil rich states, the US made deals with Saudi Arabia and as a result vast holdings of Saudi assets were acrued by the US government. This money was then in turn lent out to different &quot;third world&quot; nations in regions such as, Africa, and Central and South America. The irresponsible nature of this lending has led to a debt crisis in underdeveloped countries where in some circumstances upwards of 90% of GDP is owed and no means of paying it back have thus far been established. This keeps many countries locked in a system of neocolonialism which is enforced by the IMF through &quot;structural development&quot; programs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. When people heard the pipeline had a leak, everyone in that community started filling up their vehicles and spare gas reservoirs. It was projected by TEMA(Tennessee Emergency Management Association) that if everyone filled up like normal, that there would be no shortage. It&#39;s just when people make a run on gas like they do on a bank, demand outweighs supply and you get a temporary market shortage/outage. I know a person who works at Pilot Oil and they said supply lines and distribution should be solid and fixed within a weeks time. But other firms, who knows. It&#39;s all about how resilient the company&#39;s supply chain is in the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah im aware of gas buddy but it was dead wrong in this case. People posted gas stations that maybe had gas at the time they were there, but every station that got gas was selling out within the hour - gas truck deliveries were few and far between. Sunday night there were literally no stations pumping. having less than ten miles left in the tank and nowhere to refuel, and no idea when there would be anywhere to refuel is sobering. Definitely made me prepare better for the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah im aware of gas buddy but it was dead wrong in this case. People posted gas stations that maybe had gas at the time they were there, but every station that got gas was selling out within the hour - gas truck deliveries were few and far between. Sunday night there were literally no stations pumping. having less than ten miles left in the tank and nowhere to refuel, and no idea when there would be anywhere to refuel is sobering. Definitely made me prepare better for the future.</p>
