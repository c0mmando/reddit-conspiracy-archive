       One thing to consider is that these lucifer/demigod worshipping elite are working from a blueprint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not you believe in any such version of spirituality, you have to recognize two things.  One, the elite have access to the spirit world and gnosticism that very little of the mainstream are aware of and THEY DO believe in their narrative, even if the masses have been hoodwinked by primordial soup and the big bang, otherwise known as forced insignificance. Second is the fact that evil is omnipotent and omniscient.  Folks will say, oh yes i believe evil exists, but only in the hearts of men.  But quantum theory, if you follow it, is producing some spooky results that are starting to confirm that in fact, yes, everything IS connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now lets look at their blueprint which has gained massive fulfillment in the 20th and 21st centuries.  They have succeeded in putting almost all of the pieces in place that were laid out in the bible millennia ago possibly at the library of Alexandria.  From Israel retaking its entire homeland, to the crosshairs on al aqsa mosque (rebuilding the temple) to poisoned waters and dead fish and wildlife everywhere, to biometrics and rfid and a forced cashless society, to squeezing any social cognition of spirituality out of us, they have done a great job of playing out prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you what is next.  War like the world has never seen is next.  A huge disaster will bring the world to the brink and a leader will emerge.  That leader will be killed.  A seemingly miraculous resurrection will enthrall the masses and this new leader will capture the hopes of a fearful world.  Then it will get worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       For 7 years we will be beaten and will suffer like no other time in history.  At that point we will see if the Grand Architect comes and reigns over us all in peace and harmony for a thousand years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some things to keep an eye on:  The Al Aqsa Mosque.  If the golden dome goes down, huge sign they are ready.  Negative interest rates.  This is a big precursor to cashless societies.  Identifying implants.  This likely won't be popularized until after the big disater, it is easily and readily deployable today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be vigilant and remember that even if brainwashing has you doubting these ideas, remember that the elite don't doubt these ideas.  The part they doubt is that their side will lose in the end.  They are as brainwashed as us, but in a different way.  Evil is doomed in the end.  Have hope.

       i cant help thinking that the "elites" get there knowledge from demons that have been around for a very long time. humans could never be as smart and cunning on there own. and they have much, much greater knowledge than we know because they let us think we are unravelling their plans while the worst shit is not known

       Plus, their scientists reject everything outside of the vanity of this world as old fashioned superstition.  They make fantastical claims and theories that are beyond a laypersons comprehension that are designed to devalue our place (and power).  The greatest deception of the devil is making you believe he doesn't exist.

       I'd endorse this thought. If you read Peter Levanda's "Sinister Forces" trilogy, there does seem a Satanic supernatural plan threaded though generations of gradual systemic corruption of morality and ideals.

       But it's not a straight line. It's been waylaid and stopped numerous times. It can happen again.

       Such an application of the Hiramic allegory, while indeed startling to many, actually illuminates perhaps one of the most bizarre references to the acacia in the history of Freemasonry. In the Apprentice and Companion rituals of Count Cagliostro’s Egyptian Rite, the acacia is puzzlingly referred to as being the first matter in a particular and curious Alchemical operation. When properly executed, this operation results allegedly in the production of a cubical ashlar; that is, the result is a purified, crystalline stone or salt that has been extracted, or, to use Alchemical terminology, produced, from the acacia tree: a veritable vegetable stone.
      </p>
      <p>
       “‘[T]he acacia is the primal matter and the rough ashlar is the mercurial part. When this rough ashlar or mercurial part has been purified, it becomes cubical …It is thus that you may bring about the consummation of the marriage of the Sun and the Moon, and that you shall obtain…the perfect [astral?] projection. Quantum sufficit, et quantum appetite [as much as you need and as much as you have appetite for].’3
      </p>
      <p>
       “[T]he candidate…shall drink [the red liqueur placed upon the Master’s altar], raising his spirit in order to understand the following speech which the Worshipful Master shall address to him at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       “‘My child, you are receiving the primal matter, understand the blindness and the dejection of your first condition. Then you did not know yourself, everything was darkness within you and without. Now that you have taken a few steps in the knowledge of yourself, learn that the Great God created before man this primal matter and that he then created man to possess it and be immortal. Man abused it and lost it, but it still exists in the hands of the Elect of God and from a single grain of this precious matter becomes a projection into infinity. [italics mine]
      </p>
      <p>
       “The acacia which has been given to you at the degree of Master of ordinary Masonry is nothing but that precious matter. And [Hiram’s] assassination is the loss of the liquid which you have just received …it is this knowledge that, assisted by the Great God, shall bring you these riches.'”4

       Now take that entanglement all the way back, generation over generation.  Honestly, evil I've seen, in the spirit world.  I used to travel there before the darkening.  I don't go anymore.  Many other travelers report the same thing.  God, YHWH, The Grand Architect, i don't  know.  Also, FYI, I am not a Christian and it's not my bible.  I'm more of a spiritualist.

       I simply call attention to not apartheid, but Israel is systematically eradicating Palestine.  We all know that.  Look at the borders 50 years ago and today.  Once their plan is complete and Palestine is gone and the Dome Of The Rock falls, watch out.

       Ok, so the elite drink DMT.  What link is there to DMT opening a door to another world?  You hallucinate, sure.  I've had plenty of friends try DMT and none of them can provide evidence of a different world (most don't even make the claim, they just acknowledge its a hallucination.)
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF does quantum entanglement have to do with evil which is a human ideation?  Do you think animals sense good vs evil?  No, there's what's good for me and/or my group, and what's not.  But good and evil do not exist outside of the human realm.  Was the boxers day tsunami that wiped out 250,000 people in SE Asia evil?  No, it was just a part of this chaotic universe that doesn't give a damn about you or me or anyone else.  A comet could come and wipe out the entire planet.  Is that evil?
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch out for what if Israel wipes out Palestine?  What if it never happens?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Enough poisoned water and dead animals to be seen thousands of years ago by those early mystics who used gnostic entheogen trances to create this blueprint. Moses' burning bush was an Acacia Nilotica. The Ark of the Covenant was built of Acacia wood. The pyramids were very quiet and dark on the inside.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But I'm asking you how much.  Quantify it.  How else are we supposed to know when we've approached or hit the threshold?  Unless you don't know.  Then don't make the claim if you don't have the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so you you're not a Christian.  What is your faith/belief system?  You obviously believe in some sort of higher being or God, even though the evidence of such has never been found.  Why believe what you have 0 evidence for?  I mean ZERO, NOTHING, ZILCH, NADA, NIL.  No evidence whatsoever outside of 'personal revelations' that are often accompanied by auditory or visual hallucinations due to chemical changes in the brain.

       Thanks for the reply.  You need to dig deeper than personal anecdotes from friends if you need evidence of dmt causing entheogenic experiences.  You think you can write off any experience because of "the brain and chemicals?"  The entire human experience is chemicals. I like the saying, "technically, the only two things anyone really enjoys are serotonin and dopamine."  Every thought and feeling and everything that makes you boils down to a chemical process.
      </p>

       Quantum entanglement shows that matter has connections that defy  explanation.  7 billion people in the world, all coming out of the cradle of civilization.  Matter ripe with genetic material changes between male and female.  Matter that has been entangled, imprinted with the human condition is exchanged and new life is formed over and over.  But the matter still has connections that defy space and time and react over great distances instantaneously.  Faster than the speed of light.  Hive conscious evil rides quantum waves.  Its just as real as any thought we've ever had.
      </p>
      <p>
       Writing off and sciencing away esoteric thought is the cultural norm, because you believe and trust the scientists who mock "hocus pocus".  Why do you trust them? Is it comforting?  Until youve experienced that "projection into infinity,"  every thought you've ever had is a cultural thought, not borne of your own volition, but as part of a regurgitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot rationalize the unexplainable to someone who has only previously been shown things that were then explained to them.  A filter is installed in us.  The purpose is to have a drone class.  They used to worship religion.  Now the drone class is trained to worship themselves.  But inside each one is the capability of direct contact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck finding more truths for yourself.  If you have more questions your welcome to ask.  If you really want to try thought devoid of the filter, seek out knowledge.  Then seek out those dmt friends.  Make sure your mind is open to all possibilities though.  You do yourself no service by rejecting and marginalizing the most amazing neural network on the planet, the human mind.  Especially now that scientific proof exists that proves we are not biological islands.  Our minds talk to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my spiritual beliefs.  I am an empath.  I am a searcher.  I am a questioner.  I am an enemy of evil.  Ideas without hive acceptance are the best kind.

       You don't understand what science is. It's the ability to empirically test and learn about the world around us. You don't need scientists to tell you what to believe in. Go do the experiments yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or keep believing in things with 0 evidence to support them because it makes you feel better that you don't know how the world works. That's how you remain ignorant though, and that's not what I'm about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you don't understand how something works doesn't mean it has some weird metaphysical or spiritual aspect to it. It doesn't mean it doesn't, but you cannot claim either way without evidence. That's what separates you from crazy people- having evidence to back your claims. Go learn by actually doing experiments and performing observations, not just getting really high and thinking about shit. That can have its place but it's limited in its ability to learn about the world in that it doesn't produce predictable models for future use. It's good for introspection but not for knowledge of the universe.

       Science is performed. As I told you before, you yourself can actually fucking do it without scientists telling you a damn thing. Verse yourself in calculus and you'll be able to make observations of damn near everything you see in a mathematical sense.

       Oh, now you need it in the language of calculus?  I am no mathematician but if that is your shield to the truth then so be it.  Id love to have Rick Strassman do some experiments with you.

       Oh my God dude. How many times do I need to tell you?
       <strong>
        you can do science yourself. You don't need a scientist to tell you what's right.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you knew anything about the scientific world, you would understand that they
       <strong>
        want
       </strong>
       you to prove them wrong. Why? Because it means we're broadening our understanding of the universe. By proving a scientist wrong, you would instantly become one of the most heralded people in the world and probably win a Nobel Prize.
       <strong>
        They want you to go out and test it yourself to try to prove them wrong
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So go do it. Go prove them wrong with everything you've sent me. If it's right, as you say it is, be prepared for your Nobel Prize. If it's wrong, then you fuck with the variables in your experiment until you've tested every possible variation. The only requirements are this model you create to explain your idea must be repeatable and predictable (able to say what will be or what was, accurately). That's so anyone else can take your experiment, perform it and rest their results against yours.
       <strong>
        that is science. That's it. No scientists, no books, none of that.
       </strong>
       All you need are tools to perform your experiment, the knowledge to be able to interpret your results (this is where calculus comes in handy), and an open mind to truthfully interpret your results regardless of whether they agree with your hypothesis or not.
       <strong>
        That is science. That's how you get evidence
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Want an example of why I shouldn't just trust what your personal anecdotes are about the subject(s)? How about the very same reason why you declared my friends' personal anecdotes invalid. Personal revelations are wildly inaccurate when it comes to defining the universe. That includes yours. This is why the scientific method is important. It allows ANYONE to perform the same method that the initial observer performed to interpret the results themselves. But again, one must truthfully interpret the results. Throw out any previous explanations you had before and critically think about what you're looking at. If you don't understand it, congratulations you've got some more experimenting to do. Why is that good? Because you learn more instead of being an ignorant yet opinionated person that refuses to accept any contradictory information because it goes against what they 'believe'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last time I'm explaining to you that you can do science yourself, don't need deGrasse Tyson to feed you information. Go do it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last time I'm asking for evidence of your claims as I've clearly shown you why your personal anecdotes are unreliable. My friends' anecdotes can't be unreliable while yours are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't want to give me evidence, that's fine. Just don't get pissy when I ask for it, which I will every time. Post ANYTHING without evidence, and if I see it, I will ask for evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were you here for Sunil Tripathi? That's yet another reason why evidence is important.

       Since when does that mean that you cannot understand it using science?

      <p>
       I'm sorry I'm not like you where I read a random blog that sounds kinda cool then take it as fact with NO EVIDENCE.  The best thing you've come to me with is the livescience page with the paper on quantum entanglement (funny how you only use scientific papers when
       <strong>
        you think
       </strong>
       it supports your argument, when it doesn't at all.  Not saying you're wrong, but you're making leaps Evil Kenievel would be envious of.  You need evidence to make the claims you're making).
      </p>
      <p>
       You claimed the elite had a 'door' to a 'different world'.  That's what I asked for evidence of and still want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me spell it out for you the simplest way possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say I had no idea what this different world could be.  Say I have no ability to comprehend what it is.  You can explain all you want, but until you show me what it is, I have no way of coming close to acknowledging it exists.  How would you convince me it does exist?
       <strong>
        That's the evidence I need

       I can't open that door for you.  Go try DMT with an open mind.  Technique and dose is important.  You will never think of science or this world in the same light ever again.  If you need it, go do it.  Let the universe show you.

       I think you need to lay off it a bit judging by your post history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know what DMT does. You do know your brain produces it when you sleep and before death, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're taking a psychedelic drug. A drug that is known to cause auditory and visual hallucinations. They alter your perception of reality by changing the chemical reactions in your brain. Let me repeat, they alter your
       <strong>
        perception
       </strong>
       of reality. I'm well aware of the effects of hallucinogens, though I've not taken DMT. I know what a hallucinogen can do and how it affects you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know hallucinogenic drug rule #1 is always have someone sober to watch over you, right? You know why that is? Because your perception of reality can be so severely different than what is real, that you do dumb things that can get you or others hurt, or at the least, make your trip worse.  The mind is a powerful thing in that you can trick it to believe certain things are real when they're not. Much like schizophrenia. They
       <strong>
        perceive
       </strong>
       a reality that does not exist and can be dangerous to themselves and/or others because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Altering your perception of reality =/= a different reality actually existing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I think you need to maybe take a break from DMT for a while. I mean, it can be psychologically addictive and if it starts affecting your sober reality, then you have to take a step back and just get your mind right. I have no problem against most drug use, but safely and in moderation.

       Also, i am not a current user of entheogens.  You are probably the last person i would ask for advice.  I am likely one of the most knowledgeable harm-reduction proponents out there for entheogens.  I would say that besides rule number one is another of my favorites, "when you get the message, hang up the phone."

       That's your real problem.  You give no quarter to any theory by anyone except your own.  You play devils advocate.  I read a previous post where you claim atheism.  Prove it.  I need evidence.  Get out your calculator and prove to me that everything I've said is wrong.  You have not a collaborative bone in your body.  The epitomy of an ego in need of temporary dissolution.

       And I've been claiming this whole time that there is no evidence of your claim. I've been trying to keep an open mind and avoid saying it's impossible because I don't have the evidence to prove that. But there's a huge difference between rejecting a claim and accepting a claim. I'm rejecting your claim, not making a claim of my own.

       Of course i understand the burden of proof.  Luckily, this is not an experiment, or a court of law.  Also, you have no authority (due to bias) to conduct judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a really good friend once.  He is a scientist.  We collaborated on these theories unbelievably well.  He did not demand proof or judge my theological hypotheses.  I did likewise for his scientific acumen.  We instead searched for similarities.  You believe you get something out of demands and judgment and rejection.  He and I believed we gained more insight and strengthened our combined knowledge through deep study of each others expertise and thoughtful collaboration.  We did not accept every twist and turn we took.  But we learned from every one of them.  We both came out of it wiser and rewarded.

       Have your last reply though. I'm tired of dealing with you accusing me of this or that and putting words in my mouth. I'm done with you. All I wanted this whole time was evidence. When you can provide evidence that is unbiased (that means to your claim or my rejection of your claim) and is repeatable and predictable, you'll have my attention.

       Also, studies show that entheogens activate more of your brain.  They don't alter your perception like alcohol does.  They increase it.  They lift the veil of social conditioning.  But dmt is nothing like lsd or any other entheogen.  It is 5-10 minutes where you appear unconscious.  Your consciousness is in another dimension.  You've jumped strings.  Be brave and see for yourself.

       Stop trying to make the human brain sound so humdrum.  Like I've said before and even included a quote to highlight it, every thought and feeling you've ever had and every single function of the brain IS a chemical reaction.  "The only two things in life you've ever really enjoyed are serotonin and dopamine."  There are so many neural networks inside the brain.  I mean, damn, a simple metal wire antennae in your car can pick up signals in the air.  But you can't understand that the worlds most sophisticated neural network cannot?

      <p>
       Seriously, research the properties of the pineal and it's symbology in ancient history.  Again, the pyramids.  Dark and quiet.  Don't even need the dmt, just lots of spare time.  Dmt just makes it instant.

       Dreams, yes, very interesting constructs indeed.  They are very similar to a threshhold dose of the spirit molecule.

       Why can't the human mind just be what it is? You're right a connection of neural networks. It's the most advanced brain ebqcuse of the extensively of those networks. But we are not alone in the animal kingdom to possess neural networks. Principle of parsimony- often, the simplest explanation is the correct one. You
       <strong>
        may
       </strong>
       be correct, but there is no evidence that says we can traverse dimensions through our consciousness. We can alter our perception of reality but there is no evidence to suggest your point. If there was, you would have provided it by now. And you and I both know that personal testimonies are unreliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like it if you'd stop claiming I don't know things just because you want to use them as an argument. Bring up the idea, sure, but you have no idea of what I do or don't know
      </p>
      <p>
       I know about the pineal gland. It sits between the two lobes of your brain and people like to claim it's the key to unlocking your mind to new dimensions. It is an endocrine gland that produces melatonin in humans, among other things I'm sure. Actually just about every vertebrate creature has a pineal gland. Are they all unlocking new dimensions too?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I started to watch the terence video but I stopped when I got a phone call. I may watch it tomorrow but I'm not sure. The dude claimed mushrooms were a way for aliens to talk to us (which there is no evidence of). And keep in mind, he died 16 years ago and was prevalent in the 80s. When was that speech made? My guess would be the 80s, a time when mental health was not as widely known as it is today.

       Want to learn more about the brain? Talk to neurosurgeons and neuroscientists and ask them these questions. They understand the brain better than both you and I combined.

       And I like how you hate science...then link Terence McKenna, who was an ecologist and botanist. Also into shamanism which is unsurprising given how much the dude loved tripping balls.

       I don't hate science.  I hate the corruption of science.  You well know the ostracization experienced by the spiritually inclined in the field of science.  They outright reject the search for any (public) knowledge beyond their base humanist views.  Terrence McKenna was a great philosopher and was trained in the sciences.  This made him much more effective than me in communicating with skeptical minds.

       How on earth can you claim science and not know about parallel universe or multiverse theory?  Reality?  Wtf?  Elon Musk says what about "living in a simulation?"

       There's a difference between proposing an idea to exist and another to have an idea backed by evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose if Elon Musk says it, it must be true? Idc if Stephen Hawking says it. No evidence=no deal. That's science. Idk why you can't get out of your mind that science is a method, not a group of people.

       Do me a favor, head over to r/freemasonry and see how giddy those guys are after they are risen to the rank of master mason.  They are vague but obviously overjoyed and excited beyond belief at what they just saw.  I can relate.  "Mankind abused it and it was lost, but it still exists in the elect of God."  They are experiencing direct contact with the Godhead, Grand Architect, spirit world, whatever you want to call it.

       Evidence of such a Godhead, or however you want to call it, existing? Evidence it's not just what their minds perceive to be God? How do you differentiate between divine revelation and hallucination? That's why you need evidence of that divine being having existed in the first place. That's step one because every argument relies on that premise bring true. So evidence?

       Okay let me try here.  Its a work in progress an i am a layman.

       Their minds perception can be universal (i.e. quantum entanglement).  This world is just as real as the spirit world and both we see through chemical lenses.  Your pineal gland is the key.   I don't have any proof I've physically brought back with me, but you should read some of my old writings on this account and by all means, check out Rick Strassmans work.  Hallucination is from dehydration.  If you want to know the difference between hallucination and a shamanic trance, you'll either need to die or have a NDE.  Or have some dimethyltryptamine.  Become one of the elect of God.

       The occult and Gnosticism is all about being able to manipulate and control your own mind and consciousness. It doesn't require external entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, they have been following the same plan for thousands of years. But every time they get close they can't hold on to it. I think the only way they will succeed is if they find a way to turn people into willless slaves through technology by modifying people from birth. Lets hope they haven't figured it out yet.

       Plus, their scientists reject everything outside of the vanity of this world as old fashioned superstition.  They make fantastical claims and theories that are beyond a laypersons comprehension that are designed to devalue our place (and power).  The greatest deception of the devil is making you believe he doesn't exist.

       I'd endorse this thought. If you read Peter Levanda's "Sinister Forces" trilogy, there does seem a Satanic supernatural plan threaded though generations of gradual systemic corruption of morality and ideals.

       But it's not a straight line. It's been waylaid and stopped numerous times. It can happen again.

       I don't hate science.  I hate the corruption of science.  You well know the ostracization experienced by the spiritually inclined in the field of science.  They outright reject the search for any (public) knowledge beyond their base humanist views.  Terrence McKenna was a great philosopher and was trained in the sciences.  This made him much more effective than me in communicating with skeptical minds.
