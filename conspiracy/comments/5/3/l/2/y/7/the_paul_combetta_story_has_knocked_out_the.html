        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">26</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2016-09-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/MrMarmot.html">MrMarmot</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>...and what we learned only proves this peon&#39;s breaking the law and that HRC has pretty much broken every law ever; we didn&#39;t learn much else. I think he was hung out to dry and distract us for a couple of reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>I think she&#39;s passed on. That NC rally was very important in keeping up her campaign, and they couldn&#39;t afford to have that fakery break into the general public. The public got the bombings in NYC/NJ and the conspiracy crowd got this guy â€“ knocked the whole green screen glitches and laugh tracks from NC footage right off the front page. It&#39;s striking me as important enough to share, because you&#39;re my real friends:</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the video we&#39;ve all seen:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYXgqUZORXo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYXgqUZORXo</a></p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve seen the theories that this might have been a hit, but they didn&#39;t have any traction here. I think it&#39;s possible: Her handlers are fans of public execution for the cover and distraction factor, which I could be a victim of currently, but just some thoughts about that video.</li>
</ul>

<p>--The secret service agent at center screen, 1st frame of the video, disappears behind the van as it pulls in; both of the other agents back there move around to the side/front, but he stays.</p>

<p>--It looks like the side door (on the other side) opens at about 6 seconds in.</p>

<p>--There is the sound of someone gasping/exhaling at 20 seconds, that sounds like it&#39;s coming from her, and she collapses just after.</p>

<p>--There&#39;s the sound of something like a bullet casing, and the audio doesn&#39;t match the object that hits the ground behind her after the gasping sound. So, the audio sync is off, or that sound is something else. I&#39;ve read/seen all the commentary on this, and I&#39;m still WtF about it.</p>

<p>--The secret service agent in question reappears at 38 seconds, adjusting the sleeve on his shirt or jacket for some reason. I have no conjecture here, just noting that it&#39;s a little odd.</p>

<p>--The scrubbed news reports, the body double, etc. etc. I think that may have been her Kennedy moment.</p>

<p>Edit: If you search for the exact title of that video, it doesn&#39;t come up on the front page in YouTube. The videos that do, including InfoWars, have the footage of that agent edited out, at least the three that I just watched. Just sayin...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a good answer, except we&#39;ve only seen one camera filming this whole thing. So, that was either an oversight on the handlers, a fluke that only one person was filming, or the filming was intentional and staged to be publicized. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the last reason because it&#39;s too sloppy.</p>

<p>The only thing that I can come up with is that there were only a very few who could have been able to do it in private and they were too close? I&#39;m sure she had trusted SS sniffing her food all the time.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s also possible that it became a last-minute decision on someone&#39;s part because she was really in distress, and having her leave that memorial service looked terrible â€“ just after a horrible and short press conference the day before. They may have just had enough and it was an opportunity. If it was her detail that did something, that person or persons would have been in place for a while and waiting for the word. She was too much of a liability to keep in the public eye any longer. She was going nuts and could name all the names.</p>
