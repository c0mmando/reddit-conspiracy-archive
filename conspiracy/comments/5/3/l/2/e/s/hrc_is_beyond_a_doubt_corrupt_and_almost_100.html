        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello all. Today was the first time I stumbled upon this subreddit, and from hours of reading the top scoring links from the past year and the comment sections within them, it seems that many of you hold my same opinion. That is, summed up, that Hillary Clinton should not and can not be our president (to be clear, I am not a Trump supporter either, or a big fan of any candidate for that matter). The more I research about it, the more I want to drop everything I have here in America and move to a small country and scrub bathroom stalls for the rest of my life, for all I care. But, as an average American who (realistically) has almost no chance of changing the course of this rigged system on his own, what can we do collectively if anything? Sorry if a similar topic has been posted here, but I have been browsing much longer than I would like to admit and haven&#39;t seen much at all on this subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually am starting to think Trump is going to win in a landslide.  A lot of people think this. No one likes Hillary. She was supposed to run against Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz and win easily. But she&#39;s up against Trump who has absolutely embarrassed her already.</p>

<p>Even Hillary supporters don&#39;t really like her and can&#39;t name any of her accomplishments. She was objectively a failure as Secretary of State. Her supporters just don&#39;t like Trump or Trump supporters, and of course many of them are Marxists and/or aggrieved minorities anyway. People will show up to vote and support her, so they can defeat Trump, but if it rains? Maybe not. There&#39;s nowhere near the excitement about her that there was for Obama in 2008 and her campaign knows this.</p>

<p>She won&#39;t get nearly the black and/or millennial vote that Obama got. The optics are terrible with her. Her ratings are starting to go down and she doesn&#39;t project healthiness. People really catch onto that.  I have no idea what&#39;s going to happen between now and the election but this first debate is going to be crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Marxist who knows other Marxists, I can assure you that we HATE Hillary too. She is a blatant stooge of the ruling class, TPTB, what have you. Don&#39;t confuse us with liberals!</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you on the black and millennial votes not going for her. Honestly, yeah, every poll I&#39;ve seen has shown Trump steadily gaining momentum while Hillary drops, and there&#39;s plenty of pundits and people who just can&#39;t understand why, when a lot of us see it pretty clearly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s why I don&#39;t think Trump is compromised (yet), even though I might be very wrong about that -- because Hillary was supposed to have a cakewalk to the Presidency and instead her health started rapidly deteriorating and Trump started a true populist movement. </p>

<p>I kind of think the media smear campaign against Trump was supposed to do the trick and now, as you say, they&#39;re probably panicking and rubbing their hands over that not being the case.</p>
