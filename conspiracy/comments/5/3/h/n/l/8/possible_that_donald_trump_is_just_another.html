        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see a lot of similarities between Obama&#39;s rise to power and Trump. And just like Obama it is possible that Trump is the &quot;hope and change&quot; candidate for the Republicans, but is still controlled by TPTB.</p>

<p>I have been following Trump since he announced his candidacy. Combined with Scott Adams&#39; (Dilbert creator, he has fascinating commentary on why Trump will win, google it) analysis I fully believe he will win.</p>

<p>But when it comes to holding the most powerful office in the world nothing happens by accident. The media have been covering him relentlessly. He decimated political dynasties, his Twitter account is still active, he hasn&#39;t been &quot;Ron Pauled&quot; etc. It seems to good to be true.</p>

<p>His love for eminent domain is what caught my attention. He legitimized it&#39;s use among the electorate by donning a hard hat at a rally and saying he will build roads and highways and use ED for it.</p>

<p>What if he is the candidate that will use eminent domain to take over large swaths of the houses (and underlying land) built during the Housing Bubble and transfer its ownership to the Treasury, whereby it will use the land as further collateral for borrowing from the Fed, or transfer the land to the Fed to pay off loans?</p>

<p>I love the spectacle, but I still call bullshit on the anti-establishment theme...</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BTW, read something funny yesterday - I think someone linked it here - from Reggie Love&#39;s book. Apparently, Clinton actually <em>apologized</em> to Obama for her people spreading a rumor about him being a drug user and dealer. And he was like, &quot;You know, that&#39;s largely meaningless because I know about the emails your folks are sending calling me a secret Muslim.&quot; And she went off on him. And he told Love later that that&#39;s when he knew he was going to win. Keep wondering if her camp was also behind the gay lover rumors and the stinky plane article.</p>

I actually know more men voting Clinton than women. And a lot of people voting for Clinton and holding their noses because Trump is such a clownish disaster - which I think is what the Clinton camp was gunning for the whole time, probably the only way she could win given all the corruption...they&#39;ve totally re-imagined the old David Duke vs. Edwin Edwards election: &quot;Vote for the crook, it&#39;s important.&quot; Makes me so angry.

<p>Um. the media implying he has a small dick and faithfully giving the audience a daily dose of 2 minutes of Trump hate straight out of Orwell&#39;s 1984.... That is not the coverage you want from the media.  Those that believe the media believe that Trump is a racist, sexist, bigot...</p>

<p>That is worse than being Ron Pauled. Those are daily attacks on his character. How can you honestly misunderstand that as being positive media coverage?   It&#39;s not, it just doesn&#39;t fit the narrative you want to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that yeah he has received non stop negative coverage. </p>

<p>But Having non stop media attention is the opposite of being Ron Pauled. Ron Paul had a media blackout surrounding him and the primaries were rigged specifically against him. </p>

<p>Remember that Obama also spoke against private campaign financing laws, against the Patriot Act, wanted to close gitmo and loathed bailing out the banks at the expense of taxpayers. Then what happen? Never trust a politicians promises. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Also, as an aside, he reversed himself on the TPP just last week. He said he&#39;s open to approving it if it&#39;s great for America (and it is great for American corporations, just not we the American people - so, like Clinton, he&#39;s giving lip service because they both think we&#39;re idiots).</p>

<p>I know your retort will be &quot;but he says it has to be phenomenal and it&#39;s not now&quot; - but this is how it begins. He has softened his rhetoric and opened the door to approval.</p>

<p>If he does manage to not flake out before the election and does manage to win, do not be surprised when he signs it. Because he&#39;ll sign it. Or stamp it.</p>

<p>TPP is a dumb thing to pin hopes on - because every one of those puppets will sign it, they&#39;re slaves to money and the money corporations provide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a media narrative that he didn&#39;t really want to win the nomination and wanted to be 2nd place. I don&#39;t buy it, no one with his ego and accomplishments would have that mindset. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just hilarious that its the same experience as in 2008, where Obama promised so much hope and change, and it turns out he is  puppet.</p>

<p>TPTB are exponentially more powerful than Trump and could easily stop him, but are not...smells fishy.</p>

<p>And Rumsfeld. 
Plus, Trump&#39;s VP is Mike Pence, another warmongering neocon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh bullshit.  Is that why he wants giuliani on his team and chose a neocon VP who wants to be the next cheney?  Trump supports patriot act, NSA, wars in the middle east, he supports giving more money to Israel.  I guess love is blind if you can&#39;t see that trump is just another neocon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of that has faded away. Most women I know are not Clinton fans (granted, they remember Bill and Hill in the 90s). I actually know more men voting Clinton than women. And a lot of people voting for Clinton and holding their noses because Trump is such a clownish disaster - which I think is what the Clinton camp was gunning for the whole time, probably the only way she could win given all the corruption...they&#39;ve totally re-imagined the old David Duke vs. Edwin Edwards election: &quot;Vote for the crook, it&#39;s important.&quot; Makes me so angry. Fuck &#39;em, vote third party.</p>
