        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When the first mammals ventured out into daylight, after the dinosaurs died off, the surviving lizard people had to learn to herd mammals instead of dinosaurs. Those mammals eventually became us. We were little more than rats back then, so they bred us to be just strong and smart enough to not be too dangerous. </p>

<p>After numerous crustal terrain disasters over millions of years, the lizard people felt safer under the seas and earth. So they left us on top of the surface to proliferate and breed for their harvesting. We are their prey. I imagine the next crispr gene hack trend will be lizard eyes.</p>

<p>Some of these intelligent bipedal lizards who bred and herded us got the idea to breed us to make us smart enough to do all the work as slaves. We are the ape matrix of our lizard herding masters. </p>

<p>This is a low probability high risk hypothesis, but what if I were right? If so, we were probably designed to be too smart and we made off with their stash of real good dope. Maybe they designed us to be just violent enough for them to scavenge off of without notice.
So they&#39;re often hanging with priests and caretakers.</p>

<p>And now when we do their dope, we use tantric sex to go through the cosmic twat and rat the lizards out to the universal mind. This really pisses the lizards off, and its time they culled the herd anyway.</p>

<p>Tomorrow&#39;s St. Patrick&#39;s Day, my Irish father&#39;s birthday, he loved bullshit, you just basically discounted 50% of everything he said. Just like some of the stuff in these videos, but did you know that Jimmy Page was a huge Aleister Crowley fan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, but what do we do?  I try to be completely spiritually intact.  I&#39;m confident in myself and my being.  I carry a constant meditation of love in my heart to ward of negative energy of any stripe.</p>

<p>So yes, let&#39;s say you&#39;re exactly, literally right.  Fuck lizards.  Why would they be something to fear?  They can&#39;t possibly be geniuses or unstoppable psychic warriors or they&#39;d actually dominate the planet, not subvert the mainstream over decades, subtly convince people to abandon morality through the media, yadda yadda.  &quot;An adventure 65 million years in the making&quot; indeed.  These fucking dumbass lizards can&#39;t do better than that in that time?  Hoo boy, Gods Among Men.</p>

<p>I have a bearded dragon in a tank in my room.  I love him, but he&#39;s as dumb as the rock he sits on.  He can&#39;t find his way out of a glass box in ten years.  I&#39;m not worried about some genetic remnants just like him that refuse to leave the planet.  Fuck them.</p>
