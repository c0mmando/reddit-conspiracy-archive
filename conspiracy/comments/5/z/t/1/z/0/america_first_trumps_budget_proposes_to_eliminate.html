    <div class="md"><p>Why do we have a government funded program that primarily focuses on targeting our President? Where is the government news program that supports U.S. President Trump? 
Idk about meals on wheels effectiveness but there are other social and public programs still available that can share the burden of losing meals on wheels  till another more effective program can be put in place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question: how do you measure the effectiveness of meals on wheels? Bonus points if you can name any other social program like meals on wheels. </p>

<p>As for the government news program that supports Trump: Breitbart seems to be making huge strides in that department</p>

<p>NPR is left leaning, don&#39;t get me wrong. But I can&#39;t remember the last time The Muppets put out a hit piece on Trump; feel free to link it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cost vs results is a pretty effective way to measure how well the program is run. The government doesn&#39;t fund 100% of meals on wheels, Ca gets only about 2% of its funding from government, the rest is from donations. Granted some other states rely on up to 49% of their funds comming from the government. If people are that upset then they can donate and suppliment the amount meals on wheels lost. Question if Susan G Komens cure for cancer was government funded but only a small fraction of the money went to finding the cure would you be angry if the government cut the funding?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what are the results though?  How many people don&#39;t end up with food and starve?  It just seems like such a small program to cut when there are more massive costs in the government.  As for Susan G. Komen; because so little of the money donated to them goes towards cancer research, I already dislike the organization.  I would be surprised if received some kind of grant from the government.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not exactly sure how to answer that question.  The US doesn&#39;t have as many business connections in Africa, and other countries with similar organizations are already there, most likely.  True free markets don&#39;t truly exist in global trade.  If businesses are going to compete with other businesses that are helped by their governments, we need one that is designed to help US businesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an excellent answer as to what is. Thank you. </p>

<p>My question is perhaps more based in ethics. And maybe there&#39;s not a cut &amp; dry answer. However, if we are to become a protectionist or isolationist state, we maybe shouldn&#39;t usurp the resources of other countries? </p>

<p>It seems if that were the case, a free market could exist in global trade (at a glance.) </p>

<p>I will be interested to see how this goes. </p>
