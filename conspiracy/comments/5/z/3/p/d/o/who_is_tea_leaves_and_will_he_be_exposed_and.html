        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As the story continues to unravel, here&#39;s what we know so far:</p>

<p>&quot;Tea Leaves&quot;, a <del>man</del> person representing <del>himself</del> him/herself to be a &quot;computer scientist&quot; (who&#39;s actually a CIA operative??), apparently concocted Internet traffic logs in order to falsely incriminate Donald Trump by making it appear that a Russian bank and a server registered to an independent marketing company (Cendyn) retained by Trump, were improperly communicating.  Tea Leaves shopped <del>his</del> his/her story to several well-known media outlets, most of which, after their own investigations, refused to bite.  However, Franklin Foer, a notorious political writer with a lengthy history working for democratically-biased publications such as the Huffington Post and The New Republic, fell for it and wrote a hit piece entitled &quot;Was A Trump Server Communicating With Russia?&quot; which was published by Slate on Oct. 31, 2016.  A <em>FRUITLESS</em> FBI investigation soon followed.  In the interim, many biased MSM outlets have made numerous attempts to influence public opinion by facetiously spinning the paltry facts and trying to make it appear that Trump had some nefarious involvement.</p>

<p>What is now clear is that Donald Trump had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with the issue.  And it&#39;s important to note that the Trump server NEVER communicated with the Russian bank (i.e., <strong><em>there were NO DNS lookups initiated by the Trump server regarding the Russian bank&#39;s server</em></strong>); it was the Russian bank&#39;s server that had repeatedly pinged the Trump server, there was NO back-and-forth communication between the two computers.  In layman&#39;s terms, the situation was simply that the Russian bank&#39;s server had &quot;looked up&quot; the Trump server&#39;s contact information (just like you might open a phone book and look up Trump&#39;s telephone number), but never made a call.  And, in fact, the Trump server wasn&#39;t even actually his!  It was the property of a marketing company (Cendyn) Trump hired in connection with his hotel business&#39; sales efforts to, among other things, send out emails world wide to promote the hotels.  The Russian bank&#39;s &quot;pings&quot; in response to receipt of such emails is something that is ROUTINELY done by servers to protect themselves against spam, etc.  The ONLY THING NEFARIOUS about the whole situation was Tea Leaves&#39; use of his/her doctored logs to make it APPEAR that inappropriate activity had occurred as he/she apparently conned Foer, who clearly is NOT Internet-savvy, into believing as he fell for Tea Leaves&#39; scheme.</p>

<p>Following is a list of resources identified to date which document the claims made above.  As an aside, readers should note a VERY insightful comment by u/broreemmeanasstaday in a related r/conspiracy post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We need more info about &#39;the computer scientists&#39;. That just sounds silly. Plus, <strong><em>you don&#39;t find this server unless you already knew it was there</em></strong>.&quot;  [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p>&quot;These DNS records alone simply cannot prove that any specific messages were sent at those times. In fact, they can’t really prove anything at all, and certainly not “communication” between Trump and Alfa. This cannot be overstated: <strong><em>No one, not Tea Leaves, not his academic peers, and not Franklin Foer, can show that a single message was exchanged between Trump and Alfa.</em></strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Quoted expert, Krypt3ia, unhappy with how his words were misused in Slate article concerning Trump/Russian bank allegations: <a href="https://krypt3ia.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/shits-gone-plaid-gdd53-and-slate/">&quot;Shits Gone Plaid: GDD53 and Slate&quot;</a>, Nov. 1, 2016;</p>

<p>The TL;dr: TeaLeave’s story was correct in saying that the New York Times had looked into this. It is also true they dropped it for lack of evidence that would satisfy the editorial staff. There was NO credible evidence. &quot;There was a lot of speculation and theory but what Tea had put on the darknet and had been shopping around was not forensically proven and in fact all of the metadata that may have existed had been stamped out of all documents or never existed in the first place as they were using text files. In looking at the so called evidence I called bullshit. ... Tea[Leaves] still shopped this around until someone took the bait hook line and sinker (Foer) putting out speculation, anonymous testimony, and not much more as proof positive that Trump is in league with Russia’s Alfabank via secret emails and configured servers. ... This was a non story and this was someone’s troll or an IC operation of some kind. I left it at that… That is until last night when this fallacy laden report came out of Slate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So here is what I believe happened with Slate and Foer. Tea, not happy with my ignoring their bullshit, went on to pimp at least five venues looking for a way to get this wide and Foer was the gullible one to do so. Now, with a live one on the line Tea spun their tale and added the new twist that they are in fact a group of “security professionals” with insider knowledge and that this story is really real. Of course once again they provided no real proof of Trumps servers being configured for this purpose, no evidence of actual emails, and no real forensically sound information that proves any of what they say can be proven in a court of law. This is a key thing and Slate may not care but others do. Even in the previous dumps on the i2p site that tea set up their diagram said “this is what it would look like” would is not proof, that there is speculation and not evidence.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent an hour or so going through the OP and related articles / posts.  What I don&#39;t get is, even if this is true (probably is), and tealeaves forged the info (logs), and Slate ran with it, thereby starting the media feeding frenzy......  </p>

<p>...what proof do we have that this was the information that [supposedly] got the [supposed] FISA warrant approved and [supposedly] allowed FBI / NSA / whoever to start surveillance on Trump / Tower?</p>

<p>e.g. How do we know they weren&#39;t doing it already?  How do we know they were doing it at all...and WHEN?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m more confused than ever.  </p>
