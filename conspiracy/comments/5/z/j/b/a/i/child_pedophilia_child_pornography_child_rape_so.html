       The words "child pedophilia" and "Child Pornography" should be called what they (usually) are, Child Rape. Don't let these "elitist" sickos off via a function of language. They are trying to soften the terms currently, almost making it seem acceptable, not a matter of choice, etc. Keep the pressure on them and take back our language and country.

       people who believe that "non contact" pedophilia isnt as bad as child rape should be beaten as bad as child rapists. i dont care if youve never seen a child in your life, if youre a pedophile i hope you rot in prison. i hope every day of your life is as miserable as the day before.

       I'm sure most people "hate" anyone who has harmed a child or is complicit in the trade of abuse material.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what you're saying is you hate someone for the chemical fuck up that gave them abnormal desires.

       Do you hate trans people or gay people too even if they haven't touched a scalpel or a same sex partner?

       Well, what does it mean to view child porn? Is it touching (in video)? Is it sticking your sexual organ in a kid? If it is the latter, those people need to face the law. No, not at the same level of those doing it, but it is reinforcing and acting like a gateway drug to child rape.

       To view child porn means to view images or video on a media device of some kind (computer, phone, television, magazine).

       Viewing child porn is not the same as raping a child although both are crimes.

       I corrected my original post. The point, and you are not talking about it, you are being overly rational, is that these satanic child rapists are hiding behind words like pedophilia (when they are raping children). I want to differentiate no rape with rape.
      </p>

       Think of the children, and less of the semantics. come from your heart and less from your mind.

       "too rational"? Really?

       Who are these satanic child rapists? Who is hiding behind the word pedophile? You're being "too irrational".

       I really don't understand what point you're trying to make here.

      <p>
       Pedophillia is a mental illness where the victim is attracted to children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Child rape involves penetrating a child.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can have a person who is a pedophile but hasn't committed the rape of a child.

       Yeah, really. Your argument is purely semantics. And your user name is terrible. It is a disease that is killing more and more people and you project that at more every day. My lack of heart comment wasn't even regarding your handle, but now...
      </p>
      <p>
       My point:
When adults have "sex" with children - call it what it is - Child Rape (and not pedophilia).
When adults view other adults having "sex" with children - call it what it is - Viewing child rape.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to get control of our language back. They are already trying to justify it and weaken it (child rape).

       If an adult rapes a child we do call it child rape.

       Not all child rapists are pedophiles, not all pedophiles are child rapists. It's an important distinction.

       i agree with you about the sex rings. Although the term pedophilia is hardly a new term. Pederasty? Catamite? Look up the meanings behind these words. This has existed a helluva lot longer than anyone thinks. why is that? bc a thousand years ago, we lived to 35. so we married at twelve and started popping out babies.  in some countries, India, for example. children are betrothed at nine. I am not saying this is right, but this is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       something needs to be done to stop the rampant abuse of our children. My problem with your argument is that you are casting too wide of a net. you wish to scrub sexual attraction to children from our dna. That won't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should focus on the people making the porn, distributing the porn, and profiting from the exploitation of children. For example, certain gov't agencies retain the child porn they collect and use it to create honeypots, in the hopes of catching predators. let me rephrase: the fbi has more kiddie porn than anyone else, and when they stumble upon a site, they keep it up and running... why? so they can finally nail epstein? so they can link the luzzattos to breeding programs? so they can stop the illegal trafficking of human beings? No. They do it so they can catch guys like this,

       </a>
       , who, while being detestable in his admiration of fellow pedos, didn't actually produce any porn, nor did he actually touch a child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop worrying about the creeps on the chans, worry about the cretin in the three thousand dollar suit that frequents Thailand and Serbia on holiday. If we stop those at the top, the guys at the bottom will not have anything to feed from. that may help. it may make it worse, idk... but stopping the people that actually harm the children is priority to me over stopping the guy shamefully wanking in his basement.

       First, thanks for taking the time with your thoughtful response.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I'm not intending to cast a wide net. My first statement was done in haste, I said as much. So to clarify, let's call it what it is (when it does involve child rape and or viewing it.) We can't redefine language, so to speak, so Pederasty, Catamite is out of our active vocabulary, but child rape is not. So, again, I don't want to allow the worst offenders to hide behind words. And I am extremely against using culture to define human values. We can start at a more mundane sexual form of abuse in circumcision (no pain killers to boot) and take that to marrying 12 year olds. Tradition or not, I'm gonna call a spade a spade. If you give these people an inch, they will make it into a foot and constantly hide behind it, justify it, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go after those making the child rape videos, sure, but here the net needs to be wide. Perhaps we can stop wasting resources on the war on drugs and focus on helping human victims? I mean the idea is to help right?
I don't disagree with much of what you say and perhaps I'm going a bit more to one side of the argument, but that is because for too long things have been too lenient. So, imo, we need to make up for that by putting the hammer down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreed though, we need to go after the Epsteins and big ones. But first, we take down smaller fish, trafickers and such and make the connections. THEN you have solid evidence against the ring leaders. You don't go in the other direction and risk letting them go.

       Spoken with feeling. But it is also a bit of an ignorant opinion. If you want to refine it with some good info I recommend "Perv" by Jesse Bering. To summarize what I got out of it:
Its a bit different for females, but for males, their sexual orientation is developed between the ages of 4 and 10 and is pretty much set in stone thereafter. People don't choose their orientation, and neither can they unchoose it. It's pretty much a matter of luck what your orientation ends up as. Wishing someone be beaten for an orientation they neither chose nor can unchoose makes no more moral sense than beating them for the color of their skin or the religion they were born into.
      </p>
      <p>
       People may not be responsible for their orientation, but they are responsible for their actions. For people who actually abuse children, or pay money to people who abuse children, or rape adults for that matter, I'm right there with you. They should be erased from the earth. By the way, did you know that half of child abusers are not pedophiles? The kid was just a convenient sex object, or they got off on the power or whatever. People are responsible for their actions, not their orientation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its important to distinguish between child abusers and people unlucky enough to have developed a pedophilic orientation but have not abused and do not abuse children. If you think that abusing a child and not abusing a child are equivalent, you must think abusing a child is not a significant offence. To lump them together dilutes the outrage that should rightly be directed at people who have actually harmed children, whatever their orientation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone hasnt compromised some kids or adults right to live without being abused, then they also have a right to live without being abused by you in a self righteous fury. Have some compassion. Would you feel differently if your child grew up with an unfortunate orientation through no fault of theirs or yours?

       Child rape is a choice. It involves Satanism by all accounts. And we ALWAYS have a choice. If it also involves blackmail, then the choice is easy, you turn those blackmailers in and face the music. This is not about self preservation, this is about human preservation and being a human being.

       as someone who has been raped, and had pictures taken of me, in both an exploitative and non capacity, there is a giant fucking difference between the two. the fact that you would even compare the two shows how out of touch you are, it doesn't matter if you are discussing young humans or people who are ninety, there is a difference between someone taking pictures from afar vs up close, there is a difference between willing submitting to pics vs having them taken w/o consent, there is a difference between sharing those photos with permission vs without, and there is definitely a difference between any of those and having someone shove their genitals up inside yours.

       So you agree with the idiots in this thread saying that child porn and pedophilia isn't as bad as child rape? As far as I'm concerned they go hand in hand and where you find one you will most certainly find the others. It's honestly retarded because it's like saying you hate lung cancer but you don't think they should fully stop the production of cigarettes. Why be against child rape if you'll dance around the fact that a pedophile is attracted sexually to children. The fact that he/she hasn't offended yet is all it takes for you to deem them fit for society? Even though you people admit said person has a major flaw with how their brain works you trust them to act in a natural way?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is illogical to deny that a non offending pedo will never act on the urges his/her brain chemistry gives them. This denial of the fact is partly why child porn exists and is so rampant. Yet even then you back down and submit to the idea that taking provocative photos of children isn't exactly what it is; porn designed for a pedophile that supports the sexualization, molestation and rape of children. If you want to end the problem get rid of all the sources instead of waiting to arrest the pedo after they have committed the crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you people in some state of delusion where you think pedophilia, child porn and child rape aren't entirely intertwined problems that deserve equal and brutal punishment? You believe that child porn stops with photos and would never be a catalyst for the other two? I'm sorry about what happened to you but get the fuck out of here with that bullshit.

       you misunderstand what i am saying. intentionally, i believe. My opinion isn't all that delusional, i believe there is a difference between viewing pornography, and being a producer.
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, when you see pictures of the holocaust, are you complicit in the gassing of the jews? if you saved pictures of the darfur genocides, would that make you a warlord?
      </p>
      <p>
       now, it you are selling these images, abusing the children, or in anyway capitalizing on their abuse, then yes, you have done something wrong. and should be tried as such. but to insist that ALL of the creeps that lurk the chans are active abusing pedophiles, and should be treated brutally, shows how irrationally you are thinking about all of this. I, as a victim, would rather have people wank to pictures, of any persuasion, than go out and make their dreams some true. tipper gore in the nineties insisted that video games caused violence. her solution? rating systems. guess what has changed? absolutely nothing. There are still school shootings, there is still bullying, there is still all kinds of animosity when in school. bc the problem doesn't lie within the media. it lies within the person. I would rather someone spank to pics they find on fb than molest a child. my bad for understanding that there is a difference between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       gtfo with your "delusion where you think pedophilia, child porn and child rape aren't ENTIRELY intertwined problems...." they are related, though not mutally exclusive, which you do know, and if you don't i suggest you research a little harder.

       i've been dealing with this shit for twenty years, i had to try to understand, for my own sanity. You may not agree with my stances, but they are valid.

       "Child pedophillia" is redundant because pedo means child already.

       Child pornography is different to child rape, for example a child can be pictured naked without being raped.

       Also too, we need to recognize that there are individuals who are pedophiles and have never committed an act of pedophilia. Unfortunately once that word gets out, you become instantly astroturfed. If you automatically assume someone who is a pedophile is a child rapist, then you are an ignorant fuck muddying this already taboo discourse.

       understandably. but simply looking at an image, is not the same as committing the crime. if you are producing, distributing, or in anyway manufacturing then yes... you have broken the law and should be locked away for the safety of the public. Unfortunately, due to the stigma of being a pedophile, many will not come forward to address their issues. why that is is no mystery. Look at how people lump looking at images into actual rape. from their perspective, you seem to think that that their looking at girls at the beach in equivalent to fucking them. and they should be hanged for it. i wonder why they don't seek treatment. :/ also, we do not even have a strong estimate of how many people are pedophiles, bc they will not come out due to fear (again, understandably,) so the only ones we actively know ARE pedophiles, are the ones who have offended. see the difference?

       Sure, viewing a crime might not be a crime. My larger point is our language influences how we perceive things. It defines them. So, by using softer sounding words like "child pornography" that often discounts the severity of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure they pedophiles can really get help in the sense of psychological help - I sort of think they need to take chemicals to turn off that wiring, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       I follow you, it is a bit like criminalizing drugs, it doesn't make it easy to seek help. Maybe a bad comparison, but how do we compare the most severe things? e.g. child rape

       Wait, so by your terms, sexualized imagery is rape? Because that's what feminists have been insisting for decades and feminism is very unpopular in this sub recently.

       I wasn't clear. I mean when an adult views child pornagraphy (if there is sex) they are viewing child rape. And if an adult has sex or sexually forces their way onto a child, that is child rape too. My point was not to hide behind a word that is not the thing.

       If it's not the thing, then the word doesn't apply. A picture of a naked child is not always child porn, nor is it rape. If I take a picture of my baby daughter in the tub, is that child porn? Is it rape? The elites are not the ones playing with language, you are. Call it what it is and stop trying to muddy the waters.

       I really should have been more clear and that is on me. I wrote it up quick. But, the point is important. There have already been some talk of lowering punishment, saying pedophilia (child rape) is not a choice, and other dark crap like that. So, my premise is we need to take back our words. Let's not allow them to hide being a word that, though is bad, like pedophilia, is not usually an accurate description of the crime. So, when it fits, call them what they are - child rapists. That will make it harder for the public to ignore and harder for the sicko's to get away with things.

       First, thanks for taking the time with your thoughtful response.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I'm not intending to cast a wide net. My first statement was done in haste, I said as much. So to clarify, let's call it what it is (when it does involve child rape and or viewing it.) We can't redefine language, so to speak, so Pederasty, Catamite is out of our active vocabulary, but child rape is not. So, again, I don't want to allow the worst offenders to hide behind words. And I am extremely against using culture to define human values. We can start at a more mundane sexual form of abuse in circumcision (no pain killers to boot) and take that to marrying 12 year olds. Tradition or not, I'm gonna call a spade a spade. If you give these people an inch, they will make it into a foot and constantly hide behind it, justify it, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go after those making the child rape videos, sure, but here the net needs to be wide. Perhaps we can stop wasting resources on the war on drugs and focus on helping human victims? I mean the idea is to help right?
I don't disagree with much of what you say and perhaps I'm going a bit more to one side of the argument, but that is because for too long things have been too lenient. So, imo, we need to make up for that by putting the hammer down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreed though, we need to go after the Epsteins and big ones. But first, we take down smaller fish, trafickers and such and make the connections. THEN you have solid evidence against the ring leaders. You don't go in the other direction and risk letting them go.
