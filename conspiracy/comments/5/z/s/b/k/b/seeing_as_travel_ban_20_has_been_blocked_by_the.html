    <div class="md"><p>boom, nailed it. Trump wants to dwindle down most intelligence groups and that would mean the money party is over. So they cant make him look good. What if a false flag happens and he responds in the right manner in the public eyes? Just bolsters him more and then he can strike them down. God forbid they do a FF and he can actually prove it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think enough of the voters in America got fed up with the Hillary bullshit train, and voted for Trump as a big &quot;Fuck you!&quot; to the establishment.  Plus, I heard that they were able to prevent Hillary from cheating in November.  She got away with it when she was going against Sanders.  </p>

<p>I think it was this interview that explains it.  </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/yW4G4TwrSHk">https://youtu.be/yW4G4TwrSHk</a></p>

<p>Yes, I agree.  Brexit was a voter revolt against globalization.  </p>

<p>I used to think it was good that they went to the euro, but now I see it has its problems.  It seems like there should be separate countries and separate currencies to prevent any one person or group of people from acquiring too much power.  I did not factor in human nature, and was probably a bit naive about things.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t really make sense to me. If they want open borders, why would they do false flag attacks that make people scared? That would drive people to wanting closed borders, wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>A false flag with muslims right now would play into Trump&#39;s hand, and would justify his ban.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If they want open borders, why would they do false flag attacks that make people scared?&quot;  To justify increasing security and taking away our civil rights.  They are currently testing retina scanning in order to board a flight.  Are you willing to tolerate it?  How much humiliation are people willing to suffer in order to fly?  </p>

<p>I am aware of private terminals that the wealthy use when flying in private jets.  They do not go through any security at all.  Only us cattle go through security.  </p>

<p>&quot;That would drive people to wanting closed borders, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;  Yes, which is what Trump is pushing for.  Trump is a Nationalist, not a Globalist.  Are you aware of what is going on in Europe with the Muslim immigrants? I ask because it is not being reported by the MSM.  </p>

<p>&quot;A false flag with muslims right now would play into Trump&#39;s hand, and would justify his ban.&quot;  Yes, it would.  I would be surprised if there was one.  Do you recall the Orlando massacre last June?  Remember how Obama would not admit that it was a terrorist act?  Same with a few of the other shootings.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps.  I am not saying you are wrong, but all indications were that Hillary would walk away with it.  I went back and rewatched some of the news in the weeks leading up to the election, the day before the election, and the day of the election.  They all thought that voting day was a formality.  </p>

<p>I thought otherwise because Trump was getting a lot of people to turn out, and Hillary was not.  This struck me as odd.  I thought Trump would lose because Hillary would cheat again, but apparently she was blocked at the last moment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They certainly tried. Someone with a finger up the media&#39;s collective ass is terrified of Trump.</p>

<p>Maybe he is just a different cabal&#39;s frontman and the old breed globalists are kicking and screaming.</p>

<p>If I really tune in the antennas on my tinfoil hat, I can see the MSM knowing that future generations of voters put absolutely no stock in them as a source of news and are intentionally failing to deliver so that Trump is pushed.</p>

<p>All I know for sure is that we&#39;re in for an interesting presidency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no it&#39;s exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>TPTB want open boarders.</p>

<p>The reason that the Travel Ban is failing is because TPTB are blocking it -- <strong>TPTB (CIA/Mossad) want to be able to sneak terrorist into the US through a free-flow of &quot;immigrants&quot; and &quot;refugees&quot;.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No because this ban helps protect our country and solidify our sovereign nation. A the globalists use false flags to increase our danger and sense of public safety, and destroy our sovereignty with the goal of ending the United States. Slowly, one devastating attack followed by a few thousand more foreigner military age men squeezed into our borders. Then they rinse and repeat. </p>

<p>If you need proof look at France, Germany and Sweden, all three had brutal attacks committed by foreign military age men , followed by more pouring through the borders waiting to get their orders.</p>

<p>This is not a joke. People are being attached for existing and behaving and belonging to European culture. </p>

<p>They want you dead or enslaved, if you survive their violent processes that destroy your world. 
At the rate thing are going the Swedish government will match Somalia&#39;s government efforts to police and protect their population </p>

<p>The European police already no longer step in certain areas to enforce the law and keep this women and children safe. They&#39;re on their own in the hood </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No because this ban helps protect our country and solidify our right to protect our sovereign nation. A the globalists use false flags to increase our danger and sense of public safety, and destroy our sovereignty with the goal of ending the United States.

<p>If you need proof look at France, Germany and Sweden, all three had brutal attacks committed by foreign military age men , followed by more pouring through the borders waiting to get their orders.</p>

<p>This is not a joke. People are being attacked merely for existing- behaving and belonging to European culture.  The Europeans try to be hospitable, kind , caring, and genuinely want to help. So the MA men attack murder and maim them with Trucks, knives, hatchets, whatever. </p>

<p>The Europeans made a fatal mistake in believing 
their governments wouldn&#39;t like to them, their leader wouldn&#39;t have hidden long term plan . </p>

<p>Their officials use words like racist, xenophobic , and hate to guilt their citizens  into silence. l So people are afraid to dissent among their friends and families, out of fear-being branded with a scarlet letter.  Then TPTB can continue destroying European, slowly pulling the Jenga pieces in the shadows, only the most vigilant of us see what they do and why they do it.  We need to be outspoken about this. You and I are not evil, we  see the right and the wrong and what their future will bring. The invasion of a Europe will continue to bring death, rape, and devastation along with t the end of Christianity and Buddhism. </p>

<p>They want you dead or enslaved, if you survive their violent processes that destroy your world.
