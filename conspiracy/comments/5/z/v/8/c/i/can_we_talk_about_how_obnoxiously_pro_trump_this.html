       This doesnt just happen to ryan. It happens to literally everyone who steps out of line regarding trump. Mccain questions the russia connection and now hes a pedo. Trumps ban is halted and now obama bribed a hawain judge.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all of these stories get pushed by month old users who solely post in the donald threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       And youll be hit eith downvotes the second you post anything slightly anti trump. Mind you, you can usually bounce back. But the issues there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods delete threads about the trump russian connection, accuse anti trump posters of being brigading shills, and ban you for pointing this out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worse, actual real news like a trump team member fucking a boy, or flynn taking russian money while having national security clearence, are ignored while a picture of a 4chan post claiming mccain is a pedo gets a thousand upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       E: Annnnnd banned for fourteen days. What a fucking shock.

       This sub is pro everything and anti everything. I see people making up conspiracies specifically because they don't like trump, and ive seen people making up conspiracies simply because they dont like the people who don't like trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, the only thing that matters and the only thing that you should concern yourself with is "did they provide cold hard smoking gun evidence" - if they don't, then they can just go fuck themselves and toss their conspiracy into the shit heap pile with the rest of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are welcomed to theorize - but don't EVER build a conspiracy specifically because you preemptively don't like somebody/something; and don't buy into a theory simply because it aligns with the things you like or dislike - you will only be doing yourself a disservice

       Uh yea - when people get good leads on things and then they uncover evidence, they usually share it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its one thing to go "this is my theory" - but its another thing when somebody says "this is the way it is", yet they dont give any hard evidence.  I see the latter happen ALL THE TIME here.

       It is the very nature of a conspiracy that there will often be no hard evidence  That should be obvious.  What you have usually is a lot of circumstantial evidence and motives suggesting a plot or an agenda.  So,  to claim that cold, hard, smoking gun evidence is required is just plain wrong in this context.

       It's been clear for a while now that any sort of critical thinking here has been dying a slow death.  Here's my conspiracy though: there's a connection between - T_D - Conspiracy - Breitbart/Infowars - Russia - an information pipeline connection.

       You're trying to convince people that Paul Ryan and John McCain are good people and are just misunderstood, and you wonder why you're being downvoted? Are you even trying anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       How come every CTR/Shareblue/etc. anti-Trump shill group gets immediately exposed, while not one of these supposed Trump operated shill groups has ever been identified?

       Literal fake news that invents a conspiracy about shareblue bribing paul ryan got upvoted to the front page. All because this sub hates ryan now that he went against trump.

       I honestly believe that this sub doesn't really give much of a flying fuck about Paul Ryan... Just stay off the frontpage... hang out back in "new" here where I found this topic we are in right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The front couple pages of "hot" are mostly a battleground between voting bots, shills, partisans, and T_D users battling
       <a href="/r/politics/">
        /r/politics/
       </a>
       users on a level playing field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being pissed at what you see there is your own fault... just stay away from "hot"... Being pissed at seeing partisanship on "hot" is like getting invited to an orgy and being offended that everyone is naked.

      <p>
       Totally agreed and I've seen this too. There is a coordinated effort to smear and attack those who question Trump. We see it time and time again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've often thought if I were a politician in today's age how easy it'd be to carry out these type of attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       No more appearances on talk radio, no buying advertising, none of that is needed anymore. Just "leak" your smear campaign tactics or anonymously post it up on social media/4chan/reddit and let the users do all the rest.

       You are partially right and partially wrong.

      <p>
       I see a lot of pro Trump stuff; but lately I see a lot of anti Trump stuff. Mostly his cabinet.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't much conspiracy in Trump himself because not only is he a puppet, but he's also kind of an idiot who doesn't know that he's doing. No conspiracy, just a guy who didn't actually want to be president.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see plenty of shit against him that have plenty of upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus if you want anti Trump shit, go to r/politics
      </p>
      <p>
       The diehards and loyalists of our subreddit here don't want any of this shit.. whether it be pro or anti, we are so fucking sick of it. It's a shit show.

       I believe it's pro Trump because the readers (and the population) are pro-Trump.

       Trump isn't perfect, but he's our best hope at this point, as he's the only person in DC who has even a tiny ability to reveal the corruption in our Intelligence Community.

       Man, it is really pathetic that Trump is the "best hope" for some people. The dude has been a political insider for decades. He's admitted to bribing politicians. He was once good friends with Hillary and Bill, and probably still is. He's a billionaire who inherited his fortune and his empire. But somehow he's the "best hope" for exposing corruption. Yes, the squeaky clean Donald who has already appointed one of the most corrupt, regressive cabinets in history is going to save us all. Hilarious.

       Agreed.  It's because the corruption is so complete that no one of any character even gets close to power anymore.  They simply present us with two equally poor options, and we believe we are "choosing" the best.

       Fair. I mean, that principal is pretty much the last year in a nutshell.

       And going out on a limb here, but I bet you're fine with people saying "really" when they mean something other than "actually". I don't get why "literally" is the one word people get super prescriptivist over.
