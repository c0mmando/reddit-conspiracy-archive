        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I figure I be completely honest with how I&#39;m thinking whenever I&#39;m thinking. But when you actually start considering the depths to which we don&#39;t realize what we are, you start to ask questions like, &quot;Might this actually be some enormously elaborate play run by literally a higher &#39;power&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p>If Max Spiers is right: to the elite, we’re just candle sticks. He says that each of us represents the creative ‘spark’ of the universe. One way to view that is that we symbolize universal ignition. Within this dimension, our species has been overrun by other dimensionally, greedy consciousnesses who use our energy, in which contains the rare creative DNA, to fuel themselves sometimes with deals to spirits from higher dimensions (some people do believe our emotions can be a consequence of parasitic beings attacking us for survival in order to exist in a higher dimension, causing certain feelings to be felt in humans as a consequence). So, to these elite, we represent the answer to living forever. If we remain fat, simple-minded, and in blind obedience, we put out lots of energy, don’t question existence, and never step out of line. The elite would have a factory of innocent, obliging, mentally-handicapped human armies — as we sort of do now with our obesity rate and general health issues, with the technology we actually have but the pharma we’re given — who essentially become content animals with a dwindling IQ and no desire to exist any longer than simple-mindedness care endure. If they were to run out of us, however, they would be forever stuck in a candle-less world. There would be no positive energy to brightly outshine the dark headed their way. It doesn’t matter who or what you are, every ‘thing’ is a vibration and the vibration you put out also comes back to its center-point. The elite will have an equal and fair karmic response, I think.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m just thinking here. Thinking elaborately, I guess. You are all entitled to your own viewpoint; that&#39;s the beauty of open-mindedness. I also type all of this as a reminder to my own self..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, It&#39;s just greed. Sociopaths and psychopaths who are greedy.
There are a higher percentage who get to the top who are evil just because they take advantage of the innocent and the powerless and they have no morals while doing it.
There are plenty of very, very smart people who are not elite/rich so it&#39;s not a matter of it being &quot;dimensional&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s the most effective &#39;3D&#39; way of perceiving it. It&#39;s just...when you understand ego thoroughly and see that almost our entire population suffers from inverted consciousness, missing out on so much peace and beauty in the process, it starts being hard to remain in that sort of spectrum of thought. There has to be more to it. &#39;It&#39; just has to be bigger than the manifestation of the human conceptual perception of &#39;greed&#39;.</p>

<p>And when we take a look at the degree to which the  evil now surfacing has been displayed in the shadows by humans, no peaceful and pure human mind can fathom that it&#39;s simply a consequence of greed. It&#39;s literally evil manifesting in our dimension. Mythological disgustingness actually being real. It just doesn&#39;t seem human to me. The narrative seems so much more creative and dark. But all is vibratory and the + is awakening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are projecting what &quot;others&quot; are missing out on.  All of the universe exists inside each of us, meaning we do each have a &quot;spark&quot; and can use it for a multitude of purposes.  </p>

<p>I like how you say &quot;X&quot; I the most effective 3D way of perceiving because perhaps youll agree with me when I say there are different levels of making sense of things.  Im not convinced any is more truthful than the other.  We cant prove any of the possibilities (in this specific case, 3D material greed and psychopathy, or extra dimensional vampiric entities)  At least <em>I</em> wouldnt go around saying its one and <em>not</em> the other.  It could be both, or one, or none.  Actually, scratch that last one ... since we exist in the 3D we could be fairly sure in saying its either partially, or completely, psychopaths.</p>

<p>So, we are free to perceive and cognate on the beauty of the universe, eventually transforming at the end of our physical life...</p>

<p>Or to eat, sleep, fuck, and then die.  </p>

<p>The real issue here is judging others lives, which I fear immediately changes the dynamics of relationships of people who have chosen to live life in different ways.  </p>

<p>What if extra dimensions are &quot;natural&quot; (not &quot;super&quot;)</p>

<p>This seems to be using &quot;dimensions&quot; to refer to multiverse? Which is using the definition of dimensions as <em>realities</em> or <em>universes</em>.</p>

<p>whereas this </p>

<p>the 3 dimensions we readily acknowledge</p>

<p>Seems to be referring to spatial dimensions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, thanks for the clarification. </p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t believe that consciousness resides in a place we could not (in theory) measure. Of course I&#39;m not claiming to have all the answers. But I&#39;m personally a determinist. That means that I believe that everything that happens, happens for a reason- not necessarily with purpose.</p>

<p>Because I believe in a deterministic universe, I believe that free will is truly an illusion. We are predestined, fated, to do everything that we will ever do. Each experience could (in theory- probably never in practice) not only be measured, but also predicted with absolute certainty. I&#39;d leave in a little room for chance because we believe that there is a possible to variation of the laws of physics on a quantum level. </p>

<p>But that aside, if one had the access to every bit of data necessary, one could not only predict the future of the world... but the exact details of every little... piece playing out in it. Including this conversation between the two of us. </p>

<p>So what is consciousness? Currently we are trying to replicate it in a sort of &quot;artificial intelligence.&quot; And one of the hurdles we&#39;re facing is that we have been unable to create a true intelligence- one that is capable of creating without necessary cues. One that can have thoughts that exist independent of a user inputting them; like our own intelligence. So how do we replicate our own intelligence in a machine, would seem to be the question...</p>

<p>Unless the answer is actually much more simple that that. The answer is that there is no difference at all. That human minds <em>aren&#39;t</em> and never were capable of truly independent thought, void of all external data. </p>

<p>I see no reason to view the human brain as anything more than a glorified computer. Which means that- although we may not understand the exact way the process works- we already know exactly where the consciousness resides; in the brain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unfortunate but I think that it comes down to two factors. </p>

<p>The one that is more obvious is that most people don&#39;t have the fortitude to face the inherent nihilism in admitting the complete inhumanity of the universe. The ego blocks people from accepting their true place and role in the universe.</p>

<p>Admitting that the universe doesn&#39;t play by our rules, our self-invented values... is demoralizing. So people project their inner values onto everything. Can&#39;t just be that germs are amoral lifeforms that need to kill us to survive in the same way we kill animals and plants. No, it must be demons that fit nicely into our box of &quot;malicious evil.&quot; </p>

<p>It gets to me how people talk of &quot;ego death&quot; when they have no idea what that means. Thinking that &quot;ego death&quot; is... the transcendence and deification of self. Which is complete delusion.</p>

<p>The second and far more sobering factor is that most people simply lack the intellectual capacity to understand complex abstracts. Like the understanding that 100 billion humans have lived. Which means that 1 of us is nothing. People can&#39;t wrap their head around the idea that they and everyone they have ever met or known about is insignificant. So they invent ways of explaining how they <em>really are</em> important. It&#39;s like how people assumed that the solar system revolved around the earth. Nah dawg, the earth is just a tiny piece of the puzzle. Even smaller the more room you allow for the true scope of the universe. And that&#39;s without factoring in the 4th dimension of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My experiences have been that they&#39;re legit, but then my experiences are experiential and subjective. You might not be able to have the same experiences.

<p>What I&#39;ve learned from these guys is that there is some kind of war going on over us and that most of the ones on the side you don&#39;t want to be friends with are quick to try to convince you of their power and authority and godliness, but the ones you might actually want to call friends will treat you as equals and are quick to tell you that they are fallible and imperfect, no one is omniscient, and it&#39;s generally not a good idea to trust any of them that haven&#39;t proven themselves to you multiple times. There&#39;s apparently a lot of agendas out there and most them involve keeping people in the dark and fed bullshit spiritually, so the bad ones pretend to be all knowing servants of &#39;gods will&#39;. The silver legion guys say trust no spirit who doesn&#39;t treat you as an equal and who wouldn&#39;t die for you. No one is divinely placed over you. You are as much a part of the creator as they are, and the creator&#39;s will is not to obey some divine will of some god but to live according to your own free will. The silver legion guys are really quick to reinforce that the local spirit world is fucking dangerous and that almost everyone you encounter locally has a vested interest in tricking you, because they gain from your spiritual enslavement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I believe this universe was set up to be challenging and difficult. It isn&#39;t coincidence that to survive you must consume something else. A universal truth in my opinion. Why not just make us biologically capable of producing our own energy and nourishment? It kind of goes with my perspective that if a divine ultimate being wished to understand what he is. He would then split himself into many forms of existence. With a balance that needs to be struck between what we perceive as good and bad. </p>

<p>How do we justify our own existence that is based upon taking from something else. Why create this type of existence? Is free-will only capable in a setting where everything is permitted? Is this some kind of ultimate test whether we are worthy of our right  to exist? Or does that right already exist and we are forced to fight for it? It always feels like we are being led or forced to behave a certain way even though we have free will. If humanity could truly become a sort of united hive mind if you will I imagine the possibilities are endless. Shedding the chains of ego is a monumental task for humanity in my opinion and would take some serious effort from us to even begin. But not impossible and not that crazy to imagine. But those with the power to change have misused them. I believe they were corrupted by supernatural parasites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eating is also a pleasant and pleasurable experience in and of itself, it isn&#39;t simply &quot;all about survival&quot;. If it was all about survival and everything had to worry about that all of the time the stress of it would have made any form of existence completely unbearable and simply not worth the effort. Life isn&#39;t simply about survival but about attaining a satisfying quality of existence well beyond that, because it&#39;s healthy and pleasurable.</p>

<p>Nature only provides enough stress from that direction to encourage a healthy range of action and activities towards a qualitatively better experience.</p>

<p>We learn to take care of and foster the things that are good to eat and learn as much as we can about them. We also foster and take care of beautiful flowers for no other reason than that they are beautiful to look at or the scent of them has an uplifting and pleasant effect on us. The beauty we find in nature also encourages us to make beautiful and aesthetically pleasing as well as functional things to enhance our own existence.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we were ever expected to be worthy of this curious highly unusual little experience that we&#39;re all presently having. I do, however, believe, that we are expected to make a modest effort to try and be worthy of it while we&#39;re about it. </p>

<p>We of course have to reach a certain level of intellectual and spiritual development to be able to reach and appreciate that conclusion.</p>

<p>Life for human beings is primarily a learning experience from start to finish. We are obliged &quot;to think&quot; and learn to both survive and to make that existence as pleasant and comfortable and conducive to even more learning as we can and we&#39;ve been provided with an almost unlimited number of resources as well as opportunities to do just that if we approach it wisely and with some humility about our actual limitations. </p>

<p>Nature never gives any particular advantage to any living creature that she doesn&#39;t also take something away in order to encourage it&#39;s proper development and  use. In our case that meant a very different and far weaker slate of sensory and physical equipment that obliged us to think, plan, and better understand the world around us if we were going to successfully live in it.</p>

<p>Eating is also a pleasant and pleasurable experience in and of itself, it isn&#39;t simply &quot;all about survival&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually it is. The reason that eating is pleasant is to <em>encourage</em> us to eat. Same reason starving is unpleasant. Eating is necessary to keep us alive. If we never had any indicators that told us that eating was good and starving was bad, then it&#39;s very unlikely we would have lasted long as a species. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life isn&#39;t simply about survival but about attaining a satisfying quality of existence well beyond that, because it&#39;s healthy and pleasurable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that we strive for a quality of existence beyond because it&#39;s healthy and pleasurable. But the root cause of it being healthy is that it keeps us alive. That&#39;s all the reason it&#39;s pleasurable.</p>

<p>As a species, we don&#39;t have the ability to weather nature like a cockroach does. For our species to beat out bears and lions and tigers (oh my) we had to build secure shelters. To encourage us to build secure shelters, we had to have some sort of ambition. Cockroaches don&#39;t need to have any ambition to survive; humans do.</p>

<p>Once humans are safe and secure, the genetic traits that allowed the most ambition of our ancestors to survive didn&#39;t simply vanish. They remained. Hence we are still ambitious. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not how nature works, sorry. See vestigial organs for an example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can take out all the stuff about aliens, dimensions, and spirit energy and still claim this to be true- the history of how and why our school systems work the way they do revel this.<br/>
We receive schooling that is broken education at best. Instead of critical thinking, we&#39;re conditioned to react to authority. Instead of understanding history- western history specifically, we are not taught to think in context or that things are related, but the opposite - that history is this mishmash of unrelated facts that&#39;s irrelevant to today. Instead of knowledge of how government, religion, major institutions, and self care functions, we are given this blurry road map that teaches useless abstractions about equality.<br/>
We are taught like this by the government for twelve years in order for the vast majority of people to, as president Wilson said in an 1909 speech, &quot;&quot;We want one class of persons to have a liberal education and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class of necessity, to forgo the privileges of a liberal (classical) education.&quot;<br/>
In other words, they designed this system to make sure we were all happy workers in factories, happy with our menial lot in life and posing no threat to their base of power.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not OP but if you want another persons opinion I&#39;ll gladly share my limited knowledge. I listened to this cameron day&#39;s interview about why he is no longer a light worker. He alludes to the general consensus that there are beings who are out there to drain our life force.(If you believe this which I do.) However I am weary of anyone saying to avoid the light but he makes a good argument.</p>

<p>His main idea that I think is very important is to trust yourself <strong>above all</strong>. To connect with yourself and then to connect with the earths core. But most importantly that these beings want us to believe a higher power or enlightenment is something outside of us that we are unable to feel or experience without guidance. Trust your instincts because beings that want to abuse us want you to worship them. As stated in an earlier comment, friendly beings will not want to be worshipped or offer promises of divine knowledge and then disappoint you when nothing happens. That is what they want so they have more &quot;food for thought&quot;.</p>

<p>It kind of goes along with what I believe that the spirit world is a seperate place we are able to visit.. But I believe to go further than that to connect to ourself as a whole, you must look within yourself. Could the astral realm be a hotbed of ill intention towards humans? Perhaps but I believe it is just an area they have infested and to put it simply co-opted our main communication channel with possible friendly entities. The idea of &quot;archons&quot; tricking folks into entering a new cycle of reincarnation that is seperate from the creators will is plausible in my opinion.  And seems to kind of align with the strategies of what we deem evil in our world. (Example CIA). To co-opt a noble intention and morph into their own will. </p>

<p>We were given free will to use it, and surrendering yourself to a higher power has always sounded off to me. Even as a youngin 11 years old I believed in god but couldn&#39;t care less for religion as it is. Although I believe many are legitimate, I also believe their true core beliefs have been changed over history and translations. I also had this unshakable belief that reincarnation was very real. If our reincarnation cycle is false and we are being reincarnated just to experience pain and hardship is a valid observation. They could very well have trapped us in an imperfect clone of our previous dimension (Mandela effect anyone?) But one could also argue that pain and hardship lead to soul enrichment and a more mature outlook on life than someone who always had it easy. </p>

<p>Anyway just my opinion my friend who is also me. We are all on a journey to learn what we are at the core of it all.</p>

<p>Look into Gnosticism.     </p>

<p>Also the fact that some consider the likelihood that this isn&#39;t some kind of simulation very low.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading the Gnosticism wiki description rings heavily with me. As a kid, I grew up sort of subconsciously having no interest in any of the religions. An aspect of me saw through it all. Now that I&#39;ve experienced a consciousness shift, this newfound open mindedness is letting me read without bias for the first time. So.. I&#39;m just now reading about Gnosticism. Lol. Crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listened to Steven King&#39;s Tommyknockers and Revival over the past 2 years and there was something at the time that really disturbed me about both stories.  Now, reading other people&#39;s theories on interdimensional parasites that have been cropping up more recently has helped me understand why both seemed to hit a nerve.  The way the gradual cognitive takeover of the aliens in Tommyknockers occurred seems similar to the splits in political perception and experience which have occurred since the election.  Revival&#39;s dark ending shook me a lot more than I expected and I don&#39;t want to give it away but it had echoes of truth I felt really uncomfortable with at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One hundred percent correct. All it takes is enough willpower to overcome our own personal demons (they&#39;re everywhere). You can&#39;t <em>do it</em> for anyone else though. It&#39;s a one at a time kind of thing. </p>

<p>We&#39;re inching toward a judgement when all secrets are revealed to all. We all become psychic. I can think of no more beautiful or frightening experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have any real answers for you. </p>

<p>Space and time are no different. Everything that has happened, is &quot;happening&quot;, or will happen has already happened. </p>

<p>For me, after 4-5 years of meditation and study I would consider myself borderline psychic; I can feel others&#39; thoughts and emotions vividly. Maybe I&#39;m just clairvoyant. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an individual process; the spiritual journey into psychic abilities and &quot;enlightenment&quot;</p>

<p>We all have these abilities. </p>

<p>As far as the &quot;event&quot; I&#39;m talking about. </p>

<p>The apocalypse or &quot;revealing what&#39;s hidden&quot;</p>

<p>It could happen tomorrow, any day, and I would suggest you live your life that way. However these cyclical changes in consciousness take generations. Maybe I&#39;m getting ahead of myself when I say it WILL happen in my lifetime. </p>

<p>But if I have enough will, and you have enough will, who&#39;s to say it <em>can&#39;t happen</em>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The older I get, the more I experience and see, I too am starting to realize these things might be a possibility. And it still blows my mind.</p>

<p>I have actually had emotions/feelings passed to me from something not on this plain. And that truly blew my mind. I never thought this type thing was possible or real until that moment. I have had I guess what you would call a &quot;psychic&quot; person tell me about that experience with zero information from me about it. I had not spoken to another soul about it. The psychic person was spot on, and I did not even confirm to them they were right or that I knew what they were talking about. It sounds crazy to even write out, and I don&#39;t feel like looking nuts today, lol. </p>

<p>There are some wild things in the universe which science has not fully caught up yet to explain. That&#39;s what I do know.   </p>

<p>Other crazy experiences I have had:
-being a part of a group of people who witnessed a swishy black shadowy thing leap onto the hood of a car and then up into some trees disappearing. This was after we witnessed it swishing around a woman who had started screaming because she felt like she had walked into  a thick entanglement of &quot;spiderwebs&quot;, of which there were none. From my research into other people&#39;s experiences, the feeling of spiderwebs when these things touch you is common? Again, it&#39;s all crazy.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have seen a swishy shadowy thing 2 other times, head on, not out of the corner of my eye or anything. It&#39;s highly alarming each time. I don&#39;t have a vision condition nor any mental illness. </p></li>
<li><p>the weirdest thing by far is seeing a swishy shadow person and being jumped on by the thing. I was wide awake but had the lights off as I had just laid down to go to sleep. Like, just laid down, just turned off the lights. Less than a min laying there (and it takes me about an hour and a half to fall asleep each night. I am a night owl). And this weird thing leaped on me, arms up, and it had a darker grin on it&#39;s already dark smoky shadowy head. In my mind, I started to laugh thinking to myself &quot;you have got to be kidding me! seriously, universe?&quot; (We are talking milliseconds in timeline here) I shut my eyes right and tried to roll out of the way, but failed to. The second it landed on me, it legitimately felt like I was being drained of all energy. I even said &quot;oh shit, I&#39;m going down... stay awake...&quot; then passed out. I woke up feeling like I had been hit by a bus. It was by far the most shocking and bizarre experience of my life. I never believed in &quot;shadow people&quot; or knew anything about them until I started researching this experience after it happened. It was then that I found alarming similarities to other people&#39;s experiences shared. It was not sleep paralysis because I was wide awake and could move up until I passed out. I think there might be something to these things out there.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, these experiences I never share with anyone because I know exactly how crazy they sound to people who have not experienced them. I used to think these things were crazy and not believable as well. We live in a wild universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>God fucking damn, late to this post but I am on board with your thoughts.  I&#39;ve recently felt like I&#39;ve dealt with what you said about 
 &quot;Within this dimension, our species has been overrun by other dimensionally, greedy consciousnesses who use our energy&quot; when I took some magic mushrooms.  It was the most intense, real, trip I have ever had.  So much fucking so, I took a look at the night sky off of this sickly, gut-wrenching feeling I had in the pit of my stomach, to see the most vivid, real fuckin depiction of a saucer. 5 headlights, all about a foot in diameter, O O O O O , hover over and behind me in silence.  I quickly noped the fuck outta that thought and proceeded to try and find my friends (we were in downtown).  During which, I could FEEL their attempts to get in my way by sending in temptation like hot bitches (no disrespect), police force, and other shit.  It was and feels like this episode of Rick and Morty.  <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4bzdoo">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4bzdoo</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the late reply brother. That is intense and reminds me of some things I&#39;ve had. Usually mine manifests while driving, like people are trying to cause wrecks around me or people from my life calling me all at once when I&#39;m on an interesting train of thought... my current theory is that our thoughts and feelings determine what reality we jump to. If you are overcome with paranoia or certain suspicions, perhaps we hop timelines into that reality while still under the effects on the particular drug. I notice this can be a positive thing as well, if you have a positive mindset and work towards a good goal? Certainly trippy and mind-fucky to say the least. The biggest reason it is unsettling to me is that it implies  that we are in a matrix system or that our reality is what we make it, giving us some form of &quot;paranormal&quot; power. Idk man, what do you think. Also, wish I could hang out with people like you in real life lmao, but nobody talks about these things in texas appearantly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My experiences have been that they&#39;re legit, but then my experiences are experiential and subjective. You might not be able to have the same experiences. It requires being able to experience a world that everyone else tells you doesn&#39;t exist because it can&#39;t be measured and uses senses and abilities that science doesn&#39;t acknowledge. </p>

<p>What I&#39;ve learned from these guys is that there is some kind of war going on over us and that most of the ones on the side you don&#39;t want to be friends with are quick to try to convince you of their power and authority and godliness, but the ones you might actually want to call friends will treat you as equals and are quick to tell you that they are fallible and imperfect, no one is omniscient, and it&#39;s generally not a good idea to trust any of them that haven&#39;t proven themselves to you multiple times. There&#39;s apparently a lot of agendas out there and most them involve keeping people in the dark and fed bullshit spiritually, so the bad ones pretend to be all knowing servants of &#39;gods will&#39;. The silver legion guys say trust no spirit who doesn&#39;t treat you as an equal and who wouldn&#39;t die for you. No one is divinely placed over you. You are as much a part of the creator as they are, and the creator&#39;s will is not to obey some divine will of some god but to live according to your own free will. The silver legion guys are really quick to reinforce that the local spirit world is fucking dangerous and that almost everyone you encounter locally has a vested interest in tricking you, because they gain from your spiritual enslavement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unfortunate but I think that it comes down to two factors. </p>

<p>The one that is more obvious is that most people don&#39;t have the fortitude to face the inherent nihilism in admitting the complete inhumanity of the universe. The ego blocks people from accepting their true place and role in the universe.</p>

<p>Admitting that the universe doesn&#39;t play by our rules, our self-invented values... is demoralizing. So people project their inner values onto everything. Can&#39;t just be that germs are amoral lifeforms that need to kill us to survive in the same way we kill animals and plants. No, it must be demons that fit nicely into our box of &quot;malicious evil.&quot; </p>

<p>It gets to me how people talk of &quot;ego death&quot; when they have no idea what that means. Thinking that &quot;ego death&quot; is... the transcendence and deification of self. Which is complete delusion.</p>

<p>The second and far more sobering factor is that most people simply lack the intellectual capacity to understand complex abstracts. Like the understanding that 100 billion humans have lived. Which means that 1 of us is nothing. People can&#39;t wrap their head around the idea that they and everyone they have ever met or known about is insignificant. So they invent ways of explaining how they <em>really are</em> important. It&#39;s like how people assumed that the solar system revolved around the earth. Nah dawg, the earth is just a tiny piece of the puzzle. Even smaller the more room you allow for the true scope of the universe. And that&#39;s without factoring in the 4th dimension of time.</p>
