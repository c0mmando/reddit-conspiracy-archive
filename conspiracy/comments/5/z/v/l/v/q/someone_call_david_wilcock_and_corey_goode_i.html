       I have had these photos for two years, since March of 2015. I took them on the first warm day that year, testing out my new telescope and camera setup.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw something on the moon, and watched it for hours, testing with various lenses and zoom.
      </p>
      <p>
       I showed the photos to friends and family, casually.
      </p>
      <p>
       All with the same reaction of "What is that?".
      </p>
      <p>
       It made me nervous having the photos, but I finally decided to post them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the video of the photos I made this evening.

       A base was my guess, especially around the 7:20min mark and onwards. I watched for hours, but no ships were like... Coming out of it.

       If it's a base, you should be able to reproduce the images on different days, preferably involving different people, different telescopes and observing from different locations. That would rule out bias, dirt in your scope, objects between your scope and the moon, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, is it feasible to make time lapse videos for long stretches of time?

       Yeah I was not implying anything about your setup. The point is to improve the quality of the story by rebutting prosaic explanations and addressing / pre-empting dismissive arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps someone else here with acces to suitable hardware could coordinate with you to make the observations from different geographical locations?

       Time lapse video would be pretty hard, unless your telescope was able to self track that spot. Otherwise, you'd have to be constantly re-positioning your scope as the moon moves pretty quickly at that magnification.

       My telescope doesn't self track, it's manual adjustment, because I like the constant tweaking and focusing... It's part of the fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the moon does move fast at that zoom. It was over the course of a few hours when I saw this thing, and I was exhausted afterwards lol, from the  adrenaline and small movements.

       Ah okay so if it is stationary, which I could not necessarily tell due to the images just being flipped I guess? With the lights being in the dark side it is extremely interesting.

       Yeah, the lights are on the edge. The top right of the moon, from the first and last shot. (When it was still blue sky) as it got darker they became more apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The zoomed in shots are of that top right quadrant. The lights / structure are off the surface, quite high when you think about the scale / size.

       When you look at the variables involved with SSP's the world governments and corporate entities work together at many different levels. They all eventually got the carrot of space technology given to them and stayed  quiet out of necessity for opsec in their mind.

       I'm more skeptical of the fact that thousands of people would have to have knowledge of this and not say anything. Control rooms, rocket scientists, actual astronauts, engineers, etc. No way we could keep a base on a moon secret. Too many people would have to know while keeping tight lips.

       Probably just a crater with lighting reflecting off of the 'dirt' or whatever is on the surface. I have no idea the reflective properties of lunar dirt, nor do I think anyone here does. If the moon can appear white at night, what makes bright white spots on what appears to be a canyon or crater out of the ordinary? Just pause it at 4:22 and tell me how out of the ordinary from it's surroundings look.

       Sorry OP, but I don't think this is anything of substance. Keep looking.

       Its ok man. The train of thought you are on, I have had as well.
I would look at the photos on and off for two years.
Show them to people when I could, without mentioning the object, and let them see for themselves, and see what they thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone had curiousity. And we all rationlized.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was done rationalizing over them, and shared them with the internet, to see what the hive mind thought!

       Very interesting.  Ever try and line it up with a map of the moon and get an estimate on the size of the object, or at least the distance of the lights?

       I did try a few times looking at some moon maps, but could never definitively pin point the exact are that they are in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never tried figuring out how big it/they were, l but something like that being seen from where I was, and the apparent height off the surface beyond the shadow terminating line, makes me think it's quite large. O.o

       Two mountain peaks seems the logical conclusion - only visible when the moon is in a specific position relative to the Earth/Sun, and when these mountain bases at just over the horizon, but the peaks are still being illuminated by the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       If some civilization has the technology to build a very large base on the Moon, it seems unlikely they would make the mistake of building it to be visible from Earth.

       Great deduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pondered over it for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I concluded that initially.

      <p>
       And then yesterday, March 16, a David Wilcock's / Corey Goode talk appeared in my YouTube feed and I clicked, against every fibre in my being.

      <p>
       They showed some crazy moon pictures... And talked about bases.

       I remembered my photos and was done trying to rationalize them.

       Are we sure that's not just peaks being hit by the sun while the surrounding area is cast in shadow? It is right on the edge of the sun line, and the spots to the right of it look very similar to the spot in question (as seen at around the 8 minute mark).
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I'm in no way suggesting this isn't significant, just trying to rule out all other logic possibilities before deeming it a lunar base (though I wouldn't doubt it in the slightest).

       I thought that too at first, and is why I kept trying to get the brightness on my camera to adjust.

       My brain was trying to justify what it was seeing.

       It could be. But revisiting them over and over, just to have a peek... Its why I shared them.

       Both Corey Goode and David Wilcock have their own websites (I remember that David's blog is on divine cosmos.com).   They have some great episodes together on Gaia TV with much bigger redpills than this.  But who would be most interested in your pics and video is a YouTube channel called Secureteam10, who discusses and "investigates" these kind of lunar moon pics for many years.  They have an email to contact on their channel description.
       <br/>
       Great job on the video &amp; pics! I've seen so many videos showing things that look like bases and craft exiting the moon that I'm a believer.
