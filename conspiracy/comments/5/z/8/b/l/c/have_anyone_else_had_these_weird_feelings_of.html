        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I need some theory for this before I call myself crazy. All ideas welcome.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean like deja vu. More vivid, more alive. I&#39;ve had this for months now. I meet a new person and I know that I&#39;ve met them before at some point even if we just introduced each other. When I go to a store to buy something I know I&#39;ve done this before, like, I can predict what kind of a person is going to be my cashier.</p>

<p>Weirdest part was this weekend. I met a woman online weeks ago. We synched very well so she invited me to visit her house. She lives 200km from where I do in a town I&#39;ve never visited before. I never saw any pictures of her house or anything. On my way there I had this feeling what her house would look like. Large open livingroom with a grey sofa near the wall, rounded carpet in the middle of the room without a coffee table. A white wall dividing the livingroom and kitchen. A white, 6 person table table in the kitchen. I also pictured it to be two story house even that she didn&#39;t mention it. When I walked in it was exactly like that. I mean EXACTLY like that. I even knew where was the bathroom, without asking her.</p>

<p>What the hell is this? Is anyone else having these sensations of living throug something that has already happened?</p>
