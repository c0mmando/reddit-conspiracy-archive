        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>The pace is quickening..can you feel it?</p>

<p>Thought i&#39;d get a post in before March 15th as all hell could break loose in regards to the U.S. debt ceiling.</p>

<p>Please check my older threads for information from end of November 2016 onward.. I have run out of characters because there is just so much shit going on.</p>

<p>I will continue to post until I feel there is a change of &quot;pace,&quot; and everything slows down... but I don&#39;t feel like that&#39;s going to happen anytime soon. I don&#39;t feel that I am the only one who has suddenly become &quot;awake,&quot; at something not being quite right at the moment in the world, whether it being a local change I can see or a global change as detailed below.</p>

<p>Apologies if you have read most of this already.. but just check on the recent updates at the bottom to see that whatever is going on is a global phenomenon and not something to turn your nose up at... and it&#39;s not stopping.</p>

<p>First.. read this - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events</a></p>

<p>Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;</p>

<p>&quot;But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a surprise to us,&quot; said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw</a></p>

<p>Information on the &quot;Earth Wobble,&quot;.. or pole shift etc. Whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html">http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html</a></p>

<p>We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. The Earth Wobbling is natural my only correlation in this is that where the graph gets more extreme is where I feel the world has started to respond at a similar pace.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? I don&#39;t know. So many different things at once, so many theories and facts to digest and dispute.. so much fake information, shit sources!</p>

<p>For Earth Changes (weather,seismic,volcanic) I started posting around November.. because November is when I started to become &quot;awake,&quot; that there is something not quite right with our planet at the moment and it is behaving abnormally.</p>

<p>Why do I say this? Most articles state that scientists are &quot;perplexed,&quot; or &quot;puzzled,&quot; at things that are happening.</p>

<p>FYI - All information is from watchers.news, an invaluable resource which is unopinionated and deals in facts. They reference various local institutions.. obviously depending on what the earth change is.</p>

<p>(I have cut content from older posts, please see those for additional information)</p>

<p>OKAY...</p>

<p>STILL WITH ME?</p>

<p>Going to pre-face December with some quick facts about Earthquakes.. because most of you will be saying &quot;volcanoes and earthquakes happen all the time.&quot; and you&#39;d be RIGHT! they do..</p>

<p>but; There have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a 6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days. (Stats from End of Dec.)</p>

<p>This is also referencing a cosmic energy wave, which is also being attributed (mostly on youtube unfortunately.. but nothing [mainstream] is talking about this) a helium gas cloud which we have entered bringing in higher H3,H4 into our atmosphere.
does anybody know what a brown dwarf star is made of????? (HELIUM)</p>
