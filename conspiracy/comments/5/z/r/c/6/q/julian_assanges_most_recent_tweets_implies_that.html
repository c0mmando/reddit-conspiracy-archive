       Assange made two tweets earlier this morning that I've been contemplating and I believe I understand what he is trying to say. His
       <a href="https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/842357759333019648">
        first tweet
       </a>
       links to
       <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/revived-cia-drone-strike-program-comments-new-policy">
        an article
       </a>
       that discusses how President Trump “has given the Central Intelligence Agency secret new authority to conduct drone strikes against suspected terrorists, … changing the Obama administration’s policy of limiting the spy agency’s paramilitary role and reopening a turf war between the agency and the Pentagon.”
      </p>
      <p>
       His
       <a href="https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/842361194786770944">
        second tweet
       </a>
       points out that the CIA has lost complete control of their cyber weapons and the also links to
       <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/mar/14/albert-einstein-described-cia-psychics/">
        this article
       </a>
       which discusses a pretty accurate CIA-sponsored psychic reading of Albert Einstein. He ends the tweet with "What could possibly go wrong?"
      </p>
      <p>
       If you haven't yet caught yourself up on the fact that the CIA, alongside the Stanford Research Institute, performed psychic experiments via experimentation with
       <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/search/site/telepathy">
        telepathy
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/search/site/remote%20viewing">
        remote viewing
       </a>
       , and quite a few other things, then you should spend some time looking through those documents. In fact, the CIA was so convinced that this was real that they called it a threat to national security since they were concerned Russian spies would have the ability to remote view their own documents in file cabinets (something Ingo Swann claimed to have the ability to do).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have speculated that the Vault 7 leaks will have more information on these "out there" subjects that the CIA clearly had a hand in. I believe Julian is implying that the CIA has and may continue to use psychic readings as the basis for the target of drone strikes, now without the use of hacking tools to verify those targets. Regardless, these tweets are very curious and it's good to see Assange finally mention the ESP experiments the CIA performed since 99% of the country had never heard of this until they digitized the documents a few months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: For anyone curious, here is Russell Targ's
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBl0cwyn5GY">
        banned TedX talk
       </a>

       A fair point. I guess to most people it wasn't "confirmed" until we could read the documents ourselves... But 99% is probably overstating it.

       I don't disagree with you, but I think it's worth noting that they had a LOT of successful experiments that really made me re-think the ESP subject. It seems, to me, that the CIA discovered that consciousness is a nonlocal phenomena and then decided to not disclose what they had learned for a reason.

       The YouTube video in the comment you replied to is a good start. Targ was one of the scientists that worked on the project. Also one of the links in the main post is literally just a search of "remote viewing" in the CIA reading room site. You can see their reports on the experiments.

       I've read a number of the papers, and all I really saw was a department of a government agency furthering its own budget. There was no data collection or verification. Only "reports" that it "worked."

       I don't have an agenda. I watched the film..it didn't prove anything to me except, "old man wants attention and tells stories with little proof." There are fundamental mistakes throughout, starting at the very beginning. He's a laser physicist, then starts speaking about quantum physics and immediately gets it wrong. Quantum entanglement only happens over very, very short distances. Modern science isn't just now catching up, as he claims, he's misinterpreting the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you want, nothing he talked about was proof of anything besides a group trying to justify it's own budget with lucky guesses, and moments of "ehh, close enough."
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what I want to hear about? Not the handful of times they were miraculously right. I want to hear about all the times they were
       <em>
        wrong.
       </em>
       Which, suspiciously, he leaves out. You're telling me they were right, 100% of the time?

       You know what I want to see? I want to see records of where this was performed, facility, room number, people involved, the materials involved in the construction of that building.

       On a board full of doubters, you believe without question circumstantial evidence because it's what you want to hear.

       Nope, circumstantial evidence has nothing to do with it, but that doesn't matter to you anyway because you don't care what i have to say or what brought me to the conclusions I believe in. Instead you slap a label on me and brush a fellow human off.

       Look up project Stargate. Though heavily redacted, much of it has been declassified for decades. I remember my room mate and I researching and watching documentaries on this in college in the mid nineties, so this has been declassified fact for a ling time, at least that such programs exist(ed).

       It seems he was simply referring to CIA's Project Stargate to discredit the CIA's judgement, implying their return to the historically normal control of such terrorism abroad, was a bad idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, Obama only took to personally murdering people abroad because the CIA made several highly criticized botches. He relied on the CIA's constantly wrong or misleading intelligence (remember Iraq's fake fault for 9/11) for his continued psychopathic murderous tirade of mostly innocent people abroad, while openly using double-tap war crimes to kill first responders and medical personnel.

        the CIA was so convinced that this was real that they called it a threat to national security since they were concerned Russian spies would have the ability to remote view their own documents in file cabinets

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I heard something a bit different but similar: The CIA wanted funding to study remove viewing (RV), so they said that RV
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be a threat to national security because of the Red Scare and all of that. However, RV is very difficult and error prone. I read through some of the CIA manual for RV that's publicly available--the material is really dense and it looks like at the very least it takes lots of practice, focus and dedication to even sometimes get semi accurate results using the technique.

       I don't disagree with you, but I think it's worth noting that they had a LOT of successful experiments that really made me re-think the ESP subject. It seems, to me, that the CIA discovered that consciousness is a nonlocal phenomena and then decided to not disclose what they had learned for a reason.
