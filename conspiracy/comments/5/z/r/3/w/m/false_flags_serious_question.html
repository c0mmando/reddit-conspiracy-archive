        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I love conspiracies and false flags are amongst my favorites.  I 100% believe false flags are real and I love watching detailed videos covering the false flag. The dudes who make these quality videos have beautiful minds and make fantastic cases for their claim of an event being a false flag. I do have one question that is never addressed but one that without answers makes me very critical of such false flag claims.</p>

<p>The actors that are used must have friends and family somewhere right? False flags need numerous crisis actors which means there has to be 100s of family and friends not involved in each false flag that must remain silent after the false flag.   </p>

<p>The friends and family of crisis actors must see their friend or family on TV after a false flag right?  </p>

<p>What is the explanation for no friends and family members ever stepping up and saying that was BS.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t wrap the logical portion of my brain around the fact that no friends, family, old high school pals, old Co workers etc ever come forward and say I know that person and the official story is BS.</p>

<p>Someone please help me understand how you rationalize this fact or give your thoughts on why this never occurs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually hear about Sandy Hook as being a false flag - I mean <strong>20</strong> kids were killed.  Do people seriously believe 20 families are faking?  And how long would this have to be planned ahead?  I mean, it isn&#39;t as though there were 20 new kids in school that day, all to pretend to die?  And every single teacher at the school was also in on it?  It makes zero sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get your skepticism, but one of the biggest reasons 9/11 &amp; other false flag attacks are so successful is due to manipulation of facts. First responders on 9/11 Pentagon attack reported that there was zero evidence of a plane hitting the building. MSM just kept claiming a plane hit the Pentagon until everyone believed the official narrative. Same could be true with Sandy Hook. What evidence is available to even suggest these kids existed in the first place? I heard stories of the families of the slain kids at Sandy Hook avoided socializing with anyone &amp; after the attack happened most just packed up &amp; disappeared. Facts are manipulated all the time to benefit agendas, I don&#39;t see how this is any different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ people. I think people need to look up what a crisis actor is. It isn&#39;t every single person to witness a false flag attack anywhere in the world. Crisis actors weren&#39;t needed for 9/11. You&#39;re asking the wrong questions. &quot;The whole school decided to lie?&quot; No, the whole school WAS a lie. Try tracking down the families of these children, you will have a very hard time. Sandy Hook is in a very small community, it&#39;s not a big city. It would be pretty damn easy to create a school out of nowhere in a remote area &amp; fill it with crisis actors. I thought it was bullshit too, until I started looking into it &amp; found way to many details that made no sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So.... a plane hits the twin towers - wreckage everywhere for blocks. A plan hits the Pentagon - instantly vaporized on impact? I was 11 years only when I witnessed 9/11 on TV. Even back then, I felt as if something was incredibly off about the whole situation... If you think you need to be a expert to correctly tell if a plane hit a fucking building then you are a incredibly naive.  So, I should be like you and let the &quot;experts&quot; spoon feed me what to believe? Your &quot;experts&quot; have absolutely nothing to gain &amp; everything to lose by telling the truth. Anyone who understand the fundamentals of physics &amp; critical thinking saw right through the official narrative that day. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m defending a 9/11 conspiracy theory in a fucking conspiracy subreddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do personal relationships have to do with being a crisis actor? If you were a crisis actor, I doubt you&#39;d tell your friends &amp; family that you get paid for pushing the narrative of a false flag attack. You would probably work for the CIA (officially or unofficially), meaning you wouldn&#39;t be allowed to disclose information about your job. I doubt they would dare use the same crisis actor out of fear of someone connecting the dots. The false flag attack happens, CIA field agents (crisis actors) appear and push the desired narrative &amp; then they disappear to work on another project. If one of their friends or family spots them on TV, you could simply claim you were checking out a lead &amp; were in the wrong place at the wrong time. Not that complicated if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...wha? Why would you have a living person play a dead body? I don&#39;t think you understand what a crisis actor is. You can&#39;t amplify or set a narrative if you&#39;re laying on the ground pretending to be a dead body.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why would you have a living person play a dead body?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They wouldn&#39;t be playing a dead body - they&#39;d be &quot;playing&quot; the person who was supposedly killed. You know the guy in all the photos of &quot;Joe&quot; that was killed in the Pulse nightclub. Or the kid that was killed in Sandy Hook Elementary.</p>

<p>We see the names and faces of the dead victims, and they have to be real people (even if misnamed). So why do their friends and family not come forward and say &quot;hey that&#39;s my son Joe, and he&#39;s not dead!&quot;</p>

<p>But for the sake of argument, how about this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey mom... You know how you saw me on TV talking about how my son died in that school shooting.. no mom I don&#39;t have a kid I&#39;ve been keeping secret... no, you see, it was all a big misunderstanding. I was in the area when this reporter stuck a microphone in my face, and I panicked. They kept asking me about my dead kid, and well, I didn&#39;t want to disappoint them...</p>

<p>Anyway... if anyone asks, you loved your grandson Joe and will miss him dearly... OK?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The simple fact is, unless you are suggesting an entire community of &quot;crisis actors&quot; was employed to carry out a &quot;false flag&quot; in cases like Sandy Hook, you have no answer for why no one has come forward to expose these &quot;crisis actors&quot;.</p>

<p>Those people on TV have friends and family. They have acquaintances. You would know if your childless neighbour suddenly showed up on TV pretending to have lost a child, right? So why do these people never come out and expose the &quot;actors&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally someone that asks the right questions. This is how I believe false flag attacks unfold:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CIA finds a known terrorist or someone they want to pin a crime on. (example: Osama Bin Laden was a known CIA asset. He either defected or became a liability. Boom, you&#39;ve got your 9/11 terrorist mastermind).
Undercover CIA field agents act as the terrorist&#39;s ally (usually someone who has been undercover for a very long time, so the terrorist would never assume they aren&#39;t who they say they are.) &gt;They then train &amp; arm the terrorist, &amp; establish a plan for the false flag attack. (the terrorist(s) think the CIA agent is on their side &amp; helping them commit the terror attack.)
CIA helps terrorist initiate the false flag attack.
False flag attack happens, FBI come in &amp; clean up the mess / potentially stop the terrorist, &amp; beats their chest that they stopped the mad man. The field agents that helped or trained the terrorist disappear.
Crisis actors come in (if needed) and drive the narrative in the direction they want the masses to believe. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re going to do a false flag attack, it has to be real, because you&#39;re committing it out in the open. Crisis actors don&#39;t partake in the actual false flag attack. The Pulse night club shooter DID kill those people, so those were actually innocent people killed. How doesn&#39;t anyone recognize the crisis actors? Well, if you were the CIA would you hire someone with tons of family &amp; friends? Someone well known in their community? Hell no, you&#39;d use a field agent that orphan as a child. They were then recruited by the CIA at a very young age (usually 18), &amp; have been in the CIA ever since. Their friends? Maybe they don&#39;t have any? Most field agent&#39;s lives revolve around the CIA. They don&#39;t have time for &quot;normal&quot; lives. Watch the TV show, &quot;Homeland.&quot; One of the main characters is a hitman for the CIA &amp; he&#39;s in his 30&#39;s. He&#39;s been in the CIA his whole life &amp; literally doesn&#39;t know a single person outside of the intelligence community. This really isn&#39;t all that crazy to assume. How do secret agents keep their identities a secret? Same situation. </p>

<p>So real people were killed, and presumably injured, but the &quot;they&quot; sent in crisis actors to pretend to be <em>more</em> victims.... because... um why bother if there are real victims?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re suggesting the perpetrator was actually a CIA mind controlled suicide attacker, then you might have a point... but that&#39;s not what the &quot;crisis actors&quot; are supposed to be. They are supposed to be acting as victims, not the perpetrator... and seem utterly pointless if &quot;they&quot; are going to send ina  real person with a real gun to kill real people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It can be done &amp; it wouldn&#39;t be very hard to accomplish. If the Sandy Hooks school consisted entirely of crisis actors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what you&#39;re saying is the CIA built a school, filled it entirely with &quot;crisis actors&quot; waited a few years so no one would question how an entire school suddenly appeared in their town, <em>then</em> sent in a real shooter to kill a bunch of kids... and no one was any the wiser?</p>

<p>But you caught them by watching video of the crisis actors talking about their phony kids?</p>

<p>Seriously... I don&#39;t get it. Are the victims real? If not, why has no one ever come forward to expose them. If they are, why hire &quot;crisis actors&quot; at all? They just become potential sources of leaks.</p>

<p>None of this shit makes any sense.</p>

<p>Because they&#39;re dead. How are you going to drive the narrative in a certain direction if there&#39;s just a bunch of dead bodies &amp; no story to tell? You get crisis actors to say things like, &quot;It was horrible! None of this would&#39;ve happened if we had stricter gun laws!&quot; It stirs public emotion &amp; drives the people agree. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re suggesting the perpetrator was actually a CIA mind controlled suicide attacker, then you might have a point... but that&#39;s not what the &quot;crisis actors&quot; are supposed to be. They are supposed to be acting as victims, not the perpetrator... and seem utterly pointless if &quot;they&quot; are going to send in a real person with a real gun to kill real people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never claimed the Pulse nightclub shooter was a crisis actor. You made that assumption on your own. (Still not sure why).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what you&#39;re saying is the CIA built a school, filled it entirely with &quot;crisis actors&quot; waited a few years so no one would question how an entire school suddenly appeared in their town, then sent in a real shooter to kill a bunch of kids... and no one was any the wiser?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe they did build it for that sole purpose? I don&#39;t have all the answers. You&#39;re not understanding me correctly, there would be no need to kill the children. The children are entirely fabricated. Did you personally view every single victim&#39;s dead body or see any victims on the news or in critical condition? Almost EVERY single horrible tragedy has pictures leaked after the fact. Columbine: Pictures were leaked after showing the bodies &amp; the bloody aftermath. Why haven&#39;t any pictures of the Sandy Hooks tragedy leak showing all these dead children &amp; a shot up school? It&#39;s an incredibly fucked up things to say, but SOMEONE would leak them on 4chan or some other method. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you caught them by watching video of the crisis actors talking about their phony kids? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, you didn&#39;t watch the video. It shows a man laughing &amp; joking around until he realizes he&#39;s on live TV. He then starts hyperventilating to make it appear as if he&#39;s worked up &amp; crying. If your child was just murdered, I don&#39;t think you would be joking around. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seriously... I don&#39;t get it. Are the victims real? If not, why has no one ever come forward to expose them? If they are, why hire &quot;crisis actors&quot; at all? They just become potential sources of leaks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying to explain in my posts. Not every single victim is a crisis actor in false flag attacks. They&#39;re mainly used by the media after the attack occurs, they aren&#39;t exposed or leaked for the reasons I went into on the above post. If you&#39;re not even going to both to read it, then I&#39;m done responding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT: Perhaps you should just admit to yourself that the reason you want to believe these attacks are &quot;false flags&quot; is because they are being used to justify gun control, which you oppose. You have no other way to justify your stance other than simply coming out and honestly saying &quot;mass murder is the price we pay for having free and easy access to guns - and I&#39;m OK with that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never once said I was for or against gun control. Great job making that assumption though. I don&#39;t own a firearm, nor do I support conceal &amp; carry or ANY firearm use outside of protecting your home/property. </p>

<p>This is a place to question EVERYTHING, no matter how crazy. If you have the inability to think outside the box &amp; leave your preconceived political prejudices at the door when discussing theories, then this place really isn&#39;t for you.</p>

<p>You&#39;d be surprised. For all you know this guy was a child abuser who did not give one fuck about his child, but knew the public attention demanded a certain kind of behaviour.</p>

<p>And sometimes stress makes people act strangely. What <em>you</em> &quot;expect&quot; is not necessarily how real people behave.</p>

<p>And I pointed out that using &quot;crisis actors&quot; after the fact is fucking stupid. There is no reason to do so (real victims don&#39;t need to act) and it adds a layer of risk that is totally unnecessary - wouldn&#39;t other victims point out that the person on TV was never actually there? Wouldn&#39;t that &quot;crisis actor&quot; now have a chance to make a killing by writing a tell-all book or article?</p>

<p>And for what benefit? To have someone say exactly what a real victim would say anyway?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not agreeing with what you&#39;re saying is not the same thing as not reading what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>But you are against it, aren&#39;t you? It&#39;s obvious... especially when you believe that &quot;crisis actors&quot; are being used to &quot;push the gun control agenda&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a place to question EVERYTHING, no matter how crazy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, and that includes the wild claims of people like you.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t even articulate <strong>why</strong> &quot;they&quot; would risk using fake victims in real cases - you just know they must be because what you&#39;ve seen on the net has you convinced.</p>

<p>So much for questioning everything.</p>

<p>If you lack the ability to think critically, or if you lack the ability to leave your preconceived political prejudices at the door when discussing theories, then this place REALLY isn&#39;t for you.</p>

<p>LOL. That&#39;s rich coming from you. I have picked apart your arguments and exposed their ridiculous nature, so all you have left is to accuse <em>me</em> of lacking the ability to &quot;think critically&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re hilarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>....i&#39;m not implying that every victim of a false flag attack is a crisis actor. Those people who were hurt during the Boston bombing were definitely real people. Crisis actors are mostly needed in situations where the tragedy doesn&#39;t speak for itself because real people were hurt. Boston bombing for example: there was video of the bomb going off in a crowd. People were killed &amp; spoke about their experience, there isn&#39;t really any point in adding crisis actors because the narrative is established - a crazy terrorist set off a bomb in a crowd at the Boston Marathon. But some situations, such as Sandy Hook, would require crisis actors to drive a narrative. Shots fired at a Sandy Hook school, the situation doesn&#39;t speak for itself. The crisis actors are needed to establish details to drive the narrative, since it wasn&#39;t observed or recorded by the general population. &quot;He used a AR15 assault rifle &amp; went on a shooting spree!&quot; - crisis actors drive the narrative to get people to stand behind reforming gun control laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of people without relatives to ask questions; many are tapped from the military where they have their records to know they&#39;re alone. They also take from friends/family of people already in the know, almost like there are communities of people <em>born</em> to do things like this. The same crisis actors can be seen in multiple productions so if they find someone who fits the bill perfectly, they&#39;ll keep them. (Examples: the man who witnessed 9/11 and the LAX shooting, the mom from Pulse  [spoke at DNC] has been in like 4 events and a passanger who saw the Ft Lauderdale shootings also played a baggage handler). Ones that have to stay dead apparently go to live in Tel-Aviv. </p>

<p>And so what if bits and pieces get out? As long as 95% of the masses, whom never bother to research, believe it then they&#39;re fine. Those moon landing were fake as shit and NASA has contradicted themselves many times, 9/11 whistleblowers have come forward (killed after), eye witnesses saw 3 white men instead of 2 Muslims at San Bernardino, a Sandy Hook dad was caught fake crying on the news, people shot in the leg at Pulse were seen walking the same night, etc</p>
