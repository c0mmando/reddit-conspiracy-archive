        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ever since my early days on GLP I believed this stuff, about how America and the west are all evil and we did 9/11 to ourselves and the CIA is mind controlling everyone.</p>

<p>Most of this is said on RT News.</p>

<p>And then a few years ago I read about how in Russia, just about everyone believes that most geopolitical activity is CIA false flags.</p>

<p>I have come to believe the possibility that people who wish to destabilize the USA have seeded these narratives to us in order to make us willfully beg for their destruction. </p>

<p>Everything coming out lately confirms our biases which causes me to question it. </p>

<p>Now of course I&#39;ll be downvoted because most of you are relatively new to conspiracy thinking and believe things like the vault 7 leaks are 100% legit no question - but I think this deserves at least some thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, not gonna downvote you for considering this. </p>

<p>I never saw RT when 9/11 happened. We had professors asking questions, we had students and professionals asking questions. We had a bunch of facts that didn&#39;t add up with the official story. Lots of different speculation. Still see it to some degree. </p>

<p>In order for you to be correct lots of people would need to be Russian sleeper cells. Most of them having been born here. I think this theory of yours starts to break down right about here, where it becomes way more complex and convoluted than any conspiracy theory before.</p>

<p>It would be benificial to an enemy to publicise the truth in that case. Telling the truth is always preferable to lying, especially if you know your gonna lie later. Our media operatrs in the same way as theirs, truth when possible and lies when necessary. Politics is all about image though.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because RT didn&#39;t exist in 2001. It wasn&#39;t even around in 2003 when the US government lied to its own people and the world so that it could commit a war crime on behalf of Dick Cheney&#39;s oil baron buddies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t know that, thanks.</p>

<p>I wanted to be a demolitionist when i was young (fuck ya! Blow shit up for money? Sounds easy and fun), so i knew watching that day that it had to have been taken down from within. Everybody on the streets talking about the explosions before and as the towers came down confirmed it. I was still willing to believe in terrorists but I kept wondering how they set up the bombs. It was when the Omission Report came out that I finally bucked and started looking for others that knew because nobody believed me when I tried to explain how impossible it all was. </p>
