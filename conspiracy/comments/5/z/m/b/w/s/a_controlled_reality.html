       We are ALL in currently inside a MATRIX REALITY. The entire so called "universe" is a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION. The worlds script is written by the ARCHONS and implemented by the SATANIC GLOBAL ELITE.

       it is close to being to late. the "wild card" is that we actually could create universes by "THOUGHT", before we became morons and slaves. it will be incredibly hard, but this ability can be rediscovered. then it  is GOD AS MAN, and for the elite it would be GAME OVER.

       Yeah, I forget what the odds actually are... but there is almost no way that we live in the real world. Nothing to really trip over necessarily, because regardless this is our reality but it would be nice to know that. Do you think that our time line is set? I kinda do. Everything that goes on was planned years ago. One of the best examples of that is 911.

       it is set roughly 90 percent. the ARCHONS tell people beforehand where and with who they will be FORCED to reincarnate with. the MATRIX is very pre programmed. that being said: i think persons with EXPANDED CONSCIOUSNESS can OVERIDE the program.

       i have gone over this numerous times. this planet is a PRISON. entities from the lower astral/hell have set themselves up as GUIDES, ANGELS, LORDS, ASCENDED MASTERS. they tell humans that they owe "Karmic Debt" (which does not exist). humans are told the only way to balance the debt is to REINCARNATE. this happens over and over and never ends. these SATANIC ARCHONS use humans like "cattle" and actually feast upon the negative vibration of Suffering, Pain, Poverty, Hate and Extreme Perversions.

       of course. 1) as the ultimate safety measure you must "cancel soul contracts" on a regular basis:

       They didn't provide sources or even any further elaboration beyond saying we're in a simulation. If they did, I'm not seeing their post, and likely the other poster didn't either. Happy to read sources if I am shown them.

       They did.  I remember at least two links they provided.  In fact, I ended up with a lot of links to research and learn more from everyone.  Part of that thread, I think, moved to another page.  Regardless... calling people crazy is just not nice.

       can you post your mental health credentials? considering you have the incredible ability to diagnose mental illness of people on the internet. you must be a speedreader if you read my enormous post history already. at this point i have more important things to do than spend 20 minutes writing up something for another 3 letter agency clown like you. bye

       The song is about the weak being pushed around by bullies and elite "clowns". I am an extremely one the kind and most caring person. I pick up bugs in my driveway and move them somewhere safe. I walk up to homeless people and actually give them bags of food. That being said: Considering what insane brutality that has done to humanity it is time to be peaceful. But to be "MENTALLY AGGRESSIVE"

       If you start looking at Freemason religious and universe beliefs you'll find mentions of lesser magik.  Google it. You can find the Freemason bible online to read. It's also in crowleys book and lots of videos on YouTube explaining how it works.

       Ok... well... I can't find the first person who suggested this, but I think this as well. If we do live in a simulation, we are likely having things tested on us. That would make the most sense to me.

       You're welcome, there are too many things that don't make sense, if you look. However be very careful in your journey for truth. They have cognitive infiltrators ALL OVER the truth movement. They have disinfo and COINTELPRO everywhere, before you get too far into conspiracies and things look into Cass Sunstein. Also, try not to allow this (being that it's something you cannot physically prove and has no affect on your everyday life) to dissuade you from exposing and researching bigger conspiracies. Find your balance.

       We are soul essence incarnated into human bodies. Our soul consciousness is of a higher level than the physical level that we perceive. This is what we would call the 'Higher Self'. So we are definitely in a 'matrix' as Icke talks about. None of this is real beyond our PERCEPTION. Time is an illusion beyond our memory of it. These are all just aspects of how our brain regulates our experience. Death is nothing but a transition back to our native states of awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also the inner senses that connect us to our true selves. Gregg Braden has done some really interesting research into how the heart, on a cellular level, is much like having another brain in our body. The electrical field around the heart is very intense. Nassim Haramein teaches about the energy fields around our body connecting like a fractal hologram to both micro and macro (cosmic) scales. We can all connect to God/Source/Universe. Even though the matrix is real, we can always connect to the truth beyond the matrix. To be 'in' it without being 'of' it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All living things are all constantly moving upwards in consciousness together, back towards Source/God/Universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is much manipulation on Earth since the fall of Atlantis, especially by reptilians and archons... We are in the process of waking up now to who we truly are. There are also many positive groups here waiting for us to be ready. We have to choose love and integrity over fear and hate. We have to see that everything is connected, and if we want to have a better reality then we must choose to make it happen. The people alive now are living in a legendary time. Everyone alive now chose to be here to experience the liberation of this planet from the dark forces. Victory is Near.

       The main thing wrong with Icke is he sometimes (maybe unintentionally) gives the "fear" energy too much attention, which is especially unhelpful for people just starting these topics. If you start with love/truth, then you have it as your totem so you don't get lost in some rabbit holes.

      <p>
       Sure - lets debate then:
      </p>
      <p>
       The overall theme that I get from David Icke is that the general populous of humankind is largely subdued by a ruling class comprised of persons that have passed/inherited power down through generations via royal bloodlines and inbreeding.  They control the populous through the deprivation of knowledge and history, as well as through problem-reaction-solution (false flags), fear, violence, division, economics and environmental destruction ect.  The ruling class is quite literally insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these above things I actually agree with^ and believe that David is relaying a general truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are a few problems with David Icke - he peppers in a lot of science fiction garbage, such as reptilian beings controlling  the elite people through their chakra (or, quite literally, the elites are reptiles that are only visible in a supra-energy wavelength that is beyond what the human eye can physically observe - also, he roots his reptilian theories in history, which is cool; but he also acknowledges that history has been withheld from us purposely, and much of history as we know it is wrong.. So which is it? - he claims the elites are Satanists who worship the Reptiles/Saturn/this extraterrestrial force - he also talks a lot about how Saturn is broadcasting this reality to us that we are receiving and interpreting, but none of it is real; things along these lines, which are really cool to conceptualize about, and are somewhat rooted in history (the serpent tales in all the ancient religions) - but none of them are verifiable - they never have been and they never will be.  He also doesn't really address history too much and offers no pragmatic explanations for events and why they really occurred and how they are actually linked together (basically, everything to david is one false flag soap opera that is specifically being used to control us).  Also, David pushes the New World Order theme quite hard; most conspiracies these days revolve around the NWO, but I believe that the NWO is a bit of a farse and a distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the biggest problem that I have with David Icke is that his only solution that he offers to his audiences is to 'wake up' - okay.. wake up to what?  This fact that we are all being controlled?  Most people understand that already - but how about an actual tangible / measurable solution that is rooted in science/technology that not only proves that we are being lied to in order to subdue us, but also promises a technological revolution for mankind and quite literally brings us to a new age of human divinity?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, enter the High Level Insider; not only does he offer the first paragraph, but his whole discussion is rooted in a very pragmatic and historical explanation.  Most of his theme is actually rooted in real historical philosophical differences between Plato/Socrates and Aristotle, who viewed the necessary relation between the elites and the general public differently.  The HLI rebukes the New World Order, saying that our image of the NWO is actually the thing that we have right now, The Old World Order (basically, the way it has always been): a ruling class of power basically maintaining control over a populous by force, and all of the reptile and sci/fi theories and aliens and what not are all distractions to keep conspiracy theorists running off in the wrong direction.  Religions as we know them are just memes - our level of consciousness/awareness is infant stage compared to our potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the biggest thing is that the HLI actually does offer solutions.  He explains how life is really just the Law of the Jungle; you have the freedom to do anything you want - if you want to stand up to the 'bigger dog' you can actually do so, by making yourself more dangerous as dead rather than as alive (agency).  He has also outlined for a scientifically sound technical solution that proves that we are being subdued and could solve many of our global issues, such as lack of growth, energy and precious metals/resource acquisition.  You should look at his Space Elevator orbital ring proposal - i think you will find his explanation more meaningful and 'real' than anything that David Icke has offered up.

       I appreciate David, too - he was a huge positive leap for me on this path that I am on - but I can't tell if his a formal disinfo (like a CIA/mi6 type agent) casting a net, or if he is a regular conspiracy theorist who agreed to say some crazy shit so he can stay alive; or if he actually was a normal conspiracy theorist who was on the right path but just lost his marbles somewhere along the way - but at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter because really all that david offers is doom porn, and doesn't really venture to strategize a solution

       Ooooo, you are right!!!!  You put all this together?  I appreciate the work that went into it.  I have to take breaks and then go back to it.  This is amazing!  Information I could have never found on my own AND to such an extent.

       I have never read high level insider. But if NWO was printed on money in 1913, then it's now old. Make America great again? Like when we massacred Indians or protesting mine workers? Or had institutionalized slavery? Or practiced eugenics? Yes, be very afraid of a New World. /s

       Have you ever listened to Adampants? He was a doctor who used to post on Icke forums, talked about how doctors literally have no idea how to help people, so he stopped his practice. Pretty life Illuminating videos:

       Just my opinion, definitely trust yourself and not me or anyone else, but I'm sure you don't need positive groups or anything. You have all the answers in yourself and no one can tell you the truth, because you have to experience it to understand. Having the information isn't knowledge if you don't understand it. Allow yourself to see patterns and the symbols that you have seen all through your life. You will know when you know and you know when other people know. You can feel it lol, as crazy as that sounds. It's like this feeling of inspiration that you will want to share with everyone. You'll start laughing at the things people argue or get upset about. You won't be afraid of anything because you'll know that you are immortal, we all are, but you will also be able to understand and enjoy your time here. We are all part of a whole, but the whole is made better by expressing our individuality in our own way, how we choose, not letting someone else constrain us.

       I'll second what u/islandofdelight says.  I share his/her worldview, which I developed independently by reading a lot of different things over several decades, also meditation.

       You might want to check out r/holofractal if you need to see more "scientific" narrative along the lines of Haramein.  It's helpful if you are full of "doubts" based on a false worldview constructed (likely purposely) by institutional Science, and have the technical chops to wade through the details.  Another venue that is less "heavy" on technical detail is Schopenhauer, maybe start

       If you want to do something active to show the matrix-like attributes of our reality, really do try the

        two glasses exercise

       .  It only takes about an hour (or even less).  Pick some small but discernible shift as the test.  In my experience it can take about 3 to 6 months to fully realize a shift, and it may also be necessary to have some prior experience with meditation or ability to focus attention inward.

       Sounds crazy but not too long ago we didn't kill and eat other living things. We all communicated through telepathy, even with all animals, so empathy was always present. The modern internet is just a corrupted representation of what we all have innately and naturally. The thing that holds us back from returning to this harmony is our inability to forgive those under mind control who did terrible things without realizing it.

       excellent post Exec99. slaughtering and eating our friends in not natural and is the MAJOR REASON WE ARE ENSLAVED. the torture and killing of sentient beings causes MASSIVE NEGATIVE VIBRATIONS. sadly this is happening constantly all over this Prison Planet.

       I totally understand. Trust me, lobster and rare steak were my favorite foods. Once you get a taste of the blood, you want more of it. Starting off you won't eat people, just the "lesser" animals like rabbits and cows and deer that harm nothing and don't cannibalize other species. What

       It's hard to say but I can tell the broad strokes which led me to the views I have now. First though, I am more happy and positive now than at any point in my life, so I certainly wish for everyone to see things like I do because I know how bad it is to feel hopeless, like there is no point, like you're an outsider and everyone else is just dumb or too stupid to see the truth. Being in that place sucks. It's lonely and depressing. But let yourself find its way through you, because I promise you don't need any ruby slippers to get home lol, Dorothy realized the wizard couldn't give her anything because she had it already. The creator made you like your parents made you, with the hope that you will express yourself
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       than them. That ability to choose and determine your path, and explore and understand the world
       <em>
        with no help
       </em>
       is fundamental to you, it can't be taken away, which is why they convince you that you don't have it. So anyway, because of that, don't follow anyone. Especially not me because I was a terrible person and hated everything. But in broad strokes I think it's understanding what empathy is, and being able to relate to someone and understand why they are how they are even if you don't agree with it. Realize that every living thing has the same parent so we are all bros and sis without being corny. The same energy or spirit created us all with the same abilities, fundamentally bonded to each other just like cells in your body make up you. We share the ability to communicate with each other, animals do it every day, and you can share that same understanding with a spider on your wall. This will further show that since we all are a part of a whole, any harm to any other is a harm to us (which is why Socrates said if someone commits evil they harm themselves more than the person they hurt). War is analogous to your cells killing each other, like the liver not realizing it depends on the heart for life also. If an organ is sick you don't try to kill it, you understand it became sick for some reason so you just want to heal it. That's how a creator or a parent sees evil. There is also no contradiction in saying "we are all one" and "you are an individual who is just as important as any other" just like a family can be one, e.g. a family, but also be individuals. In our true state we want to create and give life and we love our creations, like all parents love their children unless they are under hypnosis or brainwashed (in which case you can see why the concept of punishing them is just evil in a different form). Most importantly, it's sort of accurate to say there is really only love or love is all that exist. Oh and spirit or Gods spirit? E=mc2 or everything is energy lol (language is the biggest scam of them all, telepathy is the original communication because it's the most pure expression, words are less accurate representations than pictures, and pictures are less accurate than words, etc which is why hieroglyphs came before words, it just got worse each "advancement"). Ok but the part about all being spirit/energy, all connected in the same fabric that makes us up, you can see that love = truth = the Good = God = life - so if you understand that and remember it then you know the source of all truth. That's a totem. Since you know the source of all truth is love and is life, then you can never be misled again, not in any fundamental way. You will want to share it with everyone, which is how you know CIA agents are more brainwashed than anyone, which lead me to not worrying about encryption or spying anymore because I am happy to share the truth with everyone. I don't expect or want everyone to be like this because our own personal privacy should be under each persons control and not violated for unknown purposes, but I just happen to be in a position where I don't value my personal privacy that much so I see the massive spying as an outlet to redpill the spies lol. Do they gasp when they realize I love them like a brother and would gladly talk to them if they want? If they realize I'm being genuine, that I'm not a threat to them or anyone else, then I converted them lol. Since I believe evil is not a real thing other than the absence of love/life (which means it's death, false, etc) then I can't hate anyone nor want to harm anyone just from logic. A parent doesn't want to harm their child who got led astray or brainwashed. They want them to go on the right path while also allowing them to be free and choose their own path. Sure, if they are actively harming your other child, like their brother, then you will intervene at the bare minimum necessary to stop them, but you would try to educate them why it's not just wrong to hurt their brother but it's not even in their best interest to hurt their brother. Likewise, you would not judge or shame someone who does evil while under mind control. You would not tell them they have karma to pay or sins to atone for. That's like telling a lion it should be ashamed for eating a bird. When it realizes the truth and breaks the spell, it will stop on its own, I promise. No need to shame it and make it feel bad or lesser because someone exploited it. And the biggest Truth bomb of them all: reincarnation is a scam haha. Fuck that. If someone says you need to reincarnate, remind them about mind control and massive weaponized hypnosis.

       Yes! These posts are my favourite kinds on r/conspiracy. I'm relatively new to reddit too. Well, I've been lurking for maybe a year now but I only made an account recently. I love how much I've learned from this sub alone! I hope to see more posts like this pop up again soon.

       The main thing wrong with Icke is he sometimes (maybe unintentionally) gives the "fear" energy too much attention, which is especially unhelpful for people just starting these topics. If you start with love/truth, then you have it as your totem so you don't get lost in some rabbit holes.

      <p>
       Sure - lets debate then:
      </p>
      <p>
       The overall theme that I get from David Icke is that the general populous of humankind is largely subdued by a ruling class comprised of persons that have passed/inherited power down through generations via royal bloodlines and inbreeding.  They control the populous through the deprivation of knowledge and history, as well as through problem-reaction-solution (false flags), fear, violence, division, economics and environmental destruction ect.  The ruling class is quite literally insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these above things I actually agree with^ and believe that David is relaying a general truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are a few problems with David Icke - he peppers in a lot of science fiction garbage, such as reptilian beings controlling  the elite people through their chakra (or, quite literally, the elites are reptiles that are only visible in a supra-energy wavelength that is beyond what the human eye can physically observe - also, he roots his reptilian theories in history, which is cool; but he also acknowledges that history has been withheld from us purposely, and much of history as we know it is wrong.. So which is it? - he claims the elites are Satanists who worship the Reptiles/Saturn/this extraterrestrial force - he also talks a lot about how Saturn is broadcasting this reality to us that we are receiving and interpreting, but none of it is real; things along these lines, which are really cool to conceptualize about, and are somewhat rooted in history (the serpent tales in all the ancient religions) - but none of them are verifiable - they never have been and they never will be.  He also doesn't really address history too much and offers no pragmatic explanations for events and why they really occurred and how they are actually linked together (basically, everything to david is one false flag soap opera that is specifically being used to control us).  Also, David pushes the New World Order theme quite hard; most conspiracies these days revolve around the NWO, but I believe that the NWO is a bit of a farse and a distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the biggest problem that I have with David Icke is that his only solution that he offers to his audiences is to 'wake up' - okay.. wake up to what?  This fact that we are all being controlled?  Most people understand that already - but how about an actual tangible / measurable solution that is rooted in science/technology that not only proves that we are being lied to in order to subdue us, but also promises a technological revolution for mankind and quite literally brings us to a new age of human divinity?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, enter the High Level Insider; not only does he offer the first paragraph, but his whole discussion is rooted in a very pragmatic and historical explanation.  Most of his theme is actually rooted in real historical philosophical differences between Plato/Socrates and Aristotle, who viewed the necessary relation between the elites and the general public differently.  The HLI rebukes the New World Order, saying that our image of the NWO is actually the thing that we have right now, The Old World Order (basically, the way it has always been): a ruling class of power basically maintaining control over a populous by force, and all of the reptile and sci/fi theories and aliens and what not are all distractions to keep conspiracy theorists running off in the wrong direction.  Religions as we know them are just memes - our level of consciousness/awareness is infant stage compared to our potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the biggest thing is that the HLI actually does offer solutions.  He explains how life is really just the Law of the Jungle; you have the freedom to do anything you want - if you want to stand up to the 'bigger dog' you can actually do so, by making yourself more dangerous as dead rather than as alive (agency).  He has also outlined for a scientifically sound technical solution that proves that we are being subdued and could solve many of our global issues, such as lack of growth, energy and precious metals/resource acquisition.  You should look at his Space Elevator orbital ring proposal - i think you will find his explanation more meaningful and 'real' than anything that David Icke has offered up.
