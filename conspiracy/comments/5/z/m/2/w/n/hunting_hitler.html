<p>TV shows are all well and good but they hardly are known for accuracy and so forth.</p>

<p>Is it really probable Hitler survived and escaped?  The show gives the obligatory &quot;the soviets botched the autopsy&quot; and says the DNA that was supposedly Hitler was actually from a female.</p>

<p>I definitely see it as possible that he got on a U-boat and went to Argentina and later Chile.</p>

<p>The one thing the show does make really obvious is that South America had and has a lot of German pocket communities and that there are tunnels galore associated with Nazis.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just trying to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>One hypothesis I have is that this &quot;fourth reich&quot; was at least useful to American covert ops against communism and thus they never did a crack down.  The only real hunting of nazis that brought big name results was by Mossad.</p>

<p>Thoughts?  Insights?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, the book claims that Hitler flew from Berlin and made a stopover in Magdeburg. But by that time Magdeburg and all of Lower Saxony were in Allied hands. There was no safe place anywhere near there for a plane carrying Adolf Hitler to land. </p>

<p>Second, it claims that Hitler left Europe for South America aboard the U-518. The author acknowledges that the U-boat was attacked, but claims it was never positively ID&#39;d and that while it was depth-charged, no wreckage was recovered. US Navy archives report an engagement between U-518 and the destroyer escorts USS Carter and USS Neal A. Scott. The U-boat was positively identified when her captain radioed a weather report to Berlin. The escorts attacked U-518 not with depth charges, but with hedgehogs. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with WW II antisubmarine munitions, but a hedgehog is a very different weapon than a depth charge. It uses a contact detonator instead a depth activated detonator. It doesn&#39;t explode unless it hits something. The report of the engagement states that there were several smaller underwater explosions followed by one very big one. This did bring wreckage to the surface which also aided in identifying the vessel. </p>

<p>Last, the book alleges that Hitler was cared for until his death by a Heinrich Bethe, who was a former crewman of the Admiral Graf Spee interned in Argentina after it was scuttled. German Kriegsmarine archives indicate that Bethe actually escaped from internment and managed to return to Germany. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship Bismarck and was one of the casualties when it sank. Bethe couldn&#39;t care for Hitler or anyone after the war because he was dead.</p>

<p>Hitler killed himself by crunching a cyanide pill while simultaneously blowing his brains out with a pistol - an English female friend of his had botched a suicide many years earlier, which probably played onto his mind.             </p>

<p>On his orders his body was burned - the burned body was soon torn up somewhat by random Soviet shells, like the rest of Berlin was.                  </p>

<p>The &quot;Hitler is alive&quot; garbage was Soviet psyops designed to cast aspersions on the West - they had his jaw and dental records and knew he was dead.             </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could see Stalin doing that type of Psyop... I mean there were some 5000 declassified FBI documents, and I mean the bureau is pretty good so maybe they figured it was Soviet counterintelligence and just went through basic motions.</p>

<p>I mean, Hitler&#39;s secretary seemed credible.  Getting out of Berlin at that point would have been very difficult.  </p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s why they only ever captured Eichmann, who I don&#39;t believe was in Berlin at the time... and Himmler who also wasn&#39;t in Berlin.  They seem convinced that Bormann&#39;s remains were in Berlin though he&#39;s another spotted in South America.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Probably died on the voyage or soon after.</p>

<p>What I find most interesting about that show is that the FBI documents they&#39;re using all reflect a decision in 1960 to shut down the case. What did the FBI learn that year which convinced them that Hitler was dead?</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that Martin Bormann survived, and either ran the Nazi operation there directly or from behind the cover of a Hitler body double.</p>

<p>I recently learned that there were also significant Japanese populations in South America, in particular along Brazil&#39;s southern border, which from the show appears to have been a hotbed of Nazi activity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The drug trade is a great way to fund an army and paramilitary black ops as the CIA well knows.  Those areas of South America have the cocaine manufacturing big time.  If two groups were chosen to run things efficiently, it would be the Japanese and Germans.  The US never attacked foreign elements that were &quot;useful&quot; and we know Suddam and Osama were both, for a long time, CIA trained and funded doing US foreign policy against soviets.  The US never wants communist governments in this hemisphere, which is evident from all the coup d&#39;états in SA.  Who hates a commie more than an American?  The Nazis of course!</p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest starting with #8.</p>

<p>The evidence is compelling.  I suspect Levenda belongs to a certain shadow intelligence operation himself.  His background is riddled with CIA &amp; FBI connections.  His facts are flawless about Nazis &amp; Indonesia &amp; he even has &quot;new&quot; JFK assassination facts.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s what he omits that is troubling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He died in Berlin. Hitler&#39;s dentist was captured after the war by the Americans. Two of his dental techs were captured by the Russians. Each independently reconstructed the details of Hitler&#39;s dental work from memory. Their reconstructions meshed completely, and they fit with the details of the dental work on the jaw fragments attributed to Hitler AND to the skull X-rays taken of him by his doctor after the July 20 bomb attempt. Bottom line, there is solid forensic proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Hitler died in Berlin.
