<p>Where it gets really interesting is reading further into this lawsuit-</p>

<p>&quot;Berg filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court and also sought an injunction to suspend the election. The injunction was denied by Justice David Souter on November 3, 2008. Berg also sought an application for injunction pending the disposition of the petition for writ of certiorari; Justice Souter denied it, Berg refiled and submitted it to Justice Anthony Kennedy (who denied it), then refiled and submitted it to Justice Antonin Scalia, who referred it to the Court. On January 12, 2009, the Supreme Court denied Berg&#39;s petition for writ of certiorari (555 U.S. 1126),[17] and on January 21 the Court denied the application for injunction (555 U.S. 1134).&quot;</p>

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia was the ONLY Supreme Court Justice who referred this to the court, where it was ultimately (of course) denied.</p>

<p>What.</p>

<p>By the way, the attorney who originally filed this suit also previously filed a brought a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) lawsuit charging president George W. Bush and 154 others with complicity in the September 11 attacks.</p>

<p>His career was soon after completely destroyed. Once a prominent American attorney, Berg later took a job as a driver for Uber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a sinking feeling that the only way we are going to ever see justice for the US royalty class is at the end of a rope. And I don&#39;t think we are especially far away from that scenario. I expect we are going to see them sacrifice some pieces before too long. Not the main pieces, but some of the 3rd tier ones like Soros are going to have to be thrown to the circus to quell the overwhelming sentiment of injustice.</p>

Yes, I agree that they will throw their 3rd tier under the bus faster than we can wink when they get good and cornered...but the rot must be removed from the very source.

    <div class="md"><p>People are conditioned to ignore things that might be dangerous to them. What we have is the bystander effect on a national scale. My wife is an interesting example. She is very traumatized and has severe PTSD. Not snowflake PTSD, the real kind. She saw a murder and was taken hostage by the murderers for 2 weeks while they talked about how they were going to kill and eat her.</p>

<p>So, I can&#39;t really talk about a lot of the stuff around here with her. Because she knows how dark and dangerous the world is. I bring up pizzagate and she has no barrier to belief and wants to go hunt pedos without a second thought. Regular people can&#39;t fathom the depths of depravity that exist in the world. It is outside of their frame of reference. They simply can&#39;t believe that people do these awful things to each other, so they just ignore their existence, and fight to maintain their ignorance, because to accept the possibility of horror makes the world incomprehensible to them. It is a huge problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! Thank you for sharing your experience.  I honestly was one of the ones that ignored all these faint callings of different conspiracy theories until right before the election.  I looked into what everyone was saying about the Clinton corruption...what I found staggered my mind.  I then looked into pg...due to its connection with the Clintons.  Shocked my mind.  Then I looked into the possibility of most of our politicians being blackmailed...by our own government and a few foreign actors... then I looked into the major false flags that shaped our foreign policy for the last 2 decades...and I came out fully sad and depressed.  it took about a week then I got mad....really mad.  Then I have been on a researching tear...trying to learn more about why I was so naïve to all of this my entire life.  I want to learn more and I want the world to finally wake up...like I am starting too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are also conditioned to think people that question the narrative are literally insane. Even a lot of people who think the MSM is full of shit, they aren&#39;t talking about <em>all</em> of it, they all have &quot;thier guy&quot; that they believe. And they think they are special for being able to discern that this one talking head is the one with the real information. And everyone else that thinks differently is an idiot. </p>

<p>It is kinda like the problem with Congress. Everyone believes Congress is a bag of shit, and yet they keep voting in the same people over and over. It is because it is all the other ones that are bad. &quot;Their guy&quot; is the good one. This is just another form of tribalism, like football teams. No one selects candidates based on merit. They select based on feelings and malformed intuition. </p>

<p>So don&#39;t feel bad, the conditioning is extremely well made. Also, don&#39;t go off the deep and and let your anger consume you. I kinda believe everything, and don&#39;t really believe anything. Try to stay objective in how you approach these issues or you <em>will</em> go crazy haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First let me say I admire your courage. It takes courage to open your eyes and seek truth.  The truth hurts realizing the evil all around us and that shifting ground feeling realizing reality as we knew it was a lie.</p>

<p>Most people either take the blue pill or wish they could get back to the fantasy when confronted.</p>

<p>For your ongoing journey I recommend a book that will reset your framework based on public school history indoctrination.  It will be rough but it gave me solid footing once I got my mind around it and for the first time in my life I realized why things never made sense to me.  Why mu questions in school could so rarely be answered with more than &quot;just because they say so&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She is blessed to have you. My father didn&#39;t have half the patience he needed to deal with my mom&#39;s trauma and well she does tend ro wallow in it for attention its a Borderline Personality Disorder trait and one she seems to not even realize.</p>

<p>I myself suffered sexual abuse as a child but it wasn&#39;t as ongoing as hers nor the same trauma as your brave wife deals with daily.  I do wonder, and I never thought about it much until you shared your wife&#39;s story but maybe I&#39;ve been open ro alternative thinking since my reality got shattered.  More open than most people.</p>

<p>I am also like her to an extent I have a gun and training and wanting more training because I will go deadly defensive than let it happen again or to my child or anyone&#39;s child.  But I do know even if I believe Epstein is totally guilty it&#39;s not for me to end him personally but to demand a public trial after a real investigation.  Sadly as Ben Swann got gagged just for pointing out the lack of an investigation I am doubtful we ever will see one.  The FBI director lies to Congress constantly and obviously cannot be trusted.  And it is unlikely Trump would further risk his precarious footing to go after the rot endemic to politics.  They would murder him first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife would have been much like your mother probably, if not for addiction. 12 step programs are not popular on here, and they aren&#39;t the only way to a happy life, but if you drink all the koolaid they can be transformative imho. We were both changed by the process. Not everyone gets a chance to clean house like that. </p>

<p>The child rape is the worst part. And that was unfortunately very much a part of my wife&#39;s story too. I joke around on here that rope is the only 100% solution, and there is certainly some truth to my feelings in there, but I would rather see them on public trial first. Although I remember how obsessed my mother was with the dog and pony show that was the OJ trial, and I don&#39;t think that would be healthy for everyone to do with the pedophiles. </p>

<p>I hope Trump does something with them. He has certainly been aware of the problem for a long time. A lot of people on here think he was part of the problem, I&#39;m not so sure. Ironically, I read this crazy long hit piece on him the other day that was designed to convince me of exactly that. But it had the exact opposite effect. That deserves it&#39;s own post. If I&#39;m right he may actually be extremely interested in revenge on those people. Not for the right reasons, but I don&#39;t really care if it&#39;s for the worst reasons.</p>

<p>I hope you and your mother find peace. And definitely learn to fight, my wife fought her whole life. She was ultra violent. But she wasn&#39;t trained. And I think it would have gone better if she was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though Obama&#39;s mother was a citizen, the bigger issue is that the laws at that time PREVENTED teenage parents from transferring citizenship to their child:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. law at that time did not grant automatic citizenship to children born abroad to married couples if one parent was a foreigner, and the other was under the age of nineteen, as Ann Dunham was. Under this scenario, any record for Obama that Hawaii may have on file indicating Hawaiian birth would have to contain either erroneous or falsified information.&lt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rules changed again for people born between December 23, 1952, and November 13, 1986.(BHO was born in 1961...so this would pertain to him) When one parent was a U.S. citizen and the other a foreign national, the U.S. citizen parent must have resided in the U.S. for a total of 10 years prior to the birth of the child, with five of the years after the age of 14. (Ann Dunham was only 18...so she was~according to the law in effect at the time~UNABLE to confer US citizenship to BHO,Jr) Children born out of wedlock to a U.S. citizen mother were U.S. citizens if the mother was a resident in the U.S. for a period of one year prior to the birth of the child. Children born out of wedlock to a U.S. citizen father acquired U.S. citizenship only if legitimated before turning 21. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to go back in time with information that could change the course of history... Maybe if a person had enough information and enough status, enough personal clout to make noise... Maybe just maybe a person like that could be heard. Then you read a story like this that shows there are levels of power and any attorney acting alone won&#39;t be enough to seriously challenge TPTB.</p>

<p>The only &#39;bright side&#39; of this is that this attorney was already ~70 years old when he lost his law license, so his career was probably near an end anyway. That&#39;s probably why he felt he had the freedom to challenge these things in a way that some young attorney with a bunch of law school debt and kids to feed would not be able to do. The stuff about him driving for Uber is just a character attack. He probably didn&#39;t need the money, lots of retirees take up odd jobs just to stay busy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a sinking feeling that the only way we are going to ever see justice for the US royalty class is at the end of a rope. And I don&#39;t think we are especially far away from that scenario. I expect we are going to see them sacrifice some pieces before too long. Not the main pieces, but some of the 3rd tier ones like Soros are going to have to be thrown to the circus to quell the overwhelming sentiment of injustice.</p>
