       It started today at around 7 AM: I was watching some WW2 videos the night before and when I popped on YouTube a recommended video was "Adolph Hitler, the Greatest story never told. I'm like sweet probably something about his personal life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I go on full screen and notice it's a 6 hour long video. I did not have an actual clock present since I was on full screen so I just said I'll set back and watch it for about 25 minutes and then head to class at 8.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just finished at 1:20 and I was firstly completely shocked at the time because I missed a full day at school, but secondly I was just flabbergasted that I might've been lied to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this documentary actually hold any credit!? I am so curious about it. What's other people's take on it? IS it half or fully true?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I need answers and I need them now.

       Paperclip was the big one that leads to the rest. The Soviets started taking Nazi scientists to Russia and we started doing the same in fear. NASA was headed by a Nazi rocket scientist and from that op, everything else was on.

       Someone's Insta disliking my comments, strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know about all except counttelpeo. However you missed blue beam. I think the greatest story never told is the biggest one because it is so largely regulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think from this frame. You could say you believe something like project blue beam (a fairly outlandish  conspiracy) at a dinner table or at a workplace lunch. You bring up the conspiracy theory and you deliver facts. At the worse someone would say you believe conspiracy theories, however if you deliver facts you'll even intrigue some people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at the same setting and say you think Hitler wasn't bad. You'd probably get fired, exiled, destroyed, cut out from academia, alienated form society, and worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why this is a more intense, and potentially one of the largest conspiracy theories out there.

       You understand very well. Great example, it's about what subjects we're not allowed to stray away from, and to what extent. You'll catch flak on a lot, but the truth about Adolf Hitler is on top. They really don't want you to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       My recommendations to you are these:
* Stay away from David Irving, Mark Weber, and David Cole.
* Avoid people talking
       <em>
        about
       </em>
       Hitler. Albert Speer, for example, obviously made a deal.
* Go to
       <a href="https://forum.codoh.com/">
        Codoh
       </a>
       if you have questions about specific holocaust topics.
* Read speeches from Hitler and other NS leaders.
* Read Mein Kampf.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you'll appreciate Mein Kampf, it's the best way to understand him. Maybe you're not receptive today, it happens to many. If you can't read it now, just wait some time (or try an audio-book). It should not be a bore. Begin with the first four chapters, skip number one if it's not interesting.

       I have never seen any evidence of that, and it's not very common. David Irving said we can't be sure what parts of it is genuine or not, but his words don't have credibility in my ears.

       Do you know where you've heard this? I would really like to know more about it. I believe it's in the same line as the lies about Hitler being a

       Flat earth is stupid as shit. I worked with GPS systems before I changed my major and you could find the curvature of the earth with very simple math. I honestly think it's disinfo to dumb down the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've been on a plan at around 40000 feet you could see slight curvature of the earth.

       oh really can you? lmfao! I know for a fact you cannot. if you could see it from 40000 feet you could see it at the beach or in a large bay or lake. I live near a body of water where I can see over 25 miles of flat water. explain that one. you are wrong.. unless your answer is the earth is flat.

       explain a wet tennis ball that you throw. What happens? now think about a globe.

       I personally believe flat earth is a psyop of some sort with what's likely some contingent of useful idiots. The problem, however, with banning discussion of FE on this sub is that it puts moderators in the position of adjudicating content, not behavior. If we banned FE on the basis that it's a load of horseshit, we'd have tons of people arguing that we should also ban discussion of &lt;theories XYZ&gt; because they're also horseshit. As a user and now a mod that's a power I don't think mods should have. What if we decided your favorite theory should be banned for "discrediting the sub?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we have a duty as mods to moderate behavior but not content. Shill accusations, while perhaps correct, have a tendency of devolving discussions and starting witch hunts, and I can't let that stand. Argue against the
       <em>
        idea
       </em>
       all you want, and you'll likely get support from me and others, but when you argue against the person, it hurts the sub as well.

       A wet tennis ball does not contain enough mass at its core. How do you explain rings on planets? Or if you zoom ultra wide into a moon it moving? Or the shadows you can see on planets whilst looking through a telescope?

       use any kind of ball you want get a bowling bowl for all  I care. any ball will not hold water on it's surface. You need to go to school. Learn about the properties of water. We all should know this stuff. Basic. I go on planes all the time. Just flew back from hawaii to california. Flat as a pancake all the way.

       well water finds it's level hence the term water level. the phrase horizon comes from how the horizon is horizontal. these are anecdotal but hold truth. 
Why doesn't a airplane have trouble landing on a earth that is moving at 1000mph in one direction and lots of other speeds in other directions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Throw a wet tennis ball.. what happens?  water flys off it. people laugh at flat earth and say... " why dont we fall off the edge?"
really though that question makes more sense to ask to the globe heads.. seeing as we can't demonstrate water sticking to any sort of sphere. please prove me wrong. send me your experiment with water sticking to a globe i'd love to see it.

       The real red fucking pill of that movie was that Agent Smith was the one. And while the first one was good, the trilogy as a whole was about as much of a national treasure as well...National Treasure.

       oh really can you? lmfao! I know for a fact you cannot. if you could see it from 40000 feet you could see it at the beach or in a large bay or lake. I live near a body of water where I can see over 25 miles of flat water. explain that one. you are wrong.. unless your answer is the earth is flat.
